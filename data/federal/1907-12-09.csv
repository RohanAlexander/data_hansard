Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER took the chair-at 11 a.m., and read prayers. TEMPORA RY EMPLOYES : mas? HOLIDAYS  master-General, without notice, a question in which the employees in his Department, particularly the temporary employees throughout.the Commonwealth, are interested.' It appears that the' officers can get no clear information-the matter is clouded in mystery-and to them the rulings of the Minister are as clear as mud. I desire to know to what holidays temporary employees are entitled, and whether they are paid for them; and if they are not paid for. holidays, will the' Minister see that they are allowed to work on all holidays except Christmas Day and Good Friday ? Mr Mauger.:-If the honourable member will give notice of the question, I shallgive him full particulars tomorrow morning. I - think ' I am correct in saying that all temporary hands are paid for their proclaimed holidays in exactly the same way as are regular employees. TELEPHONE SERVICE, NEWCASTLE.",14
1,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General, without notice, whether the Chief Electrician will visit Newcastle before Christmas, in view of the chaotic state of the telephone service there?",14
2,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"After consultation with .the honourable member: I made an arrangement with the Chief Electrician, who is now on his way to Newcastle. ORDER OF BUSINESS. , Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I desire to know whether the Prime Minister sees his way to put a period to our sittings before Christmas-whethe r the huge programme .of proposed legislation which appears in the Melbourne Age of this morning has any likelihood of being attempted before then ? If that programme be entered upon, I should say we are likely to be here all next year.",14
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"L i k e the honourable member, I made - myself acquainted with that programme of business for the first time this morning, and only hope it can be carried out.",14
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not think that is quite an answer to my question. Is the Prime Minister able to say whether we are likely to get away before Christ,14
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I see.no reason why the House should, meet after this week.",14
6,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,When is it likely that the Estimates will be discussed?,14
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Not before Christmas.,14
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should like to know what business 'the Prime Minister proposes to. take this week ?,14
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Necessarily , we must finish the consideration of the Tariff, and I should be very glad if the Excise Procedure Bill could be disposed.of, because then our legal procedure would be simplified.",14
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That Bill will lead .to a long debate.,14
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think not,, seeing that it has already been explained. '",14
12,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"The Bill necessarily raises the whole question, although it has been explained.",14
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It ' may not be necessary to raise the whole question.,14
14,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,The Bill necessarily does so.,14
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"W it h - all submission, I think not. I am well aware, generally, of the objections that may be taken to the Bill ; but when those objections have been recorded here, we might well come to a decision. After all, the final word does not rest with us. We - are acting under the advice of our laAy officers; and, under the circumstances, there would seem to be no other course than to pass the Bill . Those who object to it , or fake a different view of the legal questions involved, may protect themselves by taking their objections ; and it is not unreasonable to say that this ought to suffice-.",14
16,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"It is not merely a legal question; it is a question of policy, and of the amendment of the original Act.",15
17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes , of course, it is desirable that both should be fully considered. The Manufactures Encouragement Bill ought to be disposed of in Committee before we rise.",15
18,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,What about the Federal Capital?,15
19,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have already answered that question. Unless there is some objection to the amendments in the Quarantine Bill, it would be a great administrative gain if it were passed before Christmas.",15
20,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,No hope !,15
21,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,What about the Patent Medicines Bill ?,15
22,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It is a useful measure.,15
23,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Why not go on with it?,15
24,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That Bill requires the assent of both Houses, whereas I am now speaking of a Bill which has passed both Houses, and in which only verbal amendments have to be considered - ' I do not see upon the paper any other measure that needs mention. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - Why not pick out those Bills which have a chance of passing?",15
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I think there is a' chance of passing those named. INVOICE VALUE OF PIANOS.,15
26,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"But for the fact we are likely to reach the item of pianos today I should have given notice of the following question, seeing that it is rather a long one. The question is as followsis the Minister aware of the following facts, and, if not, will he cause inquiry to be made into them and communicate the result to the House before a vote is taken on the duties to be placed on pianos1. That the Customs returns for the several States show no appreciable decline in the average invoice value of German pianos imported, except in New South Wales? 2. That the decline as shown for New South' Wales amounts to about £ y per piano, i.e., from £ 2 3 in 1901, to a little more than j£x6 in 1906, and is accompanied by an exceptional increase in the number of pianos alleged to have been imported ? 3. That on these facts being pointed out to the Acting Comptroller-General, this officer unhesitatingly expressed the opinion that a blunder had been made, and . that the return for New South Wales was erroneous.",15
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I think the' information for which the honourable member is asking, might very well be ascertained on the item in Committee of Ways and Means. It is anticipated that that item will be reached today, and the question can be discussed then.",15
28,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I think the information is necessary to enable us to discuss the item. . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - So far as the honourable member has read- I do not know what is to follow-h e appears to be going beyond the ordinary form of a question.,15
29,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I had not quite finished. It will be seen that I am referring to erroneous statistics that have been furnished, and which ought to be corrected before we go into Committee on the item. My question proceeds4. That on investigation this was confirmee!, and that the Customs Department has now ascertained that no decline has taken place in the average invoice value of pianos imported in New South Wales, and consequently that no decline has taken place in the average value of pianos imported .into the Commonwealth as a whole ",15
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must see that he is going beyond the ordinary form of a question.,15
31,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Ver y well;, I shall deal with the question on the ' item "" in Committee of Ways and Means.",15
32,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Coolgardie asked a question in reference 'to this matter some four or five days ago. and this morning I forwarded him a reply to the effect that a mistake had been made-as stated by the Acting Comptroller-General of Customsin that only an estimate had been given of the number of pianos imported into New South Wales, instead of the actual number. I have requested the officials in Sydney to furnish me with the most definite particulars'that it is possible to obtain, and immediately I receive these, I will supply the information to honourable members. But, undoubtedly a mistake has been made, so that honourable members need not base their remarks in reference to the duty upon pianos upon the figures which have been supplied. PUBLIC SERVANTS: INCREMENTS.  Prime Minister whether the statement appears in the newspapers of today that arrangements have been made to pay the the automatic increments due to public servants before Christmas, is correct?",15
33,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As promised several given days ago, I have had a consultation with main the Treasurer, and he now informs me that he intends to make arrangements for the payment of the increments referred to before Christmas. EXCISE TARIFF (AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY) ACT. Mr KING O'MALLEY asked the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. What is the policy of the Government, and what is the intention of the Ministry as to the manufacturers of harvesters who have failed to observe the Commonwealth law as to Excise, and who are defying the same while receiving the benefit of the Customs duties on agricultural machinery imported? 1 : Does the Minister intend to enforce the law without fear or favour? 3. Will the Government consider the advisability of immediately introducing legislation in order to suspend the imposition of duties so long as the manufacturers of harvesters defy the law ? 4. What does the Government propose to do as regards the employees who have been spending their money in upholding the Commonwealth legislation ? 5. Does the Government intend to allow the men to lose this money ? 6. What are the intentions of the Government as to reimbursing the employees in the agricultural implement trade, who have incurred heavv expenses in defending Commonwealth legislation ? 7. What steps are the Government taking to see that the law is being carried out?",16
34,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. The policy of the Government will be the subject oif a memorandum to be laid on the table immediately. Ministers are not yet aware of any defiance of the law. 2. Yes. 3. Should manufacturers defy the law, and the present remedies be found insufficient, the Government will consider legislation to amend the defects. 4. 5, and 6. The Government cannot undercake to reimburse litigants on the ground that they are suing under Commonwealth legislation. 7. The collectors have general instructions, and the necessary papers are in the hands of the Crown Solicitor. There will be no delay in enforcing the law. POSTAL OFFICIALS : OVERTIME.",16
35,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"the Postmasterwhich General, upon noticeIs it a fact that, although instructions from Central Office have been issued for arrangements to be made to avoid the necessity for officers working after the official hour, some of the heads of branches in Sydney have since specific instructions for ' all hands to reon duty each day from Monday to Friday until 5.30 p.m.?",16
36,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o w sThe instructions from the Central Office referred to were that officers of Clerical Branches whose ordinary hours were from 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. were not to be required to attend on any day later than 5.30 p.m., Monday to Friday, or 1 p.m. on Saturday, except in cases of extreme urgency, and with the express' approval of the Deputy Postmaster-General. The authority for detaining officers until s-3° p.m. is contained in the Public Service Regulations. Only time worked after 5.30 p.m.. is regarded as ""overtime"" under those Regulations. TARIFF. In Committee of Ways and Means (Consideration resumed from 6th December, vfde page 7168): Division XIII - Pape r and Stationery. Item 352. Paper, viz. :(A) Manufactures of, Framed or Unframed, having advertisements thereon, including price lists and trade catalogues, and all printed or lithographed matter to be used for purposes of advertising, per lb., 6d. Sir WILLIAM LYNE *(Hume-Trea surer) [ n . 15] - I move That the following words be ' added :-""and on and after 9th December, 1907, A. Manufactures of, Framed (including the weight of the frame), or Unframed, having advertisements thereon, including price lists n.e.i., trade catalogues n.e.i., show cards n.e.i., and all printed or lithographed matter, pictures n.e.i., and posters of all kinds used or intended to be used for advertising purposes, also all printed bags and cartons, per lb., 6d."" This new proposal is the result of a Conference between the Comptroller-General and a number of persons interested in these particular manufactures.",16
37,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [11.16] - Will the Treasurer state whether the new proposal is intended to apply to imports by vessels, or to imports by post? Is he going to inconvenience those who may forward price lists and trade catalogues from other parts of the world to Australia by charging duties upon these articles when they come through the post ?",16
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Boo k for instance ?,17
39,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Yes . It seems very extraordinary to charge such high duty as 6d. per lb. .upon the frames. In another portion of the Tariff, frames are dutiable at a different rate- I think, at 30 per cent., under the general Tariff, and at 25 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Yet here it posed to charge 6d. per lb. upon them.",17
40,Mr STORRER,Unknown,The frames can be in Australia.,17
41,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The they will not be imported. But of course exporters, be they there may be special reasons for occasionporters or ally importing them.",17
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Hume-Trea surer) [11.19] - The new proposal which I have submitted has been very carefully drafted,17
43,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Why levy a duty upon frames by weight, seeing that they are already subject to a different in another portion of the Tariff ?",17
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Thes e frames differ somewhat from those to which the in free. honourable member refers.,17
45,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Why charge two different rates upon frames?,17
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The new posal is the result of a meeting of those interested in these manufactures, and it is one with which they are all satisfied.",17
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,A whom ?,17
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Of the imdeal porters. During the last two or three days promiscuously. they saw the Comptroller-General in reference to this matter, which I admit is intricate. I instructed the officers to very careful, and to frame the item in way which would be least objectionable.",17
49,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,What circulars coming by pest?,17
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It will depend a good deal on what they are.,17
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"What about book lists, which weigh half-an-ounce?",17
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Boo k logues will, I think, be free.",17
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Unde r what item will they be free?,17
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Unde r a later item, in respect of which I intend to move an amendment. The present item deals with only the catalogues to which I have referred, but under item 36U, ""books n.e.i."" and ""prospectuses and catalogues other than trade n.e.i.,"" are'free. catalogues Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That deals with other than trade catalogues ?",17
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I shall deal a with that matter when we come to the item. The main principle underlying the present item is that persons who have a place of business in Australia shall receive greater consideration than those who have no place of business here. It is intended is proto prevent the widespread distribution of publications which have no reference to made persons engaged in business here.,17
56,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North n Sydney) [11.22] - The catalogues of our colonial wine exothers, have free entry to foreign countries through the post. But now it is proposed to withhold from persons in other countries the privilege of sending through the post a circular or catalogue to persons within Australia. Is it intended to stop the circulars and catalogues as they arrive in the mails and imrate pose a duty or to communicate with the senders ?",17
57,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,No ; they will come,17
58,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,But this item includes trade catalogues.,17
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Trad e catalogues proare not included in item 368.,17
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Where a legitimate business is carried on here, it is intended that the catalogues shall come in free, or, meeting of at any rate, at a very low duty. The item before the Committee is intended to with other things ""which come in",17
61,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The re are two aspects of this question. First, is beit intended to compel those who are located a in Australia, and do business here, to get their printing done locally? about Sir WILLIAM LYNE - To a large extent",17
62,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,Unknown,"The other consideration is, is it intended to compel persons who are carrying on business outside Australia to get their printing done here? cata- Sir WILLIAM LYNE - No . (Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Then the Tariff should not provide for the exclusion of their trade catalogues.  ing a duty upon them ?",17
63,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am against the proposal, but now I am trying to elicit what the Ministry desire. We are not treated in that way by European loountries. Australian - catalogues are allowed to go through the post, and to be delivered. Is it intendedhere to stop the 'delivery of catalogues or trade jprice lists when posted from other countries to persons in Australia? I hope that the Treasurer does not intend to do that. It would be very unfair in view of the fact that the catalogues and price lists of our business men receive such different treatment from other countries.  sore straits for revenue when it proposes to collect a duty of that kind. It is reallyhampering trade.",17
64,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Apar t from the propriety of the proposal, I think that the duty proposed is excessively high. It ought not to apply to price lists and trade catalogues sent here by outside persons who, of course, could not get their printing done here. Such persons should not be treated, even from the Minister's stand-ipoint in the same way as persons who are carrying on business within our territory ",18
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Hume-Trea surer) [11.27] - Does the honourable member for North Sydney approve of a firm which is doing business in Australia getting its printing done in another part of the world ?,18
66,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am not dealing with that question, except that I hold that the duty is too high, even for that purpose.",18
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,In the other cases the catalogues will be duty free.,18
68,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Unde r what item?,18
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member will find that this amendment and another will make them free.,18
70,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If orable member says that they will be free, I am satisfied. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - It is intended that they shall be free. It has been represented to the Comptroller-General that the catalogues which are posted from other countries give a great deal of information to our business men, and it is not intended that they shall be dutiable. It is intended, however, that every person who does business in Australia shall get his printing done here. Complaints have also been made regarding the printing .of supplements to Australian newspapers in other countries. Suppose that the proprietors of a newspaper get their supplements printed in England or elsewhere, it is not fair that they should be admitted free. The object of this item is to prevent firms which are doing business in Australia from getting their printing done in other parts of the world, and securing free admission of the printed matter.",18
71,Mr SALMON,Unknown,It is nearly all done in Germany.,18
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I believe so. . It is intended that trade catalogues which are compiled and printed in other parts of the world shall be admitted free when posted to business firms in Australia.,18
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"If that is made clear, it will be all right.",18
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That is intended. Such publications will be made free.,18
75,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [11.30]. - I point out to the Committee that the A section of the Tariff Commission suggested that price lists and catalogues printed specially for Australian houses to advertise goods 'sold in the Commonwealth should be liable to this duty. That is a limitation. _ Mr MCWILLIAMS - Does it mean that if ' an English house has a large branch in Australia, it will be compelled to get its printing done here?",18
76,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The recommendation speaks for itself. Most of the Master Printers' Associations of Australia had no objection to British and foreign manufacturers' nrice lists and catalogues being admitted free of duty so long as the same privilege was not accorded to Australian manufacturers attempting to get their work done abroad. That is the evil j printing done abroad for Australian houses is brought here to comtlie hon- pete with local printers, but the local printers do not object to British and foreign merchants being allowed to print their own price lists and catalogues, and bring them in for commercial purposes. Consequently, I suggest to the Treasurer that he should add after the word ""Catalogues"" the words ""printed for Australian houses to advertise goods sold in Australia.""",18
77,Mr HUMECOOK,Unknown,I think the amendment covers such cases.,18
78,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"It must be made clear, because the Customs have hitherto had great trouble in dealing with such matters. These words were actually suggested by a Customs expert to remove dif ficulties and ambiguities, and to make the administration of the Tariff easier.",18
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [11.32] - I think that my amendment meets the suggestion of the honourable member for Bendigo, when read in conjunction with an amendment which I intend to move subsequently, and which I will now read352B. Catalogues, show-cards, or pictures used by or alluding to the goods of any manufacturer or producer not having a special place of business in Australia, free.",19
80,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,That covers the case. lowing effect,19
81,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [11.33]- I do not think that the Treasurer's Libraries, amendment would meet the caseI can quite see a very - wide distinction between an Australian firm sending its printing ' side Australia, and an English firm havattention ing branches in Australia, and desiring import its own printing. Take the of Sutton's, the well-known seed They have an establishment in practically every town in the Commonwealth.' Ac25 cording to the Treasurer's amendment, often, Sutton's seed catalogue would be taxed on coming into Australia. I do not think that that is the intention of the Minadays ister, and I am sure that it is of not the intention of the Committee. The Master Printers had no intention that' the catalogues of large English firms, ing branch houses all over Australia, sending their catalogues out to advertise their business, should be taxed, and think that that should be made perfectly clear. The Treasurer's amendment would mean that any English firm having an tablishment in Melbourne or Sydney would per cent. not be able to bring in its catalogues for distribution without paying duty. sonally, I do not desire to impose any per cent. taxation at all on catalogues advertising such goods as machinery, books, I do not think that this is a source .from which we really want to draw revenue. 3d. per lb. The duty can give no employment to our own people, and if is good policy to admit catalogues and price lists free.  received a letter from an advertising firm be 3d. per lb. in Adelaide who point out that these duties work out at 100 per cent. The letter is from Fred C. Powell, street car advertising agent, and agent for calendars, novelties, show-cards, and signs. The writer saysThere is no discrimination between finished goods intended to advertise the foreign made article, and the partially finished material intended to be finished here and to be used in advertising Australian made goods. He goes on to sayI have employed considerable labour in the finishing of these goods, desiring to have as much work as possible done locally. Therefore, if the Tariff is not made to discriminate as I have suggested between matter with advertisements and matter without advertisements, it will pay better to import them wholly finished. I have also been requested by the Public Libraries Board in South Australia to say that whatever duty may be fixed on these lines, there should be a proviso to the folExcept when imported for use in Public Museums, or Art Galleries; in which case they should be free of duty. outI think that suggestion is worthy of the of the Treasurer. I have received to a second letter from the firm to which I case have previously referred, in which the merchants. writer points out that the duty under the old Tariff, 3d. per lb., or per cent., whichever was the higheT, was at the former collection, as high a rate as 50 per cent, on the value, and 6d.. per lb. is 100 per cent - to o heavy a tax on the Australian 'manufacturer who uses advertising matter. Nowit is imperative that advertisements be a very attractive character, and whilst it is possible that a few of the larger firms can have matter of their own special design, this is not possible for those in a smaller way. havThe writer also points out that the Dunlop and Company can have their own designs, whereas smaller companies like the Phoenix I or Atlas Tyre Companies have to use matter procured outside Australia, but finished here. I think that the old duty eswas quite sufficient. It amounted to 50 Per- Mr SALMON - The old duty was not 50  and seeds, to that, I am informed.",19
82,Mr SALMON,Unknown,It was 25 per cent... or  higher rate; and the duty of 3d. per lb. worked out at 50 per cent. I shall move when I have an opportunity that the duty,19

84,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Thos e are dealt with in another paragraph. These people evidently do not understand the proposal.  upon the intelligence of the directors. I intend to move That the amendment be amended by adding the words "" except when imported for use in a Public Library, Museum, or Art Gallery.""",19
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Parramatta) [11.44] - 1 think that the honourable member would do well to make a separate paragraph of his amendment.,20
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,So do I .  able to do that.,20
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I presume that the object of ihese excessive duties, amounting, as the honourable member for Grey has said, to TOO per cent., is to exclude newspaper supplements and such like material, as well as to compel our business people to have their printing done locally. I do not know why we should be at such pains to make people do so, and I say this with no desire to belittle our own printeries. On the contrary, I hold that we ought to suoport them: but I do not think that we should eventually help them by completely shutting out this material, representing, as it does., the skill, enterprise and up-to-dateness of the world.",20
88,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The supplements come in blocks.,20
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"They come in lithographed. The old duties, to my mind, were sufficient even from the point of view of a protectionist. I am quite sure that magazines will also be taxed under the amendment moved by the Treasurer, which includes the words, "" unframed, having advertisements thereon.""",20
90,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Magazine s are dealt with in paragraph c.,20
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is the Treasurer going to strike out that paragraph when we reach it , since we deal with magazines in paragraph A ?",20
92,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The insertion of the letters "" n . e . i . "" would cover-the honourable member's objection.",20
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Treasurer may propose to cover magazines by this paragraph and to exclude them from later ones. Magazines and periodicals would certainly be covered by the words ""unframed, having advertisements thereon,"" unless we took steps to exclude them. If our people insist upon going to the other end of the world for some particular article or paper, we should not prevent their [ 53] 2 doing so, provided that they are prepared to pay a reasonably heavy penalty. But is not a duty of 100 per cent, altogether too high? I have no sympathy with those who seek abroad what can be reasonably done for them here. I have no patience with those who patronize every one but their own people; but my experience is that a good, stiff, hide-bound protectionist always reaches out with both hands for a cheap thing wherever he can get it . That being so, this proposal will f all quite as heavily upon the protectionist section of the community as it will upon any other. Those who clamour most loudly for duties upon foreign goods are the first to use them if they find it to their advantage to do so. Only the other day, when we were discussing the confectionery duties, it came out that manufacturers of confectionery in Melbourne, who were clamouring for high duties, were using Nestles milk, and not Australian milk, in their manufacture.",20
94,Mr COON,Unknown,That is not in order.,20
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Certainl y not. That should only be allowed in regard to the other fellow. Without the slightest desire to encourage the sending away to othei parts of the world for anything which can be reasonably done here, it seems to me we should impose a sufficiently high penalty if we adhered to the old duties. I intend to propose that we should substitute the duties under the old Tariff for those now submitted.",20
96,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [11.50] - I do not think that anything created more irritation in connection with the administration of the old Tariff than. did the influx of these price lists. As honourable members are aware they accumulated in tons in the Post Office. The position I take up is very much that which is embraced by the concrete amendment suggested by the honourable member for Bendigo. We should prevent local firms sending abroad to get their advertisements printed for them, since we can command sufficient skill and ability in the Commonwealth to meet all reasonable requirements in this direction. But to impose a heavy charge upon the admission of trade catalogues which reach us from all parts of the world would be to restrict the information required by the ordinary trader, the need for which has been felt so very much. The comprehensive letters "" n . e . i . "" appear much too frequently in the amended proposal of the Minister. The amendment suggested by the honourable member for Bendigo would certainly be much more definite, and the Minister would be well advised if he accepted it. I wish to emphasize what has been said the honourable member for Grey with repose spect to catalogues for public libraries galleries. I am glad that the authorities of these institutions communicated with influential a. member of the Committee. ments They have also communicated with me. catalogues The authorities of the public libraries in all Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide, as well as in Melbourne, join in a representation in accordance with the custom, followed without exception in every country in world, information of this character tended for the benefit of the be admitted free. I suggest to the honourable member for Grey that it would be well for him to move the insertion of exclusive provision which would embrace the whole of the items to which referred.",20
97,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The Minister agreed to that.,21
98,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I am glad to hear it. was not aware of it. In regard to the poseother matter, I hope the Committee will be guided by the principle that all work reor quired by our own people should, if posbusiness or sible, be done by our own people, whilst the admission of catalogues, giving necessary information to traders and business should not be restricted as was the the administration of the old Tariff.",21
99,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Where does the honourable member for Grey desire to introduce his amendment?  understand that it is the wish of the mittee that a new paragraph to meet what tinuance I desire should be inserted. I think I can good to us. leave that to the Minister.,21
100,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [11.56]. - The Minister might cut this debate short hv accepting the suggestion Commission and including an exemption provision to read in this wayPrice lists and trade catalogues not specially printed for Australian houses to advertise to be sold in the Commonwealth-free .

111,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The indent agent must serve some useful purpose, or he would not exist.",22
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not think he serves a very useful purpose for Australia. He has a room, and a boy, or a typewriter, and all his interest in Australia consists in taking as much as he can out of it. From an Australian stand-point, I do not like the indent agent at all.",22
113,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It is curious that the tailers find use for him.,22
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The importers may, but I am not sure that even they do. I would rather adhere to my own wording than go past the established or acknowledged houses here. I think we go quite far enough when we go as far as that. From that point of view, I should like the honourable member for Bendigo to think over the matter, and see what his amendment means, because it is extending my proposal very considerably.",22
115,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [12.4] - I do not see why the Treasurer should abuse the indent agents. They serve a useful purpose here. They are a convenience to many people who wish to import goods, and they do not deserve the abuse which the honourable member has showered on them.",22
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I did not shower abuse on them. I have always said that they do no good to Australia.,22
117,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Every man who comes here and engages in a legitimate industry is of some good to the community. Nevertheless, I think the Treasurer is right from his point of view. If these people have establishments in Australia, they can very well get their printing done here.",22

123,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I do not agree with the honourable member. We are not in a position to give exact reciprocity to other countries, in which manufacture is highly perfected, and which are in a better position to capture our trade than we are to capture theirs - Therefore, it is useless at this stage of development to talk of reciprocity.",22
124,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Seedsmen' s catare- logues would not necessarily involve an office.,22
125,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I think the general catalogues might come in at a small rate of duty. I wish to draw the Treasurer's attention to the fact that calendars and almanacs, n.e.i., appear in item 353, under a 30 per cent. duty. They are practically the same as the articles included in paragraph A of item 352. Many patent medicine proprietaries send out what are virtually their price lists in the shape of calendars and almanacs. There is really no difference between calendars and almanacs of that kind, and the other articles enumerated by the Treasurer. They are out of place in section 353, and ought to be treated in the same way as are the price lists of foreign houses.",22
126,Mr DUGALDTHOMS ON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [12.8] - I notice that included in the Minister's amendment are "" printed bags and cartons."" Cartons mean empty cardboard cases. On those things the duty is tremendous-fro m 200 to 300 per cent. The object is to make the duty on those articles the justification for the subsequent duty on strawboard.' That is really the process that is going to be worked. These cartons are to be made practically unimportable, and then the strawboard maker will say, "" The makers be of cardboard boxes have been given a high protection, and therefore yi»m can give me the increase of 150 per cent, that I ask for on the old duty."" This proposal has been very simply introduced, and I did not notice the mention of bags and cartons until I got a copy of the amendment. It is to be a buttress for the increased duty on strawboard. The strawboard maker will be able to argue, "" The increased duty on strawboard will ncjt injure the boxmaker, as the goods that, would compete with him are excluded."" But the ultimate effect will be that the strawboard maker will be so securely entrenched that he can get any increase of price right up to the cost of the imported article under the 150 per cent, increase of duty. He will be invincibly entrenched; and the strawboard boxmakers will have to pay the increased price. But the latter are told: "" Although you do pay this increased price, you cannot 'be competed with,, because you are given a duty of 6d. per lb. on your manufactured article, and this absolutely excludes competition."" What is the effect? These strawboard boxes are used only when they can be sold at a price verynear: to that of the paper wrappings or packages previously used, and immediately the price is raised the demand will be decreased, with the result of loss of employment. And why is this done? In order to give greater employment in a trade which, according to the proprietor of the Broadford Mill-the only mill producing strawboard iinthe Commonwealth-gav e employment in 1902 to only thirty-one men and seven boys.",22
127,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,And produced very coarse strawboard.,23
128,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I sav nothing about the quality; the manufacturer may say that he has improved the quality, and may still furthen improve it.",23
129,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Wh v should he not?,23
130,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am not attacking the quality, but merely pointing out that, for the benefit of this'mill, .it is sought to increase the duty from 35 per cent, to 62 per cent. 1",23
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The duty under discussion has nothing to do with strawboard.,23
132,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Of course it has-this duty is proposed in order to support a proposal later on-to increase the duty on strawboard.,23
133,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That is an insinuation which ought not to be made.,23
134,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not say that the Minister knew anything about the matter; but, as a matter of fact, I heard that this was to be done. Sir WILLIAM. LYNE - I know nothing at all about that.",23

136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,[ am afraid that the honourable member has been listening to a lot of tittle-tattle.,23
137,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am afraid that it is the Minister who listens to tittle-tattle; I always take care to sift information which I receive. Whether the' Minister's intention is or is not what I have stated, the effect will be an increase of the duty on strawboard, and the strawboard boxmakers who complain' so bitterly about the increased duty on their raw material will be protected by a prohibitive duty.",23
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that this duty is imposed for the unworthv purpose he indicates ?,23
139,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I have already said that a few clays ago I heard what the intention was, though I do not suggest that the Minister - had any knowledge of the matter. However, I leave the question of intention aside, and merely point to what will be the effect. It may be thought that under this arrangement the strawboard boxmakers will have nothing to complain of; but, as a matter of fact, their trade will be seriously affected, because, as I said before, cardboard boxes are used only when the price is close to that of ordinary paper packages. I move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" also all printed bags and cartons."" At present there are duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, on paper bags, and now it is proposed, simply because of the printing, to raise the duty to at least 100 per cent.",23
140,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Do I understand the honourable member for Bendigo to submit an amendment?,23
141,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"My desire is, after paragraph A has been disposed of, to insert, as a separate line, the amendment I have alreadv indicated. Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [12.19] - I regret that the honourable member for North Sydney has made what I may term, an insinuation as to the object of the proposal immediately before us.",23
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I heard this morning that the intention was that indicated by the honourable member for North Sydney.,23

149,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I do not say that the object is an improper one from the protectionist stand-point ,24
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The Comptroller-General advises me that the statement is absolutely without foundation. If the honourable member for North Sydney says that he does. not believe the Comptroller-General,24
151,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Why is duty proposed ?,24

157,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [12.23] - I sincerely hope that the Committee will not be influenced by the blandishments of the honourable member for North Sydney. The honourable member must be well aware that the duty proposed on strawboard is quite insufficient, and that, if the duty immediately before us be agreed to, it will be necessary later on. if we are to have true protection, to take some such step as he has indicated. At any rate, when we do reach the item of strawboard, I shall endeavour to induce the Treasurer to raise the duty above that proposed in the schedule. If every time this we endeavour to impose an effective duty, we are to be stormed at by the Opposition, we shall be kept here not only until this Christmas, but until the Christmas following. It is our duty, as a protectionist Parliament, to see that effective duties are imposed. only say Mr. JOSEPH COOK - What does the honourable member mean by an effective duty ?",24
158,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I mean a duty suffito insure that the commodity shall rebe sold at a price which will pay fair and give a fair return to those who invested money in the industry.

162,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [12.28] - The honourable member for Parramatta stated that he heard, a few days ago, that this arrangement was to be made. Here is a letter written on the 26th September lastWe have the honour to submit to you the recommendations of the Master Printers' Association of Victoria, The Paper Manufacturers, The Cardboard Box Makers, The Paper Bag Makers, The Manufacturing Stationers, the Paper merchants of Victoria,, in reference to items affecting Paper, Printing and Stationery, in your proposed Tariff. We endorse the Government's proposals with the inclusion of "" Printed Bags and Cartons,"" with the exception of Masrazines. We do not think that Magazines would be produced in Australia, so we do not see the necessity for this duty, especially is the case with "" Trade and Scientific Journals."" We suggest therefore that clause C should read "" Printed matter n.e.i. including printed bags and cartons (except newspapers registered for transmission through the post as magazines), 6d. per l b . "" That was written on the 26th September last, so that the insinuation that the arrangement had been arrived at within the past few days is utterly without foundation, and it is one which, on behalf of the Comptroller-General, I am justified in resenting.",25

A few moments ago he told us that the Comptroller-General of Customs knew nothing whatever about this arrangement. Yet we now know that it was put in black and white, months ago. Will the Treasurer now say that he knew nothing about it ? After having denied my statement point blank, the honourable gentleman rose, and read a letter which confirmed it. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports made one remark to which I should like to refer. that unlike the honourable member for North Sydney and myself, he wanted to insure the payment of - good wages to the emploves in this industry. Does he mean to imply that we do not ? Let me tell him that I have done more to secure the payment of good wages to employees than he will accomplish in his life-time.",25
164,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,That is doubtful.,25
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is no member of the Opposition who does not desire to see good wages paid.,25
166,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Then their actions do not show it.,25
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member has only one notion in regard to the method by which the payment of good wages may be insured. He thinks that that result can be brought about only by the imposition of high duties for the protection of our manufacturers.,25
168,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,That is the only method.,25
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If protective duties in themselves are a guarantee of good wages being paid,, why does he want to protect Australian strawboard againstDutch strawboard? His argument means nothing. All the duties that he advocates are duties against the highly-paid, intelligent labour of the world, and not against the low-paid labour of the world.

I wish to make only one remark in reference to the agreement which has been forwarded to the Minister in respect of this item. It was discussed during the last week-end, and I understand that the manufacturers of strawboard agreed with the card-box makers to accept a lower duty than that proposed in the Tariff . The Treasurer, 1 however, has gone back upon the arrangement, and desires to get the highest duty possible. I have been told that the whole thing has been discussed many times between the card-box makers and the strawboard manufacturers. The present proposal is a part of the arrangement arrived at between them. Nobody suggests that the Treasurer was a party to it. I hope He said that he will believe that these arrangements can be made without his knowledge.",25

173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Nobod y suggests that the Treasurer has been discussing this matter with these individuals. But the fact remains that he has proposed what they requested him to propose some months ago. The arrangement has been discussed more than once lately; but as they could not agree amongst themselves, each of the parties has been left to act it pleases.",25

176,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Then where is the difference ?,26
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not talking about manufacturers soliciting members of this House. I am merely pointing out that two sections, each wanting a protective duty, agreed as to the rate which they would recommend to the Government. The real object of this proposal is not protect our printing establishments, but protect our strawboard manufacturers.",26
178,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Laanecoorie) [12.37] I am very glad that the honourable member for Parramatta has changed his ground in regard to this particular duty. When honourable member for North Sydney first made his statement it impressed me have somewhat. I thought that it implied that some arrangement had been arrived at tween the Government and certain manuhave facturers. But now we have an entirely different story. We find that a perfectly legitimate request was made three months ago- a request to which the Government their wrappers. have acceded. Anybody who knows anything about the manufacture of these done articles must realise the enormous competition to which our manufacturers are subjected by reason of importations from oversea. I am speaking particularly of illustrated calendars. When these arrive here, nothing remains to be done except print upon them the name of the person who has ordered them. Under these cirwere cumstances we are entitled to extend to those who do that work in Australia a full measure of protection. With respect to cartons, I say, without fear of contraof diction, that those made in Australia from our own strawboard are equal to those produced in any part of the world.

Any proposal to limit the size of the paper with a view to getting it cut in Australia is really ridiculous.

The whip had not been acquainted of this arrangement, and, therefore, could not remind me of it.

208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [2.17] - I would point out to the honourable member for Parramatta that if the amendment of the amendment which he proposes were carried, it would give rise to complications. The original amendment includes the words "" frames including the weight of the frames,"" and the honourable member's proposal would, therefore, conflict with the decision already arrived at.

The Treasurer would be well advised to accept my suggestion, .which, I feel sure, will commend itself to the common-sense of honourable members generally. I am certain that if the Minister would fake expert advice, every unbiased and impartial printer would admit that a duty of 4d. per lb. on printed matter of this kind would give ample protection, and would be all that could reasonably be expected by those concerned in this industry.

225,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [2.43] I wish to make an explanation in reference to a dispute I have had with some one who lobbied me in Parliament House. I was lobbied here by Mr MCDougall, of Sands and MCDougall, and I think it is only right that honourable members should understand what occurred. Briefly. I had simply been told that he could not make the very finest qualities of coated boards, and when he came here I asked him and it was the only question I asked him - if anv evidence had been given before the Tariff Commission, and whether he would read it and let me know if he had a different view. Oh the following day I received from him this letter, which is the most insulting letter I ever received from anv one in my life.",30
226,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Thes e men ought, not to be admitted inside the building.",30
227,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"When I was a clerk in the Colonial Bank, Mr MCDougall, a= the representative of a big firm, impressed me greatly, and we were very friendly; but I do not think I can be friendly with him after this letter. He has written me as follows:Melbourne, 7th December, 1907. Hon. Dr Maloney, M.P., Farliament House, Melbourne. Dear Dr Maloney, I was under the impression that you were turned as the member for Melbourne as a protectionist. You therefore very much surprised me yesterday when you said that you would oppose the proposed duty of 25 per cent, on surface-coated board. J. said no such thing. At present the duty on plain and coated Boards is the same. We now only ask for a protection of 15 per cent. We have invested a large sum in up-to-date plant, occupying one whole floor of our factory, and employ a large number of men in the production of _ these boards, and have continued their production in the hope that when the Tariff should be revised we would get .the protection that we are entitled to. Should we not receive that protection we will be compelled to close that department and throw all those hands out of work. It is sad to think that that result should be brought about by you, a supposed protectionist. How can you justify your action? Perhaps if I ' read my reply it will be clearer than anything I can say. wish it to be understood that I have respect and regard for any man who is a free-trader, so long as he honestly holds that opinion, and if I use the term in what I write, I only do so in the course of my answer to the insult and slur that has been thrown upon me as the honourable member for MelbourneSir, Yours of the 7th inst. to hand. Your impresfor sion is correct. I am a protectionist. My litical faith has been, and will ever be, licly declared. I do no skulking, double-dealing, or underhand scheming. My votes embody my principles. I point to the votes I have myself and others. given. But I am surprised, after lobbying me Parliament House, you should now write me - and such a letter- a letter of craft and and not straightforwardness. You threaten turn men out of work-wit h what object?-t frighten me ! You know the thought that "" Houseless heads tervene. and unfed sides"" of my fellow men and women would break my heart, if I were directly or indirectly the cause. You care nothing them. Gain is your object. To put money your purse you try to frighten me by conjuring before my eyes workless men and hungry children. You want money only, and I am to be but a tool in your hands-and you threaten and women and children to influence me to ss you desire. Ought I not admire you? Noble character, disinterested humanitarian ! Mr Maloney. Yet you are the man-yo u lover of protection and of workmen-wh o did your utmost, who hesitated at no expedient, to oust me from Parliament House and put in-who , a protectionist? 365 Collins-street, No- a free-trader. Yes-wealt h went to wealth. The wealthy MCDougall supported the. wealthy Sir M . MCEacharn. Where was the poor workmen then? Now carry out your threat to dismiss your re- workmen if you dare. I believe that manhood and womanhood in this country will say you are not the master of their lives-that you are not as God-that to you they need not pray "" Give us this day our daily work that we may earn the bread of sweat."" It proves conclusively to my soul's satisfaction that the policy .of the Labour Party is the right one-the right of the man to live without being at the beck and call of his fellow man, because that man has money. With tenfold earnestness will I advocate a policy of nationalization of industries, so that the MCDougalls may become as Dodos-extinct . The fact that Sir M . MCEacharn was one of the four who voted against ""White Australia,"" and who was then an acknowledged free-trader, shows me it is not of your workmen you are thinking-blac k or slave does not signify to you. To you your men are machinery-instrument s of money-making. To me they are men with God-created souls and ""rights of life, liberty, Yours faithfully , and the pursuit of happiness."" JAS. MCDOUGALL. When the duties are considered, you may rest assured I will think of my duty to my fellowBut I men and to my country, Australia, and your threats will not operate' on my mind. After my experience of your lobbying, and of your letter, I deem it my duty to prevent your misunderstanding my words, or misrepresenting me, and all future communications, if any, must be in writing.",30
228,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [2.48] - I do not think this incident ought to be allowed to pass unnoticed, although the highlycoloured reply of the honourable member Melbourne may excite a little laughter. poRight through the Tariff that sort of tning pubhas been the experience not only of the honourable member for Melbourne, but of We have been waylaid by importers' agents and manufacat turers' agents.

The honourable member for Melbourne has taken up the right position, but he has not done so a bit too soon. The honourable member for Lang mentioned Mr. Beale's name. Although' that gentleman is a manufacturer in a large way in my electorate, I have treated him in the same way as I have treated the importers' - agents. 1 only wish that every other member would do the same. Of course, those interested have a right to make representations, but they can approach honourable members by circular, instead of personally. Only to-dav I received a large sheaf of circulars by post. The honourable member for Melbourne has done the best public action that we have had since the Tariff has been under consideration. fortnight ago Mr Speaker was asked to intervene against the placing of exhibits in this building. If interested parties want to make exhibits, let them hire a place in Collins-street for the purpose. When the last Tariff was being considered, I said that' we appeared to be threatened with the American system of lobbying, but if the present condition of things is going to continue, what goes on in America will be only a circumstance to it . No member, whether a free-trader or protectionist, should be intimidated as to his votes. I m porters' agents and manufacturers' agents should use the one channel only-by letter - and should not come to this House to make personal representations when their interests are at stake.",31

The directorv to which I refer is Wise's Post Of u e 'Directory, and the duty proposed means an impost of 3s. 6d., the weight of each volume being 7 lbs. I understand that the printing represents only one-fourth of the cost of production, the other three-fourths being expended in Australia. This duty is proposed for the benefit of a particular firm.",33

245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The member must recollect that there are very important directories' published in New South Wales.  waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs some time ago, it was pointed out that in the preparation of Wise's Post Office Directory thirty married men and twenty-five single men and women were constantly employed in Australia, and that, in addition, there were partially employed, say for six months of the year, seventy-five men and women, many of the former being married. A comparison of this directorv with the directory issued by the firm who are so anxious to have this duty imposed, may be interesting. eight towns dealt with in Wise's Post Office Directory, only five are dealt with in the directory issued by Sands and MCDougall. Then in Wise's Directory, 1,872 country postal towns are given as compared with 472 in the directory of Sands and MCDougall.

The Minister of Trade and Customs promised the members of the deputation that he would make inquiries and ascertain whether the statement to which I have referred is correct. I should like him to give the Committee the result of his inquiries, and to say whether Wise's Directory can be printed in the Commonwealth within a reasonable period. Mr AUSTIN CHAPM AN (Eden Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [ 3 - 3 l - - I recollect the deputation to z which the honourable member for Corio has referred. At that deputation conflicting statements were made. Of course, those who were interested in having the work done oversea made out the best case that they could. But to those who have seen the directories that are printed in Australia, it must be obvious that the work can be performed locally. As a matter of fact, a number of printers who waited If his upon me some time ago pointed out that this work could be done within the Commonwealth at a time when printing work was slack, and that it would thus provide employment for men who would otherwise be idle. I cannot understand the statement that nine months is required to print this directory.",35

So that nearly all the advertisements which appear in these magazines are specially allowed to be admitted free under the last item we dealt with, when they are sent out as advertisements only through the post.",39
353,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [3.55] The Treasurer in his rather remarkable speech seems to have quite misunderstood the .point at issue, or has been incapable of stating his case in such a way as to commend it to honourable members who are accustomed-in spite of the fact that he has been permitted to be in charge of. this Tariff for a considerable time-to have cases presented to them in a logical manner. The honourable gentleman says that it is desirable to foster art and literature. No doubt it is ; but if that be the object which he has in view, I ask: What . earthly connection is there between a number of advertisements which he declines to be allowed to be'attached to Munsey's Magazine and the fostering of literature and art? The whole gravamen of the Treasurer's charge is that these magazines are accompained by quantities of advertisements. If they are cut out he has no objection to allowing the magazines to come in. Therefore, his objection is to the advertisements, not to the literature and art of foreign countries. As to the honourable gentleman's remarks lobbying-which , of course, are made rather late in the day, and when the precincts of this chamber are full of exhibits of various kinds- I remind him that not very' long ago he came down to this House with a sheep-shearing machine, the driving gear of which occupied the lobby and which he said was made in Australia when, as a matter of fact, it was imported. We have not heard the Treasurer taking exception to men coming here day after day and stating their case - to honourable members. A hundred of them have tried to speak to me, but few have been successful. should be very sorry if I could not present a case better than the Treasurer has done on this occasion. The magazine which he has exhibited is an American magazine - Munsey's. The American magazines, without exception, differ from the English magazines in the number of advertisements which they contain. I take up half-a-dozen English magazines, and find hardly any advertisements in them. Now, I am perfectly prepared to listen to a proposal in favour of excluding the literature and art of all foreign countries, on the ground that it is desirable to foster literature and art in Australia. But I am not to be influenced, by foolish fulminations against advertisements contained in foreign magazines, and which come in merely in cidentally. I am sure that some of us enjoy reading the advertisements in magazines. There is no greater evidence at once of the ingenuity and the credulity of mankind than can be found in reading the advertisements in the American magazines. But the literary men of Australia do not want to exclude magazines because of their advertisements. They want to exclude them-if they have any such desire at all-becaus e they have their own brains to sell here. But the Minister in charge of this Tariff does not want to exclude American magazines for that reason. They are to be permitted as magazines to come in ; but their advertisements are to be cut out. That is an illogical and senseless position to take up. The Treasurer seems to think that literature"" and art can be dealt with on the basis of so much per pound-that works over a certain weight ought to be excluded, whilst those under a certain weight should be admitted free. He appears to think that literature is a thing that is capable of being weighed and measured.",39

356,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I certainly agree that the contents of some magazines are very trivial and foolish, but I should be sorry to think that we are guilty of the intolerable assumption that we do not require all that the intellect of foreign countries can give us. Half-a-dozen magazines which I have in mind have, perhaps, only half-a-dozen pages of advertisements as I against thirty or forty pages of general reading matter. The Treasurer has said a great deal on the question of preference to Great Britain, but this is an opportunity which I am sure he will not avail himself of to grant a preference to the Old Country, because according to him advertisements alone are anathema. If he excludes only those magazines in which advertisements preponderate he will allow British magazines to come in at a cheaper rate.

399,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I heard the honourable member make the statement pretty loudly in this chamber. He forgets that some of the country newspaper proprietors use use printing paper' imported 'in rolls.,42
400,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Ver y few of them do.,42
401,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,The Ballarat Courier and the Bendigo Advertiser are printed from rolls. I have been told that the proposed duty would mean a tax of jQ$ or £ 1 0 a week on the proprietors of those newspapers.,42
402,Mr MAHON,Unknown,What would it mean to the proprietors of the Melbourne Age and Argus?,42
403,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,The honourable member would hit others besidesthose whom he desires to hit.,42
404,Mr MAHON,Unknown,My amendment would not hit them hard.,42
405,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"It would amount to a tax of ,£300 or .£400 a year, in some instances ",42
406,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If the honourable member wishes to do so much for newspaper proprietors, why did he not vote to make type free?",42
407,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Nowaday s linotypes are very largely used.,42
408,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Canno t the newspaper proprietors save this tax out of the make-up of the newspapers?,42
409,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,O r pay it out of their dividends ?,42
410,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The use of linotypes has largely reduced the cost of printing; but the newspaper proprietors have given the public a substantial equivalent by increasing the size of their news columns. The Melbourne and Sydney newspapers, the West Australian, and the Brisbane .Courier are magnificent literary productions, unequalled in the world. If printing paper in rolls is taxed at the rate of 10 per cent., the proprietors of these newspapers will probably have to. economize by reducing their Saturday supplements.",42
411,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The duty will reduce their dividends a little, that is all.",42
412,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I do not stand here to support the rich newspaper proprietors. If it is wished to get at them, that ought to be done by means of an income tax, though at the present time they contribute largely to the State revenues.",42
413,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Canno t printing paper be made here ?,43
414,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"It is not made here. I have a copy of a letter sent to the Minister of Trade and Customs by and on behalf of all the papermakers in Australia, saying that they do not desire a duty on printing paper for newspaper purposes, because they do not make such .paper.",43
415,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Would not a duty compel them to make it, and give a large amount of employment to our own people ?",43
416,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I am afraid that the honourable member is in a frivolous mood.,43
417,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"No , I am merely appealing to a protectionist to create work for the people of Australia.",43
418,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I believe in giving protection where there is a reasonable prospect of establishing industries, either at once or in the immediate future, but we cannot make here paper for the printing of newspapers. Canada is now proposing to put an export duty on the pulp used for making such paper.",43
419,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Does not the honourable member regard as a curious coincidence the appearance in this morning's newspapers of the telegram about that proposal ?,43
420,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The agitation in Canada has been going on for some time. There is no chance of making printing paper in Australia. If there were, I should support a duty on it. I am concerned, not so mucli for the big metropolitan newspaper proprietors, as for the country newspaper proprietors, many of whom, in addition to the proprietors of the newspapers which I have mentioned, intend to use rolls as soon as they can get the necessary machinery.",43
421,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"About 2 per cent, of the country newspaper proprietors are concerned.",43
422,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"All tbs big country newspaper proprietors will shortly be using rolls for the sake of economy. In Victoria there are 414 newspapers, in New South Wales 347, in South Australia 67, in Western Australia 63, in Queensland 136. in Tasmania 26; or in all. 1,053.",43
423,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It is hardly fair to read those figures in connection with the remarks which the honourable member has made in criticising my amendment. They have application only to the Tariff proposals.,43
424,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I protest on behalf of the proprietors of these newspapers against any duty on paper used for printing newspapers, and particularly against any discrimination between paper imported in rolls and paper imported flat or in sheets. Such a discrimination - would stand in the way of those who, for the sake of economy, and to keep pace with the times, may desire hereafter to use paper imported in rolls. My objection to the Government proposal is that it is a tax on literature, which, in the end, will bring loss upon the public.",43
425,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [4.28] - Al though speeches made in Committee are supposed to be confined to the amendment before the chair, the honourable member for Bendigo has been allowed to discuss my amendment, which is not before the chair. Mr. JOSEPH COOK!-The whole subject is before the Committee.",43

427,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [4.2-9] - I think that no one is in earnest about this duty, and that the Government do not want it to pass. Therefore, it would save time to withdraw the proposal.",43
428,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I shall not withdraw it.,43
429,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"Wheneve r a duty affecting newspapers was proposed in the Victorian Parliament-and it has been the same here-it has always gone to the wall, because no one was in earnest about it. That seems to be the case again now, and as we have many debatable items yet to deal with, it would save time if the Treasurer were to tell us that he does not intend to press this proposal.",43
430,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [4-30] - I am not going to say anything of the kind. I wish shortly to give the history of this matter. In the first report submitted by the Tariff Commission, under the heading "" Importations of Paoer and Stationery,"" the item is framed in this way"" Printing, in rolls or folios, known as ' News,' to be used exclusively for newspapers under Departmental By-laws, in sizes of not less than 20 x 25 inches, or its equivalent."" To that form of the item no duty was attached.",43

433,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Hear , hear. always opposed the duty.",44
434,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That was the duce first stage. Then in the second stage this appeared in the report of the protectionist section of the Commission"" We are of opinion that this item should amended to read Then followed the words I have-just quoted, and in addition the words "" ad valorem per cent."" That is signed by Mr Frank Clarke and Senators Higgs and MCGregor. There was apparently a difference of opinion between them and the Chairman of bark the Tariff Commission, who did not sign tree ? the report which was signed by the other three protectionist members of the Commisr sion. Then I come to the report of the B section of the Tariff Commission, who unanimously recommended a duty of 10 per cent. That is how the duty of 10 cent, came to be placed in the first column of this Tariff. I recognise that we have not so far found in Australia a sufficient supply of softwoods or other material suitable for the manufacture of this paper, in view of the large quantity of it that required. We have paper mills in Commonwealth, one in Sydney and one, I Britain. believe, in Geelong. I have made inquiry as to whether this class of paper factured here, and so far as 1 can gather it is not.",44
435,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The local manufacturers do not use wood.,44
436,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I believe that ported pulp. is so. This class of paper is not made at either of the mills to which I have referred. I have been ""at a loss to know how to mit a provision which would induce its manufacture within the Commonwealth.",44
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How can the honourable gentleman expect to do that when no material suitable for the purpose is found in Australia?,44
438,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not think that that is definitely known. that if the manufacturers were put to they might find a suitable material.,44
439,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"They cannot get any pulp. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - I have had some conversation with both metropolitan and country newspaper proprietors, who woods suitable for the purpose. say that so far a suitable pulp has not been found in Australia for this purpose. But A revenue duty. I am not sure that there has been any very I suppose the determined effort to find it . In the cirthe Government have felt it to be their duty to submit the item as proBut I posed. I think that perhaps it would have been better'had we offered a bounty to inpersons to set about the discovery of some material suitable for this purpose. I have an idea that we have in Australia, and especially in Tasmania, a peculiar kind be of rush which would make good paper. But I have never heard that any one has experimented in that direction. I believe 15 that this rush would be suitable for the purpose, though as a layman I cannot: speak with any authority on the subject.",44
440,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"What about the papertree, and the various %'arieties of t i ",44
441,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not know that sufficient quantities of that material would be available. So far as this item is concerned, I - am prepared to leave the decision of the matter to the Committee, per but the item will not.be withdrawn.",44
442,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [4.35] - Hon orable members should realise that this is neither more nor less than a revenue duty.

There is an evident shortage of"" material. The great Canadian forests have so far been able to meet the demand for wood pulp, but I have not been surprised to hear that the action of the United States in proposing the free admission of wood pulp I believe has been met in Canada by a proposal to it impose an export duty upon it . British manufacturers have, so far, been importing, wood pulp from Sweden, where there are extensive softwood forests. No attempt has been made in Australia to manufacture this paper, because we have no softI n the circumstances this can only be regarded as",44
445,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Coul d we not import the pulp and manufacture it into paper here?,45
446,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I do not think we could get it . If an export duty were imposed in the countries from which it comes, it would probably add so much to the cost of manufacturing the paper here that the local newspaper proprietors would prefer to pay the duty to paying the price which would have to be charged by local manufacturers of this paper from imported wood pulp. The honourable member for Bendigo appeared to think that this class of paper is used only for the printing of newspapers. But I can inform him that it is largely used for job printing as well as for dodgers. I know of one job done recently which involved the use of 10 tons of paper, and the printing was done from the roll.",45
447,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"That paper would come under the item dutiable at 25 per cent, to 20 per cent.",45
448,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"No , it would be the very paper we are now speaking about. It is a mistake to suppose that this paper is used only for the printing of newspapers, as paper from the same roll is used for job printing. I am opposed to the item on the ground that it provides merely for a revenue duty.",45
449,Mr MAHON,Unknown,In 1902 the honourable member voted for this revenue duty which he is now denouncing.,45
450,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,I was not particular how I voted before. I voted both ways.,45
451,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,It is a go-as-youplease.,45
452,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"No , it is not. I am guided in this matter by a definite principle. On this occasion the country has said that we should have protective duties. I have been fighting. for them, and I am opposed absolutely on principle to revenue duties. I wish that those things which cannot be made here should be admitted free, and there is no doubt that we cannot make this class of paper. The Treasurer has said something about rushes. But I wonder how long the greatest field of rushes in Australia would last if drawn - upon for this purpose, and how long the rushes would take to grow again.",45
453,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The rushes I refer to grow up every year.,45
454,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I suppose that the whole of the rushes grown in Australia would be used up in the manufacture of the paper - required to print a couple of issues of one of our large daily newspapers. The search for material suitable for the manufacture of printing papers of this class has been the business of busy brains in every part of the world. So far the greatest quantity has been' derived from soft-wood forests. Canada has almost a monopoly of woods suitable for the purpose. I can support the statement made by the honourable member for Bendigo that an increasing number of newspapers are being printed from the roll. The use of the Cox duplex machine, - which does not cost anything like the Hoe printing machine, is enabling a number of the proprietors of country newspapers to print from the roll.",45
455,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Can the honourable member name a country newspaper that is printed from the roll ?,45
456,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I think the Government should omit the item. The proposed duty of 10 per cent, in the general Tariff and free from Great Britain is misleading, because this paper is not imported from Great Britain. I oppose the item, because I am opposed to a revenue Tariff.",45
457,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [4.40]. - I take the same view of this matter as does the honourable member for Darling. This is a purely revenue duty, and I cannot see my way to vote for it. I admit, of course, that revenue must be derived in some way for the services of the Commonwealth, while the Braddon blot is allowed to remain. I hope that the wisdom of this House and another place combined will shortly lead to the removal of the Braddon blot. So fa r as is known at present, wood pulp suitable for the manufacture of this paper cannot be obtained in Australia. I am not sure that a suitable material will not yet be discovered, and I suggest to the Minister that the production of a pulp suitable for the manufacture of paper would be a fitting subject for a bounty. I find from a communication placed in my hands by a gentleman who has had much experience that wood pulp for this purpose is obtained from large forests of larch and spruce, - and comes principally from Canada, the United States, Norway, and Sweden. I know of one newspaper-L e Petit Journal, which, at the time to which I refer, had the largest circulation in the world, 1,500,000 subscribers-of which it was said that every year it ate out a forest in Norway. I am informed that logs of New Zealand pine were sent to England and the Continent in order to see if they could be made into a pulp suitable for the manufacture of this paper, but the experiments show that they could not be used for this purpose in the same way as the soft wood, such as the larch and spruce. I understand that if larch and spruce were planted here, it would take twenty years before they could be used for this purpose. Another difficulty is that these trees are found in countries in which there is heavy frost and snow, and it would appear that intense cold is necessary for their proper development. To import pulp is almost out of the question. One cannot verify information on these subjects by personal observation, but if my information be correct, and I think it is, pulp, to be imported here, would require to be 50 per cent, dry, or one-half water and one-half pulp.",45
458,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Nonsense .,46
459,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"I shall give the information I have first, and the honourable member can correct it afterwards if he is able.",46
460,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Migh t I ask from whom the honourable member received his information ?,46
461,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"It is quite sufficient that I should read the statement made, and if the honourable member can correct it, he need not ask me for my authority.",46
462,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It is usual to quote authorities in Parliament.,46
463,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"The honourable member will have to be content with the authority of my lips at present, though I can tell him that his question is by no means an awkward one, since, if there were any necessity to do so, I should have no objection to mention the authority. To import puip is out of the question. Wood pulp can be carried only in what is called a condition 50 per cent, dry-hal f pulp and half water. The freight alone on the pulp necessary to make a ton of paper, even at the most favourable sailing ship rate of 15s. a ton measure, would amount to over 60s. per ton, in addition to charges for insurance, exchange, &C. In a long voyage of 90 to 100 days, pulp would considerably deteriorate, owing to its tendency to decompose. If it dried to any extent, the material would lose its fibrous and become mere powder, from which only the coarsest paper could be made; Newspaper could not be produced in this country in any quantity from rags because the supply is limited, but all writing papers should bear a heavy duty. I have here the following statement with reference to the difficulties that small printers and others are experiencing at presentA l l stocks of papers here before the introduction of the Tariff have been charged a duty by the Paper Combine, which have circularized all printers to that effect. There is a paper combine at all events in Victoria, if not throughout Australia. Sands and MACDougall make a certain printing paper-this paper was invoiced prior to the Tariff at 25s. per ream duty. The duty of 20 per cent, was not, of course, operative on such a paper. They were asked for some 35 reami to be delivered immediately, and answered this way :-25s . old price, 5s. per ream duty; 30s. a ream new price, and you must wait a month for the delivery of the order, as since the Tariff our mills are overworked.",46
464,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,What sort of paper is that?,46
465,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"A certain high class paper that Sands and MCDougall manufacture, but such is the power of the Combine that the duty is being charged even where it has not been paid. I feel that I am perfectly justified in voting against the duty, so that the paper which we cannot manufacture here should be admitted free, but I trust that this or some other Government in the near future will take steps to encourage by a judicious bounty the production of suitable wood pulp.",46
466,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [4.48I - I think it will be admitted that I am fairly keen on anything that affects my electorate. I happen to have in my electorate one of the largest paper mills in Australia, and I am assured, both by employers and employees who are well versed in the manufacture of paper, that' it is almost an impossibility to manufacture newspaper here..",46
467,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What about those rushes ?,46
468,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I assure the honourable member for Parramatta that I am a scientific protectionist. If I thought there was a hundred to one chance of manufacturing newspaper and printing paper in Australia. I should vote for the highest duty I could get, but. having been assured by those in the trade that it could not be done, I intend to vote to make this article quality free. I know there is a. feeling- I must admit that I have it myself-that it would lie well to make some people pay. a little bit more taxation than they are paying just now; but. seeing that that would be stretch>ing my belief as a protectionist, I am willing to let it go. I should like to see "" printing paper'' inserted in this paragraph as well as newspaper, as ordinary printing paper is not made here.",46
469,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am going to try to deal with that point in a separate paramittee divided. graph.,47
470,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Ver y well. I wish to impress upon the Treasurer, and upon honourable members, that in taking up this attitude I am not "" slipping "" on paper.

482,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member wish to tax for the sake of taxing?,48
483,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"No ; but I think every class in the community ought to pay their due share to the revenue. The honourable member for Bendigo also declared that we have no timber in Australia suitable for for the manufacture of paper. I point out that if the proposed duty be imposed, large consumers will no doubt put their heads together, and endeai'our to discover .hsre some substitute for the foreign timber, When I hear vaunted protectionists like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Melbourne slating that newspaper cannot be manuthe factured here, and that, therefore, no duty should be imposed; I marvel at their short-sightedness, because, after all, cessity is the mother of invention. hirge newspaper proprietors are allowed dose other people with taxes, and impose heavy duties on co'untrv newspapers, enjoving free-trade themselves, they will never have any spur or incentive to discover in Australia a substitute for the foreign paper. I advise the honourable members whom I have referred to reconsider their position before their constituents. As I have said, the country newspaper proprietor pays a duty on his type, while the large newspaper proprietor of the city has his machinery The admitted free. There is one metropolitan newspaper proprietor who draws between a year from his newspaper; and he, and other wealthy proprietors, are to be free of taxation, while the poor country printer, who often employs his sons and daughters picking up type when they ought to be at school, is taxed The honourable for Bendigo spoke of advantages which he says readers of newspapers have been given by the proprietors since the inI deny the honourable member's statement flatly. I in shall take one case in proof. If we look up a Saturday issue of the Melbourne Argus of twenty years ago, we shall find that it compares more than favourably in work with the Saturday Argus of to-dav. That was long before the linotype was introduced ; and the same remark applies to the Sydney Mormng Herald or the Sydney Daily Telepra-ph.",48
484,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"But the Herald was while, at the then published at 2d.",48
485,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That is true, but there were i d . newspapers to which the remark applies, at any rate in a modified way. The reduction in the cost of production owing to the linotype has enabled newspaper proprietors to make enormous fortunes ; and neither the remuneration of the staffs, nor the advantages given to readers, pulp are in any way proportionate to the increased profits. I challenge the honourable the member for 'Pendigo to successfully refute what I say. Twenty vears ago the daily newspapers of Australia maintained two cable services from England, but there is now a syndicate service for the whole, and therebv considerable saving. These savings and economies have in no wav advantaged readers of the newspapers; nor. as I sav. have the staffs had their position materially improved. I regret very much nethat there should have been such lengthy If the. discussion on this item, but I intend dividto ing the Committee on the question.",48
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable while member propose anv preference?,48
487,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"No ; I do not think a preferential duty would do much good. A good deal of the reel paper comes from to Great Britain, but the countries of origin are not British. I wish it to be clearly understood that my amendment contembe plates that the paper used by the country newspaper proprietors shall still be admitted free.",48

The honourable member tioned Rockhampton, and other coastal towns, and classed the newspapers there with the great metropolitan dailies. But I entirely disapprove of any .step being taken which would impose heavy burdens on struggling newspaper proprietors, who are ill prepared to bear them.

In all the towns have been mentioned newspapers' .have started by enterprising men in the face great difficulties, and yet, in his anxiety tax the large proprietors, the member is prepared to put a heavy impost on the paper required by men who are doinsr good work for the country.

493,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) that [5.13I - The amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie simply repeats words of the item, and inasmuch as I originally intended to move that it should free, I think the only way to raise the small question is for me to now move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" 10 per cent.,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" free."" The honourable member for Coolgardie has tax endeavoured to show that there should be prosome differentiation shown between the inpaper used by the small country newspaper proproprietors and - that used by the propriementors of the large city dailies.",49
494,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I have done so.,49
495,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Whether the honourable member has or has not succeeded in doing so, I decline to have anything to do with class taxation of any description. We ought to treat the big proprietors of the cities with the same fairness and justice that we extend to the proprietors of small there weekly newspapers; even a big newspaper has a right to expect that at the a hands of the Committee. It is all very well for the honourable member to say that we propose to let the big city newspaper roll proprietor escape taxation, whilst taxing the small newspaper proprietor in the counAs a matter of fact, we wish to do nothing of the kind. We intend, I hope, to give ail newspaper proprietor's their printing free. I need not enumerate the reasons why this commodity should be free. But I wish to reply to the statement made by the honourable member for Coolgardie to what is going on in other parts of the which world. Two months ago I read in a been British newspaper that in New York a of movement was in progress to requisition to the .United States Government to remit the honourable duty upon wood' pulp.",49
496,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that that is rather a strange,49
497,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am speaking Of a movement which was in progress two. months ago. Already the duties imposed under this division of the Tariff are injuring our Australian publishers, who, I am told, are forwarding their books to memLondon to be made up there. It may be to that the time will come when we shall be able to convert the rushes grown in Tas. mania, of which the Treasurer spoke, into newspaper, but even if we could do that I do not know whether there is an unlimited supply available. It seems to me if all the rushes grown in Tasmania were utilized for the purpose they would the not keep a huge newspaper mill running very long. The prospects in that direction are, therefore, very small indeed. This newspaper problem is becoming a very serious one all over the world. There is no doubt that the supplies of pine wood, from which the pulp is made, are becoming exhausted, and already the industry is in the hands of one or two individuals. Even if we impose a tax upon printing newspaper we shall not stimulate enterprise in the direction of finding an efficient substitute for pine. It will be a tax pure and simple, and we ought not to impose a burden upon newspaper proprietors for the sake of levying taxation. I think that printing paper ought .to be admitted free, inasmuch as it is the raw material of the printer's finished product.",49
498,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [5.19] - The proposed duty is undoubtedly a revenue duty. A number of items have been in cluded in the Tariff for reasons which have never been explained, and this is one of them. I sympathize with the proposal of the honourable member for Coolgardie, but cannot see that there is any justification for proposing a tax upon newspaper. shall vote in favour of the item being made free.",50
499,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [5.20] I think that the Government are quite justified in challenging the opinion of the Committee upon this item, because no less than seven out of eight members of the Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty upon this class of paper. There is no reason, however, why that recommendation should be accepted by the Committee. I should like to remind the honourable member for Coolgardie that, in voting for the free admission of newspaper rolls, honourable members will not be voting solely in the interests of the great metropolitan newspapers alone. In Sydney there are twelve newspapers and other publications using these rolls",50
500,Mr MAHON,Unknown,r l challenge the accuracy of that statement.,50
501,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"In Melbourne there are six, in Adelaide there are six, in Perth four, in Kalgoorlie two, in Launceston two, in Hobart two, in Brisbane six, in Townsville two, in Charters Towers two, and in Victorian country towns six. I give these figures upon the authority of Mr. James Spicer, a Melbourne merchant. There is no reason to doubt that they are substantially accurate.",50
502,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [5.22] - I have very grave doubts whether the amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie would have the effect of taking a single penny out of the pockets of the large newspaper proprietaries. All of these firms are in a position to pass on the duty. That is their policy. As is well known, the mere cost of the paper actually used in the production of a big daily newspaper exceeds the price which the public pay for it. But it must be recollected that the city newspapers can command larger prices for advertising space than can country journals. The latter cannot obtain anything like the same rates. Any tax that we may impose upon printing paper will be passed on to the advertisers, who in turn will pass it on to the consumers. For these reasons I hope that the Government proposal will be defeated.",50
503,Mr WILS ON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [y.25] I am sorry that this item is not the first or second item in the Tariff. Had it been, we might have been in a position to take to heart the injunction of the honourable member for Bendigo. He has told us that seven out of the eight members of the I Tariff Commission recommended the imposition of a duty upon printing paper, but that that was no reason why the Committee should accept their recommendation. H is words should be written up. in large letters. Again and again he has urged that the recommendations of the Tariff Commission should be upheld. Yet here is an item upon which he advises the Committeeto vote against its finding;",50
504,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I did not recommend the imposition of this duty.,50
505,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"But upon the honourable member's own showing seven out of eight members of the Tariff Commission recommended it. I feel that it is in the public interest that printing paper should be admitted free. Country newspapers are deserving of every consideration, because they are working under great disabilities. I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta.",50
506,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [5.28] - I regret that so many honourable members are apparently oblivious of the fact that under my amendment the paper required by country newspaper proprietors would be admitted free. "" Mr ARCHER - I question 'that.",50
507,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It is only those large newspaper offices which can well afford to pay the extra impost which would be touched.,50
508,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,We say that the honourable member's statement is entirely wrong.,50
509,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The honourable member ought to know that when I speak of country press I mean the small journals which are published once or twice a week. I should like to read a short extract from the debate which took place upon this a little more than five years ago. The then Treasurer, Sir George Turner, who I pose understood the Tariff better than did any other member of the Committee, said I know that an agitation has been started, and that circulars have been sent right and from a particular centre in Melbourne lo prove that. that this duty will mean ruin to the proprietors of the country newspapers. But the duty is really a light one, and is put on in order to obtain revenue. I do not see why printing paper should be more sacred than anything else. He went on to sayI am certain that the imposition of a duty of 10 per cent, will not discourage the publishing of books and pamphlets within the Commonhad wealth. The proposed duty, besides providing ^25,000 of revenue, will give encouragement to the large mills which are now starting South Wales. I point out to the honourable members for Melbourne and Melbourne Ports that Sir George Turner, when Treasurer, thought: that the duty would have a protective i ncidenceI f the Committee wish to strike out revenue duties, there are other items which can more fairly be amended. I commend that statement to the consideration of the honourable member for Darling. I do not wish to delay the Committee in arriving at a. decision. I regret very much that there should be so much hostility offered to my proposal, whiqh, I repeat, is simply made to give to the country printer his paper duty free, his type being already taxed, and to put an impost on the proprietors of the larger publications in the cities, who have had their linotypes and printing machinery free of duty.",51
510,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [5.31]-- I am sorry that the deputy leader of the Opposition has moved his amendment in this way, because it has placed the Committee in a very awkward position.",51
511,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"No , the Government.",51
512,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It has not placed the Government in an awkward position. The fair way is to take a vote on the proposal of the honourable member for Coolgardie, which I will oppose, because I think that if a duty is to be imposed at all it should be levied all round; and then, if that proposal is defeated, as probably it will be, to take a straight-out vote on the proposal of the honourable memthe ber for Parramatta. The Government desire an opportunity to vote for the item as it is printed, and if that is given we can' get a. straight-out vote as to whether or nor item that class of paper shall be made free.",51
513,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The amendment of the suphonorable member for Parramatta will settle that with one decision instead of two.,51
514,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable left member is very clever, but it will not do",51
515,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is just the same.,51
516,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"When the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta is put, the question practically will be that the figures "" 10 per cent."" stand part of the item, and there can be no straighti-out vote. If , however, «VJ an amendment to the item-whic h could easily be submitted-the Government in New could get a straight-out vote.",51

On the other hand, I do not want to vote to differentiate between the users of this paper, and that is what the other amendment would oblige me to do.",51
527,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,No ; its object is to make paper free.,52
528,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No . The amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta introduces a complication which is not fair, because it prevents us from getting a straight-out vote.",52

533,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Not at all.,52
534,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is of no use for the honourable gentleman to blame me. I have had. to come in after the honourable member for Coolgardie. I want a straight out vote.,52
535,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not want to vote for an amendment to differentiate between country and city newspapers, but the honourable member is forcing the Government into a position in which they must do so.",52

543,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I will vote,52
544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I will not; so that of we are obliged to take it piecemeal.,52

550,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,But the Minister can vote against both proposals.,52
551,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No .

552,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,No .,52

555,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I know that. 'He has moved an amendment which relates to country newspapers, but they represent ceronly a small proportion of the press.",52
556,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,My position is that wherever the honourable member for Coolway gardie goes for a duty of 10 per cent. I must follow him to make the rjaper free.,52
557,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"That 'is putting the Government and those who wish to vote for a duty of 10 per cent, in a very improper position. I cannot vote for or against the amendment of the honourable member without making the duty of ro per cent, stand, and if it stands",53

I do not want, nor does the Government want, to vote with the honourable member for Coolgive gardie to give a preference to one section of the press, but the amendment of honourable member for Parramatta makes it imperative for me to vote for or against one section of the press. I do vote to make the duty of 10 per cent, stand as regards only a. part of the press.",53
562,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What is to stop the honourable gentleman from proposing afterdraw wards a duty of 10 per cent, on the paper for the other section of the press ?",53
563,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That would not of his own. give us a straight-out vote. The honourable member wants to get his amendment carried even if the Committee are against it.,53

579,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"As the matter a stands, the Government and those who support them will have to vote as to a certain portion of the imports of printing do paper, whereas they want to vote as to a the whole. The matter is complicated to f the such an extent that honourable members a cannot vote as they wish. I should like to to know from the Chairman what he time thinks about the position.",53
580,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Perhaps I can memshorten the discussion somewhat. The whole matter appears to me to be quite plain and simple. We have paragraph D before us. The honourable member for Cooldesires to substitute some other words. original intention was to propose to omit the item altogether, with a view of inserting another one. But the Department of Trade and Customs have hitherto found it necessary, to enable the Tariff to be properly administered, to have words added to items so that the existing duty may be collected up to today and the new one from tomorrow. The object of the amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie is quite simple. He has moved to add ' ' printing paper known as newspaper, in rolls or reels, to be used exclusively for newspapers under departmental by-laws, ad valorem 10 per cent."" He therefore desires that on and after tomorrow 10 per cent, shall be collected on such The honourable member for Parramatta desires that such paper shall be admitted free. Therefore, he has moved to omit the words "" ad valorem, 10 per cent."" with a view of inserting in lieu thereof the word "" f r e e . "" If the Treasurer desires that the duty shall be 10 per cent., he must vote to retain that rate of duty in the amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie.",53
581,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That I want to do.,54
582,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"We cannot help that. Honourable members occasionally have to vote differently from what they might prefer to do. Unfortunately, the rules under which we are working do not always permit us to vote exactly as we should like. If the duty of 10 per cent, were retained the Treasurer could, if he chose, vote to knock out the whole item, and then some other honourable member could move that on and after such and such a date the goods be free.. Mr S IN C LAI R - I desire to have your ruling, Mr Chairman, as to whether it is competent for a private member to move to increase a duty?",54
583,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The duty under the original item was 10 per cent. The honourable member for Coolgardie has merely moved a fresh form of words. He is not proposing to add to the duty.,54
584,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Excep t in this way : that under the original item a preference is given, whereas the proposal of the honourable member for Coolgardie is to wipe out that preference, and thereby to increase the duty.",54
585,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The item was free in the second column.,54
586,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The ' member for Coolgardie proposes to wipe out that degree of preference.,54
587,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [5.53] - I must confess that after the Treasurer's long explanation I am still unable to today. [254]- 2 discover where his difficulty lies. He has stated clearly that he is against' the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta, who wishes to make this paper free. He is quite clear that he is also against the amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie. It is therefore quite easy for him to vote first against the amendment of the honourable member for Parramatta and then against the amendment of the honourable member for Coolgardie. If they are defeated the honourable paper. member can vote in favour of his own proposal. The procedure is simplicity itself. The main question is whether this paper shall be free or dutiable. That will lie the first test. The Treasurer need not be afraid of being put in a false position.",54
588,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am put in a false position, and the honourable member's explanation proves it .",54
589,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I cannot see why. I have tried to discover the Treasurer's diffido not culty, and do not think that it exists. Those who believe that the goods should be free can vote with the honourable member for Parramatta; those who believe in a duty will vote against him. If the honourable member for Parramatta is defeated the Treasurer can move for a higher duty if he likes. He will have the Committee in his own hands if he can defeat the honourable member for Parramatta.",54
590,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [5.56] - The impression that I derived from the oration of the Treasurer was that he feared lest the proposal of his own Government should by any mischance be carried. My belief is that no one would regret it more than he would if the proposal of the Government were agreed to. So far as I am concerned, I intend to vote that these goods be free. I think that there should be no differentiation. At a later stage I also intend to propose that ordinary printing paper be free. I can see no complication about our procedure. The honourable member for Coolgardie has presented his case very clearly, and I do not think that there is any difficulty as to how honourable members wish to vote.",54
591,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Barrier) [5.57] - I must confess that I am rather surprised at the action of the Government in reference to honourable this matter. Not a single word has been said by the Treasurer or by any member of the Ministry in defence of this item.,54
592,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I said something about it when the matter was introduced,54

597,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I have never attacked the Treasurer. I have always defended his personal honour. I have never an unkind word about him, and when any other honourable member has attacked him I have always defended him. that he is the last man who should make is so. such an insinuation as he has done, because, if he insinuates against others, others insinuate against him.",55
598,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,They can do it as much as they like.,55
599,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I do not think they ought to do it. This Parliament should be above conduct of that sort. surer should be above baseless insinuations, and if he makes them others will do the same. He ought not to set a bad examole. The Treasurer should have put up a big fight on this question if he really wants the duty. But there is a vague idea that the Government do not want the item carried. It has been left for the honourable member for Coolgardie to defend the item. If the Government were in earnest they should have said that they would stand or f all by the item. Why not make the stand of their life about it if they really believe in it. But we have had the Treasurer for three-quarters of an hour orating about a point of order and practically dragging; a red herring across the trail. only devoted that time, and the powerful oratory and argumentative abilitv which he possesses and can use when he Likes to defending this item, it would not have mattered about the point of order-h e could have had his own way on the main issue. Unless the Government are prepared to make a stand on this .item I , for one, shall be forced to the conclusion that they prefer to see it rejected rather than I am prepared to support the Toitem, and I think that when anumber of magahonorable members who, as a rule, vote against the Ministry are prepared to vote for one of their proposals, they should put up a fight for it.",55
600,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [6.1] - The proposition places a limitation on the extent of the taxation on paper, and man the honourable member for Coolgardie proIt seems to me quite proper that the Committee should have a chance to vote upon such an amendment. At the same time, I can full y understand the position taken He is afraid that the further amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta will, since it is proposed by the honourable member for said Coolgardie to exempt paper required for country newspapers, secure votes that it would not carry in other circumstances. But I say Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Hear , hear;"" that",55
601,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Nevertheless , I think will that the Committee has a perfect right to vote on that basis.",55
602,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,But we should not be tied down to such a position.,55
603,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I do not think that any complication will arise. Those who The Trea- prefer that the item should be free will be able to vote for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Coolgardie. Both amendments may be rejected, and we shall then revert to the original proposal submitted by the Government. The Committee have a right to vote for any limitation that may be proposed, but if either amendment were withdrawn we should not have an opportunity to do so.",55
604,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Hume-Trea surer) [6.3] - The Chairman's explanation absolutely supports my contention. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta will force honourable members to take up a position regarding the amendment. moved by the honourable If he had member for. Coolgardie which they do not wish to occupy.,55
605,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How will it do so?,55
606,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am opposed to the honourable member's amendment.,55
607,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What for?,55
608,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Because I am opposed to making the item free. At the same time, by voting against the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta, I shall be voting in favour of that moved by the honourable member for Coolgardie, and that I do not wish to do.",56
609,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,Then vote against both.,56
610,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It is all very well for honourable members to tender such advice,56
611,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The moved by-the honourable member for Coolgardie, as far as it goes, agrees with the Government proposition.",56
612,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Unles s the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta be withdrawn, it will be placed on record that I voted to differentiate between two classes of newspapers. I do not wish to do so; I wish to have a straight-out vote.",56
613,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"But if what is proposed is in order, it must be fair.",56
614,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That does not follow. It is unfair to force an honourable member to vote contrary to his own wishes. I do not want to be compelled to vote for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Coolgardie.,56
615,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The honourable member will not be forced to do so.,56
616,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I shall. If I vote against the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta, then I shall be voting for a duty of 10 per cent, on certain paper as proposed by the honourable member for Coolgardie.",56
617,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Exactly , and that member is the duty proposed by the Government.",56
618,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,But the duty will relate to only a part of our proposal.,56
619,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is not mv fault.,56
620,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"When the honamendment orable member for Parramatta has asked mine. me to withdraw an amendment to give him an opportunity to move a prior amendsurer) ment, I have always done so, and I think that it is only reasonable that he should the same for me.",56
621,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But the ciicumment, stances of this case are different. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - I have civilly asked the honourable member more than once to withdraw his amendment, and i refuses to do so, then he need not expect me to ever give way to him. I wish to publicly repudiate the suggestion that I am in favour of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Coolgardie, and to say that if the honourable member for Parramatta forces me into such a position that I shall have to vote for it , . I shall move, rather than do so, that the item be free.",56
622,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In those circumstances, I shall not withdraw the amendment.",56
623,Sir WILLIAM,Unknown,"""LYNE - Then the honamendment orable member will never induce me to withdraw a motion in order to enable him to submit one. His attitude is most contemptible.",56
624,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,56
625,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I withdraw it .,56
626,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [6.7] - The Treasurer, for the last quarter of an hour, not only when on his feet, but - when in his chair, has been making all sorts of insinuations against my action in this matter.",56
627,Sir WILLIAMLYME,Unknown,"And deservedly so, I think.",56
628,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I simply acted on the suggestion of the Chair as to the only way in which I could move this issue to a straight-out vote.,56
629,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,But it leads to a complication.,56
630,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"1 see none; if I did I would immediately withdraw my amendment. I cannot conceive of a matter being put more clearly to the Committee than is the issue raised by my amendment. If the honourable for Coolgardie will withdraw his amendment I will willingly withdraw mine, so that we may have a straight-out vote. I did not raise this question; it was raised by the honourable member for Coolgardie, and if he will not withdraw his I certainly shall not withdraw",56
631,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea [6.9] - I am not going to submit quietly to this situation. I should be much do obliged to the honourable member for Coolgardie if he would withdraw his amendand so save me from an awkward situation. It is not fair, perhaps, to ask him to do so, but, in the peculiar circumstances of the case- I think his amendf he ment will be defeated-h e might well accede to my request. He will have an opportunity to again submit his amendment after a straight?-out vote on the item has been taken.",56
632,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [6.11] - I think that the Treasurer is right. If vote be taken on the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parramatta, the Treasurer will undoubtedly be compelled to vote for a. principle that he has already repudiated. If the honourable member for Parramaua will give the matter a moment's reflection he will recognise that, having regard to the form in which the question would be put, the Treasurer, by opposing his amendment, would be voting quite contrary to the principle he has advocated. My proposal is for the imposition of a duty of JO per cent, on a portion of the item only. Such a vote would commit the Treasurer to a division of the item differentiating between two classes of newspapers.",57
633,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The same thing happens every day.,57
634,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I cannot recall to mind any similar complication. At any rate, I am not going to subject the Treasurer to the humiliation to which he has referred, and I regret that the honourable member for withdraw mine. Parramatta has not withdrawn - his amendment. Had he done so he would have simplified the position.",57
635,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,G o o n ; I can stand it all while the honourable member climbs down.,57
636,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am not climbing down. I still occupy the position that I originally took up, but I may say at once that I think the honourable member, by adhering to his amendment, has caused the last hour and a half to be wasted.",57
637,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,If the member is going to talk like that he will not be permitted to withdraw his amendment.,57
638,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I do not intend to withdraw my amendment except on the understanding that I have an opportunity to again submit it. The honourable member knows perfectly well that the second part of my amendment meets the object he has in view. If he desires a straight-out vote he has only to vote against it , and the effect of such a vote would be just the same so far as he is concerned as if his own amendment were carried. By leave of the Committee I withdraw my amendment.",57
639,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member cannot withdraw his amendment unless the honourable member for Parramatta withdraws that moved by him.,57
640,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [6.14] - I do not know that I ought to do so after what has been said. Am I to be submitted to a lot of abuse and then to be asked to accommodate these same honourable members ? The honourable member for Coolgardie, after asserting that I am responsible for the trouble that has occurred, wishes leave to withdraw his amendment, whilst the Treasurer for the last hour has been throwing out all sorts of insinuations. I know what is the matter. It is just as well that it should be publicly stated that the Treasurer fears that the feeling on the part of some of the members of the Labour party against the big daily newspapers will lead to the duty originally proposed by him being carried if they are kept together. That is at the bottom of the trouble. It is a sinister move on the part, not of the Opposition, but of honourable members opposite to get the old duty through when it is tied together.",57

646,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Yes .,57
647,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"In that case I appear to the Government, before a division is taken, to say something in defence of their proposals.. So much is due to those of us who are ranging ourselves with them, assuming that, as the duty has been proposed, there is some particular reason for it. A large number of members have voted for revenue and protective duties, and are now backing out, although the big newspaper proprietors are as well able to pay a duty as are those upon, whom they have been piling up taxation. As a matter of fact, even the Postmaster-General would faint if this duty were carried.

Pianos have been placed in one of the ante-chambers which we have been accustomed to use for the interviewing of our constituents and friends. Having been ousted from that apartment, we are now compelled to use the lobby for the purpose. I do not complain of that so much as I do of the fact that when one sits down to the study of the Tariff in the Opposition room, he is annoyed by the noise to which I refer. Honourable members should jealously guard their privileges, and especially those which are designed to facilitate the discharge of their functions within the precincts of this building. I ask you, Mr. Chairman, to take notice of this complaint, and get rid of the nuisance. Several honourable members have spoken to me about the matter.",58
649,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I shall see that it is attended to. Paragraph, as amended, agreed to. Amendment (by Mr KNOX) proposed - That the following new paragraph be inserted : 29 - "" DD. On and after ioth December, 190714 Printing n.e.i., free.""",58
650,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Bendigo) [6.28] 15 I think that the amendment should be AVKS. carried. Under the old Tariff the Customs authorities had great trouble in determining whether imported printing paper was to be used for the printing of newspapers or for other purposes. The best thing to do is to make all printing paper free.,58
651,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Is the amendment in order, since its effect would be the same as that of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Moreton, with which the Committee has dealt?",58

653,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.3o to 7.45 p.m. PAIRS.,58
654,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [7.45] - We should know exactly what is covered by the amendment. It seems to me that, in accordance with their policy, the Government should be prepared to do something to encourage the local paper mills. I believe the proposed new paragraph would cover all kinds of paper, because there is hardly any limit to the variety of paper which is used for printing. The new magazine known as the Native Companion is, I understand, printed on paper made in Geelong.",58
655,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is the Lone Hand also printed on Geelong paper?,58
656,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I could not say, though I am aware that the people connected with that magazine strongly advocate protection. In the case of the Native Companion, however, I am able to say that the editor, writers, and artists are all Australians, and the paper used is manufactured in Australia. I think the amendment should not be accepted. It is too much of a drag-net, since it would cover paper used for the printing of books, magazines, and job printing, as well as for the printing of newspapers. If we do not give some encouragement to the local manufacturers of paper we cannot expect any development of that industry, although, as we make greater progress in forestry, we shall probably grow timber from which pulp can be obtained for the manufacture of paper: The proposed new paragraph would cover every kind of paper except that specially mentioned in paragraph w-writin g paper and paper for typewriting. I should like to hear the views of the Treasurer on the amendment.",58
657,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [7.50] - I think the honourable member is quite right in asking these questions. I believe the proposed paragraph would be found to be too much of a drag-net, and the honourable member has given excellent reasons why it should be opposed. We have paper mills, in which paper used for these purposes is at present being manufactured. I think the Committee has gone very far already in allowing printing paper to be admitted free. This is a serious matter for those who have established and are carrying on the manufacture of paper in the Commonwealth. I think the Committee should be prepared to give them encouragement and support. Proposed new paragraph agreed to. Paragraph E. Writing (plain), cut less than 16 in. x 13 in., ad. val., 15 per cent.",59
658,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [7.55]-- I think the Government might just as well eliminate this paragraph. The quantity of this paper imported in 1906 amounted in value to only ^308. There is an anomaly in this division to which I should like to direct the attention of the Treasurer. It will be found that, although this paper is dutiable at 15 per cent., writing and typewriting paper identical with it is dutiable under paragraph (w) at only 5 per cent. Some of this paper is used for the printing of the better class of circulars. I-do not know how the Customs officials are to administer a Tariff of this kind. It seems to me that they would require to have an expert constantly at hand, and even then 1 should say there would be great difficulty in deciding what paper should be admitted at the lower duty and what at the higher duty. I suggest that the Treasurer should postpone this paragraph until we reach paragraph (w), and then deal with the papers contained in both at the same time.",59
659,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Trea surer) [7.58] - The object of this paragraph is to secure that the cutting of the paper shall be done here.,59
660,Mr MAHON,Unknown,That is no argument at all. The cutting would be done by machinery.,59
661,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That is why it is proposed that this paper should be dutiable at 15 per cent.,59
662,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That cannot be, because it refers to paper 16 in. x 13 in., and the same paper is referred to in paragraph w, where it would be dutiable at 5 per cent.",59
663,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I was going to say that I think the paper included in paragraph w should also be dutiable at 15 per cent.,59
664,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"In one case the reference is to paper ""cut less "" and in the other to paper ""not less"" than 16 in. x 13 in.",59
665,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That is so.,59
666,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How much work would this give in Australia?,59
667,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I suppose thai it would give a considerable amount of work. I know the intention is to secure that the cutting of the paper shall be done here. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 15 per cent., which is the same as the duty under the-old Tariff, and that is also the dutyproposed by the Government in this Tariff . There is, therefore, no alteration in this case. I admit that there is something in the contention of the honourable member for Coolgardie that the two kinds of paper should be on the same basis.",59
668,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Was this a separate line in the last Tariff ?,59
669,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Apparentl y it was. I have not inquired.,59
670,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [8.1] - In the old Tariff these items were the same as they stand in this. It was provided that writing paper cut less than 16 x 13 inches, and paper (toilet) in rolls or packets, should be dutiable at 15 per cent., while writing and typing paper' in sheets not less than 1.6 x 13 inches was free. These two provisions relating to writing paper are reproductions of the old Tariff, involving no alteration except in the latter case the 5 per cent, general Tariff. The reason for the discrimination is that it is thought desirable to encourage the importation of writing paper in bulk in order that the cutting up may be done here, so giving a considerable amount of labour in the Commonwealth. The one is comparatively the raw material.",59
671,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Did the Commission make inquiries as to what labour would involved ?,60
672,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"We had no suging gestion one way or the other. We merely recommended the reproduction of the"" Tariff.",60
673,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Parramatta) [8.2] - It is a great pity that the Commispaper sion did not make a simple inquiry of that letter. kind.,60
674,Mr FULLER,Unknown,No one came before us.,60

One or two men and a machine doing nothing else but cutting the paper would up enough for the whole Commonwealth. One hesitates to interfere with old duties, but if ever there was a case made out for That seems to be an anomaly. that interference it is this one. It does not give any employment, and is only other instance of many which we have already had under review, in ters, while pretending to impose duties in order to bring into being great national dustries, are taxing the whole of the people of the Commonwealth for the purpose of tryincr to bring into operation a small dental process.",60

691,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [8. n] - The Treasurer is consolidating the two classes of this paper as distinguished in the old Tariff, and he should consolidate the old duties also by accepting a compromise of 20 per cent.",61

In 1906 the imports from the United Kingdom amounted to 12,000 cwt., and from other countries to 78,000 cwt.",61
695,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Melbourne Ports) [8.17] - I should like to see carpet-felt paper included in this paragraph.,61
696,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,That paper is dealt with in paragraph K.,61
697,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"But the duties on the papers in paragraph K are not so high as the duties imposed in the paragraph under discussion. This paper is made here in large quantities from any sort of pulp, and its manufacture ought to be adequately protected. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [8.18] One reason for not including carpet-felt paper in this item is that the papers already included, and those proposed to be added by the Minister, are largely the raw material of the paper-bag manufacturing industry. Carpet-felt paper, so far as I know, is not the raw material of any industry. The carpet-felt paper is simply used as imported, whereas the papers which are included are closely related to those comprised in paragraph j . I call attention to the fact that the duty on paper bags is considerably lower than the duty on raw material; and I should like to move that the duties be reduced to 3s. 6d. and 3s. as in the old Tariff. In order to preserve the paper-bag industry, which employs a much larger number of people.than is employed in the making of the paper itself, it is necessary to leave a margin of at least 2s. per cwt. in the duty. I have a letter here from a firm which is largely engaged in the manufacture of paper bags, and as it is short, and puts the case very clearly, I shall read itI t is So far as we are concerned, we have been working quite satisfactorily under the old Tariff of 3s. per cwt. duty on paper, and 5s. per cwt. on bags; and we think any addition to the duty unnecessary. There are, so far as COOK) we know, only two paper mills working in Australia, employing, on a liberal estimate, perhaps 100 hands. A - fair price for paper, such as is used for sugar bags, which form a considerable portion of their output, is 7s. per cwt. f.o.b. London: The freight and charges, exclusive of duty, average about 4s. per cwt., so that, with the old duty of 3s. per cwt., the total charges amount fo 7s., giving the local mills a protection of too per cent. If the duty is made 6s., as proposed, the protection will amount to 143 per cent. In the paper-bag business alone, there are a far larger number of hands employed than in the two paper mills. According to the proposed Tariff, our raw material, paper, is to have its duty doubled-thoug h a large portion of it must be imported in any case-in order to give an unnecessarily high protection to the papermakers. That it is unnecessarily high is shown by the fact that a paper mill was run for many years in New South Wales without any protection. We hope, therefore, you will see your way to assist in having the duty on paper, -'Brown sugar (grey, blue and other tints) and Fruit Bag Paper,"" reduced to the old rate of 3s. per cwt. Far more serious to us than the increase in duty on paper is the alteration of the duty on paper bags. This was formerly 5s. per cwt., which allowed us a margin of 2s. per cwt. over the protection of 3s. on paper. This is now altered to 25 per cent, on English manufactured bags, and 30 per cent, on foreign. What is the result? Grey and brown sugar bags, which form the larger proportion of our, and many other, manufacturers' output can be bought in London at from 8s. to ios. per cwt,; 50 that the duty on these will be reduced from 5s. per cwt. to 2s. to 2s. 6d. less than half, while the duty on paper, of which they are made, is to be doubled, viz., raised from 3s. to 6s. per cwt. The result of this will be to do away with the present protection both to the paper mills and the paper-bag makers; as, unless the mills reduce their present prices, which they say they cannot afford to do, it will pay the makers of such bags better to stop making and import, thus throwing a large number of hands out of employment. We should suggest that, as the present Tariff has worked satisfactorily, the duties on paper and bags should be as before, 3s. and 5s: - per cwt. respectively; but if this cannot be secured, at least the duty on bags should be at a fixed rate per cwt., as that on paper is, not ad valorem; and that the same proportion should be maintained between the two as under :Old Tariff (1901) ... ... 3s. If increased is. on paper ... 4s. If increased 2s. on paper ... 5s. If increased 3s. on paper as proposed ... ... 6s.",61
698,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I have a memorandum here to move that the duties bags be increased to us. and ios.,62
699,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"I do not know what protection the duty gives maker of paper. My proposal would give continued employment to a large number recommendation. in the bag-making industry, and would, I imagine, though, personally, I do not per cent. know, give some protection, at all events, to the paper-making industry. From the point of view of the employment given, paper-bag industry is much more imupon portant than the paper-making industry; and it is necessary, therefore, that former should have this modicum of proin tection. There is a further passage letter, as followsIt is important to note in this connection, 6s. per cwt. on paper was the rate of the old Victorian Tariff previous to 1901, and that in that Tariff the duty onpapeT bags was ios. per cwt., the same as we now suggest, in event of the 6s. duty being retained on paper. If it is necessary to raise the duty in the case of the paper-making industry, it is duties -' . also necessary, in the interests of the general community, and of a large number of workers, that the duties in connection with the paper-bag making industries should be proportionately raised.",62
700,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [8.29] - We ought to have more information to justify the doubling of the duty on the raw material of the paper-bag maker. I desire to see some protection given to the papermaking industry, but we have heard nothing to show that more than the old duty is necessary. It is very clear that if the duty be so excessive as to make importation the more advantageous, the industry will not be encouraged. We ought £0 have some information from the Treasurer to justify us in doubling the existing rate of duty.",62
701,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Hume-Trea surer) [8.30] - I explained just now that when we come to deal with the' question of bags I intend to propose increased duties.,62
702,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,That will have the effect of increasing the price of bags.,62
703,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not think that it will. If the bag-makers get a larger measure of protection the bags will Paper. Bags, not be any dearer than they are now. The per cwt. per cwt. Government have merely adopted the re5 - od. s commendation of the A section of the Tariff 6s. 8d. Commission. 8s. 4d. Mr WILSON - That section does not reios. od. commend a duty of ios. per cwt. upon bags.",62
704,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It recommends on a duty of 6s. per cwt. upon browns and sugar and fruit bag paper ,62
705,Mr WILSON,Unknown,What is its recommendato the tion in regard to bags?,62
706,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It has made no,62
707,Mr WILSON,Unknown,It has recommended 25,62
708,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It stands to reason that if - we increase the duty upon the the paper we must also increase the duty bags. The proposal that I have promised to submit is rendered necessary by the the fact that we must preserve a margin favour of those who' desire to manufacin the ture bags in the Commonwealth.,62
709,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,But why in that crease the duty upon paper so enormously ?,62
710,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Honourable members are discussing this question a. the little bit prematurely. Let us first insert the words which I have already proposed.,62
711,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Then we can reduce the .,62
712,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,We are not going to reduce them.,63
713,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Darling) [8.33] - The Committee has already rejected a .proposal to extend any protection to paper manufacturers in respect of certain other lines. This class of paper is being made here under the pperation of a duty of 3s. per cwt. Yet the Government now propose to increase that rate to 6s. per cwt. without assigning any reason whatever for their action.,63
714,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I will give the honourable member a reason.,63
715,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The honourable member is not the Treasurer. To say that because the duty upon paper has been raised to 6s. per cwt. we must necessarily increase the rate upon bags to ios. per cwt., is no answer to my question - I should like to hear the honourable member for Bendigo, who was Chairman of the Tariff Commission, throw some light upon this subject. To me it does not appear that any reason has been assigned for increasing the duty upon paper from 3s. to 6s. per cwt.",63
716,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [8.35] - I think that 6s. per cwt. is rather a high impost to levy upon this class of paper. If the first amendment be defeated I shall be prepared to move that the duty under the general Tariff be 5s. per cwt., and under the preferential Tariff 4s. 6d. per cwt. It is only right that all industries should receive a fair amount of protection. Amendment. (Sir WILLIAM agreed to.",63
717,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,Balaclava) [8.37] - I think that the duties proposed upon the paper enumerated in this paragraph are too high. In this connection we have to consider the interests of the small shopkeepers. I know that in Victoria the industry of bagmaking has been a remunerative one under the old rates. But confectioners have complained that they are unable to sell their goods at a reasonable profit on account of the increase in the duty upon bags.  lollies.,63
718,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"But under the Government proposal the duty upon paper-bags will be far heavier than that upon sweets. Consequently, if confectioners weigh the basis with the sweets they will lose money.  get lollies for 6s. 6d. per cwt. ?",63
719,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"But the bags made from this class of paper weigh very heavy. By agreeing to the Government proposal we shall be placing upon the retailers a charge which they will not be able to pass on to their customers. Consequently it will f all very heavily upon the small men. I would further point out that very few paper-bags are imported. The total value of our imports under this heading is only about £ 3 , 0 0 0 annually. If we increase the duty upon bags to 4s. 6d. per cwt. under the general Tariff, and to 4s. per cwt. under the Tariff for the United Kingdom-a n increase of 50 per cent - I am sure that that will be sufficient.",63
720,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [8.39] - I would point out that in 1906 we imported 4,542 tons of brown sugar paper of the value of .£65,920, and during the first six months of the present year we imported 2,419 tons, valued at .£34,853. It will thus be seen that we annually import nearly £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 worth, of this paper. That fact in itself-seein g that we have mills in every State of the Commonwealth capable of producing this particular paper-demon strates that the existing duty is not sufficiently high. Of course, if we increase the duty upon paper it will be necessary to increase that upon bags. In New Zealand the duty upon brown sugar paper is 7s. 6d. per cwt., and that upon bags n s . 3d. per cwt. The Treasurer's proposals, therefore, are less than the New Zealand rates. In view ""of the fact that this class of paper can be manufactured in every State, the Committee may very well assent to those proposals. LYNE'S) Mr WILSON (Corangamite) [8.41I The question of the duty upon paper-bags is one that seriously affects a large number of deserving persons throughout the Commonwealth. It affects shopkeepers, confectioners, grocers and others who have to give away these bags with the goods that they sell.",63
721,Mr STORRER,Unknown,They do not give them away; they weigh them in with the goods.,63
722,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"In many cases they do not. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has argued in favour of absolute prohibition. Because paper-bags are imported he declares that we ought to raise the duty upon them to such a point as would exclude them. That is no argument for the advancement of the country. It is a positively ridiculous statement. We must permit a certain amount of competition, otherwise the industry, will be injured. Under the old rate of 3s. per cwt. this brown sugar paper has been manufactured in the Commonwealth. We have also been manufacturing the bags. able member for Brisbane has pointed out, there must.be a considerable differentiation between the duty upon paper and that upon bags, because the former is the raw material of the bag-makers. have made the raw material of industries dutiable at 15 per cent. ment, however, now propose a duty of 6s. 6d. per cwt. upon the raw material and duties of only 30 and 25 per cent, upon the finished product.",63
723,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The Treasurer has notified his intention to move for an increase of those ad valorem rates.,64
724,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"When the honourable member for Darling asked him what was the recommendation of the Tariff Commission in respect of bags, what did our cunning Treasurer do? He looked at his Tariff, noticed that the Commission had recommended a duty of only 25 per cent.., and accordingly remained silent upon the point. I noticed a twinkle in his eye as he observed the recommendation of 25 per cent., but he would not tell the honourable member for Darling that the A section of the Tariff Commission had recommended a duty of 6s. per cwt. on the raw material of the bag manufacturer, and that the duty on the finished bags should be reduced by one-half.",64
725,Sir WILLIAMLVNE,Unknown,Is the honourable member going to help us to wipe out the anomaly ?,64
726,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"I want to show the honourable gentleman where the are. Is it not an anomaly that the A section of the Tariff Commission should recommend that the duty on raw material should be increased by 100 per cent., the duty on the finished bags decreased 50 per cent. ? Obviously, it shows that they did not consider the relationship tween the two items, and in the circumpaper stances the Committee should pause before it accepts either recommendation. I that the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava, that the duty should be at 4s. 6d. and 4s. per cwt., is a. fair promise, and if the Treasurer is not pared to accept that he is very greedy. Surely he cannot expect us to double the duty on the bags? If we did so, it would do harm to a very large number of serving persons.",64
727,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Why does not the hona orable member support the recommendation of the Tariff Commission? As the honor- Mr WILSON - If I did I would be voting to bring about an anomaly, the very thing I was elected to prevent. I am surprised at the honourable member trying to lead me astray. I trust that he will Hitherto we yet look into the matter, and see that the duties on the papers for bag-making and The Govern- the bags are properly adjusted one to the other.",64
728,Mr DUGALDTHOMS ON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [8.49] - A large proportion of these bags are imported and are made of a paper which our mills do not make. I have received from the trade a communication, in which this passage occursIt does not seem to us that any beneJit will result by putting such a heavy impost on bag papers. Paper known as "" k r a f f t"" is generally used for this jjurpose, and cannot be made in Australia. Krafft paper is only made in northern Europe. Thousands of tons are sent annually to the United States, showing that it cannot be made even in America, neither is it made in England. We are asked to put a tremendous impost on that paper. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said that in New Zealand the duty on paper is 7s. 6d. per cwt., but I think that he has made a mistake.",64
729,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,No ; that will come into force in February.,64
730,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No . I have a copy of the Tariff which has just been passed; and I find that the duty on paper bags, not paper, is 7s. 6d. per cwt.",64
731,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,No ; it is n s . 3d. per anomalies cwt. on paper bags.,64
732,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Ite m 156 in the New Zealand Tariff reads- "" Paper bags, coarse, including sugar bags, 7s. 6d. and per cwt."" In New Zealand, as in Ausby tralia, the larger quantity of the imported bags is made of a paper which is not made belocally, and also a'large proportion of the which is imported for bag-making is not made locally. So in item 156 of its think Tariff New Zealand imposes a duty of 7s. 6d. per cwt. on "" paper bags, coarse, fixed including sugar bags,"" and in item 157 a comduty of 5s. per cwt. on paper, that is, prewrapping paper of all kinds; while in , item 165 it levies a duty of 25 per cent, on !! paper hags n.o.e..."" namely, all but the coarse paper bags, on which the duty of de7s. 6d. per cwt. is fixed. The Parliament of New Zealand recognised thai large proportion of the paper which i? imported for the bags cannot be made within the Dominion. Nor can it be made in Australia. That largely accounts for our importations of a peculiar paper which, while light, is yet strong and tough. I agree with honourable members that the relationship of these duties is not fair to the manufacturer of bags; and although I am a free-trader I object more to a protection that protects the outside manufacturer than to a protection which protects the inside manufacturer. This duty is a protection to the outside manufacturer. Under a duty of 3s. per cwt. the mills have been turning out a large quantity of these papers, and no reason has been given why the duty should be increased. I shall vote for the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Brisbane, and try to get the duty on the paper brought as nearly as I can to the old rate. After that I shall vote proportionately as regards the duty on the paper bags. We ought to recognise, as in New Zealand, that it is only the coarser paper for bags which is made here, and that there is a certain quality which is not even made in America or Great Britain, but is imported largely to those countries for making bags.  received a copy of the circular which in October last wasaddressed to the Minister of Trade and Customs by the South Australian Master Printers' and Allied Trades' Association. They point out that "" white sulphide"" and ""krafft brown"" papers, which are largely used in Australia, are not made locally. They also mention that sugar paper' in grey blue and other tints costs about £ 9 per ton in the ""Old Country, suggest that a duty of 6s. 6d. on the Home cost is unreasonable, and show that a duty of 3s. per cwt. gives a protection of 33J per cent, to the mills. They further state that the Australian mills make only a few grades of paper, and that there is a large quantity of paper which must be imported in the interests of the makers of paper bags. They submit that a duty of 3s. per cwt. is ample in the case of fruit bags, sugar bags, or brown bags. They allege that the old duty gave ample protection. If the Committee impose a duty of 6s. 6d. per cwt. on material which costs from jQZ to j£g a ton, it will be prohibitive, and do considerable injury to the manufacturers of paper bags. On the other hand, if the Committee increase the duty on the bags it will penalize the users of them, especially so if the material cannot be made, or is being made, in Australia. It will become a revenue duty, which must be passed on. The only sensible plan is to reduce the duty on the first item, and leave a fair margin to the bag-makers.",64
733,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Does the honourable member mean to say that this paper cannot be made in Australia?  made, not by me, but by the South Australian Master Printers' and Allied Trades' Association, who surely should know what they are talking about. It must be patent to honourable members that a reduction of the duty is necessary.",65
734,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [8.58] - In 1901 the original duty imposed on this item was 6s. per cwt In Victoria the duty was 6s.; in New Zealand it was 5s., and pretty well the same proportion was maintained in Canada and the United States. I intend to propose that the duty on brown paper be 5s. in the general Tariff and 4s. 6d. in the preferential Tariff, as suggested by the honourable member for Bass. And when we come to deal with bags, I intend to propose an addition of 2s. per cwt. on each item, in order to give about the same protection ;is is given in New Zealand. That will reduce the duty on each item to that which was intended or proposed. After listening to the debate, it seems to me that a proportion should be maintained. The duty of 6s. 6d. per cwt. as proposed was, perhaps, a little too high. . Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Fi x the duties in the paragraph at 4s. 6d. and 4s.",65
735,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No ; I prefer the duties to be fixed at 5s. and 4s. 6d., and on the other two items I intend to propose that the duties lie fixed at 7 s. and 6s. 6d. per cwt., which will be lower than the rate in New Zealand. I am reminded that these papers are being made in Australia.",65
736,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,No .,65
737,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am informed that they are being made both in Melbourne and Sydney. I think that I am treating the Committee very fairly in agreeing to duties below the present rates in New Zealand in both cases.,65
738,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,Why does not the Minister accept the proposal of the honourable member for Balaclava that the duties be 4s. 6d. and4s. ?,65
739,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Why should we make our rates lower than that of New not Zealand and lower than the old Victorian rate, which was 6s. ?",65

741,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No , it has not.",66
742,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"Oxley) [9.2] The duties as proposed in the Tariff are 6s. 6d. and 6s., which are extraordinarily high. The Treasurer-has agreed to them to 5s. and 4s. 6d. But he might reasonably accept the amendment honourable member for Balaclava.",66
743,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Our duty ought to be higher than that of New Zealand.,66
744,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"What have we on behalf to do with New Zealand ? A short time ago a committee of commercial men was appointed in Sydney to report on various matters connected with the Tariff. In their report on this particular matter they say-'The proposed tax of 6s. 6d. per cwt. against 3s. per cwt. in the old Tariff is centage that is altogether out of proportion to even the requirements of the manufacturers. On some papers it means a duty of 75 cent.; and is a prohibitive duty on an mous quantity of bag-making paper that cannot possibly be made in the Commonwealth. It also tends to place the ordinary bag-maker solutely' at the mercy of the paper merchant and the paper manufacturer; the latter ally (in lines that he can manufacture), is to quote his made bags at a price which, when compared with his quotations to the bag-maker for. paper, leaves the latter no option but go out of the business. Three shillings cwt. should be an ample duty on these lines. No bag-making papers are imported from Great Britain. I will gladly vote for the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member Balaclava, although I had intended to hours. support that suggested by the honourable member for Brisbane.",66
745,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Corio) [9.5] - The honexist in the orable member for Brisbane made a great mistake in saying that these goods cannot be made in Australia.

746,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"Not all of Some of them cannot even be made in the United States, and have to be imported from Great Britain.",66
747,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"That is a dreadful effect thing ! A little while ago they could manufacture eucalyptus oil in the United States, but was that a reason why we should not make it in Australia? Because America cannot manufacture an article, that a reason why Australia cannot? know that these goods are made in Geelong, and I believe that they arealso made in Sydney. The South Australian printers, whose opinion has been quoted by the orable member for Grey, are blind to what is being done in Australia. ' We do not find the Victorian Printers' Association, who live on the spot where the goods are manufactured, saying that they cannot be made here. They recommend the acceptreduce ance of the proposed duties.",66
748,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,The duties do not of the affect the printers a bit.,66
749,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"If the duties do not affect the printers, why was such an appeal made by the honourable member for Grey of the South Australian printers, who are asking that the duties shall be reduced? The honourable member for North Sydney has said that we should not protect outsiders. I agree with him. I urge the Government to allow the duty to remain as as it stands, and to increase the duty on a perbags to about double what is at present proposed. I wish to appeal to those who per are in favour of good wages being paid, enorand short hours of labour worked, to support these duties. We. have lately had an abexample of the good effects of the new protection, which honourable members opposite especiseem glad to talk about without doing able much to promote when they have an opportunity. In consequence of the imposition to of these duties the mills of Geelong have per been .able to reduce the hours of labour from sixty per week to forty-eight without a reduction of the wages of the workmen, and I am glad to be able to publicly state that the directors have promised nie that for that shall be a permanent reduction of",66

The witness consequently claimed consideration against this fierce competition. He particularly drew attention, to the fact that this printing paper, which we have made free, and which is made free under the character and in the name of printing paper, is often brought into use as wrapping paper. I should like the Minister to consult his officers about this question, and to see whether some strict definition of.printing paper cannot be introduced into the Tariff. I think that it is possible to provide that free printing paper should not be allowed to be used as paper for wrapping purposes. I also think that the manufacturers should receive consideration for their wrapping paper. In the meantime, I am disposed to think, on re-perusing the evidence, that 6s. per cwt. for these papers is too high. I am disposed to accept .the Minister's suggestion, and to bring it down a little.",67

It shows that the imported paper can be sold at £ 2 per ton less than the price of the locally-manufactured paper.

Although I do not wish to occupy the time of the Comstate mittee unduly, I am in a position to that the local manufacturer of strawboard, notwithstanding his promise to the Tariff Commission not to increase the price that article if the duty were increased, increased it to an amount equivalent to increase in the duty; that he either cannot Kingdom. or will not supply the local demands; that he has a monopoly; and that very few hands employed in the manufacture of strawboard, the article being almost entirely by machinery. In short, can make out a good case for the reduction for which I ask.",69
778,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Is not one of the biggest users of strawboard located in the Cook electorate ?,69
779,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Yes . One of largest makers of cardboard boxes, of which strawboard is the raw material, is established in my electorate. The old of is. per cwt. was equivalent to an ad move.valorem rate of 25 per cent, while the proposed duty of 2s. 6d. per cwt. is equivalent to 62J per cent. But under the old cwt. rate the local manufacturer was able to increase his output; and that he large margin of profit' is shown by the fact that, when the Tariff Commission were taking evidence, he was selling strawboard in Sydney at the price at which he sold it in Melbourne, notwithstanding freight charges amounting to 16s. per ton,, and other charges bringing up the total to £ per ton. If the Treasurer will meet me this matter, I shall be glad. I make the request as one who has given him a good deal of support in connection with the Tariff.",69
780,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member must not bargain.,69
781,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"There has been, a good deal of bargaining already. Members of the Opposition have declared that, order to prevent undue discussion, and enable us to return to our homes by Christstrawboard mas, they would accept what they termed - a fair thing; and now I , who have given the Government support, ask that in matter in which I am very much concerned the Treasurer will grant a request for a reduction. If he will meet me in this matter, I shall sit down, but, if not, I shall be I compelled to show the Committee what a to strong case there is for reducing the pro",69
782,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I cannot come down to the old duty.,69
783,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Then I had better the case as it appears to me. Although show the Government propose a preference to Great Britain, in 1906, as a reference to page 4957 of Volume XXXIV . of Hansard of will show, both he and the honourable memhas ber for South Sydney agreed that strawthe board is practically not made in the United",69
784,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It is not really; there are that is, not very much.",69
785,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"No . Consequently made we may dismiss the proposed preference I in favour of Great Britain as likely to be inoperative, and we can regard the duty for all practical purposes as that set down in the general Tariff, namely, 2s. 6d. per cwt.",69
786,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Will the honourable member accept a duty of is. 6d. per cwt. ? the Mr JH CATTS - If the Minister will come down to is. 6d. per cwt, which is nearly half the rate proposed, I shall reduty sume my seat; but,, before doing so, I That after the figures "" 2s. 6d.,"" the words "" and on and afteT ioth December, 1907, per (General Tariff), is. 6d.,"" be inserted'i and after the figures ""2s.,"" the words ""and on and after roth December, 1907, per cwt.

787,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Svdney) [9.41] - Eve n from the point of view of the local manufacturer of strawboard, there can be no justification for the duties proposed by the Government. We were told when the old duty of is. per cwt. was 1 agreed to that it would have the effect of in closing the factory; but, as a matter of fact, the business has developed and extended so as to give no logical or sufficient reason for even a small increase in the duty. The Treasurer has intimated that he is willing to agree, to a duty 50 per cent, higher than the old rate; but I do not think that we should accept that offer. It must be remembered that, while only a in comparatively small number of hands are to employed in the one mill which makes here, many hundreds are employed in the factories which use it. The preference to Great Britain is a mere prea tence, . and the Minister is prepared to abolish it, knowing as he does that, practically, strawboard is not made in the United Kingdom. The old rate of duty was equivalent to 25 per cent, on unlined strawboard, to 20 per cent, on ""strawboard lined on one side, and to 15 per cent, on strawboard lined on both sides. That information is given in answer fo question 93,689 of the Tariff Commission's evidence. It is true that Mr MCDougall, the manufacturer, said that in some instances the duty was equivalent to only 12 per 1 cent., but he can have referred only to board lined on both sides with glazed paper. The duty of is. 6d. at present proposed is an Increaseof 50 per cent, on the old Tariff, and will make the figures 37 per cent, on unlined 1 strawboard, 30 per cent, on strawboard lined on one side, and 22J per cent, on strawboard lined on both sides. That must have a serious effect on the users of this material. It represents' a very considerable increase on a line which is the raw material of an industry which must supply its manufactures at a cheap rate if they are to be used at all. They are used as a substitute for paper wrapping, and they will not be used unless they are sold at a rate which will bring them within measurable distance of the price of paper. The Broadford mills, which are the only mills manufacturing strawboard, are in the hands of a combination consisting of two companies who pooled their assets, and who have a monopoly. I allude to that not as an attack upon them, but in order to show that the company has every opportunity to take full advantage of any"" duty that may be imposed. I do not object to a monopoly properly conducted, but I object to passing a duty for the benefit of a monopoly, which, because it has no competition to contend with, is able to take full advantage of that duty, when ho good reason can be shown for its imposition, and when it is clear it will injure another industry. Those interested in the Broadford mills form part of a paper mill combine. I am assured that they have formed a combine, can fix their own prices, and in that way also take every advantage of any duty imposed. I understand that sales of their papers, not strawboard, in Queensland and New South Wales are allotted to one company, and sales in Victoria and"" South Australia to another, and they have agreed as to the prices they shall give for their raw material. There might be no objection to such an arrangement if it were reasonably conducted, and without: State assistance, but when we are asked to give this industry assistance by means of the Tariff we have a right to ask whether it is needed, and whether it will be good for other industries. The' statements I have made will be found to be borne out by the evidence submitted by the Tariff Commission. Freight and charges on the imported article amount to over 50 per cent. That in itself is surely a large protection, strawand yet we are asked to give from 22J per cent, to 37 per cent. more. In this 1 case we have not to ask whether the price will be raised as the result of the imposition of the duty, because the price has already been raised by 30s. a ton, and advantage has therefore already been taken of the increased duty. It is true that Mr MCDougall, for the company, said that if some of the duties on the raw materials of the industry were reduced they would hot raise their price.",69
788,Mr HARPER,Unknown,The cost of straw is very much higher than it was.,70
789,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Those risks were pointed out when Mr MCDougall was before the Tariff Commission.,70
790,Mr HARPER,Unknown,The cost of straw has risen since that time. .,70
791,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,A director of the concern made a very stupid promise to the Tariff Commission which has not beenfulfilled. He said that if they got an increased duty they would agree not to raise the price.,70
792,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Was that promise made without any qualification?,70
793,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Yes , it was pointed out to him that it was a dangerous promise to make, because the price of his raw material might go up, and he said he would take that risk and give the promise. The promise has not been fulfilled. There has been no increase in the duties upon the raw materials of the industry which would justify the increase in the price of strawboard, whilst the duty has been taken off dextrine and has been lowered in the case of other materials. The effect of the proposed duty is shown in this way. I have here a carton for a candlemaker which would be dutiable at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. Mr HU ME COOK - Pape r for candle cartons has been made dutiable at 5s. and 4s. 6d. per cwt. under paragraph G.",70
794,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I am not dealing with this carton as specially used by candle manufacturers. It might be used for other purposes.,71
795,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,If empty it would come in under item 353A.,71
796,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That is the so, and it would be dutiable at 30 per cent, in the General Tariff and 25 per cent, imported from the United Kingdom. do not remember the wording of the alterathis tion the Treasurer has made in paragraph G, but it would not affect such packets this carton, which would come under item 353A. Now, what has the carton-maker to pay? On the strawboard alone he would have to pay, according to the duty proposed by the Government, 37",71
797,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,That is if the duty is 2s. 6d. per cwt.,71
798,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No . The percentage of duty would be from 62 per the cent, to 37$ per cent., at the 2s. 6d. and rates. But taking the duty at is. fid. a cwt., as I have shown, the percentages duty would be 37 per cent., 30 per cent, and 22 per cent, for strawboard unlined, per ton. 1 lined on one side, and lined on both sides respectively, so that the maker of the carfreight war. ton would actually pay more on unlined strawboard imported for its manufacture than the duty charged on the unlined strawheard board made up in the form of the cartpn I produce. That is a serious matter for those engaged in the business, and yet that would be the condition of affairs brought, about by the proposal now made. I think the Minister will see that we should not impose a duty in excess of that imposed under the old Tariff. Under the operation of that Tariff the single factory panded, and presumably there was reason for it in the results achieved. a great deal more about this, but I do not wish to delay the Committee. I trust Minister will reduce his demand to the rare treated. of the old duty. No reason has been shown for increasing, whilst good reason has been shown for retaining it.  is one thing which more than another should induce the Committee to revert to the old' duty on this item, it is the action which has been taken by the local manufacturer of this effect- strawboard. When this gentleman was beEmployers fore the Tariff Commission he was emphatic hours from voluntarily jn his assertion that if he could get an indaily pay. creased duty there would be no increase the price of locally-made strawboard.",71
799,Mr COON,Unknown,"He .was only one.  tioned, and it was suggested that that was a rash promise to make. Still he was positive, and said that if he were given an increased duty he would be prepared to enter into a guarantee that he would not increase price of strawboard. As a matter of fact, he has increased his price twice since if he gave that promise. The first increase I was by ios. per ton, and immediately after Tariff was tabled he increased his price by another20s. The Government propose as to fix the duty at is. 6d. per cwt. The old duty represented 25 per cent, on the cost price, and the natural protection 60 per cent., so that under the old duty of is. per cwt. the local manufacturer enjoyed a proper cent. tection of 85 per cent. 1",71
800,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"What does the honourable .member call the natural protection?  article here, which is £ 2 ios. for sailing 1 2s. boats and £ 3 5s. per ton for steamers.",71

805,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"It was done after the last Tariff.  altogether misleading. According to the evidence there are only about twenty hands employed in the industry. Surely a protection of 85 per cent, under the old Tariff is enough. If we are to consider the number of employees, we ought to give greater weight to the claims of the boxmakers, who employ a much larger number of hands than the strawboard-makers do. It looks as if we were to starve a big in- ' dust'ry in order to keep a little local combine going. This firm have had orders on hand for months past, and are unable to execute them. Yet they want a higher duty. There is not a duty proposed in this Tariff that is less warranted, and the Minister knows it. If a duty which, plus the natural protection, amounts to 85 per cent., is not sufficient, then, in all conscience, the industry ought to go under. If it is a question of whether that or the box-making industry, which employs between 3,000 and 4,000 hands, is to go under, then the strawboard-making industry ought to go under. There are ten times as many hands employed in making boxes in South Australia, which is only a part of the Commonwealth, as there are in that industry. We ought also to consider those who use the boxes. The duty has already put the price of the boxes up by from 15 to 20 per cent. What is there about this particular firm, who were so positive when before the Royal Commission that they would not 'increase their price, that this Committee should give them all they ask for, especially in view of the fact that they have increased their prices twice since they made that statement? Their price now has exactly absorbed the whole advantage of the increased duty. it was £ 7 ios., it is now £ 9 . If we were to put on another 50 per cent, duty they would increase their prices proportionatelyThey knocked out all the other small makers, and it is not the function of this Committee to bolster up combines - of that kind, which have no concern about any other business man. This firm would crush any other firm if it got a chance. It has done so already.",72
806,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"The honourable member did not speak in that way in regard to the Standard Oil Trust, which has been trying to crush out the British Imperial Oil Company. He supported it.  ber is just about as correct in that allegation as he was when he asserted positively that I was wrong in saying that discs were not made in Australia. He was satisfied that they were made in his own district, but he afterwards found that they were not made in Australia at all. I was not here when the kerosene item was passed, so how can the honourable member say that I was standing up for the Standard Oil Company ?",72

This strawboard-making firm has increased its prices in face of its own sworn evidence, and the only excuse it gives is that the cost of its raw material has been increased. I defy the members of the firm to point to an increase of more than 3s. 6d. in the value of a ton of their raw material since this Tariff was introduced. . Mr HARPER - Does the honourable member mean t'o say that straw has only increased in price by 3s. 6d. a. ton ?  it is the increase in price of the straw that has led them to raise their prices. They put it down to the other materials used, such as paper for lining, dextrine) &c. Dextrine has been put on the free list.

809,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [10.7] - I do not think that we should be concerned about any foolish statement that a representative of any firm made to the Tariff Commission. If we are to deal with big industries on that basis we shall get very much astray. It was a foolish thing for a man to say, and a foolish thing to ask anybody. If is only fair to state that one of the reasons given since then for the increase of price is the immense rise in the price ofstraw, which is the absolute raw material.",72
810,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,They never gave that as a reason.,73
811,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The firm gave me that as one of the principal reasons. ""We are not here to base our consideration of proposed duties upon statements made by individuals. We should dismiss them altogether. A statement of that kind did not bind the company if they did not wish to keep to it. Nor have we been, so far, in this Tariff, legislating out of consideration for the numbers of persons employed in particular industries. It is said that there is only one factory concerned in this case; but' it is reasonable to assume that if there were large profits in the industry a number of other strawboard factories would have been started in the Commonwealth, because the raw material is obtainable anywhere. There have been other cases where there was only one concern in an industry, but some of us appealed in vain to the Committee for consideration of the much greater number of other people who would be affected. I therefore take it that we might dismiss the argument about the statement which was made and not kept, and a? to which they possibly have an answer, and also the fact that there are not a very large number of hands employed in the industry. What we have to consider*is what is a fair amount of protection to give to the industry, so that it may be carried on at a reasonable profit and in such a way that there may be a fair chance of encouraging competition. I think the 2s. 6d. proposed by the Government is too high. At the same time we have to consider the strawboard makers.",73
812,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,r l have agreed to accept is. 6d.,73
813,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"That would be a fair compromise. I am informed that prior to the last Tariff the condition of the industry was such that the men in this factory offered voluntarily to work for twelve hours a day in order to keep the thing going. That helped their - employers through, and when the last' Tariff was adopted the employers gave them a forty-eight hours' week without any reduction of wages. I believe those are the facts.",73
814,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,That shows that the old duty was sufficient.,73
815,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It only proves that previously without Ihe duty they were unable to carry on. It does not prove that when the duty was imposed in the last Tariff the employers made big profits. We have no evidence as to how much profit they have made, but I take it that there cannot be a great deal in the industry, or there would have been other competitors. There could not be a monopoly in an industry with the raw material so plentiful in every State, but the fact is that there has not been enough in it to induce others to take it up. We have also to consider the"" box-makers, for I am sure that the 2s. 6d. duty first proposed would have been too heavy a burden upon them; but the Committee might fairly accept a duty of is. 6d., and give the strawboard industry the same encouragement as we are giving the other industries.",73
816,Mr HARPER,Unknown,"Mernda) [10.12] - The Broadford factory is in my electorate. . I know something about it, and it is only due to the proprietors that I should state a few facts. The number of employees in the factory is seventy-five, so that it is not a small concern. In addition to those directly engaged in the factory, a large number of people are employed in carting wood and .straw, and the company buy straw, from the farmers. The product is entirely the - result of labour at every point. The honourable member for Lang stated that the firm had recently imported 500 tons of strawboard from.

826,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,But there is a factory in the honourable member's own electorate.,74
827,Mr HARPER,Unknown,"We had reasons for importing strawboard, of which we are large consumers. I am assured by the honourable member for Riverina, who has just inquired, that at no time has strawboard been imported for the Broadford Mills. I merely give the information as it is given to me by people who are in a position to know that the statement made here to-night is not correct ; and I may say, further, that it is not true that the Broadford Mills cannot execute orders. After the last Tariff was settled, the question was whether, under the low duty, the Broadford Mills could be carried on; and I am informed that the employees agreed to work longer hours in order to tide over the trouble, and that no dividend was paid by the company for several years. I have no personal knowledge of these facts, but give them as they have been related to me.",74
828,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Is the imported article the cheaper?,74

I am assured, however, that the supplies are ample for present requirements. nTe. of course; certain kinds of strawboard, which are not produced at the Broadford Mills, and which must be imported whatever duty be imposed. It is only fair that the case for the other side should be laid before honourable members, in view of the many incorrect statements that have been made. I visited the Broadford Mills some time ago, and found that they were largely the support of the town. The employees, who, of' course, reside there with their families, were ready to help their employers in difficult circumstances; but I hear to-night that since the imposition of the new duty the hours have been made forty-eight instead of sixty per week, the latter being the number which the men volunteered to work in the time of trouble. I think the proposal of the Government is a fair compromise, and I intend to support it.",74
830,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [10.20] - The question of strawboard is like "" King Charles' head "" - it is always cropping up. This is the third time this session that we have had a discussion relating to this particular commodity. Whether this is because those interested hope to ultimately arrive at what is substantially prohibition, I do not know; but so sure as any interference with the Tariff is proposed, up comes the question of strawboard. On the two previous occasions, the discussions resulted in the maintenance of the duty of is., which has always been regarded as fair in the case of an article which ought certainly to be easy of manufacture in a place like Australia, where there is plenty of the raw material available at a very cheap rate. Honourable members talk about the price of straw having gone up lately; but I venture to say that it has not gone up to anything like the extent to which it has in the older countries of the world. I have been wondering why the Government have reintroduced this question. On the last occasion, the then Treasurer himself gave the best of all reasons why the proposed duty should not be imposed, and eventually withdrew it on his own motion. It may be, however, that a new Treasurer has promised that the increased duty would be proposed. Reference has been made by the honourable member for Mernda to the fact that the Broadford mill has not been doing particularly well. Can we wonder at that when protectionists of the bright, particular star-colour of the honThere orable member sends to the United Kingdom for his strawboard?",74
831,Mr HARPER,Unknown,I do not do anything of the kind.,74
832,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member said that he has imported some strawboard.,74
833,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Some time ago.,74

835,Mr HARPER,Unknown,My constituents have some sense !,74
836,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am glad to hear that; at any rate, I am sure they have an excellent representative. At the same time, I think that the honourable member might turn his attention to the Broadford mill when he requires strawboard.",74
837,Mr HARPER,Unknown,So I do.,75
838,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am particuTariff larly anxious to hear why the honourable member sent to England for strawboard, and I fancy the reason, if the matter probed to the bottom, is that he found upon the old rate. the imported strawboard to suit his purpose better than the local strawboard. That, of course, is always a legitimate son for preferring one strawboard. another. I have heard that there is great difference in the quality of strawboard, and that for some purposes it is still neceswas sary to import. I presume the honourable member for Mernda had in his mind the smaller sorts of boxes which require particular kind of strawboard that can be turned and twisted into shape. I believe that some strawboard is very brittle, when made into small shapes, has a tendency to break. However, it does occur to me that, with straw as cheap as it in Australia, and considering what, I sume, is the simple process of manufacof ture, we ought to be able, in view natural protection which our isolation affords, to make strawboard equal, at least, to any that can be procured from abroad. This matter was investigated by the Tariff Commission, and I presume that the evidence by Mr MCDougall was well weighed. Why the Chairman of the Tariff Commission should recommend this increase of duty I do not know? I am informed that that the chairman of this company, Mr from Holland MCDougall, told the Tariff Commission ton. that the old rate was equivalent to 12 per1 cent.

I can easily understand that it quite possible for a witness before the Tariff Commission,' without looking ahead, to promise that the price of strawboard a would not be increased. But when the cost of the raw material is increased it is necessary that the duty upon the finished article and, should also be increased.",75
846,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,But Mr MCDougall is promised that he would not increase the preprice of strawboard even though the cost the raw material was increased. of the Mr CHANTER - I do not deny that fact. I am merely pointing out that it is reasonable to suppose that the duty upon the finished article should be increased in proportion to the increase in the cost of the raw material. The honourable member for Grey spoke of the natural protection.which this industry enjoys.

I wish the .Committee to recollect that those engaged in this industry have to compete against the manufacturers of strawboard in Holland who work their employees sixty hours per week, as against forty-eight hours worked by the operatives in the Commonwealth, and who pay them considerably less.",76
851,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,What is the honourable member's authority for that statement?,76
852,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,My authority is the particular company which has established the strawboard factory to which I have already referred.,76
853,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,I have been informed that the wages paid in Holland are £ 2 - ios. per week.,76
854,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"The wages paid in that country, not merely in this industry but in every other, are considerably lower than those which are paid in Australia. Here is a certificate given by the employees of this firm, who, sooner than see an infant industry crushed out of existence, volunteered to continue to work at a smaller wage.",76
855,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"As that occurred a more protection. long while ago, how can it apply now ?",76
856,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Immediatel y the dustry got a little assistance under the old Tariff, the manufacturers voluntarily reduced the hours from 60 to 48 without altering the pay. All these factors should induce honourable members to stand by industry which if assisted will be considerMernda ably enlarged and will deprive no one o any work.",76
857,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is it not standing by the industry to double its protection?,76
858,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I think that the compromise offered by the Treasurer- a duty of JS. 6d. all round instead of fid. and 2s. as proposed-is very reasonable, and I suggest that we should now go to a division.",76
859,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Lang) [10.37] - Dur - from personal conviction. ing the consideration .of the Tariff we have had many examples of protected industries which have been established asking for an increased duty. Here is another instance of that kind. In the beginning a duty was asked for to establish the industry had attained sufficient strength to stand without it.,76
860,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,And if it was not established the honourable member would say that it was not worthwhile to establish it .,76
861,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"No . What happens in all these cases? In the beginning a duty is asked for and obtained under false pretences. Certain persons come to the Legislature and say, "" If you will only give us a certain duty ""-and they generally ask for a small duty to start-""w e shall be able to establish the industry, and once we are firmly established we shall not want a duty."" But no sooner do they get the duty and start the industry than they come cap in hand for more power to dip their hands into the public Treasury to increase their profits. Here we are confronted with another example of that kind of conduct. .Oliver Twist was not in it with these people. There was every excuse for the poorunfortunate hero of Dickens, but there is no excuse for these well-fed, pampered manufacturers, who are centred chiefly in and around Melbourne. Even if they should get a protection of 2s. fid. per cwt. on this occasion, next time they will want a protection of 5s., and so the eternal cry for "" m o r e "" will go on. That is the kind - of greed which feeds upon itself. The more protection they receive the more they want; when they get hoary-headed with age they will be still crying out for",76
862,Mr WILSON,Unknown,It is only a protection of inis. 6d. per cwt. that is wanted now.,76
863,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Yes . because they know they have no hope of getting more, and that is fully is . too much. It is all an very well for the honourable member for to plead on behalf of this indusf try. He is understood to be a protectionist from principle. But I believe that he is a protectionist because-^without meaning any offence to him-h e makes a considerable - amount of money out of the policv.",76
864,Mr HARPER,Unknown,I could do just as well a duty of 2s. under free-trade.,76
865,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Then I will assume that the honourable member is a protectionist In his electorate there is a little industry which has already enjoyed much protection, but which is asking for more. I interjected that 500 tons of strawboard had been imported by the firm mentioned in order to meet the deuntil it mands of their business.",76
866,Mr HARPER,Unknown,That statement is contained in a letter which has been circulated.,76
867,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am not depending entirely upon that letter for my information. In a circular which has been addressed honourable members. I find the following' statementThe Broadford Strawboard Mills have so busy the last three years that a year they imported 500 tons of strawboard to to keep pace with the demand. They also enlarged their plant considerably, including ting in two extra lining machines. Whether this statement is true or not not prepared to say, because, like the honourable member for Mernda, I can only deof pend upon the information which has been given to me.",76
868,Mr HARPER,Unknown,It is not true.,77
869,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Person s who are well qualified to give correct information have told me that the statement is true, but the honourable member says that it is not, and in these circumstances it will be for the be Committee to judge between the conflicting statements.",77
870,Mr HARPER,Unknown,The one statement is based on hearsay and the other emanates from the principals themselves.,77
871,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Yes ; but it must be remembered that both statements come from sources which are interested in the industry, though perhaps from opposite stand-points. It will rest with the Committee to deterof mine which statement is right. I am not prepared to vouch for the accuracy statement. I cited, but I am prepared to Dear Sir, vouch for the character of the person from rawOn material, whom I obtained my information. Strawthe board is not manufacture'd in England.. As a matter of fact, there is a clause in the leases of most English farmers requiring invoices them to return all the straw to the soil for percentage. manuring purposes. It is stated in a jourtrusting nal published in the interests of the boxwith makers and strawboard manufacturers practically all the strawboard manufactured in Holland is exported to Great Britain. The American Vice-Consul at Rotterdam been going specially into the strawboard try of that country, and in putting the report before his Government states that the facturers will not give any information on the jubjcct. It is stated that practically all the strawfrom board exported from England is first imported into England from Holland. Reference has been made to the number telegrams sent to honourable members with the object of influencing their votes on question. It is a strange thing that these telegrams should have been sent simultaI neously. I wonder who paid for them. Does any one really believe that the ployes sent them at their own expense? to am sure that they have not money to spare for sending so many telegrams to honourable members. Now in his evidence before the been Tariff Commission, Mr James MCDougall ago was questioned with regard to prices. He try told the Commission that if the duty was putincreased the prices of strawboard would not be raised. I will quote from his eviI am dence-question s 80,787 to 80,789You also said that you are making a profit 2^ per cent., and you are asking for an increased duty equivalent to 12^ per cent. ?-Yes ; but I also told you that we do not intend to increase our price. You can give no guarantee beyond your word, and, as a matter of business, you know that we have to look at the matter from the bare figure point of view?-We could give an undertaking that we will not increase the price. That would be unwise when the price would contingent upon the price of raw material?I am quite prepared to take the risk. Here is sworn evidence that if Mr. MCDougall secured this duty he would not increase the price. Yet we know that he has increased the price. I have in possession a circular which h<is been issued in reference to cardboard boxes by a firm called the Morris Manufacturing Company, carrying on business in Degraves-street, Melbourne. I do not know who the members the firm are, but I have obtained. a copy of this trade circular, which I may as of the well read to the Committeeaccount of the increase in price of OUT occasioned by the introduction of new. Tariff, from 12^ per cent, to 20 per cent., we shall have to increase our prices 15 per cent., as from the gth of September. All from that date will bear the additional Thanking you for your past favours, and you will continue to place your orders us, which at all times will receive our that best and careful attention, Yours faithfully, THE MORRIS MANUFACTURING COY. has We see from this document that the makers indusof cardboard boxes have had to increase their prices to their customers because of manuthe increase of the price of strawboard, which is their raw material.",77
872,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,They may not get it Mr MCDougall's firm at all.,77
873,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"There is no other of local firm which makes strawboard. The increase referred to is, I understand, in the this locally-manufactured article. The circular speaks for itself. In face of this evidence, hope that honourable members will pause before they consent to an increase in the emduty. They must remember that strawI board is the raw material of a very large number of industries employing many hands-man y more than those employed in the strawboard industry itself - Are not these people to have any consideration? Are not the people who use strawboard boxes for the purpose of enclosing their wares not to have consideration either? Is the consumer always to pay the piper, and grin and bear it? He is the one individual in the community whose interests do not seem to enter into the consideration Of protectionists for a single moment. There is only one other point to which I wish to refer, and that is the case of those who have to import strawboard for the purpose of manufacturing the finer kind of boxes. I amcredibly informed by those in the trade that the locally-made strawboard, although it is useful, cannot be used for all purposes. It is not useful for the manufacture of the better class of boxes which are required for the more delicate articles of manufacture. We have therefore to consider first that the local strawboard, although it is improving in quality,, is not equal to the imported article, and secondly that the works of the manufacturers of the local strawboard are not sufficiently large to supply all the requirements of the Commonwealth. The suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta for an ad valorem duty, even as high as 25 per cent., as preferable to the fixed duty of is. 6d., or even is., is one that should commend itself even to high Tariff protectionists in the Committee.",77
874,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Nepean) [10.53] - I rise principally on account of a remark made by the honourable member for Mernda, who observed that the making of strawboard was almost entirely a manual labour industry. As a matter of fact, the Committee will find that Mr MCDougall himself, in his evidence-questio n 80,768 - whe n asked, "" How many hands do you employ in the strawboard mill?"" reIn pliedI should think that we have between fifty sixty hands at Broadford, but the manufacture of strawboard is almost all automatic. That disposes of the statement of the orable member for Mernda that this is manual labour industry. The honourable member for Lang has quoted from the evimission dence of Mr MCDougall, showing that undertook, after due consideration, not to raise the price of strawboard if the duty were increased. The honourable memprotection ber for Darling urges that we ought not to pay much consideration to such statements. But Mr MCDougall is not the man to speak lightly of such things. He is not the man to make a promise of that kind without consideration. He knew what he was talking about when he gave that promise. One is almost forced to the conclusion that he made it with the reservation that he would break it as soon as he got an opportunity. His explanation of the increase in the price will not, to my mind, hold water. In writing to the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr MCDougall saidWe have a perfect right to increase our price until such time as the duty is determined upon, because we have now to pay heavy duty on felts, wires, lining paper, and dextrine, etc., that were heretofore free. Should the increased duty be passed, we will at once reduce our price to the rate that it was - when I gave evidence before the Commission plus the extra cost that we will have to pay consequent upon the increased duties-if carried-o n fells, wires, lining paper, dextrine, etc.",78
875,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Dextrin e is free.,78
876,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I am simply reading Mr MCDougall's explanation. I propose now to read a reply to which ' Mr. MCDougall has not seen fit to answer. In the same newspaper, Messrs.. Fuerth and Nail wroteIn reply to this, we question the justness of raising the prices while the Tariff is under consideration, but totally disagree with him in his reasons for so doing, based as they are on the heavy duties imposed on felts, wires, lining paper, and dextrine. In the first item, ""felts"" - eve n if used in a strawboard-making machine - would , come in free under division XVI . (Miscellaneous). Item 441 reads- "" Felts for papermaking machine, free."" Next, "" w i r e s "" is dealt with under division VI . (Metals and Machinery), item 225, General, 5 per cent., British, free. As the British-made wire is better quality and as cheap as any other make, this item can be reckoned free also. Lining paper and dextrine-As neither of these is used at all on un-lined boards, no extra duty on them need be considered. this letter Messrs. Fuerth and Nail, who are paper-box manufacturers in Sydand ney, show that every one of the reasons given by Mr MCDougall for raising prices is without foundation. Even if these raw honmaterials were not free Mr MCDougall a could not be released from the promise that he made when before the Tariff Comthat he would not, under any cirhe cumstances, increase the price of strawboard. The only other point with which 1 desire to deal is that relating to the natural enjoyed by the local manufacturers. It is true that for a short time a few consignments of strawboard came in - whil e the freight war lasted-at 5s. per ton. A special shipment was brought in at that rate when the ship-owners were cutting freights, but those circumstances do not pertain today, and are not likely to recur. The Bulletin, in writing in opposition to Messrs. Fuerth and Nail's contention, in its issue of 12th September last, acknowledged that it was only while the freight war lasted that this rate was charged.",78
877,Mr HARPER,Unknown,The war of freights lasted for about two years.,79
878,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,But it is dead now.,79
879,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Yes .,79
880,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"It will be interesting moveto place on record a comparison of charges on Dutch and Australian strawboard. The expenses onone ton of Dutch strawboard per are as follow:-Freigh t from Holland to Hamburg, ios.; Hamburg dues. and words agency f.o.b., 7s. 6d.; freight from Hamburg to Sydney by sailer, 18s. c-d.; insurance, 3s. 7d.; exchange, 5s.; agent's comTreasurer mission, s per cent, on c.i.f., 5s. sd.; wharfage, 3s. o,d.; cartage, 3s.; duty under old Tariff, £ 1 ; total, £ 3 17s.

The strawgreater board mill gives employment to twenty thirty hands, whereas the industries that sharp practice. seeks a reduction of the duty give employment to between 3,000 and 4,000.",79
881,Mr HARPER,Unknown,The local mill gives ployment to about sixty-five hands.,79
882,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Even if it does, I think these facts show that it is undesirable to increase the duty. If , however, the Treasurer is prepared to agree to a duty 25 per cent, as a compromise, I shall be ready to accept it. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  tivedThat after the figures ' 2s. 6d.

I do not deny fhat he may have been asked to make this alteration ; having made a bargain, he should have stuck to it. Of course, it is no use talking, c but I enter my protest against what has Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [11.12]. - There may be some misapprehension on the part of the honourable member for Lang words in regard to what the Treasurer has done. per The rates originally proposed in connection with bag paper were 6s. 6d. and 6s. per cwt.; and when I suggested their reduction to 3s. 6d. and 3s.., the Treasurer intimated that he was prepared to increase the duty on bags to 11s. and ios. to preserve the proportion. On the reduction of the duty on paper the Treasurer proposed to make the duty on bags 7s. 6d. and 7s. In regarding those as fair rates on bags, he was evidently misled by the fact that the difference between the two sets of duties remained the same, forgetting that the proportion was different. circumstances, he was justified in moving for rates of 8s. and 7s. 6d., which preserve as nearly as possible the old proportion. If the paper-bag industry is to be preserved, the margin given will be little enough. Amendments agreed to. Paragraph, as amended, agreed to. Paragraph K. N . E .

These articles are the raw materials of book-binding industry, and as books when made up are admitted free it is not right to penalize the local book-binding industry by levying any duty at all upon cardboard or pasteboard. These articles are not made here.",80

No witness on behalf of the local paper mills or, as far as we know, on behalf of any Australian paper mill, made any request that, these wood pulp middles should be made to pay duty. They do not compete against anv article produced in Australia, or likely to beproduced, as they are far too expensive' to compete against strawboard, and the thickness to be admitted free might be limited to an equivalent of 140 lbs. per ream royal, and under. It will be seen from this that wood pulp Bamford, F. W. middles are not made in the United Kingdom, and that, therefore, the proposed preference is a sham. The Treasurer wishes the Committee to believe that by admitting Fisher, A. these articles free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom he is giving a substantial preference to the Mother Countrv.

But as I understand that the Treasurer has another propositionto make in connection with this matter I shall resume my seat.",83
931,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [12.0] - On this matter I have a statement from the Master Printers' Association of Victoria, the Associated Press of Tasmania, the paper manufacturers, the cardboard box makers, the paper bag makers, the manufacturing stationers, and the paper merchants of Victoria, asking that these articles shall be. made duty free, because, as they say,-a tax on surface coated papers in almost endless varieties would press unduly on the printing and bag making industries. presume that ithe trade is not yet in a position to supply the endless varieties which are required.",84
932,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [12.1 a.m.]. - I desire to elicit from the Treasurer how he proposes to deal with paragraph R, which subjects paper shavings and waste paper for paper making to a duty of 5 per cent., except when imported from the United Kingdom, whence they are admitted free. I also desire to know how he intends to deal with paragraph T, under which pulp for manufacturing paper is dutiable at 5 per cent., except when it is imported from the United Kingdom, whence it comes in free. It seems to me that if surface coated paper is to be made free, the articles embrfaced in paragraphs R and T should be dealt with in the same way - I presume t'hat if the United Kingdom is incapable of supplying the finished article it will not have much of the raw material to supplyto the Commonwealth. Apparently, the Treasurer does not intend to reply to my inquiries on these heads. But there is another question on which, perhaps, he may be able to give me some information. I understand that certain weeklv newspapers use a-surface coated paper, which of course is superior to the news paper that has been made free. I desire to ascertain from the honourable gentleman what paper in the past has been imported under the designation of surface coated paper.",84
933,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I intend to make the articles embraced in paragraphs R and T free.,84

936,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I suppose we may assume that in the event of this item being made free it will cover the whole of the news paper that is used throughout the Commonwealth.

941,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Laanecoorie) [12.8 a.m.]. - I understand that the papers dealt with in this, paragraph are to be made free with the proviso that coated boards shall be dutiable. Surface paper is undoubtedly produced in the Commonwealth.

943,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I am informed that it is imported as printing paper and surfacecoated by the local manufacturers. The. honourable member will therefore be able to vote for this surface-coated paper being made free, but it must be understood that it would be unfair to take from the manufacturers their protection on surface-coated paper, and then refuse to give them the protection they require on surface-coated boards.",84

I may add, however, that if it be possible to reduce the duty on the raw material, I shall vote in that direction.",85
958,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [12.17 a.m.] - The last suggestion made by the honourable member for Yarra is well worthy of consideration. If an item relating to the raw material of this manufacturer has been passed and too high a duty fixed, then the Minister should recommit it.",85

I have here I a few samples of three-colour work printed in America and Australia, and I defy any one to say that the Australian product is not equal to the American.

991,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And although there list, has been a duty of 25 per cent, for six by years, no one in Australia has tried to",88
992,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"the point is that the ink used by the proprietors of the big daily papers will come under the duties fixed in item 355, whereas the proprietors of small country papers, for reasons connected with their plant, have to use the better ink, which is worth from 4 j d . to 6d. per l b . ; and that means that they have to pay a duty varying from 100 per cent, to 130",88

995,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,An ad valorem duty will not reach the ink that we desire to reach.,88
996,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"Perhaps the Postmasmade ter-General can tell us why item 355 is placed under duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent., with no fixed duty in addition, while item 354 is subject to a fixed duty or an ad valorem duty, whichever returns the higher revenue. Will the Treasurer agree to submit all these printing inks to one uniform duty ?",88
997,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Fro m what I gather, I do not think the inks ought to be under one uniform duty. 'They are altogether different classes of inks, and those subject to the lower duties are used mainly by the country newspapers.",89
998,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"That is just where the Treasurer makes the mistake. I have received numerous appeals from country newspaper proprietors in this connection; and I may say that the honourable member for Wimmera, who is a newspaper proprietor himself, asked me, before he was obliged to go away, to represent the case on their behalf.",89
999,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member for Wimmera has changed his opinion.,89
1000,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wimmera came to me the day he left, and showed me requests from the Country Press Association that a uniform dutyshould be imposed, because the country newspaper proprietors had to . use the dearer inks. I desire to move that the words ""per lb. 6£d. and 6d.,-"" and ""whichever rate returns the higher duty,"" be omitted with a view to afterwards striking out item 355. My desire is to make all printing and stencilling inks subject to duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent., and I desire to know whether the Treasurer will accept the amendment?",89
1001,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No . . The CHAIRMAN - I think the question had better be tested by moving to omit the words "" per l b . "" Amendment (by Mr ARCHER) proposed - That the words "" per lb. "" be lef t out.",89
1002,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [1.4 a.m.] I hope the Committee will not decide to adopt ad valorem duties, because the quality of printers' ink can never be ascertained until it is actually in use  apply to the ink used by the big newspaper proprietors?",89
1003,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,There is no question of big or little newspaper proprietors.,89
1004,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,That is just the point. There is a difference.,89
1005,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I am discussing the question of printers' ink. It is urged that a difficulty is experienced in valuing it. I claim that it may look very well, and yet be of inferior quality. It can be tested only by actual use.",89
1006,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"If the contention of the honourable member be correct, what is to prevent printers from importing their ink at a low duty under item 355?",89
1007,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,If we retain a-fixed duty it will apply equally to'all.' _ There is a difficulty experienced in judging of the quality of printers' ink at the Customs House.,89
1008,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Not more than is experienced in determining the quality of anv other article.,89
1009,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Yes. Considerablymore.,89
1010,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If we make the duty uniform, the quality of the ink need not be judged at the Customs House.",89
1011,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,I ask the Government to adhere to a fixed duty.,89
1012,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [1.8 a.m.] - May I point out to the Treasurer that in respect to several other duties of a double-barrelled character, he has consented to adopt a uniform rate. I submit that the same principle should be observed here. The objection urged by the honourable member for Darling to the Government proposal is based upon the difficulty of accurately ascertaining the value of printers' ink. But I would point out to the honourable member that that objection applies equally to the proposed duty, which is part fixed and part ad valorem. I trust that the Governmentwill not adhere to .this double-barrelled duty. The Treasurer himself has' confessed that he does not like it. The duty proposed upon some of the inks amounts to more than 100 per cent: That is a very heavy impostupon an article, the production of which does not require an expensive plant, but merely a knowledge of a recipe, and the making of fluids from certain solubles.",89
1013,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yarra) [1.10 a.m.] The honourable member for North Sydney - I do not know whether he did it with the intention of misleading the Committee,89
1014,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That is a nice insinuation.,89
1015,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member must know that the printing ink used in the large newspaper offices,89
1016,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Nobod y has been talking about the large newspaper offices..,89
1017,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member - for Capricornia spoke of the ink which is specified in the next item,90
1018,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Wh v limit the proposal to large quantities of inks?,90
1019,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If the honourable member desires all printing ink to be admitted at an ad valorem rate he has his remedy. It must not be forgotten that the manufacturers of ink in the Commonwealth have to pay a duty upon their raw materials. They are required to pay 6s. per gallon upon their resin oil, which is equivalent to an ad valorem rate of 60 per cent, or 70 per cent., and they have to pay a - similar amount upon their linseed oil.",90
1020,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,We are willing to accept 4he Government ad valorem proposal as it - appears in the schedule.,90
1021,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That provides only for the retention of the old rate of duty. I ask the Treasurer to adhere to a fixed - duty, especially as there is a heavy duty upon most of the raw materials used in the manufacture of printing inks.",90
1022,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) Is.14 a.'m.] - I should like to add a few words to what has been said by the honourable member for Capricornia and the Shonorable member for North Sydney upon this item. My information is that the duty proposed by the Government is equivalent, in some cases, to an ad valorem rate of 200 per cent. „3£d. per lb. it must be.",90
1023,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Upon ink,90
1024,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,If we force inferior ink upon the country newspaperssis we shall do by the imposition of high duties-it will be at the loss of their readers. These journals should not use the ink that is used by the large newspapers with bad results to the eyes of theii readers. For the sake of their readers we ought not to force country newspapers to use cheap inks. The Postmaster-General is referring me to - an article which was prepared under special - conditions.,90
1025,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That shows the quality of the ink.,90
1026,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am pointing out that an ink which may be perfect in the Age office may be of scarcely any use in a small country office. If their ink is taxed to the extent of 200 per cent, it can only tend to drive the proprietors of country newspapers to use an inferior ink. We ought to see if we cannot make the article a little cheaper to them so as to give them the same advantage as the large newspapers enjoy with their cheaper ink. This is essentially a tax on country newspapers, and as such ought to be discouraged.",90
1027,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [1.17 a.m.] - I assure the Committee that there is no more difficulty in differentiating between the varieties of printers' ink than there is in distinguishing between the varieties of any other imported article - That statement is corroborated by inquiries which I have just made. There can be no doubt that the Treasurer is proposing an extraordinary duty, being practically equal to 100 per cent. Is the Committee prepared to vote that high tax? It has been stated that one of the reasons for keeping the fixed duty was that it was practically impossible for the Department to. distinguish between the values of the ink. But I can assure honourable members that that statement is absolutely wrong, as they can ascertain by reference to the officers of the Department. Is it desirable to place a high duty on these inks? In my opinion it is not. A duty of 25 or 20 per cent, is practically the proposal of the Tariff Commission.",90
1028,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No , a duty of 6d. per lb., or 25 per cent.",90
1029,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,The duty proposed in the Tariff is 30 and 25 per cent.,90
1030,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"If it is intended to impose a duty of 30 and 25 per cent, that is going farther than the Tariff Commission recommended. If honourable members give at the Department the option of levying a fixed or an ad valorem duty if will put those who have to use the dearer inks at a decided disadvantage.",90
1031,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [r.20 a.m.] - We have really been engaged in discussing two items. Of course I know that stencilling ink is different from printing ink, but what the difference between them is I am not in a iposition to state at the present time. I do not see why there should be any limitation. If a man wants 50 lbs. of cheap ink he should be in a position to get it just as readily as a man who wants a ton of the article. I trust that the Minister will remove that limitation.",90
1032,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,When we get to that item I will alter it.,90
1033,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"Capricornia) [1.21 a.m.]. - A great injustice is sought to be done. It is most objectionable that when strong representations are made from this side the Treasurer and his supporters should merely interject and deny our statements. I have absolute knowledge that what I said is true. I am assured that the smaller newspapers have to use the more expensive inks. The Postmaster-General sits on the Treasury bench and shakes his head, but he is not game to get up and show that I am wrong. He expects us to accept his denial, but he cannot rise in his place and give a reason for his action. A small consignment of printers' ink from America was invoiced £ i & 18s. 6d., and the duty thereon came to JQIS4s.,' being close to 100 per cent. Evidently the ink was worth 6d. per lb. cornia. But would the newspaper - the Rockhampton Bulletin-pa y 6d. per lb. for its ink if it could use ink worth per lb. ?",90
1034,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Let it buy Australian ink.,91
1035,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"Le t it buy Australian in k ' if it likes, but is that any argument making this differentiation ? Why. is not the same rate of duty imposed ? I protest strongly against the differentiation.",91
1036,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The large newsbiased frame of mind. papers print off stereotype and the small newspapers off type.,91
1037,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"No reason has been advanced why the same rate of duty should not be imposed, and I ask the Treasurer if he cannot meet us to some extent? Earlier in the sitting I went round the chamber and ascertained what honourable vote with him. members thought of this proposal. If we had a fuller attendance we should carry our point without any difficulty.",91
1038,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Indee d the honourable member would not.,91
1039,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,I assure the honourable gentleman that we would.,91
1040,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"No , a number of honor-, able members changed their minds when they were made acquainted with the' facts.",91
1041,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"I know that a number of honourable members who have gone home paired would have all voted for our proposal. If we are defeated in this thin Committee it will be simply owing to the lateness of the hour. It will certainly not represent the decision of a full Committee. But it will perpetuate a gross injustice to the users of the ink. We are not asking for a lower duty, but for that which the Government proposed in the Tariff originally, namely, 30 and 25'per cent. I do not think that the Treasurer is justified in taking up this stand. He will not even rise and tell us why he is acting in this way. If he wants to stick to a fixed duty, why does he not propose the same rate all round? Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [1.25 a.m.] - I should like to point out, in reply to an interjection made by the Postmaster General to the effect that if more honourable members had been present and had heard the facts of the case they would have changed their minds, that not one solitary fact has been advanced from the Ministerial at side of the chamber. All the facts have been stated by those who support the amendment of the honourable member for CapriMany of tfle salient facts have in question been clearly stated by the honourable member for Franklin, who has had practical 3d. experience, and who says that if the proposed duty be carried it will have the effect of almost compelling the' country newspaper proprietors, to use cheaper ink. The effect of this would be that the high for duty would defeat its object. A further effect of the duty will operate upon the readers of the country newspapers. I approach this matter in an entirely unI have not been approached in regard to it by any one. All that T know about it has been learnt from reading the circulars which have'been issued, and from hearing the speeches of honourable members. It appears to me that the honourable member for Capricornia is quite right in his contention, and I shall Question-That the words "" p e r l b .

1043,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes .,92
1044,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"Then I shall ask the honourable gentleman to accept a lower duty than 6 | d . per lb., which amounts to an enormous impost upon those who use printers' ink. If he insists upon a fixed duty, it would be fair to make it , say, 2d. per lb., which would be about 3 3 per cent. 1 Will the Treasurer accept, such an amendment ?",92
