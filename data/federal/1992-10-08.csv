National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: 1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag. 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents the Nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet earth; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901. 3. They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. 4. They recall that millions of native-born .Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism. 5. They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will: Propose and pass a motion that ""the existing . Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a Referendum"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Reid (from 34 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria draws. to the attention of the House: That about 28,000 unborn babies are being killed in Victoria annually, and that a total of about 750,000 have been killed in Australia since abortion item 6469 became part of the Medicare benefits schedule in 1975. Most abortions are performed on healthy unborn babies for reasons of convenience and most of the procedures are funded by the Australian taxpayer through Medicare. Your petitioners therefore ask the house to terminate Medicare funding of abortion in Australia by supporting the Abortion Funding Bill of 1990. by Mr Scholes (from 17 citizens). Breast Cancer Screening To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia showeth The need for the Government to recognise the importance of Mammograms being accessible to all women and that this medical facility should be covered by Medicare.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Rocky Ridge Nursing Home remains operational and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Snowdon (from 879 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights. That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life. That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect. That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided medical benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million. That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals.

That in 1987/88 the Federal Government paid $6.4 .million from taxpayers funds for 61,879 abortiOns under Medicare Items 6469 and 274/275 alone. That in the same year Federal Government grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies and abolish Government funding of abortion. And your Petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Webster (from 458 citizens). Petitions received. NA",10
3,The Clerk,RESPONSES TO PETITIONS,"A ministerial response to a petition previously presented to the House has been received as follows: Meat Inspection Fees Minister for Resources The Honourable Alan Griffiths, MP 29 September 1992 LM Barlin Clerk of the House House of Representatives Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 Dear Sir I ref-r. to your: letter of 20 August 1992 regarding a petition received by the House of Representatives on the same date. In accordance with Standing Order No. 132 of the House of Representatives, my response to the petition in the form of a statement to the House is attached. Yours sincerely Alan Griffiths NA NA REPRESENTATIVES ON 20 AUGUST 1992 BY NEVILLE NEWELL The petition relates to the increase in meat inspection fees payable to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) by the Murwillumbah abattoir from 1 August 1992. The fee increase is due to the abattoir being unable to meet the criteria for subsidy under the small and remote establishment subsidy. Murwillumbah abattoir is ineligible for the subsidy because it is within 150km of the nearest non-subsidised establishment and, as such, cannot be considered as being in a remote locality. The 150km range is a conservative estimate of the distance that fresh meat can be transported. Until 31 July 1992 Murwillumbah abattoir had received a subsidy to small abattoirs introduced in 1989, as a temporary assistance measure, when meat inspection fee for service was implemented. The fee for service charging system replaced the previous throughput charge. The subsidy was extended on 1 January 1991 when full cost recovery of AQIS' user attributable services was introduced. In Murwillumbah abattoir's case the subsidy was 70 per cent of the scheduled fee. The extended subsidy ceased on 1 August 1992, a month later than originally planned. The decision to cease the subsidy was taken on the basis that this form of short term assistance provided sufficient time for small establishments to rationalise their operations in order to minimise inspection usage and consequently charges. I understand that since the cessation of the subsidy, Murwillumbah abattoir have modified their inspector requirements from daily usage (4 days per week) to hourly usage (3 hours a day/3 days a week). This reduction in inspector usage will reduce their annual charges to less that $22,000 while retaining the flexibility to increase inspector usage in 1 hour increments should the need arise. Although Murwillumbah abattoir initially faced a substantial increase in fees, I believe that AQIS charges are sufficiently well structured for a small operator to take advantage of the various inspection options which are available. from the Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, relating to a petition lodged by Mr Newell on 20 August 1992, praying that the increases in Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service charges at Murwillumbah abattoir be revoked.

4,Mr SMITH,CONDUCT AT QUESTION TIME," Mr Speaker, I want to seek your indulgence for one moment about a matter that has been brought to my attention",14
5,Mr SPEAKER,CONDUCT AT QUESTION TIME,All right.,14
6,Mr SMITH,CONDUCT AT QUESTION TIME,Another matter has been brought to my attention; I must inquire about your health. I hope that it is not a serious injury that you have sustained.,14
7,Mr SPEAKER,CONDUCT AT QUESTION TIME,Taking too .much from the Opposition on the chin!,14
8,Mr SMITH,CONDUCT AT QUESTION TIME,"Well, just turn the other cheek.",14
9,Mr SPEAKER,CONDUCT AT QUESTION TIME,I said to the honourable member for Curtin that I thought Wilson Tuckey had sent me something from Indonesia.,14
10,Mr SMITH,CONDUCT AT QUESTION TIME,"lam sure it would be a pleasant gift. Mr Speaker, I hope the bleeding stops soon. I want to raise the matter that appeared in the Australian on 5 October. It relates to a report headed 'Coalition blamed for quality of Question Time', which has been an ongoing matter lletween the Government and the. Opposition.",14
11,Mr SPEAKER,CONDUCT AT QUESTION TIME,Is the honourable member for Bass disputing the authenticity of the article?,14
12,Mr SMITH,CONDUCT AT QUESTION TIME,"Probably not on this occasion, but the particular matter that I wanted to raise relates to a report of comments by the Deputy Speaker which I thought were probably inappropriate, given that he is charged with upholding the House and the Standing Orders. I draw this matter to your attention and wonder whether or not you have seen it and whether you think the remarks were appropriate. I take the view that the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker ought not to be in the business of publicly blaming one side or the other for the conduct of the Parliament. It is their role to uphold the Standing Orders and it would be, in my view, appropriate for you and the Deputy not to indulge in the public debate that is taking place about how the Parliament ought to be conducting itself. I draw this matter to your attention.",14
13,Mr SPEAKER,CONDUCT AT QUESTION TIME,"I have not seen the article but I do not think that the honourable member for Bass would want to curtail a right of members of parliament, no matter what positions they hold, to comment upon what happens in the chamber here; but it is not a matter for me to adjudicate on. NA Community Affairs",14
14,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I present a report on the prescription and supply of drugs entitled Prescribed Health Part 2: Prescribing and Medication Management, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",15
15,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to table today the Committee's second report on its inquiry into the prescription and supply of drugs. The Committee's first report. was tabled in March and dealt with the pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory framework by which drugs are made available for prescription and over the counter sale. The Government, in responding to the 43 recommendations contained in the first report, supported all but one of these. The degree of endorsement of the Committee's work and conclusions is pleasing and is a measure of the importance of a coordinated effort in achieving an integrated approach to quality drug use. This report, which deals with the role and responsibilities of doctors in the drug distribution chain, also discusses the rights and responsibilities of patients as the consumers of pharmaceutical products. It makes a strong case for more effective communication and a greater commitment to the better use of medicines by prescribers and patients as equal partners in a health team. As teamwork is a central part of this inquiry, this report is being tabled at a particularly opportune time. Last month saw the launch of one arm of the Government's pharmaceutical strategy, with September being designated the Be Wise with Medicines Month. This initiative, developed by the September health and pharmaceutical education working party, is part of the Government's overall strategy to encourage better use of drugs. Throughout last month, via media publicity and other promotional activities, people on multiple medications were encouraged to ask their doctors for a review of their medication regimen to maximise the benefits of the Report treatment they were receiving. This is something highlighted 1;>y the Committee in its report. In fact, one of the Committee's recommendations is to give greater weight and encouragement to such medication reviews by making them an individual consultation item under Medicare. Such reviews of patients on multiple medications on a regular basis could also reduce the cost of hospital admissions due to adverse drug reactions. In the Committee's second report, reference is made to recent studies which indicate that an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 hospital admissions and 700 to 1,400 deaths relate to drug use each year. This is thought to result in costs in dollar terms of between $55m and $69m in one year. This does not take into account the cost of individual hardship and lost productivity. I note in this context the comments of the President of the AMA, Dr Bruce Shepherd, who has issued a press release stating: The availability of new, more potent medicines on the Australian market makes it inevitable that inadvertent overdoses will occur: these are part of the price paid for progress. This cavalier approach to this very. serious problem does no credit to the medical profession which has a vital role to play in minimising health risks to the community. This report looks in detail at the role of the prescriber and examines the degree to which undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing education equips doctors with the necessary skills and knowledge base to make informed decisions about the appropriateness of drug or non-drug therapy. The Committee recommends that a core curriculum in clinical pharmacology, as developed by the Australasian Society of Clinical and Experimental Pharmacologists and Toxicologists, be taught in all medical schools in a broad context that includes community as well as institutional settings of prescribing. The report also makes recommendations about placing greater emphasis in undergraduate courses on communication and interaction skills so that patients derive more benefit from consultations. Reference is also made to the influence of internships and prescribing in hospital settings. In the continuing education area, the Committee makes comments on recent changes in general practice and requirements for vocational registration, and discusses the advantages of these changes for improved prescribing practices. The Committee believes that all prescribers should be required to undertake some form of ongoing medical education, particularly given the almost continuous introduction of new drugs and the rapid advances in patient treatment. The nature of such acceptable continuing education should be developed by the professional bodies representing each specialty, and the Committee considers the quality and flexibility of the quality assurance program the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to be an appropriate model. The Committee also makes recommendations about enhancing the role and impact of the Australian Prescriber as an independent source of authoritative drug information. While acknowledging that the pharmaceutical industry also plays an important, though limited, role in providing prescribers with information about new pharmaceutical products, the Committee encourages industry sponsored education activities which meet specialist college standards and contribute towards vocational registration. One of the other means by which professionals and consumers could be better informed about drug use in the community is through improvements to the current drug database. At present, the major independent sources of population based drug use information are the Health Insurance Commission, the Drug Utilisation Subcommittee of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee. The Committee notes that some commercial market research companies also have important information about drug use and makes a recommendation to have this included in an expanded database. Furthermore, the Committee recommends that State and Territory health authorities be encouraged to supplement a pharmaceutical database by including drug use data from public hospitals. This would also necessitate a strengthening of the adverse drug reaction reporting process, and the Committee recommends that professional and consumer associations be involved in achieving this. Provision of more sources of independent information to prescribers also will assist in making better use of pharmaceutical products. Strategies to achieve this include academic detailing, drug information services and therapeutic guidelines. Comments are made in the report about academic detailing projects currently being trialled. The Committee considers this to be an important strategy for providing independent information and advice, if properly focused on high risk drugs where the potential for negative health outcomes due of to drug interactions or overuse is of major concern. The Committee also recommends the re-establishment of the National Drug Information Service within the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services and the continued development of national therapeutic guidelines to complement an Australian national formulary. One major government initiative to achieve better use of medicines was the establishment of the Pharmaceutical Health and the Rational Use of Medicines Working Party, PHARM. A principal part of PHARM's work was the development of a policy document on the quality use of medicines. One significant thrust of this document was to promote the establis-ent of a national centre for the quality use of medicines. The Committee supports this aim. As well as recommending the continuation of the work of PHARM by an implementation committee, it also recommends that the Department develop guidelines and an operational charter for such a national centre. While making comments about the Government's overall coordinating role, the Committee makes recommendations about streamlining the operations of the General Practice Consultative Committee, an expanded role for the Health Insurance Commission, and better coordination between the general practice and pharmaceutical benefits branches of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. In keeping with its overall focus on patients as consumers of medicines, the Committee discusses consumer rights and responsibilities, looks at consumer education programs and makes comments about current medication record management systems. At this stage the Committee does not consider that the suggestion of an electronic 'smart card: encoding a patient's medication intake is a viable option until issues of patient confidentiality and computer compatibility are resolved. The Committee then makes observations about particular consumer groups such as those from non-English speaking background and makes recommendations about greater access to and better use of the telephone translating and interpreting service. With all consumer groups, the critical factor is a team approach to improve community health outcomes. This means that, where necessary, doctors, pharmacists, nurses and allied health professionals must work together with consumers and their carers. A team approach can lead to improved prescribing, with doctors consulting pharmacists; greater consideration of non-drug alternatives, with doctors consulting allied health professionals; improved drug administration and patient compliance, with greater involvement by nurses, pharmacists and carers; and the early detection of adverse drug outcomes by all involved. An initiative which may lead to the development of stronger health teams is the establishment of divisions of general practice. This is discussed in more detail in the report. The report concludes by looking at the role of nurses, particularly in the community setting and in remote locations. In. acknowledging the reality that nurses in some situations already diagnose illnesses and dispense prescription drugs in limited circumstances, the Committee recommends that this be formalised in the legislation. Thus, individual nurses with specific training could be licensed to dispense a limited range of prescribed drugs at specific locations. For example, in an urban context, nurses could dispense oral contraceptives through family planning clinics; in remote areas,·nurses could dispense antibiotics when a doctor is not available or contactable. A recurrent theme running through this report is teamwork and close cooperation between all professionals and participants in the health system. In many instances this will require that the attitudes of many health professionals change in order to break down long established practice and to foster new links within broader, more cooperative structures in a way that has not happened before. This requires an ongoing commitment by all players to maximise quality health care for all Australians. In the next and final report of this inquiry, the Committee will examine the role pharmacists can play in the health care team, including proposals to expand their role in the provision of education about medicines to the general community. Pharmacists are an important link in the distribution chain, and more effective use of their professional skills and knowledge will assist in the general improvement of the quality use of medicines. I recommend the report to the Parliament and especially to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Me Staples), who is at the table. I thank the Secretary, Bjarne Nordin, and James Catchpole and Shirley Hunter from the Committee secretariat for their diligent and competent work in assisting the Committee in its work.",15
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Ronald Edwards) '-Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the Chairman wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion? Motion (by Mr Jenkins) proposed: That the House take note of the report.,17
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! In accordance with sessional order 102B, the debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. Migration Regulations Report Debate resumed from 14 September, on motion by Dr Theophanous: That the House take note of the report.",17
18,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"Since 14 September, when this House last considered the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations entitled Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian System: Achieving a Balance between Refuge and Control, there has been some controversy about the manner .and the form of presentation by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). He unfortunately is overseas and consequently not able to be present for today's debate. There has been some comment about the extent to which he gave proper deliberation and weight to the report of the Committee as distinct from his own minority report. I apologise to him for making these comments in his absence, but I think it is important that, where the Chairman is a dissident, he understand that it would better for him to pass over to the Deputy Chairman the responsibility of tendering the report. My first concern is that the controversy, such as it is, that has emerged about the extent to which he gave due emphasis and priority to the majority report would have been quite easily avoided had he handed to the Deputy Chairman the responsibility for tendering the report. He could then have given himself more opportunity to present his alternative point of view to recommendation 8.46, which concerns the PRC permit holders, people who at the moment have a unique status within this country. The last time. I spoke, I mentioned the increasing problem of the spate of refugees coming into the country. We are fortunate in Australia in that, although we do have a large number of refugees waiting to be processedand on this side of the House we are very critical of the way in which the Government is handling that processing-we are not plagued with the large numbers of refugees that, for example, have come across the border into Germany or Pakistan, or even into Papua New Guinea, which have been totally unexpected and had consequences for the way in which they need to be dealt with. Australia, however, is a host country for migrants. One of the quandaries which the Committee deliberated on was the extent to which priority can be give to refugees, as distinct from that which properly needs to be accorded to those who apply for migration in the normal course of events. Because of the concern regarding the PRC conclusion, I want to say a few words on that specifically. I know that all of us have received correspondence from a number of Chinese students who believe themselves to be disadvantaged by virtue of that recommendation. I do not accept their submission. As far as I am concerned, consideration needs to be given to them if they are in reasonable fear of persecution. That, indeed, is the substance of this recommendation. As with other refugees, if they are able to meet the criteria prescribed and the criteria which have be traditionally been accepted, not only by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees but also by this country, there is no question that they should remain as refugees. If they cannot meet those criteria, then there is a criterion that is covered in the recommendation which ensures that proper weight is given to their circumstances and that time is given for their return. They can, of course, then apply to enter as any other applicant for migration to this country and their application will be dealt with in the normal way. I have long been concerned about the need for people to leave Australia before they can apply for migration. There are a number of circumstances where, in another report, we have looked at change of status within Australia. I am not happy with aspects of that. I think there are reasons why those who are in Australia perhaps make better migrants than those outside Australia, provided they are going to integrate into our community. However it is also true that at a time of high unemployment, at a time when there has to be a reduction in the number of persons accepted for migration into Australia, the criterion for entry must be prescribed. For that reason, I support the 8.46 recommendation with respect to the PRC permit holders which will exclude a visa class which cannot continue i-definitelybeing neither fully-fledged Austrahans nor people on temporary visas. There has to be a way in which they can be dealt with and their cases finally resolved. For that reason, I believe the compromise we reached in recommendation 8.46 is ideal. As 1 said, 1 think it is unfortunate that the Chairdischarge man, in presenting his report, did not take a proper position, and expressed his dissent, rather than presenting the report of the majority. 1 believe the Chinese students will not be disadvantaged under our recommendation and that the report should be accepted in full. The Parliament is fortunate to have had an opportunity to consider the report again and 1 think it is a report which the Government should adopt.",18
19,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"Firstly, 1 would like to support the views that have been expressed by other members of the Committee who have spoken. They paid tribute to the very valuable contributions that were made to the functioning and to the deliberations of the Committee by Dr Kathryn Cronin, our legal adviser, and by the Secretary, Mr Andres Lomp, and his predecessor, Ms Robina Mills. I am certain all members of the Committee would agree that if it had not been for the very real commitment of those people in deliberations which were at times very difficult and complex the Committee would not have been able to produce a report which, on any view of it, is significant and important. Unfortunately, 1 was overseas at the final stages of the report and was not present when the Committee made its decision and divided on the important question of how one dealt with the PRC situation. Having had the benefit of coming back and reading both the opinion of the majority, in which 1 seem to have been included, and the dissentient reports, 1 must make it clear to the House and to those who will be reading the report that while I was not present when thosconclusions were reached, 1 choose to dissociate myself and dissent from the decision of the majority of the members of the Committee. Equally, I am bound to say that 1 do not agree with the views put forward by my colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) when he says that, because a chairman of a committee finds himself in a situation where he dissents from a view of the majority, he cannot therefore the obligations which go with being a chairman in presenting a report and in-l-ding in that report his own dissenting op1ll1on. The important thing about all parliamentary committees is that those members who go on them and have to analyse the facts, while undoubtedly governed as they are on most issues by their own political philosophy and their own analysis of the particular problems that arise, at the end of the day do not-and it has been my experience on all those committees on which 1I have been presentrepresent any kind of party political position. So if one is a chairman of a committee and one finds oneself in a position where one cannot agree with some aspects of a report and if it is incumbent upon a chairman to say: '1 cannot continue in the role as chairman' 1I have to abandon that role in order to dissen'r that presumption can only have any rationalif the view is taken that a chairman is.bound to virtually acquiesce in whatever recommendations the committee makes or is in some contrary position as chairman. That is, not a position that 1 can endorse or accept. On the broader policy issue, 1 believe that a-l members of. the Committee, despite the d-ssent that has been recorded on this very dIfficult and complex question, have approached the subject objectively in terms of their own perceptions. The history of the problems arising out of the events in Tiananmen Square is set out on pages 188 and 189 of the report. That history also sets out the commitment that was made by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) on 27 June 1990. According to that commitment, PRC nationals or illegals would be able to stay in Australia for four years under a special category of temporary residence permit. There was also a new aspect of our refugee policy which allowed those applicants granted refugee or humanitarian status to obtain a four-year TEP rather than immediate permanent residence. Finally, there is the important commitment that no Chinese nationals would be required to return to China against their will. It may well be that, with the advantage of hindsight, in a highly emotional, difficult and complex situation not merely for the Government but for all members of this House, those commitments might not have been made and there could have been a different approach, but the reality is that at the time that that statement was made by the then Prime Minister there was no significant dissent from it, either within the Parliament within the broader Australian community. My colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) is shaking his head. While I place great value on his views, I would emphasise that what we are talking about is significant dissent at the time, and I do not believe that the views then expressed would come into that category. One has to place store on all Australia's relationships, and not merely those with Asia, and its position in respect of undertakings made by its Prime Ministers. Against the need for endeavouring to get uniformity within our immigration policies we have to weigh the value of the undertakings given publicly and now acted upon by two Prime Ministers. If one were to say that all aspects of our immigration policies were consistent, and that all applicants coming to Australia were treated equally, then we would have to say that there may be some strength in the argument put forward by the majority of the members of the Committee on the arrangements that have been made in respect of the Chinese who are here and seeking refugee status. But that is not the case. We do not have a uniform policy and practice in respect of all aspects our immigration policy. Some national groups are treated differently to others. Without opening up the question at great length, one can simply point to the existing arrangements in respect of applicants from New Zealand. They do not need visas, and they do not need passports. They arrive in Australia and immediately have the status of permanent residents and all that goes with that. I myself have raised that in another context, but here I am saying that so long as we are in a position where there are those discrepancies, no matter how much we desire it, we are not able to say that we have a uniform standard and a uniform code. The question that then has to be faced is whether one can agree with the view expressed by the majority of members of this Committee that following a procedure of individual processing-and that is a process that I support-if someone does not fall within the framework of refugee or humanitarian status then, despite the underor takings given by two Prime Ministers and two Ministers of immigration, we are then going to say to those who fall outside that category, 'We will give you three months in which to organise your affairs and you will then have to leave Australia'. The other aspect of that is that it presumes that we have got to a stage where we are satisfied that the Government in China at that time, whatever it might be, is operating in a way in which the kinds of impositions and restrictions on human rights which were evident at Tiananmen Square are no longer operating. The fact of the matter is that in respect of our relationship with China there is clearly emerging a strengthening relationship, both in terms of trade and commerce and in terms of culture. If one looks at the expansion of that trade and the expansion of that understanding-(TIme expired)",19
20,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"I seek leave to make further comment in respect of this matter, Mr Deputy Speaker.",20
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"It may be convenient to the House for you to be called again after other members, but I would think it would have to be by of leave, because the time allocated has expired. You cannot continue your remarks now.",20
22,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"It is interesting that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) should seek· to defend the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). As the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) says, his position is indefensible. The concern that we have is that he seems to be completely out of step with everyone in this place on the issue of migration, and yet he is the Chairman of this Committee. There are 11 members on the Committee. It is like the platoon marching down the street: everyone is out of step and he is the only one in step. I think there is cause for real concern about his role as Chairman of this Committee. I am not a member of the Committee, although as secretary of the Opposition's committee on immigration, I have taken an active interest in the subject. I do congratulate the Committee on its excellent report entitled Australia s Refugee and Humanitarian System: Achieving a Balance between Refuge and Control. It deals with a complex and sensitive issue, and that is, of course, the handling and treatment of those arriving here who seek to remain because they are refugees. I notice that the honourable member for Calwell said, in a comment that he made during his speech, that there are currently 17.5 million refugees worldwide. I would have thought that was actually a conservative figure. I have heard estimates of the worldwide number of refugees as being as high as 50 million or even 100 million. On a worldwide basis, it is a huge problem. In that context, I suppose that for us, in this country, it is only a relatively small problem. We are, of course, an island, and it is not easy for people to arrive here. My friend the honourable member for Moore and I were recently in the former Yugoslavia. Of course, the refugee problem that has been created by the war there is enormous, and it is impacting on countries surrounding Yugoslavia, as people arrive on borders as refugees. The countries that are expected as a result of the Geneva Convention to take them are finding it a huge problem. In Croatia, we visited refugee camps; the problem for Croatia alone is that there are 300,000 or 400,000 people who are defined as refugees there. They are people who are banished from their homes and are temporarily residing outside the borders of their own country. Most of those 300,000 or 400,000 refugees in Croatia are from Bosnia-Herzegovina. In Croatia, there are also another almost 300,000 people who are described as displaced persons; that is, those persons who are banished from their homes but are still within the borders of their own country. The Croatian Government representatives were telling us there that it is costing the Government $70m a month just to provide for the needs of those who are refugees or displaced persons. I suppose our problem here in Australia does tend to pale into insignificance when compared with the real problem that exists in other countries. I commend the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) for having already reacted to a number of this Committee's recommendations. There is-as the subtitle of the report suggests-a need to achieve a balance between providing refuge, and maintaining control over our own borders and over our immigration program. Most Australians, at least the ones I talk to, expect that an element of control has to exist. I do not think there is anyone, perhaps with the exception of the Chairman of this Committee, who would advocate that effectively we should open our borders to anyone who wants to arrive, by any means whatsoever, and then have that person remain here. Most Australians take the view that we do need to maintain very strict control over who is allowed to come here and who is allowed to stay here. However, Australians are generally compassionate people, and basically generous enough to understand that we need to be able to offer humanitarian assistance to those who seek asylum in our country. There has been a concern in the community in recent times that some element of control has been lost, and that view is expressed to me quite often. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) implied, even today, that there are potential migrants who would be very good residents of this country and who are denied access for one reason or another. Even as the right honourable member suggested, there are some people already the country who would be very good citizens of this country, if they were allowed to We can identify a number of people in that category. I have got such cases on my desk the moment. There is concern that, while deny access to those sorts of people or send those sorts of people home, we neverthe the less go to great lengths to allow those who happen to arrive here by boat to stay. The Australian community has become fairly cynical about that process. I have people telling me almost every .day that they have a relative in some part of Europe Asia, it does not really matter where, who would be a very good resident, but they case basis. cannot come here. They say to me, 'We want to do the right thing. We want to apply them to come here'. However, if they get in a boat and row across the sea and then arrive here we welcome them and we provide them with every facility so that they can stay here. That is a cynical attitude-the honourable member for Melbourne Ports shakes his head-but that is the attitude that is so mon. It is widespread in the Australian munity, and overseas as well. That is why report is important because I believe that does address a lot of those issues. It does give us some sort of a balance between compasto sion and providing refuge for those who are genuinely in need whilst enabling us to maintain a level of control over those who come here. The Australian community expects that. The PRC nationals issue is addressed in report and most of the members have spoken on that. issue. I think that issue, more than other one issue, added to the impression that control.of our immigration had somehow been lost. The former Prime Minister, Mr Hawkethe and we remember him when he addressed the Chinese students in a very emotional wayimpression created an enormous problem with his that emotive decision to permit the 21,000 Chinese nationals, who were in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square situ-tion, to stay those four years. In speaking in debates in this place since then we have always recognised that was are involved. going to be a problem. Four years seemed in like a long time away at the time. It was a problem we put off for another day and, in stay. fact, for another government as it will probably turn out. But the time is getting at closer and the Committee has had to come to we grips with this matter. I think it has made we some very reasonable recommendations about handling of that. The recommendations actually accord with the Opposition's position on the subject which it has held right from day one, and that is to recommend that the approach to the problem should be nondiscriminatory and consistent with the way or others who seek residency or asylum in Australia are treated, and that is on a case by It is regrettable that the current Prime for Minister (Mr Keating) seems to have reaffirmed his predecessor's decision to create an underclass of people with limited rights as a permanent part of Australian society, but hopefully this will now change. The Commit. tee was very critical of the fact that people have been held in detention, referring parcomticularly to the situation at Port Hedland. comSome people have been in detention now for this almost three years and the Committee it believed that there should be limitations placed upon the legal processes that allow this happen. I have already alluded to the fact that those processes are extremely generous. The Government has announced its intention to do this. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has already picked that up. The Committee the expressed the view that detention of the Cambodians in particular has lasted for too any long and it is imperative the procedures which are in place do not allow a repetition of such lengthy detention. The Committee investigated situation at Port Hedland. It is a long way away for most of us. Most of us have the that conditions there are very poor, people there are very uncomfortable, and I am sure-although I have not been therethat that is the case. Nevertheless, the Comfor mittee believed that that facility should be maintained because, in the end, it speeds up the process and effectively benefits those who The Committee supported border claimants rights to access legal advice, but determined that public funds should not be utilised in pursuing unmeritorious claims through every avenue of appeal. I certainly support that and I believe the Australian community would also support that process.",20
23,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I return to the comments that have been made. I take the House back to the time when what was made clear to the Parliament and to the people of Australia, in a period which was highly emotional, was that no PRC citizen who was then seeking the benefits of government policy in respect of staying in Australia would be forced to return to China. We had a situation where the then Prime Minister Hawke made it perfectly clear that no one of those persons would be compelled to return against his will. That was subsequently re-endorsed by the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). One should look at the balanced presentation of the Opposition's position on that. I do not recall any situation in this House where it was made clear at the time that the Opposition was concerned to dissent from that position. It is perfectly true, as has been suggested, that the Opposition said that it wanted a case by case determination. That is a view I have no difficulty in supporting. It was open to the Opposition to use the processes of the House, at any time since those undertakings were given on behalf of the Australian Government, to say, 'No; we completely dissent from that. Our position is not only that we will have case by case determination, but also that we repudiate and will not be bound by the undertakings given by two Prime Ministers that no PRC applicants will be forced to go back to China against their will' That is the crux of the difference that exists between members of the Committee. As I say, I do not have any difficulty with case by case determination. The reality that has only recently emerged is that running through the logic of the position that has been taken is the problem of what happens at the end of that. That issue has been addressed by my colleague Senator Cooney and the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who sayand I join them in saying it-that one is bound not to repudiate the undertakings given by two Australian Prime Ministers. That is my view. Certainly, those undertakings were given in a situation-in the case of Prime Minister Hawke-where there was a high degree of emotional reaction; not merely within the Parliament, but within the Australian community. Mr Downer-That is how to make decisions, is it?",23
24,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"We would all prefer that it would not have happened; but at the end of the day, what is the word of a Prime Minister worth",23
25,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,We have a Westminster system.,23
26,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"There is a Westminster system. But the real issue-and it is very simple-is: if the Opposition now wants to say, 'We will not honour those undertakings' , that is its prerogative.",23
27,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,But your own people say that.,23
28,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"I am notarguing that the Opposition does not have the prerogative to say that. What I am saying, however, is that if Australia is to have any kind of reputation-not merely in the Asia-Pacific region, not merely in our dealings with our near neighbours, but in the world community-then it should not walk away lightly from the public undertakings given at the time, which were not subject to any clear dissent and repudiation at that time; it is as simple as that. At the end of the day, the developing relationship-not merely between Australia and China, but with other Asian neighbours. means that the refugee problem is not going to go away; it is not going to disappear ' overnight. It is not accurate to say that when people just land on our shores they are given an immediate welcome by the Australian Government; they are placed in detention while they are subject to very intensive interrogation to see what their actual status is. This is a problem for immigration authorities; it is a problem for the Government and it is a problem in relation to the maintenance of our standards. This report makes many positive recommendations. However, I would say the truth as to how we handle the situation of the PRC nationals lies somewhere between the position of the Chairman of the Committee, who I think has responded with integrity-I reject some of the allegations that unfortunately have been made in this debate-and the position taken by Senator Cooney. Because I was not present at the time, I choose to associate myself with their position. I say I do not want to be included as part of a majority decision, because at the end of the day I believe there is more damage done to Australia and to our reputation at every level if undertakings clearly given by Prime Ministers on behalf of the Government of Australia are not honoured, both in principle and in practice. That does not preclude a position that allows for an effective examination on a case by case determination. If one looks at the statements made by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) in respect of this very important matter, there qualifications and criteria which mean these matters can be processed. If the Opposition chooses to take another position, that is its responsibility. I believe that it is not merely a matter of justice for the younger students and the Chinese who came here on the basis of those undertakings but that one cannot lightly walk away from what they are entitled to believe was a position adopted by the Government, and which carried with it the implied endorsement of the Opposition at the time. If one looks very carefully at the record of the Opposition's position, it can be seen that, while it had qualifications, there was no occasion within this Parliament-with all the capacity during adjournment debates and for statements to be made-when there was a major dissent. At the time the undertaking was made, there was a principle statement on behalf of the Opposition which said, at that time, 'We will not be bound by, nor will we honour, any undertaking which says that no PRC applicant will be sent back to China against his will'. One may develop qualifications, but the reality is that that position was not taken by the Opposition at that time. While I have a high regard for the personal integrity of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), I do not believe the Opposition is entitled to take this position now. One has to balance out whether or not we stand by our obligations and our commitments or whether we now choose to accept, by virtue of a that change of leadership in the Opposition, a change in its attitude on a whole range of issues. Do we now say, not merely to the people who are caught up in this situation in Australia but to the Asia-Pacific region, that undertakings given by Australian Prime Ministers-whatever their political complexion-cannot be relied upon, cannot be acted upon, because tomorrow there may be a change of government and we want to repudiate, as a matter of political assessment, undertakings so clearly given? I do not believe that that is a general practice· in the history of this Commonwealth's government. There are certainly are changes in terms of domestic policies from time to time, but there are clear international implications in the stand that we take on refugee matters. I believe this is an important document. I commend the document as a whole, not only to the Parliament but also to other nation states. I do that because, as has been pointed out by the Chairman of the Committee, it is a document which will be looked at by other nation states that also have massive refugee problems confronting them. (TIme expired)",23
29,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has made a number of assertions in his second opportunity to speak to this particular report. Those assertions need to be rebutted, but in the first instance I must say that I do have respect for the honourable member's dedication in speaking twice to the same matter, bearing in mind that it is obviously quite impossible for the Government to find two people to defend the position it has taken. My hat goes off to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. In this particular instance, it is rather shameful that the Government could not find somebody else to put the point of view of either the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) or the Chairman of the Committee-whichever happens to be government policy-because it is clear that that is the nub of today's debate on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. The other interesting debating point made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is the principle that, whilst the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, made the wrong decision at the time because the circumstances obviously affected him emotionally, it is now up to the Parliament to substantiate that decision and support it because the former Prime Minister made it in the first instance. That is clearly a wrong principle. The other point made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that needs to be rebutted is his assertion that somehow the Opposition acceded to the Prime Minister's position at the time. That is clearly wrong. At the time the Prime Minister made his emotion-ridden decision to grant blanket protection in the form of four-year temporary entry permits to the 21,000 PRC nationals in Australia at the time of the massacre, the Opposition opposed the decision. I will reiterate the reasons for that opposition, for the benefit of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports who obviously has some trouble with his memory. Members of the Opposition opposed that decision becaus- claims for protection should have been made on a case-by-case basis against existing criteria. The decision not to determine claims on a case-by-case basis destroyed Australia's universal principle of nondiscrimination on the grounds of race and country of origin. I am not a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations but I have a great interest in this particular matter. It is clear, as I mentioned earlier, in the of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on Australia's refugee and humanitarian system that the conflict between the Chairman and the rest of the Committee, and also the conflict between the Chairman and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, is worthy of some substantial notice by the House. Clearly, that is a very important difference of opinion. The rather heated spat between the two individuals, as reported in the Telegraph Mirror on 18 September, following the equally heated Caucus immigration committee meeting which was closed in disarray after 15 minutes, makes it a matter of grave concern. When he was the Minister, would the honourable member for Melbourne Ports have tolerated a situation where there was an open breach with the second most senior spokesman for the Government on matters relating to immigration and migrant regulations? Of course not. He knows full well that that would not be the case. What about that particular spat? It was reported in the Telegraph Mirror as follows: MPs in House Brawl, Wild Corridor Clash. A longrunning row between a senior Government Minister and a Labor backbencher has erupted into a wild shouting match in the halls of Parliament House. Simmering resentment--;so it was not a temporary matterboiled over when Immigration Minister Gerry Hand and head of the Labor immigration committee Andrew Theophanous were involved in the verbal brawl in full view of an Opposition MP, parliamentary . and ministerial staff and a passing delegationwhich was from the United States, as it turns outRelations between the two have been worsening over differences in immigration policy, which resulted in open disagreement during an interview on the ABC's 7.30 Report. The argument on Wednesday followed conflict earlier that day between the two at a meeting of the Caucus Immigration Committee. That is no way to be running the country's immigration policy. There we have the senior spokesman for the Government on migration matters, the Minister, and the second most senior spokesman, the Chairman of the Joint report Standing Committee and the Caucus immigration committee, in open disagreement over a fundamental point in relation to the Government's migration policy. It is clear that to resolve this matter either one or the other must go. Either the Minister must go or the Chainnan must go-or both together. In this particular instance, bearing in mind that the policies of the Government have now started to converge very closely with those of the Opposition, it is probably a little more uncomfortable for the chainnan of the Committee, and therefore he ought to go. Clearly that irreconcilable difference between the two means that there is no longer the prospect for the right sort of relationship and ability to develop government policies in a rational and cool manner. Having said that, I want to point out that in relation to this it is quite clear that in the matter of these temporary visas issued to the PRC students the Government has moved closer and closer to mirroring the position taken by the Opposition ever since this matter first became an issue thanks to that emotionridden decision by the then Prime Minister in the first case. This is the nub of the dispute between the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and his Minister. The honourable member for Calwell made his view clear in a private conference in Melbourne in mid-September, which was reported by Millett in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 September as follows: The Chairman of the Caucus immigration committee, Dr Andrew Theophanous, said the Government was allowing the Coalition to set the agenda on immigration policy. He also accused the Government of not doing enough to differentiate between its own policies and those of the Coalition. . . Dr Theophanous cited as evidence of the Government's departure from its traditional stance its decision to cut the migrant intake severely year; its Budget measure denying migrant access to unemployment benefits until six months after entry; and its introduction of an English-language some migrant categories. And just as an amusing aside the report stated: Dr Theophanous is also understood to have complained about the Government's failure to curb its outspoken backbench immigration critics, Senator Peter Walsh and Graeme Campbell. I might also point out that this is not the only spat within the Labor movement in relation to this particular gulf-this difference in policy positions. I bring the attention of the House also to comments made by one of the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, Senator MCKiernan. He had a spat of his own with the former Prime Minister, Mr HAWKE - the person who is responsible for this particular state of affairs. As reported in the Sydney Morninr> Herald of 30 September: Mr Hawke, who was overseas when the report that is, the Joint Standing Committee's reportwas released early this month, told the Herald yesterday that the commitment should not be withdrawn. He also rejected criticism that the decision to offer sanctuary had been ill-considered and emotive. I just point out what Mr Millett went on to say in relation to Senator MCKiernan: 'I think Mr Hawke is wrong,' Senator MCKiernan said. 'The commitment has got to be reviewed. There are 17,000 reasons why it should be reviewed. 'It has caused a big furore in other ethnic communities. They are claiming that if the Government can do it for the Chinese, why can't it do it for the Bosnians and the Sri Lankans, whose plight is demonstrably worse.' Mr Deputy Speaker, need I say more about the disarray in the Government's migration policy? I just want to point out that in the speech I made in the MPI debate in this House on 5 May this year, I said: In June 1989, 20,000 Chinese students in Australia were given four-year temporary visas ... to remain. This decision to grant those visas was virtually a unilateral decision by an emotionally influenced Prime Minister who, in one fell swoop, corrupted the immigration program of this country. this ... This year about 14,000 dependents are expected to join the students in Australia. .. Of course, social security and other benefits were test for extended as a consequence. I then went on to say that Prime Minister Keating has compounded the original emotion-ridden decision of Prime Minister Hawke to destroy the equity, credibility and morality of Australia's refugee and humanitarian program. In concluding my comments I have to say, as I said earlier, that in this very substantial difference between the two most senior spokesmen for the Government in this policy area, one or the other must go. It is clear that one of them largely enjoys the support of the rest of the Government and the other does not. The Minister is going at the end of this particular parliamentary period. However, it is clear that in this most important policy area one or the other must go, and they must go soon. (Time expired)",24
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA NA,27
31,Dr CATLEY,AUSTRALIA,"I move: That this House reaffirms the need to create positive environment for business confidence to ensure investment in and the viability of the automotive industry in South Australia. I have moved this motion because of the debate about the automotive industry raging in South Australia at the moment which results from the commitment of the coalition to a zero tariff regime by the year 2000. The Opposition policies would do a lot of damage to the car industry in South Australia. Car making is a core business in South Australia; it is not peripheral to the operation of the economy. The metropolitan area of Adelaide, and it is very much a city-state, makes Mitsubishi cars in a plant employing between 3,500 and 4,000 people. It makes the Magna and its derivatives in the southern part of the metropolitan area. In the northern part of the metropolitan area, General Motors-Holden's makes the Commodore and its derivatives in a huge plant employing 7,000 people. In between these two, like the spine that holds the metropolitan economy together, there are component manufacturers varying in size and varying in product. They make mirrors, like Britax Rainsfords; shock absorbers, like Monroe; exhausts, like Walker Australia; and hoses, wheels and castings, rubber and plastic components, seat frames, brakes and fuel lines, jacks, batteries and various body panels. This industry employs one in five industrial workers in South Australia and perhaps 15 per cent of all workers in the metropolitan area of Adelaide are dependent on it. Without it, and without the skills which it has, there would be no MFP project in South Australia, there would be no submarine manufacture, there would be no technology park and there would be no whitegoods manufacture. South Australia's heritage not only includes the churches for which it is justly famous but also car making, which started in the 1920s with coach building at Birkenhead in Port Adelaide and has spread across the metropolitan area to encompass the industry I previously described. There has been a bipartisan commitment during that 80 years to support the car industry. It is a commitment that has extended through the Chifley a Government that saw the first General Motors-Holden roll off the line in 1948, through Menzies, Whitlam, Fraser and the present Government. At the State government level, it has extended from Sir Thomas Playford's very successful efforts to attract a greater car industry through to the premierships of Dunstan, Tonkin, Bannon and now Arnold-who, through the Little report, is doing his best to enhance the car industry. This Government is committed to improving and enhancing investment in the car industry through the plans of the 1980s and the latest plan enunciated last year-the Button Plan-which will take us to an apparent rate of tariff of 15 per cent in the year 2000, but, according to Industry Commission estimates, an effective rate of protection, incorporating the import-export facilitation programs, of 35 per cent. This will produce, as it is already producing, a leaner, exporting, internationally competitive industry producing a cheaper, better product. Cars that would have cost $33,000 had the existing program of 1983 been maintained now cost $23,000. Automotive exports during the same period of time have gone from almost zero to $l.2 billion. General Motors is planning to export 5,000 car units and Mitsubishi 15,000 units per year. The overall result is that within this plan the two major car makers and their component suppliers in the metropolitan area of Adelaide are planning to invest, and invest heavily, in an internationally competitive industry that can deal with a reduction in tariff rates to the level that we have enunciated-15/35 per cent by the year 2000. Into this context came the coalition's plans enunciated in late 1990 to move to a zero tariff regime by the year 2000. This derived, I believe, from two major sources: the ideological position of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) as a former professoof economics, deriving from chapter 6 of the standard economics primer, and the theory of comparative advantage as derived from David Ricardo, using the comparison between port exported by Portugal and textiles exported by England, with both of them concentrating on their comparative advantage and the historical result, of course, of the wealth of England and the poverty of Portugal. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), as a spokesman in this sector, derives his ideas, I believe, essentially from the National Farmers Federation agenda of 198-, which sought to produce a free trading envlfonmentbut now, I am sure, requires readjustment to an international environment which has not moved towards free trade but shows terrible indications of moving in precisely the opposite direction. The commitment of the two has produced a zero tariffs proposal which would, in the South Australian car industry, produce zero investment and, over the next decade, zero industry. There is no car industry in the world that survives without government intervention usually in the form of a strong commitment to protection against imports. In this respect, I quote Mike Quinn, the Chief Executive Officer of Mitsubishi, South Australia: All the car makers are multinationals and the demand on available capital is heavy. It is a resource and must be placed where it will work best. Once we lower tariffs to zero there will be no inc.entive to invest here. In America, Europe and ASia, there are voluntary import agreements and other non-tariff means of limiting exports from Japan. Those countries are saying to the exporters: ""You won't get access to the market unless you invest here. ""We would have to look seriously at whether we invested in a new model. The last one cost us $500 million., Und-r the Opposition tariff policy, we just wouldn t do It. There's no point. .. "". General Motors and the Federation of Automotive Parts Manufacturers have expressed similar views. I had occasion last year to visit the Nissan plant in Yokohama and see what that means in practice. It means the plant in Yokohama, with a tecbnologicallevel, I believe, essentially comparable to that of Mitsubishi in Adelaide but having a production run of over 400,000 units and a specifically designed multi-billion dollar facility for storage within 100 metres of a deep-water wharf. The result is that the marginal unit costs of producing the 400,OOOth car off that line is considerably lower than the marginal cost of producing the 40,oooth off the best production run we could manage in Australia. The transport unit cost is approximately, I am informed, as a result of this investment, about $500 per unit. One cannot live off the difference between the marginal cost of the 40,OOOth and the margin cost of the 400,OOOth with a transportation cost of $500 per unit. There requires a tariff intervention, which we believe is of the order of 15 per cent nominal and 35 per cent actual when taking into account the import-export facilitation plants. We are not alone in this field. It is interesting that the Liberal Party of South Australia is increasingly divided over whether we or the Opposition are right. The Leader of the Liberal Party Opposition in the South Australian Parliament is continually-and again this morning in the Financial Review is reported as doing it again-distancing himself from the objective of a zero tariff regime. I note that the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), who now has within his seat the Mitsubishi plant, has been careful to distance himself from the regime, limited and the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus), soon to run for Hindmarsh, who has a number of component manufacturers in her seat, has been careful not to support the zero tariff regime. If I am wrong, I am sure she will point this out to me. The point is that the difference between zero and 15/35 is the difference between the existence of a strong internationally competitive, internationally exporting, internationally performing car industry in South Australia and no industry at all. The difference between Adelaide with and without a car industry is the difference between a vibrant industrial base and a country town processing the surrounding products of the agricultural sector. The difference is tens of thousands if not 100,000 jobs. The difference will reverberate throughout the community, throughout the social structure and throughout the value of the asset structure of the metropolitan area of Adelaide. It is with some dismay that I raise this matter and alert the House to the need to ensure effective business confidence and investment in a viable automotive industry in South Australia and in the metropolitan area of Adelaide.",27
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,Is the motion seconded? Mr SawfordI second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,29
33,Mr MCLACHLAN,AUSTRALIA,"Barker) (10.46 a.m.)It is appropriate that this motion should come forward but it is quite extraordinary that the Government should have chosen to bring it forward so belatedly. Business confidence in the State of South Australia, not only in the automotive industry, is at its lowest ebb of any time· in the life of any of us in this House. Business confidence in the country is at its lowest ebb for 60 years but in South Australia in particular it is absolutely bottom, under water if you like. The Labor Party has been running that State and this country for all of the last 10 years. Mr Bannon became the Premier in November 1982 and Labor's institution, the State Bank, the institution that was going to provide such an elevated base for lending and has now given rise to the infamous State Bank affair, is the single worse example in this cpuntry of how to destroy confidence in a State and probably the single worse example of how to destroy the population's bank balance all at once. There are a number of reasons for business confidence being destroyed. First is Keating's national recession; the second is Bannon's South Australian depression; the third is that business taxes are too high; the fourth is that the population has not got enough after tax income; and the fifth is that too many people in this whole country who are the consumers, the customers, of the South Australian car industry are out of work. There is too much damnable debt at every single level, nearly all of which has been created since 1982, when Bannon acceded to power, or since 1983 when the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) started working on the national levers. As the Labor Party's customers are all over Australia, it has actually been in control of the fortunes of those customers for all of that time. Cars are too expensive and the cost of running them is too high. The honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) has alluded to the fact that the cost of cars has to come down and has come down. How do we know that cars are too expensive? The answer is that nobody is buying them. The average age of cars in this country is running up to nigh on 10 years. Australians are making do, under Labor, with much older cars that are less safe, use too much fuel, are less fuel efficient and are more polluting than they need be. From 1988 to 1991 the number of new cars sold in the United States per thousand head of population was 39. In Switzerland it was 47; in the United Kingdom it was 35; in Germany, one of the more affluent nations, it was 49. In Australia the average number of new cars sold between those three years-1988 to at rock 1991-was 26 per thousand people, a lot lower than the average of any of the other OECD countries. The Australian car market has been in recession for 15 years and Labor has been in control of this company for 10 of those 15. If honourable members opposite do not believe that, I remind them that from 1968 to 1974 the growth in the car market was 4.3 per cent; from 1974 to ,1982 it was 0.1 per cent; and from 1982 to 1991, under Labor, it was minus 1.6 per cent. That is proof that the motion moved by the honourable member for Adelaide is belatedly appropriate, but his reasons are absolutely wrong. It is not about the possible differences in fortunes or in tariffs or in taxes in the year 2000. It is about the disastrous fortunes of the Australian customer, the consumer, the man or woman who buys a car from South Australia, over the last 10 years. That is why confidence in this industry is at its lowest ebb for many a year. The Government has managed to lose 10,000 jobs in this industry in one year. We did not do that. Nobody was looking at what was going to happen to a tariff differential of between 15 per cent and 5 per cent, not zero per cent, by the year 2000. Honourable members opposite did that, all by themselves, and lost 15,000 jobs in two years. That takes a bit of doing. The car market has been stagnant in this country for 15 years. It need buyers. It needs confident buyers. It needs people who are in work. It is pretty hard for the million people who are out of work to buy a car. The market needs cheaper cars that cost less to run. That is why it needs a government which is prepared to create the arrangements where those actualities come to pass. To do that we are going to have to have very high productivity changes continuing to happen in the Australian car industry. Give it some credit for productivity gains. I give it great credit for the last two or three years. There is not a lot of credit to be given, with one exception, in our State of South Australia for what happened eight or 10 years ago, but certainly some credit should be given for quality and productivity changes in the last two or three years So we need very high productivity· and quality changes and we need to cut taxes. Why does the Government not cut industry taxes? Why keep taxes on inputs whether it is $100 or $300, whether it is a wholesale sales tax, a payroll tax or a superannuation guarantee levy? A wholesale sales tax on a business car today is $2,600 for an ordinary Falcon. The Government is continuing to charge the customer $2,600 and therefore he will not buy so many cars. Business cars in this country today are absorbing about 50 per cent of the market. In Western Australia,·they told me last week, it is 60 per cent of the market, and no doubt of a very recessed market. Why is the car industry continuing to have to pay governments, either State or Federal, for the honour and glory of producing a motor car? It is absolutely ridiculous and it is time that honourable members opposite understood what is necessary. Changes are urgently needed to get this industry going and those sitting opposite need to make those changes. The word - investment' is mentioned in the motion. Let us look at investment. General Motors has said that it will continuously invest. It, as those opposite know, is investing currently in a new paint line. It is a very expensive, very high quality paint line. Toyota, despite an interpretation out of Japan a few days ago by the Prime Minister, has subsequently said that its investment will go ahead at Altona. Mitsubishi has said several things. It has said that it might withdraw under the coalition policy-that is how I interpret it-but it has not said that it will invest under the policy of the Government. Ford has not said it will invest under either policy. Ford has not said that it will invest the $500m, $600m, or $700m necessary for its new model. These policy changes could be delivered by the Government. The tax reductions for the companies could be delivered if the Government had a mind to do it. The absolute commitment by car companies and their management to get ptoductivity and quality up could be delivered. It could be, in a sense, a continuous part of world's best practice every hour and every day if they wanted to deliver it. Tax reductions for the consumers, for tlte members of the Australian population who buy these cars, could be given. This Government has produced a climate of doom and gloom. That. could be changed to one of work and profit. The Government should listen very carefully, because if it does those things there are hundreds of thousands of new registrations to be gleaned in this country for Australian made cars. When the Opposition is in government we will do that. This Government will not get the opportunity to do so because it will not have any time left, but if it did it would have accomplished the objective of this motion. Therefore, the challenge is to any government and to the industry itself, no less to either. (Time expired)",29
34,Mr SAWFORD,AUSTRALIA,"Whenever we debate the coalition's zero tariff policies for the car industry it is certain that, with the mind of a grasshopper and exhibiting the behaviour of a lemming, honourable members opposite will fall over the cliff to political oblivion and end up as electoral dead meat. That is a colourful description, I admit, but how else would any rational person explain the stance of the Opposition on zero tariffs for the car industry to the year 2000? The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has a problem; the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) has a problem. It is a genuine problem and it simply will not go away. Essentially, it is one of leadership. It is a problem of refusing to listen to any view other than their own. It is a failure to accept that people with expertise in the car industry, with good motives and integrity, would ever disagree with the Leader of the Opposition or the honourable member for Barker. It is an inability to build bridges for the industry, which is one of the most significant employers in the country. It is also a lack of acknowledgment and awareness of the tremendous changes that have occurred in the car industry in recent years. It is an admission of preparedness to embrace policies without known outcomes. It is blatant incompetence; that is really what it is. It isa failure of political leadership. It is a failure of strategy. It is a failure of negotiation and exposition on the tariff issue and employment in the car industry. When it comes to listening to sensible views about the future of the Australian car industry, this coalition is stone deaf. The coalition's policies deserve nothing more than expiration but-as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has remarked in this House-slowly, very slowly, all the way up to the election. The coalition fails to understand that cutting tariffs alone will not bring about greater national competitiveness. The coalition also fails to understand that zero tariffs could lead to no industry whatsoever, and it admits to that publicly. The coalition also overlooks basic fundamentals in the car industry. The car industry in Australia is foreign owned. The size of our market means that manufacturers have to export to survive in the long run. The industry is remote from foreign markets. The only car industry in the world with negligible protection is in Japan, but the crucial point overlooked by the coalition is that Japan only stripped its industry of protection when it was established as the global leader. The Opposition did not mention that there is an overcapacity in the world to produce cars. Everyone knows that, yet the car makers in Australia wish to invest $2,200m over the next three years, but not with zero tariffs. It seems to every observer of this debate that the coalition considers everyone in the car industry to be wrong, yet considers itself, with no expertise in this industry, to be correct. What arrog-nce, what stupidity! Has the coalition listened to the Japanese car makers? No. Those car makers say there will be no car industry under the zero tariff proposals of the coalition. That is pretty much car to the point. That is pretty blunt. That is pretty clear. Representatives of the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association told the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) that Japanese investment would be jeopardised under the Opposition's policy. This is at a time when the Australian automobile industry is making considerable political progress and securing employment for Australians. Considerable changes-and they were acknowledged by the honourable member for Barker-have occurred in the car industry in Australia, but they seem to have passed by members of the coalition. In the last four years, faults in locally produced models have gone down by one-third. More importantly, the quality gap is closing on imports, for the first time ever. The number of industrial disputes is not only low, it is less than the manufacturing average. The inter- story on exports is just as good. As the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) pointed out, exports are now worth $1,200m, which is three times the level of five years ago. Last year in fact, automobile exports from Australia increased by 22 per cent and, as I mentioned earlier, current investment proposals total $2,200m for the next three years to 1995. Any sane, sensible person would conside- that to be progress. The policies of the Opposition would, as Japanese car makers have pointed out, wreck the industry. To whom are honourable members in the coalition listening, other Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Barker? To no-one, I presume. They are currently not listening to Australian car makers. Mitsubishi Motors Australia in South Australia would abandon .plans to invest $600m in South Australia if the coalition imposed its zero or negligible car tariff policy on the car industry, Mitsubishi, as the honourable member for Adelaide also pointed out, is one of South Australia's largest employers, and a decision by it to drop investment plans would be a crippling blow to the South Australian economy. Economic forecasters Arthur D. Little forecast tariffs in South Australia would lead to a 14 per cent unemployment rate in South Australia by the year 2000. The Managing Director of Mitsubishi, Mr Quinn, told the Adelaide Advertiser that Mitsubishi would walk away from a $100m engine plant expansion, and would not proceed with a new Magna model, under the coalition plan. He said: Under the Opposition tariff policy, we just wouldn't do it. There's no pbint. A decision not to invest in a new Magna would mean the company would switch to importing all its vehicles. It is a little 1968 and 1974, under the MCEwen plan, when all the growth-it was growth-was in imports. This in turn would force the closure of the Tonsley Park assembly plant and, in all likelihood, the Lonsdale engine plant. Why would anyone want that outcome? What about Toyota chief, Mr Robert Johnston? He slammed the coalition front bench as a group of farmers, economists and lawyers who did not listen to industry.. This is the company that plans to invest $750m in Melbourne. What about the head of Ford, Jac Nasser? He has warned that the company would review all its future investments in Australia if the coalition stuck by its tariff policy. What about the car component industry? It has claimed that the coalition's plans were crude and could force the international car giants out of Australia. The the Federation of Automotive Parts Manufacturers has said that the coalition's laissez-faire policy settings would spell the end of the road than the for large segments of the industry. Is the coalition listening to the Federation's Director, Mr Malcolm Stewart who, by the way, represents 200 manufacturers of car components who have 2,000 employees? No way. Is the coalition listening to people such as Colin Peter, the Managing Director of Castalloy Manufacturing, or Roger Pedrick, Group Managing Director of Hendersons Automotive? Listen to Colin Peter for just a moment: We've had our own particular discussions with both Ian MCLachlan and John Hewson and I rather doubt that either of those are moveable. that zero He then goes on: The Keating Government. . . I believe, at least has a view of the car manufacturing industry that says we have a plan. Roger Pedrick says: I think the coalition is just totally inflexible. OUf only hope at this stage is to talk to somebody that is close to the worJc force. . .  Keating Government'. A $50m investment by Victorian based electronic automotive component manufacturer Robert Bosch has been put on hold because of the coalition's policies. The Sales Director of Bosch, Mr like Barry Comden, said that he had come to the conclusion that the Opposition simply did not care whether the car industry continued to exist. He went on to say that the planned investment would create 100 jobs. But if we take the consequences of the Opposition policy to their logical conclusion, we would say that all 1,500 jobs at Bosch would now be in jeopardy. The coalition is simply not competent and not astute enough to build bridges with the car industry. The intransigence and lack of flexibility of the coalition are mind-boggling. The reason the coalition cannot build bridges is that its arguments are flawed, failing to coerce or to convince, and totally lacking in exposition. They have no known outcomes, except the probable destruction of the car industry and a massive loss of jobs. As I said at the outset, this is primarily debate about flawed leadership, a personality problem perhaps, and unknown outcomes emanating from coalition policies. No wonder so many of the coalition back bench have had glazed looks in recent weeks. The coalition also seems to be ignoring the wisdom and experience of its own back bench. Does it listen to the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) and the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred)? No. Does it listen to the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), who is from the National Party? No. Does it listen to the State Leader of the Liberal Party in South Australia? No. These honourable members are not alone in their concern. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), the Manager of Opposition Business in the House of Representatives, is worried about his constituents. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), the hon9urable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) all know that the automotive industries in their electorates would be wiped out under their leader's tariff policies. The honourable member for Hawker has nearly 3,500 employees in the motor industry in her electorate; the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), nearly 3,000; the honourable member for Ballarat, 1,000; the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), 1,000. I commend the motion to the House. (TIme expired)",31
35,Mr WILSON,AUSTRALIA,"It is quite clear that there has been a failure of leadership. That failure of leadership has a failure on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That failure of leadership has been a failure on the part of Premiers of South Australia. There is certainly a need to create in South Australia a positive environment for business confidence to ensure investment in, and the viability of, not only the automotive industry but other industries as well. Independent research has confirmed what most South Australians know-that there is a serious crisis of confidence about the a future of the State. Two out of three South Australians believe that under State and Federal Labor governments their State has been going in the wrong direction. Under Labor, South Australian industry has lost its competitive edge. The reasons are many, but I bring to the attention of the House three of them. Firstly, wage differentials have been eroded. Federal unions in place of State unions and the centralised wage fixation system have significantly reduced wage differentials. Fightback will empower South Australians to regain the edge. The cost of living in South Australia is lower than it is in other States. The mean weekly housing costs are $110, compared with $125 in Victoria and $139 per week in New South Wales. South Australia has a 2.4 per cent price advantage over other States in the average retail price of food. With Fightback and effective enterprise and plant based wage bargaining, South Australians could increase the wage rate advantage of their industries, retain their car plants and still maintain a higher standard of living than in the eastern States. 'Secondly, since the Tonkin Liberal Government was defeated in 1982, State debt has increased from $2.6 billion to $7.3 billion at 30 June 1992. An additional $450m of bank losses and this year's State Budget deficit of $317m will be added to the debt this year. To this level of disclosed State debt of about $8 billion must be added the unfunded liability of the State Public Service superannuation scheme, long service leave and holiday pay commitments, and the undisclosed liability to cover the losses of other government business enterprises which formed been part of South Australia Inc. State debt is heading for $10,000 per man, woman and child in the State. Is it any wonder that there is a crisis in confidence? There are few, least of all amongst those responsible for the State's major enterprises, who believe that those who got us into the morass of debt can get us out of it. Thirdly, since 1982, State taxes have increased by 197 per cent, compared with an increase of taxes nationwide of 171 per cent. South Australians in 1982 were burdened with the lowest level of State taxation, paying $7.22 per week for every man, woman and child. They now pay $20.68 per week per person, with the highest bank taxes, the highest State fuel taxes, the highest Workcover premiums, the second highest electricity tariffs and the highest mainland land tax· on high value industrial land. Few South Australians, and few of the State's industrial leaders, believe that those who have burdened us with these heavy taxes will be able to reduce them. As has been pointed out recently in what is known as the Arthur D. Little South Australian business climate study, a disproportionate amount of the finances of the State are being used by the government sector, reducing the level of resources available for business activity. The study pointed out that 'union backed State Labor governments have tended to be distributionists not productionists', that the governments did not see 'the need to implement an industrial policy that fundamentally addresses economic restructuring', and that 'by and large the policy has been one of shooting any bird that flies past rather than planning for the future economic well being of the State'. For a positive environment to be restored in South Australia, there must be a change of government, not only within the State but in Canberra as well. The tariff debate in which we are now engaged should be put in perspective. Tariff reform should not be made the scapegoat for the policy, management and leadership failures of others. As an idealist, I look to the achievement of free and fair trade within the nation and internationally. As a realist, living in an imperfect world, I appreciate that protectionist measures may be necessary to protect our industries as they move towards genuine international competitiveness. Our policies will enable our industries to achieve that competitiveness with minimal tariffs. As a South Australian, I want to make sure that in my State the economic environment is one that ensures that we have a viable car industry, and other industries as well. As with trade within our nation, so also with international trade: we must not only be vigilant but very active to ensure that fair trading relationships are not corrupted by restrictive trade practices of any kind-tariff barriers, quotas, regulatory exclusion, and strategic marketing practices-aimed at the destruction or transfer of efficient industries. Where others are corrupt we have to be prepared to protect our economic well-being. Tariffs alone have not been an effective or efficient shield. If our trade is attacked, we must be more sophisticated in the weapons we use to target those' who do not play the game. South Australians want a change of direction. South Australians want us to make major reformS to the tax system: under Fightback we will. South Australians want us to make major reforms to the, industrial system: under Fightback we will. Under the coalition's tax reforms, payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and fuel excise will be removed by October 1994. The superannuation levy will be frozen at its level at the time of the election, removing the obligation of industry to pay at least another 4 per cent of payroll by the year 2002. Personal income tax will be reduced on average by one-third. The Fightback reforms of the industrial system will permit enterprise and workplace bargaining. This will enable South Australian workers to keep their jobs and to maintain their standards of living whilst at the same time making possible a widening of the differentials between South Australia and the higher cost eastern States. These tax and industrial reforms will be undertaken long ,before tariffs are dropped below the 15 per cent accepted by the car manufacturers under a Labor plan which does not include major tax or industrial reforms. Ten years ago when the lAC recommended that import quotas and the local contents scheme be replaced by a tariff only regime, car makers then warned that such a policy threatened the demise of the industry in tenns similar to those expressed by the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley). Their old press releases are being reused. As before, they pleaded for special treatment for the car industry but not for others. I wonder what they would have said if we had put forward policy proposals to maintain the status quo for the car industry and those involved in it right down the line-employees and managers alike-and, at the same time, left them subject to Labor's system of industrial relations and Labor's tax regime whilst implementing the Fightback refonns throughout the rest of the economy. I am excited by the vision of the Fightback proposals. I am persuaded by their coherence and comprehensiveness. I am convinced of the commitment of the vast majority of my parliamentary colleagues to carry out the Fightback plan. I am optimistic, not pessimistic, about our ability to deliver the promised refonns. They will be implemented in the right order. Taxes will be abolished and the industrial system will be refonned to the advantage of industry, well ahead of tariff refonn. (Time expired)",33
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday.· TERTIARY EDUCATION: PRIVATE NA,35
37,Mr BRADFORD,PROVIDERS,"I move: That this Parliament: (1) congratulates Professor Harry Messel on his appointment as Chancellor of Bond University, noting his comments that Bond University will be the best university, public or private, in Australia in 10 years; and (2) recognises the potential role, in the creation diversity and quality, of private providers of tertiary education in Australia. I am very proud to have Bond University situated in my Gold Coast electorate and we certainly welcome the appointment of Professor Harry Messel as Chancellor of that university-its second chancellor. Professor Messel was appointed on 31 Apri11992. He is, by all accounts and by reputation and by achievement, an outstanding Australian. From 1952 unti11987 Professor Messel was Chair of Physics and head of the School of Physics at the University of Sydney. He has had an academic career par excellence. In 1979 his contribution in so many parts of the academic world and the community at large was recognised with the award of a CBE. Professor Messel's list of published work is a publication in itself, showing him as author, co-author or editor of more than 60 books. In his capacity as a specialist in theoretical nuclear physics, he has undertaken in excess of 100 world tours. Upon his appointment as Chancellor at Bond University, Professor Messel is reported as saying that Bond University will be the best university-public or private-in Australia in 10 years, and as saying, 'Woe betide tertiary education in Australia if the university does not succeed'. Professor Messel-and we must put what he says in the context of his wide and long experience in the public university system-went on to say: State universities in Australia have lost all their quality, they are running at Dead Sea level. He said further: It is a terrible thing to have happen, but it has, and the Government must take the blame for that. Pr-fessor Messel said that, and we in the Opposition agree very much with him. I think a lot of Australians would agree with his respected and informed opinion on the subject of education. The present centralised framework for higher education is severely restricting the number of places in universities. We have seen earlier this year as many as 50,000 young Australians missing out on places in universities. This Government has held out false hopes of education to the young people of of this country. Participation rates in high schools have increased and they have been increasing progressively for many years now. More children are staying at school and that can only be a good thing. But what about when they leave school? Where do they go? They cannot get jobs and 50,000 of them could not get into universities. We are aware that this year 150,000 were unable to get places in TAPE colleges. There is no doubt in our minds-nor in the minds, I am sure, of those who are so affected-that the Australian tertiary education system leaves a lot to be desired. I echo and support, as does this side of the House, what Professor Messel said on his appointment as Chancellor of Bond University. He said that the Government must take the blame for what has happened. This Government, instead of relying on incentives to achieve quality, has made it clear that it will increasingly rely on centralised monitoring of performance. It is, of course, a strategy doomed to failure. The strengthening of the student market, resulting from the funding of individuals which is proposed by the Opposition rather than the funding of institutions, will provide incentives for excellence in institutions. In particular, competition between private universities such as Bond, the first private university in Australia, and public universities will promote excellence. I have yet to hear from the Government-perhaps we will hear from the Government today-in relation to what its problem is with private universities. We have seen the flourishing and development of private secondary schools. We look to the United States where private universities predominate. Certainly, some of the excellent private universities there are household names to us here. What is this Government's problem with the development of private tertiary institutions? There has been in latter times some sort of a commitment to private providers of vocational training. The Government has been almost dragged to the point where it will allow that to develop but. it continues to make it difficult for those who want to get into that market to make things happen and to provide training for those 150,000 kids who this year could not get into TAFE. What is the Government's real problem with the development of private tertiary education and universities in particular? There are a few others on the drawing board but I hope that Bond University will be the first of many private universities in Australia. Clearly, that will be a very important part of the solution to the shortages of tertiary places which exist now and, in my mind, there is no doubt that it is also an important part of the solution to the problem of bringing back quality into tertiary education. Professor Messel said, when he was appointed, that it was the quality which had diminished so markedly and he blamed the Government for this; and we do too. In the sort of climate that the Opposition will create in government for private university development, of course, Bond will thrive. So far, it has succeeded in the face of considerable opposition from this Government, even outright denigration by the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). He could never help himself; he had every opportunity to tip the bucket on Bond. He generally chose the most opportune time to do it, just prior to enrolments. He would make some sort of statement to the community that there was some doubt about the viability of the university at the time it was out there seeking enrolments. Those sorts of acts by the Minister, in my view, were despicable. Not only did he fail to support that institution; he went about actively denigrating it. In the face of that opposition and in spite of that opposition, Bond has survived. It has done better than survive. From an initial enrolment of 300 students just three years ago, ·the figure has climbed now to 1,472, close to 1,500. That sort of growth rate is almost unmatched in public universities in Australia in that three-year period. I suspect it is almost unmatched in the world. If we looked at Harvard, Stanford or Yalesome of the great American private universities-we would find that they achieve nothing like that sort of growth rate. It would have taken them years to quadruple their enrolment numbers. Bond University has grown and as it has grown it has developed a reputation for excellence. It has a faculty which is extremely well qualified. It has an excellent student faculty ratio, and this is now being recognIsed and people are now wanting to go to Bond because of the product. In the end, that is the test of the university's success-what sort of a product it puts out at the other end. Bond graduates-those from the law faculty particularly come to mind-are now in demand. Bond has flourished and it prides itself on its enriched and accelerated degree program where personalised teaching by committed teachers ranks highly and students can graduate with a bachelors degree in two years. The Opposition will encourage private providers of tertiary education and training. We believe that this will provide places for kids who are now missing out. The Government has failed to deliver that. The solutions are obvious. Bond University is a part of the solution. I congratulate Professor Messel on his appointment, I share his vision, and I hope this Parliament does, for the future of Bond University. (TIme expired)",35
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROVIDERS,Is the motion seconded? Mrs Sullivan-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,37
39,Mrs JAKOBSEN,PROVIDERS,"Cowan) (11.27 a.m.)While I would hesitate to withhold support for the former part of the motion moved by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) and for its being debated, on the basis that it would be churlish not to congratulate Professor Messel on his appointment, it might be more appropriate to commiserate with him, given that he has chosen to tie his neck to the Bond University albatross. Nevertheless, I do wish him success. I cannot, however, support the second part of the motion, which runs completely counter to the notion of publicly funded tertiary education, which Australians expect to remain and which I wholeheartedly support. I have no doubt that the honourable member for MCPherson supports the terms of the motion absolutely-apart from the fact that he drafted it. Why would he not? He is very determined about free enterprise; he believes that everything can be done better in the private sector. He is, of course, mistaken. His defence of Bond University is an argument in favour of the Opposition's infamous Fightback proposals. The Government's primary responsibility is to ensure the adequacy and quality of the publicly funded tertiary education system. The point which is often overlooked by. those lauding the merits of private tertiary institutions, such as Bond University, is that the clientele for these institutions is currently very limited and depends entirely upon capacity to pay. That is how the selection could be carried out-not by the size of the brain, or the intellect, but by the size of the wallet. The Opposition will not succeed unless and until higher fees are charged at public tertiary institutions. I believe that this particular thrust is part of the whole Fightback strategy-that being able to take a voucher to any institution will enhance the prospects of viability of private tertiary institutions. Mr Bradford-Exactly, you have got it right.",37
40,Mrs JAKOBSEN,PROVIDERS,"I realise that; I am often right. The user pays principle is a favourite with the Opposition. It is, after all, the core of Fightback. Never mind that it is inequitable or unjust. Never mind that this closeted and elitist approach to education denies tertiary students the opportunity of mixing with people from different backgrounds and lifestyles or of choosing the course that they take on the basis of its appropriateness to their career choices, rather than its cost and their capacity to pay. Never mind that able students from disadvantaged families will either mortgage their futures in the attempt to succeed at university or not attend university at all. Support for private tertiary institutions of the level exhibited by the honourable member for MCPherson can only persist in circumstances where the conclusion has been reached that high fees will be charged in the public tertiary sector as well as the private tertiary sector. Only when these fees have been jacked up will there be any chance that the people might make a conscious choice to go to a private university where their money commands more respect. The question that needs to be asked in the context of this motion is: do we need private universities in Australia? The answer from my perspective is no. There may well be a place for them, but I do not believe. we need them. While there is a problem of people getting places in universities at the present time, it is not one which can be solved by cost. If it could be solved thus, then Bond University would be overflowing with students rather than begging for them. What most Australians are aware of is that we have a very good public tertiary education system. Our universities, of which there are now more since the colleges of advanced education changed their name and their structure, are in great demand, as are our TAFE facilities. This Government is committed to the creation of more places,- to the attainment and maintenance of quality in education at the tertiary level and to the ensuring of equitable access. To achieve equity of access, student attendance at all tertiary institutions as post-secondary schools is aided through Austudy wherever the cost of education would be prohibitive. As all honourable members of this House would be aware, the Austudy income support grant system was extended and augmented by an optional loan arrangement in the last Federal Budget. The number of students at Australian universities, including pre-1987 colleges of advanced education, has increased from 348,600 to around 560,000 in 1992, and our Government will fund a further 25,000 increase in student numbers between 1992 and 1994. By contrast, the policy of the Opposition centres on a voucher system, which I discussed earlier, with universities allowed to determine fees for all courses and all students. Such a policy would destroy equity of access. Opposition claims that fees would open up more places are untrue. Few students could afford fees which would average around $12,000 per year, ranging from $25,000 for a three-year arts degree to $130,000 for a six-year medicine degree. As I said earlier, the effect of the Opposition's policy in this regard would replace rationing of access according to academic ability with a rationing according to ability to pay. Promises to provide scholarships and favourable loans by the Opposition are hollow because the costings contained in the Fightback package make no provision for the substantial cost of such measures. Loans, therefore, would only be available on commercial terms, implying enormous debts for graduates and compounding at commercial interest rates. Another significant problem with the Opposition's policies is that they fail to recognise the substantial public good element in the higher education system. That is to say, the restriction of education on income grounds will inhibit our nation's ability to develop and adapt in future. A voucher system, as proposed by the Opposition, will result in a mismatch of student career choices with the demand for graduates, particularly in terms of the social needs for graduates. This point was made in a recent speech by the head of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' well as Committee, Professor MCKinnon, who said that his concerns about the voucher system include: how much intervention will be applied by government to prevent only 'popular' courses (such as medicine and law) being taught, and how to provide specialist needed but low student number courses. As vouchers would be allocated by the Commonwealth, the proposed system would effectively reduce institutional control over admissions policies of universities, which runs counter to things that the Opposition itself has claimed. As stated by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the policy is: to allow all universities to determine fees for all courses and all students. In short, there would be a proliferation of fee paying arrangements throughout the system, and the honourable member has described fees as the key element in this proposal. I agree that it is the key element. The Opposition promises that 'HECS and loan arrangements will be available' and, as I said, this is not even costed in Fightback. Even an interest subsidy·on commercial loans of this magnitUde would be substantial; a substantial cost would be implied, and the Department of Employment, Education and Training estimates that it would cost $30m in the first year, rising to $74m in the third year for an arrangement under which the Commonwealth would pay interest on loans until students graduate. However, no provision for even this cost was made in the Opposition's budget figuring and it must be concluded that these promises would not be fulfilled. The scholarships proposal of the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein, clearly failed to pass the Opposition's razor gang that drew up Fightback. This creates a poor preced-nt for all other higher education funding, as the Opposition in government-which hopefully it will never achieve-would attempt to plug the $3.9 billion hole identified by the Departments of Treasury and Finance. The Opposition promises to provide as many vouchers as places under the Government's rolling triennial program. However, it also promises to extend vouchers to Bond University. This substitution implies a reduction, perhaps of as many as 1,000, in student numbers. In short, Opposition proposals would fail to achieve the stated aims and would damage both the higher education system itself and the system's contribution to the broader Australian society. I believe that the current system of publicly funded tertiary education, when properly expanded, as this Government has done, and properly targeted, as this Government has done also, is the correct way to tackle higher education in a country such as Australia, and that Bond University, while able to continue its activities, ought not be propped up by the Government, nor should Opposition policies on the education voucher system be allowed to be implemented.

41,Mrs SULLIVAN,PROVIDERS,"It is my pleasure to second and to speak in support of this motion moved by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) this morning. I remind the Parliament of the subject, that this Parliament congratulates Professor Harry Messel on his appointment as Chancellor of Bond University, noting his comments that Bond University will be the best university, public or private, in Australia in 10 years; and, secondly, recognises the potential role in the creation of diversity and quality of private providers of tertiary education in Australia. I do not intend to be diverted at any length by the contribution just made by the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), but I do point out to her that Professor Harty Messel made that prediction about Bond University, having had a long life in public universities in this country, without any expectation of any change of policy in Australia. So he knows that Bond will stand or rise on its merits and it is indeed an outstanding example of a private institution. Further, I feel constrained to place on the record, in the light of what the honourable member for Cowan said, that Fightback provides an additional $3 billion at least for education. It is one of the very high priority, dramatically increased funding areas in the Fightback program. When the honourable member for Cowan said that there would only be a demand for private tertiary institutions when the coalition forces students to pay fees at public institutions, she was sadly wrong. She did, however, unfortunately exhibit the same characteristic as has the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, when he pursued a particularly bloody-minded attitude towards students of Bond University on the issue of Austudy. He finally came round to the view that students who qualified under the means test for Austudy, who happened to be attending Bond University, ought to be paid it. That was the only just and proper decision to make in the end, but he held out for years. . The situation is that Austudy is payable to students who come from low income families and who qualify for tertiary institutions-for quite some time, under the previous Minister, only those who went to public institutions qualified. The students in question who would have qualified for Austudy and who wanted to go to Bond University were not paying their own fees. They were very bright students who had won scholarships to attend Bond University. The scholarships paid the $30,000 in fees. There was no question of their ever being able to pay those fees themselves. Secondly, the students who were applying for Austudy had been accepted for entry into a public university. They had to go through that step anyway in order to get Austudy and, if they had taken up that offer of entry to a public institution, they would have cost the public purse the cost of educating them at the public institution, plus Austudy. I might say that it was welcome when finally the Minister saw the injustice of what he was doing and granted students who are at Bond University on scholarships the right to have Austudy. Nevertheless, this attitude towards the students in this case is an example of the deep envy felt towards Bond University from day one. The most disgraceful example of this was the vicious attacks on it, even the very concept, by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee when tertiary institutions were desperately short of places. There was no suggestion that· this institution was going to take any money or resources at all from public tertiary institutions. The vice-chancellors should have welcomed, firstly, the additional places that it was going to make available to students in the tertiary area and, secondly, the very different sorts of things it was setting out to do which could only have enriched-and, in fact, has been proven by history to have enriched-the whole area of academia. It is now a matter of history, of course, that the Vice-Chancellor of Bond University is a member of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. Another example of this mindless envy that I want to quickly give the Parliament today is the attitude of some guides to tertiary admission. I refer to an article on the subject in the Australian newspaper of May this year ,which, in relation to Professor Harry Messel, a very new Chancellor, said: ... attacked the decision by the University Admissions Centre (NSW and ACT) and the South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre to refuse Bond course advertising in its guides. . . The South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre's executive officer, Mr Chris Jenson, said the South Australian centre had a policy of taking advertising. When Professor Messel had approached the centre to place an advertisement, he had been knocked back. Mr Jenson is quoted as saying: I was in favour of including a paid advertisement but the management committee came to the' view it regarded Bond as a competitor. . . This publication tells South Australian students what courses are available at tertiary institutions in Australia. It really is very depressing that people who have such an important role to play in our tertiary sector of education-as those who are on the ATAC's management committee do-do not want South Australian students to know all the tertiary courses that are available in Australia because they might actually leave South Australia and go to some interstate university in preference to a South Australian university. I echo wholeheartedly all the things that the honourable member for MCPherson said about the contribution of private education in Australia. Time will not allow me to give my own views on those. I just want to put on the record the disgraceful approach that this Government has taken to Bond University. This was epitomised in an interview given by the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), on radio station2UE in February 1991. In response to a question generally on education, he made the comment: Had Bond University not been the abject failure that it's been then there would have been some extra thousands of places available for Queensland students at Bond University. The interviewer, Mr Jones, said: I think you're being a bit harsh there. It's not an abject failure. Further on in the transcript it says: DAWKINS: It has been a failure; it's been a total failure. JONES: No, it's not, no. DAWKINS: It's got hardly any students. JONES: No, no. Have you been there? Have you been there? DAWKINS: No, but I know. JONES: Hang on, hang on, that's unfair. I have been there often and it's not an abject failure. There are 1,000 kids and I have regular dialogues with many of them who in fact maintain the level of instruction is first class. DAWKINS: I'm not complaining about-They've got some of the, most superb academics in Australia. They're doing some good research work. It's been a failure in terms of its projections of undergraduate students. He can say it is a failure and damn it as he did without ever going there to look at it, talk to its people and find out the philosophy of those who are running it. As the honourable member for MCPherson pointed out, in fact it has grown very quickly for a new institution. I just want to add the point that it has grown very quickly at the same time as the publicly funded Gold Coast University College has grown at a phenomenal rate. In fact, I credit Alan Bond's announcement that there was going to be a Bond university on the Gold Coast for the fact that we got the Gold Coast University College at all-the Gold Coast CAE as it was then. The Hawke Government had been stalling for years and there was no sign of our getting a tertiary institution. I believe that in the end the Hawke Government was shamed into putting an institution into what was-and still is-the fastest growing part of Australia, with a very high percentage of young people in the tertiary education age group who were demanding tertiary education and were disadvantaged because they could not get any locally. So I congratulate Bond University on what it has done. It clearly has met a need, not in the Gold Coast region but in the area of education generally. It has been an outstanding success. What Mr Jones, the interviewer of the then Minister, pointed out was true. Students from Bond University are enormously enthusiastic about what they are getting. They are not all young people. A very large number of law students, for example, are qualified lawyers who enrolled to do the course in law at Bond University because they can gain so much from it. Even though they are practising lawyers, they can gain a great deal from going back and studying the special things that Bond University is offering. I wish Professor Harry Messel all the very best in his appointment as Chancellor. I know from his track record as an outstanding Australian over many years that he will be a great advocate for Bond University. With the great wisdom and drive that he brought to the University of Sydney in his time as Professor of Physics, I know that he will take Bond University on to meet its destiny, which is to be one of the leading tertiary institutions in Australia and to establish its reputation throughout the world. (TIme expired)",39
42,Mr GEAR,PROVIDERS,"All of us on the backbench realise that private members' business does throw up some rather interesting motions, none more interesting than this one. One can understand why the honourable member· for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) moved such a motion, because obviously the university is in his electorate. Obviously, that is the main rationale for it. I can remember the days when the Bond University was to be established. In fact, I made a speech on it in the old House. If my memory serves me correctly, the reason that Bond University was established was not to meet some lofty ideal about meeting a need for education in Australia. The reason that Bond University was established was to flog off building blocks on the Gold Coast. Alan Bond comes from Western Australia, as I do, and one thing we know about Bondy is that he has never had a burning passion about higher education. It has never been one of his strong suits, but building blocks have been. One of the ways in which Mr Bond just could move a few buildings blocks on the Gold Coast was to establish a university on a piece of land that at the time was useless, in the hope that the surrounding land would improve in value and, once subdivided, would return a handsome profit to the Bond Corporation. So let us not delude ourselves. about why Bond University was established. That is exactly why it was established. There was no other reason. I am not going to get up here today and bag Bond University and, in fact, I wish it well. If people want to get their education at the Bond University and pay the fees that are demanded, good luck to them. A common' thread in the debate from the Opiosition - ide of this House is that if something is run by the private sector it must be inherently good, but if something is run by the public sector it must be inherently bad or inferior to anything that is run by the private sector. That is the sort of sentiment we have heard today. People say that this magnificent university established on the Gold Coast is going to be the best in Australia in 10 years time. Let us have a look in 10 years time. I wonder whether the Bond University can measure up to the Australian National University in terms of esteem, in terms of the quality of its product. Only time will tell. But this idea that somehow because it is privately run it will inherently be better, I think, damages the case that has been put here today. The mover of the motion talked about the great private universities in the United States of America. Of course they are great universities; they have been there for hundreds of years. They are established in their own right. A person could not imagine that any university established in Australia in the last 10 years could be remotely compared with them. I wonder whether there is a great need for private universities. Certainly I have never had a letter from any of my constituents in over nine years in parliament saying tome that there is a great need out there for private universities. I agree that there are calls for more sity places but that is more as a result of the policies of this Government, which has put a premium on education, not only for the private sector but more importantly for the kids who are finishing secondary school. I say that, because it is the case that if a person does not finish secondary school then he cannot go on to university. One of the great failings in the system for people with children in my electorate, or in working class electorates in this country, was that most of their kids never got through secondary school so that they could line up for places at universities. That has changed. The rett{ntion rates, as we all know, have gone from an abysmal 30 per cent or thereabouts to over 70 per cent now. That generates more demand for places and that demand has been met. In fact, the number of university places has increased from 376,500 in 1987 to 520,000 at present. That is the equivalent of about 12 universities being established in the last few years. That is meeting the demand for places. Another argument that runs through all of this is the so-called freedom of choice argument. The freedom of choice argument is not used only in education; it is used also in health. Yesterday we heard the freedom of choice argument used once again in industrial relations. There are a few things I can say about freedom of choice. The first one is that a person has to be able to afford it. A person has to be able to afford freedom of choice. Freedom of choice by its very nature must advantage those people on higher incomes or with greater wealth. The Opposition's education policy is a classic example of that. In that policy every student in Australia will be given a voucher with the same value and the universities can set the cost of the courses. All students will then have to buy their places in universities. A person does not have to be Einstein to figure out what is going to be the end result of that. The vouchers will never cover the cost of the course. Then the freedom of choice argument comes down to whether a person can afford the gap between the value of the voucher and the cost of the course. univerWhen people talk about freedom of choice they are talking about the people who can afford it, not the people who cannot. This Government has never accepted that view and never will. We accept that out in the community there are people who do need assistance. There are people from working class areas such as the one I represent who would lose out under that situation. They would never have the freedom of choice and would be' much better served by the present situation where access to higher education is on merit rather than on ability to pay. In fact, the current situation with regard to higher education is that there are no up-front costs. If a person's TE scores are high enough to allow that person to enter a course then that person will enter a course. I have yet to hear any criticism of the graduates of our universities, in this country or in any other country. I have never heard calls from private institutions which say they are going to be the best in Australia in 10 years. The only people who make those statements, obviously-and I do not blame them-are the people who are associated with Bond University. Mr Ronaldson-What about the ones who can't get in?",41
43,Mr GEAR,PROVIDERS,"I have covered that, but obviously the honourable member was not listening. Let me speak about the ethos. There is a certain. ethos that develops about these universities. I suppose that for Bond University the one that we remember was pointed out by the Prime Minister in Question Time a couple of days ago: the Gordon Gecko Ball-greed is good. That is the name of Bond University's annual ball, and that is the sort of ethos that is paraded around Bond University. I wonder if that is the sort of value we want to put into our students: the Gordon Gecko view of life that greed is good, that you are not a success unless you are a self-made millionaire, and that if for some reason you take on some other role in life that may not return you that sort of money then somehow you are a failure. I do not think it is. When I talk to people in Australia about universities, about higher education, or about education in general, I do not hear complaints. I do not hear complaints about the quality or the quantity of it. 1 hear occasional bleats from the Opposition members, but they complain about everything and tell us about nothing. They talk about increasing the number of places in line with demand, but one only has to look at the Fightback policies or at Fightback! itself. The sole purpose of the Fightback! document is to make governments smaller. I wonder whether education or any other area of government involvement in Australia would be enhanced by cutting the Federal Budget by 10 per cent or $1O,OOOm a year. (Time expired)",43
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PROVIDERS,Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made - order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading Consideration resumed from 17 September.,43
45,Mr KERR,PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGES,I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr Melham - I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,43
46,Mr KERR,PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on presentation of this Bill I adopted unreservedly what was said by Mr Spender, QC, the then shadow Attorney-General, in the House of Representatives debate on May 1987. He said: Let us take a hypothetical case in which a witness comes before a parliamentary committee and gives evidence which is quite untruthful and which amounts to a charge of serious criminal conduct against a third person. That third person is charged. The same witness is called and gives different evidence but the evidence is vital to the case, for example, vital to the prosecution. Should it not be open to the accused person to say: 'The evidence he is giving is untruthful. What he says now is different from what he said before the parliamentary committee. '? That statement summarises the nub of the evil that this Bill is intended to remedy. I do not want to canvass again all that was said when I presented this Bill. For the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act, should this legislation be ultimately enacted I would ask readers to incorporate what was said on presentation into this second reading speech. The point I want to make today is that the dangers warned of by Mr Spender and others are not hypothetical dangers. They are not fanciful dangers. There are many occasions in this Parliament on which witnesses come before committees and make allegations of fraudulent or criminal conduct. For example, in hearings before the Public Accounts Committee members have heard allegations regarding fraudulent tendering procedures, corruption in the Federal Airports Commission and improper conduct by Customs officers. Those allegations may give rise to criminal proceedings. If they do, then the same persons who have made allegations before a House committee or a joint committee may be called to give evidence in the trial. If they then give inconsistent evidence, a great injustice may be occasioned in the trial if defence counsel are not permitted to controvert what they are now saying by raising the fact that they have given prior inconsistent evidence in parliamentary hearings. A simple example that might show the political significance of this is the Murphy trial, where the evidence given before the Senate committee regarding words which were alleged to have been be spoken by the then High Court judge, words which were alleged to be: 'Now what about my little mate?', took on very great political significance. Had Murphy not been allowed to draw attention to discrepancies between what was said in the Senate and at his trial, a great injustice could have been occasioned. The IflW facilitates defence counsel drawing attention - o prior inconsistent statements because, whatever the. circumstances, it is material that a different account has been given. There are three possible ways in which a prior inconsistent statement is material. Firstly, it is possible that the witness has lied to Parliament but is telling the truth before tJIe tribunal. Nonetheless, the point that the witness has lied on oath before a parliamentary committee is surely material to his general veracity and reliability as a truthful giver of evidence. Secondly, it is possible that the witness is lying to the court. Obviously it is self-evident that that is material. Thirdly, it is possible that the witness honestly has a poor recollection and is giving a different account with no malice. It is obvious that it is relevant to draw attention to the different accounts. At the moment, no other tribunal has a privilege that goes as far as this Parliament. If you give evidence before a court, you are privileged, but if you have given prior inconsistent evidence in court it is always possible to draw attention to that fact. As Sir Clarry Harders says, the whole world may comment on these inconsistencies, but under the present law regarding privilege it is not possible to raise this very matter in a court where someone's freedom is at risk. So I urge members of the House to give very serious consideration to the issues which have been put before the House in this Bill, and I urge members to consider and to read the paper that Sir Clarry wrote, which has promoted the introduction of this legislation. (TIme expired).",43
47,Mr RONALDSON,PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGES,"In the short time that is available to me today to discuss the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment Bill, I will discuss briefly the history of this matter. I commend to honourable members the explanatory memorandum to the Parliamentary Privileges Bill in which there was a lengthy discussion about the historical significance of the events that were a precursor to what was to become the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. Indeed from that explanatory memorandum, I quote the following passage: The purpose of this clause is to avoid the consequences of the interpretation of article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 by the judgement of Mr Justice Cantor or Mr Justice Hunt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. As honourable members are probably aware, these judgments arose from the Murphy trials and it was as a result of those trials that the Parliament of the day effectively decided it needed to step in and restore the interpretation of article 9 of the Bill of Rights and remove any restrictive meaning as given by Mr Justice Hunt in the second Murphy triaL There was some extremely interesting information to be gleaned from the speeches that were made in this House during the debate on the Parliamentary Privileges Bill. Just to mention some, I refer to the former Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, the former member for North Sydney, Mr John Spender, and indeed the present honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran). I also gather from reading debate on the matter that the present Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) expressed concerns which I believe reflect the concerns of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the former member for North Sydney, and the honourable member for Gippsland. My personal view is that this Bill before the House again risks muddying of the waters, which were the sentiments expressed by a number of honourable members when the Bill that became the principal Act was first being debated some years ago. I believe that, if this Bill were to become law, then it would lead to a steady watering down of article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688, and whether retaining those principles is a good thing or a bad thing should really be a matter for separate debate. Rather than risk the watering down of article 9 and indeed section 16 of the principal Act, I believe it would be far more appropriate to adopt. a different course than that proposed in this Bill. Surely, if it is drawn to the attention of the Parliament that a person who has given evidence in a court of law countering evidence previously given under oath to a parliamentary committee, then the Parliament should be able to take action against that person. Indeed, the situation should be the same if it is drawn to the Parliament's attention that a witness at a previous parliamentary committee makes public statements contrary to those given to the parliamentary committee such as to indicate that the witness had perjured himself or herself before the Committee. In my view, a better legislative amendment to section 16 would be one that referred a matter of conflicting evidence back to the Standing Committee on Privileges, which would duly have the right to recommend to parliament the penalties to be imposed similar to those in section 7 of the principal Act: If a case of perjury before a parliamentary committee hearing is made out as evidenced by conflicting sworn evidence in a court of law, then parliament should have the right to deal with the matter accordingly. In his speech on this matter on 5 May 1987, my friend and colleague the honourable member for Gippsland said that he feared· that witnesses could give evidence before a parliamentary committee but later in a court of law could give a completely different type of evidence and there would be no way of crossexamining them to show in the court that they were perjuring themselves. I know that through this Bill the honourable member for Denison is trying to address that very situation. Indeed, I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments that he· has expressed today and that he is trying to express in the Bill itself. With the greatest respect to those responsible, the Bill is fairly loosely drafted, and I have some complaints in relation to that. We really need to address the question of that 1688 Bill of Rights and whether we accept the principles behind it. If, as a parliament, we do not accept them, then let us debate them. But the watering down of this Bill is effectively winding the clock back to the judgment of Justice Hunt and Justice Cantor and the problems that that caused, as expressed by Mr Spender and others. At the end of the day, Senator Evans decided-I think on the balance of probabilities, despite it not being really what he wanted to dothat, rather than risk that mUddying, he would support it, I think somewhat reluctantly. At the end of the day it was accepted-and the honourable member for Denison will correct me if I am wrong-by Mr Spender, but with some reluctance. Quite frankly, I fully concur with their reluctance. I concur .with the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Denison, but I do not know, unless we have a full debate on the principles of the Bill of Rights, whether this Bill achieves what we want it to achieve. The far better course is to have a provision available to the Parliament to refer that sort of conflicting evidence back to the Parliament to be dealt with. (TIme expired)",44
48,Mr MELHAM,PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGES,"I am pleased to support the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment Bill. In my view, the current provisions of subsection 16(3) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act carry the reach of parliamentary privilege too far. That subsection imposes a significant restriction on the right of accused persons to defend themselves in proceedings in which they are in peril in a court or in a tribunal. What we are talking mainly about here is the liberty of the subject. The Bill before the House seeks to delete subsection (3) of section 16 of the principal Act and to replace it with the following subsection: (3A) If: (a) a person (the 'witness') gives evidence against another person in a court or tribunal; and (b) the witness had previously made a statement in evidence before a House or a committee; andand this is the hub of it(c) that statement is not consistent with the evidence given by the witness in the court or tribunal; the other person may test the credibility of the witness by questioning the witness with regard to that statement. The explanatory memorandum to this Bill explains the position quite succinctly. It reads: The amendment proposed by this Bill applies where a person gives evidence against another person in a court or in another tribunal. If the person the evidence has previously made a statement in evidence to a House or to a committee, and the statement is not consistent with the person's evidence to the court or tribunal, the person's credibility may be tested by questioning in the court or tribunal as to the statement he or she made amended, or this Parliament to the House or committee. In all other respects, the protection provided by subsection 16(3) will continue to apply. For example, evidence given by a witness to a Parliamentary Committee cannot be used either as a basis for legal proceedings against the witness or to support legal proceedings against a witness which arose from matters occurring outside Parliament. So what we are talking about in this Bill is testing the credibility of witnesses, not about using the evidence that they gave before the committee or the Parliament against them. We need to sit back and reflect what we are about. Are we about allowing someone to give contradictory evidence in criminal proceedings which could send someone to gaol for many yeats, which could have resulted from the Murphy and Foord trials? Where would we as a parliament be in the eyes of the public if people could come before us as witnesses and say one thing but in criminal proceedings say another and not be tested as to the inconsistency? It is an absurd,ty; it is a nonsense; it carries parliamentary privilege too far. It is an unintended consequence, in my view, of legislation that should have been scrutinised more closely. The shadow Attorney-General at the time, John Spender, QC, who has experience in these matters, hit the nail on the head. The caution that he gave at the time is correct, in my opinion. It is an absurdity. The situation is that we as a parliament need to rectify it. We need to sit back and say, 'What are we about?'. As it is, parliamentary privilege is attacked; this House is impugned outside because it is referred toquite properly in a number of cases-as cowards' castle. This Bill does not seek to go behind cowards' castle in using statements by members or witnesses in this House or in committees of this House against them. What it says is that, if people bring themselves forward in a tribunal or a .court and assert certain things, their credibility can be tested giving by reference to prior statements that they made. That is all this Bill attempts to do-to right what in my opinion is a very grave wrong. Subsection 16(3) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, as it stands now, should be will further down the track find itself in this absurd situation where someone can be sent to gaol for many years by giving evidence of a different nature in court and not having evidence given before this Parliament or before the committees of this Parliament tested.

49,Mr MACK,PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGES,"North Sydney) (12.12. p.m.)While I appreciate the motivation of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) in bringing forward the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment Bill, I take the view that it is, on balance, undesirable. First, the Bill would detract from the Parliament's standing in relation to the courts; it would erode the immunities of members and senators, as well as other persons appearing as witnesses before parliamentary committees. Secondly, the evil it purports to address involves evidence given to a court which contradicts evidence given to parliament. Such circumstances are rare and I think that the occasions on which they had any significance would be even rarer. Thirdly, the proposed amendment creates a greater evil in that persons giving evidence to Parliament might be deterred from doing so by the possibility that they will later be attacked in court. Fourthly, I agree with my predecessor as the member for North Sydney, Mr John Spender, QC, who said in 1987 that he would move an amendment along the lines of what is now being proposed, but decided against it when he realised that it would create more problems than it would solve. The exhaustive examination of the matter at that time ended with the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, Mr Spender, the Deputy Chairman, Senator Evans, and the House realising that the anomalies that would be created by the proposal in the Bill before us are certainly worse than anything it attempts to solve. I believe it would be unwise for this Parliament to give up any of the privileges and immunities which it has inherited from the House of Commons under the terms of the Commonwealth Constitution. The origin of those privileges and immunities is the Bill of Rights of 1688, article 9 of which states: The freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or tioned in any court or place out of Parliament. This supremacy of parliament was recognised only after a long struggle between the House of Commons and the' Tudor and Stuart monarchs, who applied the civil and criminal laws to suppress debate and intimidate parliamentarians. The Bill now before the House would make a small but nevertheless significant inroad into the privileges assured to the Australian Parliament. These privileges, coming from the Bill of Rights and the Australian Constitution, were reaffirmed in 1987. The Bill opens the door sufficiently for any powerful interests to set their lawyers on to people for the things they say or do in parliament. Far from helping to obtain the truth, this power will, on the evidence of history, be more often misused to obscure and intimidate. The Bill of Rights seems to make it clear that in a clash between the powers of parliaments and courts, parliament should prevail. Such a clash is not merely a theoretical possibility; it happened only last year in the dispute over the Westpac papers. I am aware of legal opinions that would interpret the Bill of Rights and the rights of this Parliament quite differently, so as to put the court's powers above parliament's, but that is a lawyer's view of the world and one which I reject. I think it is enough to say that the vast majority of people would not be so foolish as to try to tell one story in evidence to a parliamentary committee and then give a different story to a court. Parliamentary proceedings are recorded and important evidence before committees is increasingly being reported by the news media. No reasonable person giving evidence in another far public forum could expect to contradict important evidence given to parliament without achieving notoriety. There are legal sanctions for the few who might attempt this, including the possibility of perjury charges, without the need to erode parliamentary privilege. People who wish to appear before parliamentary committees to give evidence should not be dissuaded from exercising their rights. The Bill before us has questhe potential to do that. People wanting to give evidence to a parliamentary committee about some powerful corporation may be intimidated and deterred from doing so by the knowledge that its lawyers may create an opportunity to attack them in subsequent legal proceedings irrespective of whether the evidence varied or not. When considering the Parliamentary Privileges Act in 1987 the House appreciated these problems in trying to formulate an exception to parliamentary immunity as the Bill now attempts to do, but I view the Bill in the same light as the House viewed it at that time.

50,Mr FILING,SEWAGE DISPOSAL,"I move: That this House: (1) recognises the environmental costs associated with sewage effluent disposal into ocean systems; (2) urges government bodies responsible for sewage disposal methods to consider alternative waste treatment irrigation schemes that would recycle and utilise treated sewage effluent productively in an environmentally responsible manner; and (3) recognises the irrigation sewage treatment scheme proposed as. an alternative to the Beenyup Wastewater Treatment Plant (BWTP) north of Perth, which would result in less pollution of our marine environment than the operation of the BWTP, and while subject to stringent environmental standards, would provide economic benefits through the sale timber and employment of labour. In speaking to this motion I will be commenting on the problems facing Australia with respect to the use of scarce resources and waste treatment. I will discuss some alternative methods of waste treatment. Although much research is still to be done in assessing the environmental and economic implications of these methods, urgent consideration must be given to implementing some of these alternatives. A recent report by the Deputy Chief of the CSIRO Division of Water Resources, Dr John Thomas, and an economist from the University of Western Australia, Dr Paul MCLeod, alleges that existing methods of water supply and waste treatment have reached their technological and economic limits. The report looked at the efficiency with which Australian cities were using their $50 billion worth of water assets and estimated that every year Australia was underspending on asset replacement by $500m. The question was raised as to whether Australian cities could afford the cost of building enormous new networks of pipes, distant headworks and other infrastructure to support planned metropolitan expansion in outer suburban areas. The report concluded that it was no longer acceptable for Australian cities to dump vast amounts of treated sewage in the sea or to waste the even greater volume of fresh water at its disposal. Specific solutions to the problems associated with water and water disposal have yet to be formulated. However, it is apparent that the solutions will have to involve the use of less water, more recycling, increased water harvesting near cities, retention of sewage slurry on the land for incorporation in agriculture, and new technologies for purification. A change in attitude' must be made, as illustrated by CSIRO scientist Dr Wilf Crane. Dr Crane is involved in a project in New South Wales designed to set national guidelines on the effectiveness and sustainability of forests in treating municipal effluent and producing timber. He said: It's time we stopped thinking of effluent as a problem and began to think how we can use it. . . of For too long we have harboured the idea that you can just flush effluent away and it will disappear In May 1990, the environment review reported on South Australia's Bolivar scheme where recycled sewage sludge was used to fertilise tree plantations. The Hunter Water Board in Newcastle, New South Wales, and the city of Geelong, Victoria, have also adopted the practice. The Geelong Water Board has planted in excess of 15,000 red gums on 16 hectares of land adjacent to its sewage treatment plants. Until 1988 the treated sewage effluent was discharged directly into the ocean. From 1988 to 1990, the trees treated with effluent reached a height of 1.8 metres and consumed 25 megalitres of the effluent. The plantation is expected to yield fuel wood from a forest of 165,000 trees. In a new project to reduce waterways pollution in Albany, Western Australia, Tasmanian blue gums, river reds, rose and ribbon gums will be planted as part of the plan to combine tree farming and the control of water and nutrient flow. Effluent will receive secondary treatment at an established sewage plant before it flows through pasture land and is then pumped slowly on to the trees. This process, known as slow .rate infiltration, irrigates the tree plantation with a nutrient rich effluent from the town. The choice of eastern eucalypts over Western Australian trees is significant as the eucalypts grow at twice the rate of seedlings and allegedly absorb more water than any Western Australian tree while producing high grade timber. It is hoped that the proposal will ultimately allow for the removal of a sewage outfall point at Point King in Albany which has been responsible for the large amount of nutrients in water around that city. The proposal was precipitated by the Environmental Protection Authority recommendation in 1990 that the Water Authority of Western Australia shut down Albany's main waste water treatment plant within four years, and has been referred to as 'an environmental revolution for the disposal of domestic waste water'. However, it is worth mentioning that, although the concept of land disposal of waste water is not new, few systems have been thoroughly monitored for their environmental impacts, particularly on groundwater. This would be a significant factor in the viability of a recent proposal to replace the Beenyup Wastewater Treatment Plant located on the coast north of Perth with an irrigation scheme utilising treated sewage effluent for the growth of hardwoods. The scheme proposed by local marine scientists Craig Manning and Hugh Kirkman involves planting and harvesting eucalyptus trees on land irrigated with sewage effluent as opposed to discharging the treated effluent into the area of ocean .known as the Marmion Marine Park via the Beenyup Wastewater Treatment Plant. It is proposed that the project would reap dollars for the local community from the sale of wood and create much needed jobs for the unemployed in Wanneroo. This issue is of great importance to the people of my electorate because theWAWA is proposing to increase the volume of treated sewage dumped into the ocean from the BWTP. A second pipeline extending offshore into the Marmion Marine Park has recently been built with this in mind. The WAWA is also currently involved in undertaking a study on the effects of pollution in ocean water around Perth including the MMP. However, no data on the effects of an increased volume of treated sewage effluent disposal on the Marmion Marine Park environment is yet available. In the absence of further information, the EPA has not permitted any further increases in the total load being discharged in the treated effluent with the operation of the second outlet. Although this maintains the status quo, the cost of improved treatment will go up and more of our precious water supplies will be expelled with the treated effluent as the population increases. These guidelines for the nutrient loading have been set by the EPA, with the provision that they cannot be changed pending the outcome of the joint EPA and Western Australia Water Authority Perth coastal water study due for completion in 1994. As part of the report, the WAWA is obligated through statutory requirements set by the Minister for the Environment to look at different methods of waste water disposal and to present conclusions of these investigations to the EPA by 1994. It is the responsibility of the relevant planning authorities to seriously look at the waste disposal options available to the in, and not to simply fulfil the statutory conditions set for them. It is essential that we provide a 1990s strategy for waste disposal given that the time frame for planning, design and environmental approvals can take up to 10 years. My electorate is situated in the second fastest expanding residential region in Australia, Perth's northern corridor. The implications of this expansion on our environment are many. A far sighted approach to infrastructure development to service this rapidly expanding community is absolutely essential. Irrigation projects utilising treated sewage effluent are currently used to service smaller communities around Australia. These initiatives have not yet been adopted on a large scale in metropolitan centres. New approaches to waste treatment for urban areas may have to be considered. ' One of the major issues of importance for an urban waste treatment irrigation scheme is the large amount of land required. This is why irrigation initiatives have to be part of a long term planning approach to the urbanisation and development of our metropolitan centres, and they need to be considered now. As pointed out by Mr Geoff Bott, environmental officer with the Environmental Protection Authority in Western Australia, the impact on soil and vegetation as well as animal and insect life also has to be considered, as does the impact on groundwater supplies. Climatic conditions, possible run-off from site, and the absorption potential of trees used to take in treated effluent are some of the other factors that need to be considered. I briefly tum to another alternative waste treatment process known as BIOCYCLE. This is a domestic waste water treatment system. It has been developed as an alternative to septic treatment. Essentially, it is a treatment plant similar in concept to the large sewage treatment plants used in metropolitan centres but on a domestic level. The BIOCYCLE system has achieved national and international recognition through being featured on Beyond· 2000, Burke s Backyard and in House and Garden magazine. It removes most nutrients from effluent and relies on further nutrient removal at the quadriciary stage-irrigation or land application-for total treatment. It takes household sewage effluent and converts or extracts water of a suitable standard to be used in things like reticulation and other uses for water in the garden, thereby saving the vital urban water supplies for obviously more important uses. On that note, I will conclude, having attempted to cover some of the options available to us. The crucial issue is timing. Options to existing methods of waste disposal need to be sought now to cater for existing and future requirements. At present we have very little knowledge of the consequences of our waste management systems. This must change. It is vital that we look ahead and try to assess the future consequences of our actions today. Mr Bradford - I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.",47
51,Mr JENKINS,SEWAGE DISPOSAL,"I am very pleased to be able to associate myself with this motion sponsored by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). My interest in the subject matter of the motion arises from my membership of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, and my involvement and participation in the inquiry into the protection of the coastal environment, which led to the tabling of the report entitled The Injured Coastline. This House should recognise environmental costs associated with sewage effluent disposal into ocean systems. In the course of the inquiry, the House of Representatives Comrnittee toured all States and Territories of the Commonwealth. If we look from Sydney to Perth; if we look from Coffs Harbour to the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria and, indeed, if we look at the State of my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), Tasmania, we see that all have problems with their disposal of sewage. I led the subcommittee that went to take evidence in Tasmania, and in our report we said that during its visit to Tasmania the Committee was informed that a major source of pollution of the Derwent River in Hobart was the sewage discharged from the 15 treatment plants operated by local government councils along the river. So this is a problem that has national significance. What are the issues that we need to look at when considering the deleterious effect of the disposal of waste into the ocean? It is not only the unsightly residues; it is the potential toxic and infectious material in recreational waters; it is litter and plastics in ocean waters; it is the reduced species diversity at outfalls; bio-accumulation of toxic substances in fish, crustaceans and shellfish, the potential loss of fishery reserves, as well as potential risks to public health and the modification of important biological processes. The Committee did not go towards trying to set an environment cost in dollar terms of this effect. It took it as being said that there was that effect and, in the report, the Committee recommended that the Government increase the proportion of Commonwealth environmental research funding towards research and development of new waste water treatment technology as an alternative to ocean disposal. As the honourable member for Moore has outlined, many of the alternatives to ocean outfall are in their infancy. He mentioned the Bolivar afforestation trial in South Australia. The House of Representatives Committee went and visited that trial when it was in its first stages but, of course, it is a major trial over three years which will not finish until June 1993. So we need to have those trials in place so that we can really look in the short term at what might be best, given the type of climate, the type of soil conditions, with which we are trying to deal. From what we saw in the minimal trial that was taking place, there appeared to ·be great potential but, as was said at the workshop conducted by the House of Representatives Committee, it was estimated that to use the existing waste water output of the Bolivar treatment works in Adelaide would require wood lots of between 3,500 and 5,000 hectares. So we should continue to look at the many other alternatives that the honourable member for Moore mentioned in his contribution. In my own area, in the Plenty Corridor, under consideration is wetlands treatment, but that has to be done with great environmental sensitivity tp protect the watersome time. ways of our cities and not to further impinge upon and destroy the scarce water resource of this island continent. . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER· (Mr Les Seott)-Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 104A.

52,Mrs SULLIVAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to grieve with the people of Queensland, and I am sure that you, as a Queenslander, will share the concern I am about to express. I grieve for the manner of the departure of Noel Newnham from public life in Queensland. He has been the Police Commissioner in Queensland for the past three years and an applicant for the job when his present contract expires at the end of October, but he announced the day before yesterday that he had withdrawn his application. Such a withdrawal was bound to be controversial, given the story of Noel Newnham in Queensland over the last few months. I have no inside information on the Queensland police force, but my heart is in my boots, as I am sure is the case with mlPlY other Queenslanders, over the events that have occurred and their implications for Queensland citizens. Queensland went through the trauma of the Fitzgerald inquiry and the unveiling of the rottenness at the top of the police force in Queensland, with all the implications that those events had for ordinary, law abiding citizens. We had a hope that after the Fitzgerald inquiry and the appointment of Noel Newnham things might be better. I have a deep sense of foreboding about what lies ahead. I have had that sense of foreboding for I was very interested in Ray Whitrod's attempts to clean up the police force in Queensland. Ray Whitrod followed the late Frank Bischoff, a man who was not investigated by the Fitzgerald inquiry but who received quite a bit of dishonourable mention at the inquiry. Nobody doubted that Whitrod faced a daunting task when he became Police Commissioner. The great strength he had was the then Minister for Police, Max Hodges, who was as honest a politician as anyone could ever wish to meet. Hodges and Whitrod worked absolutely indefatigably to attempt to rid the Queensland police force of corruption. It is a matter of record that Whitrod was forced out of Queensland and his successor as Commissioner was Terry Lewis, now serving 14 years gaol for criminal corruption of the Queensland police force. The parallels between N ewnham and Whitrod have been disturbing me for some time. I remember that Whitrod was hounded unmercifully by the Police Union during his term as Police Commissioner. I also remember that Detective Tony Murphy seemed to be the protagonist for the Police Union. In preparing this speech, I attempted to find out precisely what office Murphy held in the union during Whitrod's time as Commissioner. I was trying to determine whether he was either president or secretary. I was informed that he was neither: he was simply a member of the executive. Nevertheless, it was Murphy who hounded Whitrod unmercifully and got all the inches of ink in the press that he could ever have wished. Tony Murphy, of course, also received some mention at the Fitzgerald inquiry, but most mention of Murphy was in relation to drug issues. It is a matter of great regret that the· Fitzgerald inquiry was unable to do any really substantive work on the subject of the trading in drugs in Queensland. That is no reflection, of course, on Commissioner Fitzgerald. I am not suggesting for one minute that John O'Gorman, who has become the bete noire of Noel Newnham, is in the same category at all. I have no reason to believe that. John O'Gorman is probably an earnest policeman doing as honest a job as any of them. Nevertheless, he has taken it on himself to hound Newnham. It is a matter of notoriety that the Queensland Police Union earlier this year organised for the members of the Queensland police force to vote on whether or not they had confidence in Noel Newnham. It is, of course, a matter of some concern to Queensland citizens whether the police force has confidence in its police commissioner. I want to tell the Queensland Police Union that many Queenslanders bitterly resented the action that it took and they felt it had no right to publicly conduct any such ballot. One can think of similar services where one would get much the same sort of outcome in any such ballot.. I think in some ways one could even take some heart from the fact that Newnham came out of that ballot fairly badly, as it appeared, in terms of votes cast. Nevertheless, that is not the role of a police union in my view and in the view of many Queenslanders-it rankled with me that it dared to do so. Not one word of criticism, of course, of that action was made by Premier Goss or any member of his Government, and they therefore have much to answer for. In the brief time available to me, I want to place on the record something about Noel Newnham. I will quote from an article in yesterday'S Courier-Mail because it is easier when someone else has prepared a biography. He was a policeman Jor 35 years. The article says: Newnham was a foundation member of the Victims of Crime Assistance League and was appointed Deputy Commissionerin Victoriain October, 1987. He was involved in many reviews of police administration and was twice national police consultant to the Australian Law Reform Commission. Months before accepting the Queensland position, he was awarded the Australian Police Medal, the highest award for distinguished police service. In between raising a family of four and being involved with community work, he also gained a Bachelor of Arts degree, with majors in psychqlogy and politics, and a diploma in criminology. He also has been committed to the scouting movement, helping introduce scouting to his Victorian hometown because 'our eldest boy wanted to join the cubs' ... Newnham became Deputy Commissioner of Scouting in Queensland, and this 'boy scout image' did not sit kindly with his opponents within the service. His administrative style, which sought to run the service on corporate lines, was not well accepted among the rank and file. Some of the opposition could be attributed to a reluctance to accept positive change, and some of it to a growing belief that the administration was out of touch. There were complaints that the service was bogged down with paperwork, projects and pontificating while Queensland homes were open to plunder. The last three. paragraphs that I quoted could have been written about the complaints against Whitrod when he was Commissioner of Police in Queensland, and that is why I have this very uneasy feeling about the departure of Noel Newnham. In the Courier Mail yesterday the President of the Police Union, Senior Sergeant John O'Gorman, said: Mr Newnham's withdrawal was in the best interests of the Queensland Police Service. He said rank-and-file officers would welcome the new commissioner and would try to resolve any differences behind closed doors. He said Mr Newnham had put many officers offside when he arrived. 'There are a number of things police haven't forgotten, such as his comments when he first arrived, that corruption was still widespread police culture needed to be broken,' he said. 'There are about 5000 of us who were around at that time that took that personally.' Well,. if they were not part of the police culture, they did not need to take it personally. I think it is a very sad reflection on the Police Union in Queensland that that comment would be made, because Noel Newnham was echoing the feeling of every decent Queenslander at that time when he said it. One of the things that I think really ought to be noted-which just about tells the whole story-was that Noel Newnham was chosen for the position of Commissioner of Police from 64 applicants for the job. Until he withdrew his application, the applications for his replacement numbered six. If that does not tell you something about what senior police enforcement officers around Australia think and how they view Queensland, nothing does. There were 64 applicants in 1989 and there are six now and, of course, there are now only five since Noel Newnham withdrew his application. The role of the Goss Government in this has been a total disgrace. It is, of course, no secret that Newnham and his previous Police Minister Mackenroth did not get on. It is believed that the beginning of the end for Newnham came shortly after his appointment, when he went to see the Premier with the transcript of some telephone conversations that Mackenroth-not then the Minister for Police but the shadow Minister and almost certain to become the Minister after the 1989 election-had with a character who was notorious in the Fitzgerald inquiry hearings and, of course, was very much a public figure by the time Mackenroth had this conversation with him. I cannot go into the details because there are still some legal matters being attended to in Queensland. Premier Wayne Goss said, in answer to a question from the parliamentary leader of the Liberal Party, Mrs Joan Sheldon, on 8 May this year: Back in mid 1990 I am very sorry to say that the Police Commissioner came behind the Minister's back to see me ... and the Who else could Noel Newnham have gone to? Should he have gone to the Minister with a Federal Police transcript about this conversation he had? Should he have gone to the Minister with this confidential transcript and said, 'Minister, you need to know the Federal Police are investigating your connections with this person.'? Of course not. The one person who had to support Noel Newnham in the extremely difficult job he took on was the Premier. Therefore the Premier must bear the blame for what happened in Queensland this week. (TIme expired) Queensland Grants Commission",51
53,Mr LINDSAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to draw the attention of honourable members to the general state of chaos surrounding the distribution of Commonwealth general purpose assistance grants to local government in Queensland. The problem centres on the Queensland State Grants Commission which is responsible for recommending the distribution of these funds to the relevant State Minister. Since 1989-90, the Queensland Grants Commission has developed a methodology based on principles agreed between the Commonwealth and Queensland State Governments consistent with the aim of horizontal fiscal equalisation as required under the Local Governrnent (Financial Assistance) Act 1986. Unfortunately, the methodology developed by the Queensland Grants Commission to date is producing results more designed to raise eyebrows than carry out its role. The results of this methodology in terms of grants recommended for individual authorities involve excessive and unexpected redistributions which will cause major budgetary problems for many local authorities and massive windfall gains for others. For example, the Queensland Grants Commission sent advice to local authorities on 30 June this year which provides estimates of the level of their proposed grant in 1996-97 arising from their methodology and I ask for leave to incorporate this information in Hansard. Leave granted.

the table shows clearly the massive dislocation both positive and negative that individual local authorities in Queensland face over the next few years. The magnitude of these projected increases and decreases for individual local authorities is nothing short of astounding. I will quote a few examples of decreases, beginning with Atherton, minus 67 per cent; Cairns, minus 59 per cent; Mount Isa, minus 81 per cent; Townsville, minus 67 per cent; Mackay, minus 57 per cent; Rockhampton, minus 51 per cent; Bu.ndaberg, minus 64 per cent; Gladstone, minus 76 per cent; Toowoomba, minus 41 per cent; and Brisbane, minus 39 per cent. On the other side of the coin I quote a few examples of increases. Chinchilla, up 149 per cent; Eidsvold, up 163 per cent; Livingstone, up 178 per cent; Miriam Vale, up 210 per cent; Monto, up 144 per cent; Nebo, up 153 per cent; Rosalie, up 186 per cent; Widgee, up 173 percent; and Wondai, up 158 per cent. Surely such radical changes in grant outcomes must bring the Commission's methodology into question. The Queensland local government authorities believe, and their belief is strongly supported by the Grants Commission's figures that I have incorporated in Hansard, that the new methodology favours the bush over urban areas to an extraordinary and unfair degree.

I would like to provide honourable members with some specific examples based on the only major city in my electorate, which is Townsville. In 1996-97 the Townsville City Council's recommended grant will drop to a lousy SUm-from $3.6m in 1989-90. This is a fall of about $3.2m in 1990-91 values compared to 1989-90, or 79 per cent in real terms. In other words, by 1996-97 the Townsville community will be about $3.2m, in 1990-91 values, worse off each and every year. Such a reduction represents a loss equivalent to 15 per cent of Townsville's annual general rate collections. In cumulative terms, over the 10 years from 1990-91 to the year 2000, the Townsville community will lose up to $19m in 1990-91 values. The Commonwealth and State governments could not sustain such a loss on their tax collections and nor can the Townsville City Council. The impact of this cut can only be met in a limited number of ways-through increasing rates, cutting services or sacking staff. Borrowing to sustain recurrent activities is simply not an option. The Townsville community could now face a real terms general rate increase of over 15 per cent to compensate for the Commission's radical grant outcomes. As Townsville is already in the top 20 in terms of net rates and charges in the State and within the top 20 in tenns of the general rate, such an increase would be difficult to introduce in tenns of what the local community is able and prepared to pay. It. would be no comfort to ratepayers to know that a goods and services tax of 15 per cent would be added to this rise if Fightback were introduced, particularly on garbage collection services, commercial services and, if the Cole Committee's recommendations are accepted by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), a 15 per cent tax on the general rate. In terms of the implications of all this, the average general rate for a Townsville ratepayer in 1991-92 was $580 net of discount compared to an average of $279 for a ratepayer in Widgee Shire. Townsville ratepayers are now going to be forced to pay an extra 15 per cent. So if the 1996-97 recoIl11llended distribution applied in full last year, the T9wnsville ratepayer would be saddled with a general rate of $667, while the ratepayer in Widgee could be paying $140. With this result, no-one in their right mind could accept that the Queensland Grants Commission has developed an acceptable or proper outcome for these allocations. The former Minister for Local Government in Queensland, the Hon. Tom Burns, MLA, commissioned his own review by academics from the Queensland University of Technology on this weird methodology. Their review appears to have addressed the technical aspects of the mathematics used in the Commission's methodology and little else. The study must have been a disappointment to the Minister as it hardly seems to have addressed the full tenns of reference that he set, and that is being kind. It would seem that to the Queensland Grants Commission the methodology has become an end in itself and the outcome merely a by-product. I am quite surprised that the former Minister for Local Government in Queensland, Mr Bums, did not move to bring reason to the situation. The Queensland Grants Commission seems to be convinced that it has developed the perfect methodology to achieve horizontal fiscal equalisation. It appears to be inflexible in this belief. The time has come for the Queensland Grants Commission to admit that the outcomes produced by its flawed methodology are neither practical nor acceptable. Its members would have to be misguided zealots of an extreme nature to suggest that the distribution of grants they are recommending is justified on the basis of· the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation. I understand that Commonwealth and Queensland officers from local government departments and some Queensland local authorities met recently to discuss the problem. I hope the new Minister for Local Government in Queensland, Mr Terry Mackenroth, can bring a sense of reality to the Commission and the distribution of Commonwe-lth general purpose assistance to local government in the State of Queensland. The present position is completely unacceptable. I ask the Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) to bring his influence to bear with his Queensland counterpart and try to bring some sense to this outrageous treatment of local government in Queensland. University Places",53
54,Dr KEMP,A B C D E F G,"I rise this afternoon to express a deeply felt grievance of some 50,000 young Australians. Although they are qualified in the judgment of the universities to continue with their higher education, they have been deliberately locked out of universities by the policies of this Government. When report after report has highlighted the need for a flexible, welleducated work force with the skills necessary to compete in an internationally competitive marketplace and when the Government claims that it wants a clever country, honourable members may well ask how this situation has come about. The answer lies in the Government's rigid and ideological approach to higher education. Present arrangements, under which the availability of government funding remains the detenninant of the number of undergraduate places, are severely limiting both the number that can be offered and the resources available to universities. In effect, thousands of young Australians are being prevented from attending university because the Government is prohibiting these institutions from creating additional places address this demand. Such is the hypocrisy of this Government, however, that at the same time it is encouraging the admission of overseas students, estimated this year to number over 15,000. Only last weekend I noticed a statement from the executive director of the recently opened Australian Education Office in Washington that he aimed to double the number of students from the United States studying in Australia by 1994. Imagine how current year 12 students, facing up to their end of year assessments, must feel when they see that the Government is aiming to bring some 1,500 more United States students into Australian universities to occupy places which are not available to Australian students. Every night when they sit down to study, these Australian students must be painfully aware of the sudden death situation the Government has placed them in, where a mark marginally below the cut-off line is sufficient to deprive them of the chance to pursue a university education. The pressure this situation places them under would be, for many, simply intolerable. Overseas students are under no such pressure. We welcome overseas students, but they are under no such pressure because they can get a place where Australian students cannot. It is not as if this situation has arisen because the Government has not been warned. Every advisory report that it has received has indicated that this situation can be very readily solved. The Industry Commission told the Government last year that it should immediately move to implement one of the options outlined in its report which, according to the Commission, would overcome the serious problem that qualified Australian students who do not currently have a funded place are prohibited from public university study. Even the Government's own Higher Education Council has recently said that additional university places are essential, and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Comniittee has stated its view that Australian students unable to win quota places should have the same rights of enrolment in fee funded additional places as students from overseas. to There are institutions around this country willing tomorrow to open their doors to these students if the Government removes the ban. These students are excluded for no reason other than political ideology. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services e Mr Baldwin) says, 'Oh well, few Australian students would take up places if we removed the ban', but he is not prepared to find out. He is so committed to his ideology that not even the advice of all the Government's expert advisory bodies and all the pleas of students will move him. This is a rigid and inflexible policy mouthed by a rigid and inflexible Minister. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services could significantly ease the pressure on these year 12 students now sitting for their end of year assessments by acknowledging their right to obtain a place if they can get a sponsorship, are prepared to make a financial commitment or can obtain a scholarship from the university. As a member of the Socialist Left faction, the faction which devastated the Victorian economy and upon which judgment has just been passed by the Victorian voters, the Minister has a rigid opposition to anything that savours of market mechanisms, and freedom of choice for students and universities scares the daylights out of him. It is hard to believe that he justifies banning Australian stude-ts from these extra places with the argument that this is fair and equitable. None df the Government's main advisory bodies Ibelieves this is fair. The universities do not believe this is fair. The excluded students do not believe this is fair. But, wait a minute, the Minister says it is fair. In his eyes it is fairer to deprive students of their university education altogether than to give them a chance to get in. It· is obvious that the Minister is using a most peculiar definition of equity-one drawn, I imagine, straight from the Karl Marx dictionary of fair play. What is troubling the Minister is the fact that, if the ban on Australian students is lifted and they are given the right to invest in their higher education in the same manner as overseas students are allowed, some will invest and some will not. Instead of a glorious equality of deprivation so beloved of those of the Minister's ideological ilk, a wide variety of individual circumstances, motivations and values will be recognised. That is his real fear. So all those excluded students should take heart from the fact that, although their own hopes and aspirations have been sacrificed, they are serving the Minister's wider social purposes. Forget individual equity-this Minister has another agenda. Like many socialists, he does not recognise the value of encouraging this investment in universities, at least not when it comes from Australians. Apparently he is prepared to be really broad minded and exclude overseas students from the ambit of his ideological claim. His senior Minister at the time, of course, had a different view. The socialist ideology advocated by the Minister is profoundly dehumanising because individual students are completely powerless to do anything about the tragic situation in which they find themselves. Under the Minister's system, the ban is total. Nothing the student does can earn a place even if, as is the case with, say, Ballarat University College, there are places going begging. ill the interests of the Minister's concept of equity-that is, equal deprivation-nothing can be done. ill an effort to scare anyone who will listen, the Minister peddles the same wobbly old trusted but untrue argument that such a move will lead to the introduction of full fees for all students and education for wealthy-that it would replace merit with money. What nonsense. How absurd for the Minister to say that these excluded students lack merit. How dare he say this, when the universities themselves have indicated that these students are qualified for university entry. The universities want to admit them; the students want to be admitted; yet the Minister says that it is fair to exclude them. In Fightback, the coalition has undertaken to fully maintain and fund the same number at least of Commonwealth funded places as are currently funded under Government policies. The greater freedom that these institutions and these students will have under our policies will not be accompanied by a withdrawal of Commonwealth funding. There will be more places; there will be better funded institutions; and there will be a higher investment in university education in this country under a coalition government than there can ever be while this Government maintains its ideological defence of this unsustainable ban on Australian students gaining entry to unfunded places in Australian universities and having the right to invest in their own education. The Minister knows that this ban cannot be sustained. Let him recognise it now, lift the ban and end the intolerable discrimination against Australian students. Food Labelling",57
55,Mr HULLS,A B C D E F G,"I have a very serious matter that I want to raise in this House today. Just this morning I have written to the Trade Practices Commission and the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Scien-e and Technology, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), about a blatant breach of the Australian Food Standards Code country of origin labelling requirements. Mr Deputy Speaker, I expect that you enjoy a good sprinkle of pepper on your eggs at breakfast time or perhaps a delicious green pepper sauce on your steak at dinner time. I also expect that you like to buy Australian products, that you would like to think that every time you grind pepper on your dinner plate, you are not contributing to our balance the of trade problems. I also expect that you would be amongst the 60 per cent of shoppers who would be prepared to pay 10 per cent extra for Australian products. People who bought packs of Saxa pepper, like this one that I picked up in Aussie's this morning, could be forgiven for eating their breakfast with a warm inner glow because the words 'product of Australia' are printed on the plastic container. But-and this is a big but-the fact of the matter is that we import nearly every single kernel of pepper into this country. I also know that the Saxa pepper company imports most of its pepper from Indonesia. As a nation, in fact, we import tonnes and tonnes of the stuff. For example, in 1990-91 we imported 411,000 kilograms of whole black pepper from Indonesia, 96,448 from Malaysia and 66,926 from Singapore. But we did not only import it from our South East Asian neighbours. We also imported 32,062 kilograms from France and 2,361 from, of all places, Denmark. We also imported a substantial amount of processed pepper--pepper that had already been crushed or ground. Again the main countries of origin were our South East Asian neighbours and, surprisingly, the United States of America. Of course, we have to import pepper because we do not have a thriving pepper industry in this country. But what we do have in this country is country of origin labelling laws that are there to provide the consumer with information necessary to make a choice to buy an Australian or an imported product, or perhaps to make a political decision and not buy a product from, say, South Africa, or from the United States of America while it continues to play havoc with world grain markets with itS export enhancement program. For your information, Mr Deputy Speaker, the labelling on this product reads as follqws: SAXA ground black PEPPER CEREBOS (AUSTRALIA) LTD., 92-96 STATION ROAD, SEVEN HILLS, N.S.W; 2147 PRODUCT OF AUSTRALIA SOg NET. Yet, when my office contacted Saxa and asked where it got its pepper from, we were told that its salt was an all Australian product, but that all its pepper came from Indonesia. The labelling on this particular container appears to me to be clearly in breach of section 53(eb) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and section 4 of the Food Standards Code which is enforced by the States. Section 53(eb) states that a corporation shall not 'make a false or misleading representation concerning the place of origin of goods'. The Food Standards Code requires the country of origin statement to be written distinctly, legibly and indelibly. I think this Government has been very receptive to calls by consumers, farmers, food processors and trade unions for accuracy in food labelling.·The Australian Food Standards Code requires that all packaged foods must be labelled with information about the country of origin. The Australian Food Standards Code as amended to June 1992 states quite clearly at section 4(a) that the label on or attached to a package containing food shall include a statement that identifies the country in which the food was made or produced. I would like to draw the House's attention to the fact that all the other pepper products available on the shelves of the Coles New World Supermarket in Mareeba, in my electorate, are clearly labelled 'imported product'. Saxa is not playing fair. I believe it is breaking the rules. The Food Policy Alliance made headlines earlier this month calling for the law to be changed to make it mandatory for food companies to give more information on packaging. The Alliance is a cross-sectoral group of consumer, farmer, food processing and trade union organisations that has been campaigning for truth in labelling for quite some time. I agree with the Food Alliance and with the farmers in my electorate who want the country of origin rules tightened even further. I think this is happening. In two specific areas, country of origin labelling requirements have been recently strengthened: in the cases of fruit juice concentrate and of unpackaged imported fruit, vegetables, nuts and fish. The National Food Authority is currently considering three applications seeking to define terms that can be used in the country of origin statements. The Authority shortly will be publishing notices seeking comments on these applications. But whilst it is important to pursue tighter rules, let us make sure that food importers and manufacturers are complying with existing regulations and that companies such as Saxa are meeting current truth in labelling requirements. , Saxa's misrepresentation is not just a case of one importer of pepper making representations that could disadvantage other importers. It has far wider implications than that because some pepper is being grown right here in Australia. I have what I believe to be the one and only commercial pepper farm in Australia in my electorate. .Last month I visited the Silkwood pepper farm of Levis and Myra Campagnola. Silkwood is not far from Innisfail, as honourable members would know, in the heart of sugar country. In the mid-1980s, when the sugar industry was suffering a downturn, Levis decided to diversify. He did some research and was shocked to learn, as I was, that we do not grow pepper in Australia. Levis did Some more research and learnt that the climatic conditions in the countries that produce most good quality pepper are very similar to those that exist in far north Queensland-pepper thrives in a tropical climate. While the majority of Australians huddle in the south-eastern comer of this fine continent freezing for most of the year they forget that a large part of the continent is in the tropics. Levis recognised the opportunity for import replacement and to value-add by making peppercorn butter and other processed products. Levis and his brother Louis have planted 2,000 pepper vines on 1.5 hectares of their 270-hectare cane farm. Admittedly their operation is small but it is growing. Levis is currently marketing fresh green pepper and dried black pepper as 'gourmet' pepper products around Queensland, into some Sydney restaurants and into the butcher shop next to my office in Mareeba, while a deal with Woolworths is looking very good. Levis has paid for the privilege of placing a 'Made in Australia' triangle on his pepper products. I believe it is an absolute outrage that the Campagnolas' pepper products that they have paid to have labelled as Australian made-and that are, of course, 100 per cent Australian made-can be placed on supermarket shelves next to Saxa pepper products that are falsely labelled 'Product and are 100 per cent imported from South East Asia. We continually ask our farmers to become more efficient and to value-add. The Campagnolas are efficient and they are doing exactly what we as a government require: they have found a niche market and they have gone for it. They are producing world class pepper that is an ideal import replacement product with real export potential. The Campagnolas have not asked for government handouts. All they want is a fair go, and they are not getting a fair go from Saxa. Maybe Saxa has an explanation for what appears to be blatantly unfair and dishonest conduct. I would love to hear it. Rights of Indigenous People",59
56,Mr NUGENT,A B C D E F G,"I understand that in Darwin at the weekend there was a conference entitled 'Surviving Columbus' that dealt, at least in part, with indigenous people. I am aware that the Government was represented, but I do not believe that the coalition was. Whilst I do not speak for the coalition on these matters I do take an interest in issues relating to our indigenous people, and today I want to express some personal thoughts on how we might start to deal with this hitherto somewhat intractable problem. We are not alone in challenges in this area. Many Western governments have been wrestling with the issue of indigenous peoples and their place in a modem nation state for a long time. Some measurable progress has been more evident since World War II rather than before it. The evolution of international law has placed particular emphasis on human rights, most notably those regarding minority and indigenous rights. At times some Australian public figures have unfortunately appeared to be swimming against the tide when they find extenuating circumstances or special excuses which they consider exempt them, and therefore the rest of us, from fundamental recognition of indigenous people's rights and needs. The wider world makes no such fine distinctions and will be unimpressed by Australian reasons of Australia' or excuses for inaction. The facts today are really quite simple. The white man settled this continent, often bloodily, and applied his own legal system to validate his settlement and subsequent property transactions. He used. his own imported political institutions to rule over the indigenous people whom he had displaced. 'rrhat same legal system found most reCently, in the Mabo decision, that significant rights do pertain to ·indigenous peoples in certain circumstances. If governments were now to consider changing those rules by altering the law and extinguishing or limiting those few rights 'enjoyed' by a vulnerable population at the margins of our society, Australia may severely hinder progress towards true reconciliation between Aboriginals and the rest of Australian society. Moreover, an immediate effect of deflecting or turning back Mabo would be to legitimise anti-Aboriginal and anti-Islander sentiment in the wider Australian community. It would also advertise to the world that, whilst everyone else has inalienable rights, the indigenous people have none, except when we feel gracious enough to grant them some. However, I suggest that the decisive factor for government policy makers may well be that of international reaction. We cannot pretend that this subject is solely a domestic issue. Increasingly, indigenous policy is coming under the international spotlight. How can we as a nation attack and denounce the human rights records of countries such as South Africa, Indonesia or China, when we ourselves are hesitant to acknowledge the historical and fundamental rights of our own indigenous people? Other countries have tried to reject the moral, political and legal claims of their indigenous people, just as some Australians do today. Yet over time those other countries have learned that to deny the identity of peoples who have their own distinctive culture, and who have survived precisely because they have it, is simply an invitation to conflict. I would suggest that that really is not something we would wish for Australia. Whilst we should not forget what happened 200 years ago, the key issue today is to address present Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. If we fail to do so, we court disaster. Then, if there are disorders in the wake of the High Court's recognition of those indigenous rights, it will say much about the lack of maturity of Australia as a modem society for having failed to deal with that disadvantage. We should be capable of at last coming to grips with such issues and not thwarting the indigenous peoples' aspirations. The issue of indigenous peoples has been a cancer, I would suggest, in this country. Governments have tried to hide it, often at considerable cost in Aboriginal and Islander lives and well-being. Now the courts have brought it out into the open and we have to deal with it. I remind the House that many white Australians feel free to demand obedience, political loyalty, respect or patience from that indigenous community, yet we could in this very Parliament so easily dismiss the moral and legal rights of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. To do so might well generate a severe adverse reaction from that community. Australia today is not lacking for policy solutions. However, it will require accommodation, not the confrontation of the past. Social peace will be achieved with both the provision of legal protection for the disadvantaged and with the support of, and commitment from, the general population. Ongoing inaction on the part of political parties provokes the greatest grievances and the greatest anger on the part of Aboriginal people today. We simply must act sooner rather than later if we are ever to reconcile Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia. I would entreat the House to ponder very carefully indeed on these issues. Finally, I want to make the point that I raise these issues because they are beginning to be forced upon us. I am not advocating that we have a treaty now with the indigenous people. I have very great sympathy with the views expressed in this morning's Canberra TImes editorial, from which I will read some extracts: A treaty defines only those elements which may be included; in so doing it limits the capacity of both parties to broaden and deepen their understanding and indeed their caring, each for the other. It goes on to say: If it were to proceed now it would interrupt a movement which is bringing a new dimension to the respect which has been growing for Aboriginal culture among other Australians. And it concludes by saying: The remarkable achievement of a peaceful multicultural society is enriched by the knowledge that Australia's Aboriginality lies at its foundation. Only when this is achieved would it be valuable to reconsider an Act of Reconciliation in the form of a treaty, for by then it would be negotiated goodwill on both sides-and in the knowledge that it would simply formalise a genuine sense of fellowship and mutual respect. My concern is that we are not necessarily going to be allowed that lUxury of time, and perhaps we need to face up to that fact now. Member for Calwell: Immigration",61
57,Mr CAMPBELL,A B C D E F G,"I am appalled at the prevailing situation in this country where so many people pander to some sort of perceived international view and are quite prepared to subjugate Australia's own interest to this mythical international view. I must say that I am sorry that the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) is overseas. It is something I did not realise. I wish he had been here to enjoy my remarks. On an occasion last year, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), sat down on the back bench and engaged in a light-hearted conversation with honourable members. He had previously just been accosted in the aisle by the honourable member for Calwell and had spent some minutes in conversation with him. The Minister seemed to depart from that engagement with relief, but he was not to be spared the attentions of the honourable member for Calwell so easily, who darted back and sat beside the Minister on the open aisle. The Minister was now pinned, and the honourable member for Calwell recommenced his earnest conversation. The Minister nodded and nodded wearily, occasionally interspersing a fews words of his own, but mostly he just nodded, until finally he leant forward, with head bowed, giving the impression of a man utterly wearied by the subject. The honourable member for Calwell is the Chairman of both the Caucus immigration and ethnic affairs committee and the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. He has had a considerable influence on immigration policy matters in the past and regards himself as something of an expert on immigration matters. It has been no secret, however, that there has been friction between the Minister and the with honourable member for Calwell, notably in the Caucus immigration committee meetings. In Parliament on 5 May 1992, the Minister made some interesting remarks during the second reading of the Migration Laws Amendment Bill. After the honourable member for Calwell had spoken, the Minister said: Let me say to the honourable member for Calwell, before he goes, that I will not be as flamboyant in my response to him this evening as I was the other night [in committee]. I would not do that in here and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, probably would not let me get away with it. This friction finally came into open view on 16 September when the Minister and the honourable member clashed heatedly in the Caucus immigration committee meeting and continued the argument in the corridors. It was reported that the two were overheard by a passing US delegation and two committee members were quoted as calling for the honourable member for Calwell to be replaced as chairman. One remarked, 'I think he should resign. Anyone with a smaller ego would.' The Minister accused the honourable member for Calwell of trying to set his own agenda on immigration and of claiming credit for Government reforms he had little to do with. The honourable member for Calwell has also been strongly criticised by both Liberal and Labor members of the Joint Committee he chairs, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. The Committee, after two years of inquiry, released a report on refugees in late September. At a Committee hearing as early as July 1991, the honourable member had set the scene for his dissenting report. He displayed then that he was more concerned with posing as a man with great compassion for refugees, no matter how dubious their claims, than with sensible immigration control. I wonder whether he has any concept of Australia's national interest. At that meeting, the Deputy Secretary to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Wayne Gibbons, had stated that refugee rorts would worsen if applicants were given the right to apply for residency on humanitarian grounds after they had failed on refugee grounds. He stated: If we relax controls on our borders, we are sending a great signal to the world which might result in large numbers of people turning up and trying their luck. He also said: ... worldwide border claimants are not the most deserving of refugee claims. In spite of this clear warning, the honourable member for Calwell strongly supported giving the boat people a second chance to apply on humanitarian grounds if they failed in the refugee test and said that his Committee might urge the Minister to accept this view. It was clear then that, no matter what evidence was put before him, the honourable member for Calwell had his own humanitarian image to protect. The final September majority report of the Committee strongly and rightly criticised the emotive actions of Mr Hawke in granting indefinite stay to those Chinese students in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. This Hawke commitment was later restated by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to his great discredit, in a letter to a Chinese language newspaper in May of this year. But the majority of the Committee said that the commitment which gave the Chinese favoured status was unjustified, and it called for Chinese students to be dealt with on a case by case basis after their four-year visa expired in 1994. What a great surprise it was when the Chairman, with the support of Senator Barney Cooney, wrote a dissenting report. Members in the majority accused the honourable member for Calwell of misrepresenting the majority view of the Committee in the presentation of the report and of giving more emphasis to his own views. He had earlier been outraged by a newspaper report by Margaret Easterbrook of the Age which accurately outlined the recommendations of the majority, the week before the parliamentary report was released. In parliament he called for the story to be referred to the Standing Committee on Privileges for possible action. This is not the first time he has reacted in such an overbearing manner to a story which has displeased him, and called for an investigation by that Committee. The honourable member for Calwell has in the past also acted as though he was the Government's spokesman, if not the de facto Minister, for immigration. When the FitzGerald report was released in 1988, for example, he dismissed it out of hand on behalf of the ALP. In a press release on 16 January this year, in relation to the immigration program, he stated: ... with respect to the program of 1992-1993, the Minister for Immigration will be holding extensive consultations with community groups, the union movement, the business sector, et cetera, with a view to making a decision in April this year. In the event, the decision was made much later than April. When a target was set for 1992-93 of 80,000, the honourable member for Calwell was greatly displeased. Anyone not familiar with the facts might assume that the honourable member for Calwell was the Minister, for on occasions he has certainly played the part. There have been suggestions that it was hinted to him by the Prime Minister that, after the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs leaves he would be next in line for the position-presuming an ALP win. While I can believe that such a suggestion possibly was made, I cannot believe that the Prime Minister would be so foolish as to make the honourable member for Calwell the Minister in charge of immigration. I for one would oppose it tooth and nail. Mr Costello-You should be the Minister.",63
58,Mr CAMPBELL,A B C D E F G,"I should be the Prime Minister. Although I have often been a lone voice in my attack on the honourable member for Calwell over the years, I am pleased that these days I am far from alone. As indicated, he presents himself as a great humanitarian. He also presents himself as a champion of anti-discrimination, of fairmindedness, in immigration. He rails against racists and 'unscrupulous political actors', but let us look closely at his proposal for immigration, which he recently put forward, entitled Towards a Fairer Immigration System for Australia. He says that such a system is necessary in part because of 'considerable resentment among a number of ethnic groups (especially from Southern and Eastern Europe)'-that is, the select pressure groups who claim to represent southern Europeans in particular, but clearly do not. Dr Katharine Betts has noted in her book Ideology and Immigration how family reunion provisions were extended in the immigration program because those groups claimed there was a strong demand for family reunion from southern European migrants. This was shown to be a lie by the fact that very few migrants from southern·Europe use the extended family reunion provisions. More people from Britain use them than southern Europeans, while the big users are Asian people. Mick Young noted in Parliament in 1984 that while he was shadow immigration Minister special arrangements had been made, following professional ethnic pressures, to bring out victims of the Italian earthquakes, but they did not want to stay. Mick Young said, 'They couldn't get back to Italy quick enough'. In spite of the total lack of demand from southern Europe and the influence that it had already had on the immigration program, the professional ethnics still claim they are being discriminated against. They are totally opposed to the integration of migrants because it means that their power base will be eroded and the reason for their existence will fade even further. They believe they need immigration to top up their power base. This is the true face of multiculturalism: status, power and self-interest. This is the policy Government funds, a policy which by its very nature is divisive, and it divides us all. The professional ethnic, Paolo Totaro, was quoted in th- June edition of the Catholic Social Justice Council publication, Justice Trends, as suggesting that the Government should give special consideration and preference to Italian immigrants. If someone from a British background were to say that preference should be given to British migrants, that person would immediately be branded a racist. Another professional ethnic, Franca Arena, stated at an Evatt Foundation conference on immigration in April that Italy had every right to oppose the entry of Albanian refugees, but in the same breath denied Australia the right to restrict immigration. Which country does she, and others like her, serve? If it is not Australia, we might well ask what she is doing here and, in particular, what she is doing in one of our parliaments. The honourable member for Calwell's immigration proposal divides the world into 12 regions and is based on two broad classifications. Under the first, the so-called 'principle of international equity', a percentage figure for each region would be determined based on the proportion of the region's population vis-a-vis the world's population, that is, the bigger the population of the region relative to the world population, the more weight that region would receive. This section allows the honourable member for Calwell to posture as an international citizen, mouthing such high-sounding phrases as 'the equal right of all people to contribute people to Australia'. The fact that this is just a smokescreen for the main purpose is made apparent by the second classification, which the honourable member for Calwell says is necessary under the so-called 'principle of multicultural harmony'. It is a quota system based on the national origins of the people in Australia, in his words, 'Since the inception of the program in 1945'. He says that this second principle wiil result in a considerable weighting being given to some of the larger, older migrant groups, such as the Dutch and Italians, who the within the last few years have been severely disadvantaged under the present system. He does not mention the Greeks. (Time expired) Health Services  p.m.)-I wish to bring to the attention of this Parliament the horrible predicament confronting many local community committees across rural Victoria charged with the responsibility to provide health and aged care services to their citizens. This issue is a national disgrace, devoid of any sense of social equity or justice, and must be corrected. At the time of my election in 1972, the western and north-western regions of Victoria had an excellent network of community and public hospitals, many under the auspices of the bush nursing system. However, the same could not be said for other aged care services. Nursing homes and hostel accommodation were limited. Many of our senior citizens in the twilight of their lives had to leave their home environment, their district and their families and go to other cities such as Melbourne, Bendigo and Ballarat to find adequate facilities. But all this was changed. The total number of beds for aged accommodation has increased more than tenfold in this time. We now have in my electorate and our region a wide and complementary range of accommodation and health delivery services. This has been achieved through positive government programs by previous Federal governments, both Labor and coalition. These have been effective programs based on need and an understanding that the Australian people require essential services, of their geographical location. But, more importantly, this has been achieved through strong local leadership and the foresight of management committees working with a responsive and generous public in financing, planning and constructing such facilities. Our aged people, our senior citizens, are now provided with a choice to live in a secure and comfortable environment to which they themselves have contributed so much. Tragically, this progress is now under threat. Many of these modem facilities and many of our hospitals are now fighting for survival on a day to day basis. The last few months have been traumatic for many management committees, and I could say for a number of members of this House, particularly the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who has been working with me on this issue. The problems have been created through many factors, but particularly these: the financial mismanagement of this Government, reducing its capacity to meet essential community services; the failure of Medicare as a universal health scheme to be financially viable and fair; and the imposition of bedclient ratios that have no relationship to the practical provision of service to the of regional and demographic situations across Australia .. Year by year, both the quality and availability of health care have seriously declined. We have increasing government controls but less service and higher costs. Waiting lists at our hospitals of people seeking elective surgery continue to grow. We now have two classes of Australians-those with immediate access to public or private hospitals, with the financial capacity to receive specialist care and long tenn treatment, and·an underclass which includes many on pensions and fixed incomes, sole parents, the unemployed and now today, tragically, even small business people and farmers. The administrations of our hospitals see the impact of these problems reflected in their capacity to meet expected social obligations. Let us just briefly look at three of the largest public hospitals in my electorate. We read this in the Swan Hill Guardian of irrespective Friday, 25 September 1992: Services risk in hospitals slash $lm off budget in three years The State Governmentthe previous State Government has slashed another $427,000 off hospital spending. This means the hospital has lost more than $1 million in the past three years: We could also refer to the Mildura Sunraysia Daily of 18 September: Staff cuts and reduced service the result of 'disappointing' budget· . Hospital funds slashed The reduction followed a cut last year of $690,000 to the $39 million operation which also includes Red Cliffs and Robinvale District Hospitals. The same situation occurs at the Wimmera Base Hospital in my home town where there has been a $1m slash over the last three years. The effect on the bush nursing system and on other religious and voluntary care organisations is critical. Once again, I refer to the headline in the Wimmera Mail TImes of Monday, 28 September, 'Crisis Faces Aged diversity Care'. The article begins: Thirty-five hospitals in the Victorian Bush Nursing Association are sinking deeper into financial crisis as federal and state governments persist with crippling financial formulas and tighter regulations which threaten their existence. The Natirnuk hospital, down to two acute-care beds with a heavy and growing commitment to 20 nursing beds and a new lO-bed elderly people's hostel soon to be finished, has all its 42 staff one working part time. . . . Smaller hospitals, such as Rainbow, Birchip and Charlton, face the prospect of closing their homes at the end of the year. This is because: Their top up federal grants end on 31 December. This Federal Government has imposed funding and viability formulas that are unrealistic and, if not changed, will guarantee the demise of these hospitals, nursing homes, hostels and, of course, these community organisations. Small nursing homes are being told to increase bed numbers to a viability level in regions where increased bed numbers are simply not needed, or they are being told to expand into multipurpose centres. This is a real option in many instances but, unfortunately, for many of these smaller homes it is financially impossible as the Federal Government, at the same time as telling them to expand into multipurpose centres, is withdrawing its top-up funding for its nursing homes. Finally, the daddy of them all is the option being given by the health bureaucracy to relocate its existing facilities to another community. Perhaps the bureaucracy and perhaps this Government may provide to the management of these homes the guidelines that would allow them to move a $lm brick nursing home 30 to 40 kilometres down the road to the next town. Fortunately, the people in Victoria have now spoken and I am optimistic that the new coalition Government in Victoria will immediately act on this issue, guarantee equity and recognise that these facilities are essential, irrespective of the number of people that live in a community, the population or their isolation. At a Federal level, I plead with the Federal Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) to recognise the catch22 situation that government policy has either intentionally or unintentionally placed these facilities in and give us a change· of direction. The Federal coalition in Fightback, I believe, has met this challenge. Health services, of course, will be free of a GST combut ponent and there will be a system of financial incentives for low and middle income earners and the elderly through a system of tax credits to maintam and to re-enter private insurance. nursing High income earners will be encouraged out of the public system, reducing the load that exists on that system and, of course, assisting in reducing waiting lists. These reforms, I believe, will ensure that all Australians will have access to quality health care and will restore the balance between the public and private health sectors. This in turn, of course, would also correct the viability problems in the bush nursing hospital system and correct, I believe, the deterioration of services that will occur in the public system if changes do not take place immediately. Northern Territory Economy",64
59,Mr SNOWDON,A B C D E F G,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (1.33 p.m.)-On Tuesday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) addressed the penalty that the Opposition proposes to inflict on States and Territories by stripping about $2 billion a year off outlays to the States and Territories. Currently, those expenditures are around. $30 billion per annum. He mentioned particularly the cost burden that that would mean to Victoria. The figure he used was about $55Om. I do not want to talk about Victoria but I do want to talk about the impact that those proposed cuts would have on the Northern Territory economy. I say that. because I think it is important to understand the nature of the Northern Territory economy .and the degree to which it is dependent upon public sector outlays emanating from Canberra. At this point, it is worth pointing out that the Northern Territory Government's own budget is about $1.7 billion, of which $1.1 billion or thereabouts comes from the Commonwealth Government in its general and specific purpose payments. In a moment, I will look at .other payments which are made in the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth apart from these direct payments. If we take the proposal to cut 5 per cent off those outlays to States and Territories, in the case of the Northern Territory we are talking about a cut of $52m, or thereabouts, from its revenue in current terms. When one analyses the impact of that, one needs to recognise that even the Opposition shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), has acknowledged that at least $4Om would be cut in grants from the Northern Territory Budget. Perhaps most amazingly, this has been acknowledged and indeed supported by the Northern Territory Government. This is a government acknowledged for its own fiscal ineptitude and lack of fiscal rectitude in the way it administers the Northern Territory economy. Yet we see in the Sunday Territorian of 30 August that the Northern Territory Treasurer actually said that he was happy with the proposed cuts. Honourable members should think about that. Here we have a Northern Territory government, which is reliant upon Comrrionwealth outlays for its own Budget to the point that at least two-thirds of that Budget emanates from Commonwealth sources, saying that it is prepared to tolerate, accept and indeed support a proposal which would cut $52m from revenue. One wonders where these people are coming from, because that $52m-using a model which has been developed within the James Cook University in Townsville-would conservatively mean the loss of a large number of jobs, in the vicinity of 1,400 jobs directly and indirectly lost as a result of this cut of $52m. As I pointed out, this is from a government acknowledged nation wide for its fiscal ineptitude; a government that has the highest per capita debt level of any government in Australia,including Victoria. We know what happened to the previous Victorian Government last week, apparently because of the crisis in the Victorian economy. Yet currently, the debt level that is carried by the Northern Territory community is around $6,580 a head. That is around $500 more per head than the debt level carried by the Victorian Government. That gives an indication of the ineptitude of the Northern Territory Treasurer. It is also a government which last year cut $l1Om from its own expenditure, costing directly around 1,220 jobs. In addition to the loss of those 1,220 jobs, there was a dramatic cut in services, which had, and is still having, an enormous impact on the Northern Territory community. Those cuts and services included the closure of schools and health services, and changes in the way schools are administered-to the point where class sizes were changed. Cop this: in urban primary schools in the Northern Territory, the pupilteacher ratio is 22 : 1, as a result of these ERC cuts. In Aboriginal bush schools-the schools with the most disadvantaged Australians and with, in a sense, the worse educational outcomes-the class sizes were 28 : 1. Is it any wonder, therefore, that there is a crisis acknowledged within education circles, in the area of Aboriginal education in the Northern Territory? Not only is the Northern Territory Government prepared to cop this $52m cut, on top of the $110m which it cut from its own expenditure last year, but it is also apparently happy with· the prospect of the proposal to abolish the payroll tax. You would have to ask those people why they are happy about this proposal to abolish the payroll tax, when it accounts for 41 per cent of the Territory taxation base and 7 per cent of the total public sector receipts, excluding those coming from the Commonwealth. One has to say that there is something wrong with people who would purport to govern in the interests of the Northern Territory and its citizens but who are prepared to cop such a dramatic impact upon their own economy and their own budget. But that is only one half of the equation. In addition to that, we know that the Opposition is proposing to cut 10 per cent across the public sector nationally. That, in itself, will have another enonuous impact upon the Northern Territory economy. I will retail briefly how that comes to be the case. I said initially that the Northern Territory public sector budget was around $1.7 billion, of which $1.13m is directly sourced by the Federal Government. In addition to that, the Federal Government last year spent between $700m and $1 billion in the Northern Territory on its own programs. A 10 per cent cut in this expenditure, using the lower amount of $700m, would mean conservatively the loss, directly and indirectly, of a further 1500 jobs. So here we have a government in the Northern Territory purporting to represent the interests of the whole community, masquerading as being responsible for administering the affairs of the Northern Territory, but prepared to cop proposals which in the very first year of an Opposition government would directly and indirectly cost in the vicinity of 3,129 jobs. I would say that if that is responsible, I would walk backwards to Bourke; but I do riot think I need to walk backwards to Bourke because everyone-even the members of the Opposition-know that that is grossly irresponsible. It is even more irresponsible when one recognises that in tenus of the employment levels, 40 per cent of the labour market of the Northern Territory is in the public and service sectors. I am concerned, and I know the community of the Northern Territory is concerned, that the CLP Government is supporting these propositions. I know that there are people in this House who have asked me questions about the fiscal ineptitude of the Northern Territory Government, and about the way it has wasted money in the past. Members have talked to me about those issues from time to time-there is one sitting here at the moment-and about the particular issue which has been raised with me on a number of occasions, not only by this member but by other members in this House, about the way in which it spends the resources of the Northern Territory community in tenus of capital works. Mr Costello-Whom are you talking about?",67
60,Mr SNOWDON,A B C D E F G,"I do not want to embarrass him, but there are only a couple of members in the House, and he knows who he is. My good friend the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) unfortunately has a view which-unfortunately, from my perspective-is shared by many in the Opposition. Indeed, I would say it is probably shared by some people in the New South Wales and Victorian branches of the Labor Party. Their view is that the Northern Territory and other States, which are funded on the basis of fiscal equalisation and receive per capita allocations-(Ttme expired) Greg Matthews Richard Loe",69
61,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,A B C D E F G,"In the one minuty left to me, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to complain about the treatment of the cricketer Greg Matthews by the Australian Cricket Board, which I regard as outrageous. The man is not a slave. He has got a right to have a view. The fact that he is being dealt with in such a way by the Australian Cricket Board-fined for supporting an anti-smoking commercial-is really very poor. The second point I want to make is that I do hope that at long last the New Zealand Rugby Football Union comes to its senses and deals with Richard Loe by putting him up on criminal charges because of the way he treated Paul Carozza when he was in Australia. They had no courage and they let him get away with it, but it has come back to haunt them. I hope they are prepared to have a bit of courage and actually deal with him in terms of a criminal injury matter.",69

63,Mr HALVERSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Recently, I received a letter from a finn of solicitors acting on behalf of one of my constituents who, in July last year, was injured as a result of faulty Telecom equipment. In September 1991, my constituent's solicitors wrote to the local Telecom office giving details of the incident and lodging a fOrn1al claim for compensatory damages. Telecom did not reply. In October, the solicitor sent another . letter. Telecom did not reply. Six months later, in March this year, they wrote again to Telecom, this time to the public relations officer in Melbourne, but still there was no response. Five more months passed. In August, my constituent's solicitors again wrote to Telecom advising that unless a response was received within 14 days they would refer the matter to their local Federal member. On 18 August, 48 weeks after the date of the first letter to Telecom, my constituent's solicitors received a phone call advising them that the matter was being handled by the finance department of Telecom, Frankston, and that further inquiries should be directed there. On 20 August, they wrote to Frankston. After almost two more answerless weeks had passed, they gave up the unequal struggle and wrote to me outlining the difficulties they were experiencing. A few days later they again contacted me to advise that they had just received a letter from the firm of solicitors acting for Telecom in this matter. It took almost a year-50 weeks to be preciseto finally get a response. One wonders what Telecom's reaction would be if its customers adopted a similar attitude and time frame when responding to their phone accounts. Real Estate Inspections: Loss of Property",70
64,Mr GEAR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to raise a concern that one of my constituents has brought to me. He was selling his house and had it open for inspection. He raised with the real estate agent the possibility of some of the goods inside the house being stolen, and was assured by the real estate agent that two people would be in the house and therefore his contents would be quite safe. In the event, the house was open on the weekend and, as could be guessed, he had some valuables stolen. He tried to claim on his house insurance but the insurance firm would not cover it because the house was not broken into. He went back to the real estate agent and said that he had been given an assurance that everything would be safe. The real estate agent said, 'That's a bit tough, but this happens all the time'. I have taken some legal advice on this from one of the legal eagles here in the House and I am assured by him, as well as one can be by these legal eagles, that the real estate agent is liable. Mr Ronald Edwards-Who is it?",70
65,Mr GEAR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I cannot name the real estate agent because I do not know who it is. But the real estate agent is liable. So in a case where a person opens his house and the real estate agent has control of the house, and valuables are stolen, the real estate agent is liable. So I will be recommending to my constituent that he approach the real estate agent again, ask him to pay up, and say that otherwise he will take legal action to recover the cost. I believe that when this happens throughout Australia-not only in Western Australia-people who put their property in the hands of real estate agents should take the . same advice. (Time expired) Bogus' Telefax Accounts",70
66,Mr ALDRED,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to bring to the attention of the House a rather curious and perhaps disturbing matter which has been referred to me by the company accountant of a local business concern, MACFarlane Generators of Carinish Road, Clayton, Victoria. This matter involves the receipt of bogus telefax directory accounts by the firm MACFarlane Generators. I have one of these accounts in my hand. It is entitled International Tele/ax DirectoryWorld Edition, under the name of the United Telecom Trust; Bellerivestrasse 10. A post office box is given-box 263-then the postcode, CH-8026 Zurich. The account was posted in Praha, Prague,and the dispatch date is given as 25 June 1992. The fax number quoted is 35437138 and the amount payable is $US785. This and similar accounts have been received in plain white windowed envelopes on a regular basis. Mr Heinz Schendzielorz, the accountant mentioned, has posted each such account to Telecom for information and reference. However, he wonders how many other finns receive such accounts and whether any are actually paid in error. It is to be hoped that the finns are not unwittingly subscribing to this or any other bogus account. I caution the hasty payment of any kind of account. People must make sure it is a genuine account before paying. Workplace Sexual Exploitation",70
67,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Stirling)Some time ago, I had the opportunity of working in a major organisation, advising it on industrial relations. One of the issues that struck me very early in the piece was the number of people, particularly women, who were working in process work. What I found interesting was the degree of sexual exploitation present. In fact, it was very clear in this particular place of work that, if one wished to work there or wished to get any overtime, one had to perfonn certain favours for the foreman. It was only when this was drawn to the attention of the management and the union intervened that the women's rights were restored. I raise this matter in this place because I want to say with the best will in the world to honourable members opposite that, if in fact they remove awards and trade unions from the situation, there will not be a quick remedy. These women who were subject to regular sexual harassment would not have been able to get a quick remedy. There was not even a remedy at common law, in the sense that the women would not have been able to take the case up because they would not personally have had the resources. In tenns of the question of justice and injustice in the workplace, whilst the Opposition is talking about its industrial relations policy, one of the facts it must understand is that there are many powerless people. In this case, there were 59 different nationalities working in that place, and the majority of women were subjected to sexual harassment. Had there not been a trade· union and an award situation, they would not have had any way of redressing the injustice. This is something that honourable members opposite must address in tenns of their industrial relations policy, and I do not believe they have. At the real level, those women had no bargaining power; they could not have redressed the injustice, and it would have continued. (TIme expired) Health Care",71
68,Mr RIGGALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"This afternoon, I rise to talk about the health system as it is operating in Victoria. Many honourable members may be aware of the waiting lists in our public health system in Victoria. It is absolutely appalling. A woman's son came to me the other day on her behalf, because she was unable to travel. She had been waiting over 18 months for a knee operation. This woman-she was in her seventies-was housebound because of the inappropriateness of the health system brought in by the Labor Government. Medicare has failed. It needs to be streamlined. We need to get back to a dual system, whereby people who can afford it look after themselves. I would like to tell those people that here we have real compassion for those who are retired. A retired couple who are on the pension will get a tax credit of $800 cash to help them fund private health insurance so that they can get immediate access to hospital. We will also bring in a co-payment, so that the medical benefits are not frittered away on minor, silly complaints by people who have been told the lie that there is a free medical system. There is not a free medical system. There is a finite budget, and it has been abused by the Labor Government. (TIme expired) Cigarette Promotions",71
69,Mr LAVARCH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Mention has already been made today about the situation concerning Greg Matthews and the decision of the Australian Cricket Board to fine him, apparently because of his anti-smoking stand. There is another action which is being taken by cigarette companies and which I want to draw to the attention of the House, concerning a promotion being run which is called the Oz Rock music collection. In this promotion, the Philip Morris company, under the brand name of Peter Jackson, is selling two packs of 30 cigarettes with a tape from a famous Australian rock band. This month, the band is Noiseworks. Obviously, this is simply aimed at teenagers, or at least those under 25. From my experience, not too many people aged 40 or 45 are frequent listeners to Noiseworks, so I will not cop the argument that this is being directed only at people who are established smokers and that it. is not trying to initiate new smokers. This sort of campaign is little more than bribery on the part of the cigarette company. It is trying to recruit new smokers into its fold, and it is high time that companies such as Philip Morris showed a little more social responsibility in their marketing techniques. Such companies are always claiming that they sponsor sport not because they are interested in getting new people, but because they are getting people to swap from one brand to another. Yet they come out with these sorts of promotions which are clearly designed to get new smokers from the youth and teenagers of this community. (Time expired) Parliamentary Fringe Benefits",71
70,Mr MACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"For over a decade public respect for political institutions has been running downhill. One of the main reasons is the seemingly endless revelation of politicians' perks and lurks, particularly in a time of economic stress and constant calls for people to work harder for less pay. It is outrageous that the parliamentary superannuation scheme should collect $1.9m for 1991-92 and payout $9.8m. The Australian reported recently that former members' free travel under the gold pass system cost taxpayers $1.3m in the 1991-92 financial year. This only became public when the Nine Network obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act showing that one former MP used $50,000 worth of travel, and his wife $16,000, at taxpayer's expense. Dr Bob Woods-Name him, name him!",72
71,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,If the honourable member for Lowe continues to interject it is I who will name him.,72
72,Mr MACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The article reported ministerial offers to tighten gold pass rules. The Auditor-General apparently recommended an examination of accountability requirements, but that is no reassurance for Australian taxpayers. It will do nothing to restore public confidence about politicians' fringe benefits. The public wants perks and lurks for public figures reduced to the minimum. It is essential that the Government make the annual costs of travel and all perks of office for members, senators and former members publicly available. The secrecy in administration of parliamentary superannuation, travel schemes and other perks only fuels public outrage. The spectacle of the endlessly idling Comcar, and usage at a rate of $1,000 a day, is totally unacceptable. Sugar Tariffs",72
73,Mr COURTICE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Yesterday in parliament the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd), in commenting on an article in the Australian Canegrower, said: The article said that our tariff for sugar will be zero in the year 2000. That is wrong; it will be 5 per cent. That is in total contradiction to Fightbackl, which in table 4.1 says quite clearly that there will be the elimination of all tariff quota and bounty assistance. It is also in total contradiction to the Leader of the Liberal Party (Dr Hewson), the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), and the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), who is quoted in the newsletter of the Australian Cane Farmers Association as follows: That attitude is held in a number of circles. Liberal parliamentarian Ian MCLachlan, former NFF president, recently defended the Coalition ZeroTariff policy; calling the sugar industry a 'tired industry run by tired old men.' That is an insult and a disgrace, and it highlights the difference of opinion between the National Party and the Liberal Party over tariffs. They have clearly broken ranks, and it is about time the Leader of the Liberal Party made up his mind whether he supports zero tariffs for sugar or the 5 per cent the National Party is talking about. Recession",72
74,Mr RONALDSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the very short time. I have I would like to bring to the attention of the House, to people in the gallery and others, that quite extraordinary comment made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) the other day that 'the recession is over'. I invite the Prime Minister to come to places like Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong, and he will soon see whether this recession is over. The simple fact is that we have got empty shops and we have got empty hopes. We have got a great many people-about 18 to 20 per cent-who cannot get a job. I can tell you now that the recession is far from over. If the Prime Mi-ister bothered getting out of this place and started visiting Victoria, or even his own ele.ctorate, he would see for himself just how bad it is. This recession is not over. There is a long, long way to go. It will only be over when this country sees the Fightback policies introduced by the coalition. Jackie Howe",73
75,Mr HULLS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Unlike the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), I want to talk about something sensible. This Saturday, 10 October, is the one hundredth anniversary of a great event in this nation. It will be 100 years to the day since the famous shearer Jackie Howe actually shore 321 sheep with blades. That effort has never ever been beaten. Indeed, it was 58 years after that event occurred before that many sheep were shorn with mechanical shears. Jackie Howe was a great member of the Australian Labor Party. I am pleased to say that to help celebrate that event the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will be accompanying me to Blackall this weekend, and he will be opening the Jackie Howe centenary celebration. It is going to be a great weekend. All roads lead to Blackall, and the Prime Minister and I are looking forward to attending the celebrations. Recession",73
76,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to support the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) in his comments that the recession is far from over. I am glad that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is in the chamber, because he should come to those areas and find out on the ground exactly what is happening. There are people there who cannot get a job, and have been unable to get a job for years. For these long term unemployed people there is no sign of the end of the recessionnone at all. Nor will there be, until there is a coalition government in this nation and we have the opportunity to implement the Fightback package and give some incentives to people-some encouragement and some reward for their efforts. That is really what is needed in this nation. The Keating Government has penalised business and penalised employees with high taxes and high interest charges.",73

In his absence questions should be directed to the Minister for Higher Education and  NA Economy . Mr REITH-My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer explain how the loss of over 60,000 jobs in the last two months justifies the Prime Minister's claims that we were out of the recession long ago and that he has saved Australia?",73
79,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition raises this matter in Question Time. He has proposed a debate on precisely this question after Question Time. So I will not go into detail about it now, except to say this: whatever else you say about what is happening in Australia at the moment, you must concede that the economy is growing. Obviously we would like it to be growing faster. Obviously we would like the growth in the economy to be showing up in an improved level of employment. But Australia is doing rather better than many other economies. I think that is worth acknowledging. The Opposition can only concentrate on the negatives; it can only talk this country down; it can only try to portray Australia as a failureMr Sharp-You have brought it down.",73
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourabie member for Gilmore will cease interjecting.,74
81,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"when, in fact, on any assessment Australia, compared with most other countries in the OECD, is doing well. We are in a world which is growing slowly or not at all. Yet, in that context, Australia is doing better than practically any other OECD country. If we look at what has been happening in the last 10 years, not just in the 10 minutes, we find that we have had a faster growth in employment during the 19808 and into the 1990s than any other OECD country.; we have had a faster growth in the labour force as a whole; we have had the second fastest growth in the working age population within the OECD; and we also have a higher participation rate than the OECD average. I am not trying to make any excuses or alibis on the basis of the participation rate, but worth recording that, if we had the average OECD participation rate, our unemployment rate would be 7th per cent. So these points are worth making, unless you have one single-minded objective: to concentrate only on the negatives and not recognise the great improvements that have occurred in the structure of the Australian economy. The point that the Prime Minister was making yesterdayMr Sharp interjecting",74
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gilmore will cease interjecting.,74
83,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"was an entirely valid point: we have seen a dramatic improvement in the structure of the Australian economy. We have left behind the fact that, when your mob left office, we were essentially just a mine and a quarry, with no expectation of ever being an effective manufacturing country or ever being able to compete effectively in the world. You were the ones who ensured that we got left behind during the post-war expansion in trade, particularly manufacturing trade. Mr Reith interjecting",74

Aviation  directed to the Prime Minister and relates to aviation policy. What information is the Prime Minister able to provide to the House on the benefits that will flow to the Australian it is economy as a result of the aviation policy initiatives that were announced in the One Nation package earlier this year? Secondly, can the Prime Minister provide any further information on significant aviation developments that will also benefit the Australian economy?",74
88,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very happy to take this question from the honourable member for Shortland, who announced the deregulation of Australia's airline system-the key change in Australian aviation in postwar years; the change that broke away from the sweetheart agreements and the two-airline policy that was enacted in the closing weeks of the 1983 election campaign which locked the Government into a two-airline policy for a number of years, until its expiration when the then Minister took the courageous decision to open up Australia's skies. The Government has been able to build upon that path breaking reform. In the One Nation statement delivered earlier this year we announced further changes including, as we have seen since, the acquisition of Australian Airlines by Qantas and the building, in particular with Ansett, of a second international and domestic carrier as well as trans-Tasman flying. The House might like to know that Air New Zealand has just announced that it will commence services to Taipei and Bangkok through Brisbane. It will operate two-weekly Boeing 767 services to each of these destinations from November this year. I note that it is indicating that it will initially inject $14m into the Queensland economy to provide, directly or indirectly, more than 1,500 jobs in its first year of operation from Brisbane. Interestingly, these initial destinations will be expanded by Air New Zealand to an anticipated level of 24 services a week from Brisbane into north Asia and Japan by November 1994. By the end of 1994, Air New Zealand estimates that employment directly or indirectly generated by its operations in Australia will be nearly 10,000, and the Australian economy will be boosted by nearly $90m per ,annum. This very good decision is good news not only for the people of Brisbane and Queensland but for the whole of Australia in terms of employment and the expansion of trade in international servicesnone of which are growing more strongly than tourism services and airlines. The memorandum of understanding entered into in August between Australia and New Zealand provides for another carrier to fly across the Tasman. Ansett has already formed global alliances with four major international carriers-British Airways, Cathay Pacific, United Airlines and All Nippon Airways. Ansett has announced plans to apply for capacity on international air services to several major Asian destinations, including Malaysia. , Last week I had the pleasure of opening a new $200m terminal in Sydney for Ansettthe largest and most luxurious domestic terminal of its kind in the world-which will underpin this growth. It has now applied to the International Air Services Commission for capacity on routes to a number of Asian destinations, including Malaysia, China and India. Significantly, we have seen increased capacity available to service Malaysia following successful bilateral talks between our two governments in June this year. At the moment, the Department of Transport and Communications is conducting bilateral discussions with Indonesia, and talks with Singapore and Japan are scheduled for later in the year. All these important changes in what is a revolution in Australian air travel will see an enormous increase in employment-lO,OOO from Air New Zealand alone-let alone Ansett becoming a second carrier, and let alone the beneficial effects and synergies available from the Qimtas-Australian merger. Today Senator Button announced a very significant decision-that Cathay Pacific, a major international airline, has decided to ,relocate its Hong Kong-based data centre in Sydney. The beating heart of the airline, its database, is going to be based in Australia in Sydney. This relocation represents an investment of around $200m in the Australian economy. Australia· was chosen by Cathay Pacific in preference to a number of major overseas competitors, including Canada and I think Singapore. This decision shows Australia has much to offer as an ideal site in the Asia-Pacific region for advanced telecommunications. Mr Downer-It is the first bit of good news that I have heard from you lot for a long time.",74

93,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When I was in Cambodia recently it was clear to me that every telephone call that leaves Cambodia, or Vietnam, comes and hubs through Sydney. Every phone call to the rest of the world hubs through Sydney and goes out. That proves that Australia is a centre for telecommunications in the Asia-Pacific area. In this decision by Cathay Pacific it is clear, along with the other telecommunications decisions, how important Australia is, because of the changes which the Government has introduced. The structural changes will give us a greater share of the international airline business, cheaper air fares, better services to Australians, better tourism services to and from Australia and, of course, growth in that internationally traded service which a decade ago, under the mine and quarry policies of the Opposition, did not even exist. Tangible results from the One Nation statement are still coming through, as they do every week in the areas of road, rail, air, electricity and all other things which we are seeing changing. But there has been no greater change than the revolution in the airlines first started and presided over by the honourable member for Shortland. Unemployment",76
94,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer him to comments of the Prime Minister in his capacity as Treasurer. in April 1991 when unemployment was 9.2 per cent. He said: The unemployment numbers are of great concern to the Government but we know they will not begin to improve until the recovery is well under way. Since the Prime Minister has now publicly asserted that the recession has not just ended, but ended long ago, why is the trend for unemployment still rising?",76
95,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are actually wrong. The trend rate for unemployment has been improving for the last three months and the trend rate for employment has also been improving over the last few months. You have to make up your mind whether you are going to distort the facts in order to make your grubby points about talking Australia down. You refer to something the Prime Minister said. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. For the sake of clarity, given the statement from the Treasurer, I refer him to the statement which says",76

98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Gippsland.,76
99,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Opposition member wants to make the point that there has been no improvement in the perfopnance of the Australian economy. This could not be clearer the than in something his Leader said in August 1991. He said then, 'This country is hopelessly uncompetitive'. That is what his Leader said in August last year and has repeated on many occasions since then. How could a country which is hopelessly uncompetitive see us become the tenth largest supplier of imports to Japan? How could we be hopelessly uncompetitive if we were doing that? How could we be hopelessly uncompetitive if we had the fastest rate of growth in manufactured exports of any country in the OECD, and indeed among the Asian countries as well? Is that a definition of a country which is hopelessly uncompetitive? Of course it is not. But of course you will not acknowledge that there has been· a massive structural change in the way in which the Australian economy works. You do not have to listen just to me or the Prime Minister. I will quote from the most recent Burvey of Australia conducted by the Economist magazine in 1992. It said: ... in the past decade the authorities have got most of the big decisions right .. . a centrist Labor Government '. . . has got the big strategic decisions right. It goes on to say that we still have a long way to go, which we all acknowledge.",76

When we say 'we ain't what we was' that is what we were when you were in office. As the Economist says, we have made the big strategic changes and the big strategic decisions. We have got those decisions right and Australia is now in a much better position to confront the future than it was 10 years ago. Productivity Growth",77
103,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the' Minister for Intacular. dustrial Relations. Is the Minister aware claims that' the current industrial relationS system inhibits productivity growth? Can the Minister inform the House whether recent developments in productivity support this view? Can the Minister also provide inforwhich mation on the way in which enterprise barper gaining under the current industrial relations system is leading to productivity growth? Mr WILLlS-I am aware of the comments which were made this morning by the Opwas position spokesman on industrial relations, honourable member for Bennelong, who in talking about our industrial relations tem, that the great weakness of the present system is that it stands in the way of workplace productivity. In other saying that we cannot get productivity improvements in this nation at the present time because of our industrial relations syssubstantial tem. This is simply propagation of the kind myth which the Opposition is constantly expressing, as though the Australian had not changed frorn the time that it office almost a decade ago. In fact, there has been dramatic change. no less an area than productivity been quite dramatic change. Far from standing in the way of productivity improvement, the industrial relations system has in fact been promoting that productivity improvement. We have a wages system which for several years has been focused on productivity improvements through the two-tier system, through the award restructuring principle, and now through the enterprise bargaining principle. We have a wages system which for several years has been saying, 'You have to improve productivity in order to get a wage increase'. That of course has meant that we are changing all sorts of conditions of employment. Enterprise bargains are being entered into which involve changes in award conditions to suit that enterprise. There have been changes in fundamental areas such as hours of work and, consequently, substantial increases in productivity are being chalked up in many areas., Some of these increases are quite specI will give the House a few examples. of Dulux Australia in its Clayton plant has, in the last three years, reduced the time taken to produce a batch of paint from 120 hours to 40 hours-a quite enormous increase in productivity. Amecon, the dockyard in Melbourne is producing the frigates, has had a 600 cent increase in productivity over the past four years. I would be the first to admit, since this place is in my electorate, that it probably had a very low level of productivity; but it the same low hwel of productivity as the prevailed for decades under conservative said, governments. It is only under this sysGovernment that that change has come about. ASTA Components in Melbourne has had a 250 per cent increase in productivity in the words, he is past two years. I am getting to the really hard ones now. In the building industry we are starting to see a productivity imprpvemeIit occurof ring through enterprise agreements. A spectacular example was the Great Southern Stand economy at the MCG in Melbourne which was left completed four months early and several million dollars under budget because of the In agreement which was entered into in relation there has to that construction. The company which built this place, Concrete Constructions, is now routinely finishing its contracts under budget and ahead of time. The really hard one, the acid test was given to this Government by the Opposition and by everybody else, was the waterfront-stevedoring; improving productivity in that area. The Opposition lampooned us and said that we would never do it; that we could do it only by sending in the troops, as though one could get some sort of sergeant major to drive a portainer crane. That was the policy of those opposite for improving productivity on the waterfront-and they said it would never happen. Mr Sharp interjecting",77
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Gilmore will cease interjecting.,78

107,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is completely undeniable. Mr Sharp interjecting,78
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Gilmore. If he interjects again I will name him.,78
109,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, the work force has been reduced by 44 per cent from October 1989 to June this year and it will be halved by the end of this month. That is a tremendous reduction in the number of people employed but, of course, there is no less amount of cargo going across the wharves. In fact, there is more, which means that there have been very considerable increases in productivity. By June of this year the number of TEUs per employee shift had almost doubled from 1.25 in 1989 to 2.35 in June of this year. That is almost a doubling in employee productivity on the waterfront. The container crane handling rates have gone up by 46 per cent to June of this year and are now at or near the level of our international competitors. The ship turnaround time has reduced by 39 per cent through the improved crane handling rate. On grain handling terminals we have had labour requirements reduced between 50 and 80 per cent. We have had vessel turnaround times that reduced from 41/2 days to 21/2 days. The stevedoring costs have been halved, and the Wheat Board has acknowledged that this is now saving it $10m a year. Yet the honourable member for Bennelong says that the industrial relations system stops us improving productivity. What an absurd statement. We are seeing that productivity improvement occur over the whole economy and not just in isolated examples. Last year, a year in which this economy was just clambering out of recession with low growth, we had an increase in productivity which was almost double the average rate of increase in productivity for the previous dozen years-2.6 per cent against 1.4 per cent. We are seeing it happen across the whole spectrum of the economy, not just in isolated cases. It is happening under the current industrial relations system. The facts of the matter quite unambiguously are that we do not need to introduce a sweatshop facilitation policy, as the Opposition would have us do, in order to increase productivity in this country; we do not need to strip away award conditions; and we do not need to abolish the protection offered by the Industrial Relations Commission to increase productivity.

Is the Minister aware that last year 66,000 used car engines and 700,000 used tyres were brought into Australia from Japan? Is he aware that this trade is at great cost to Australia's motor trades industry and employment and undermines Australian design safety and environmental standards? Did the Government recently impose a $12,000 tariff on imported used cars to prevent the destruction of Australia's car manufacturing industry?

The trend 'rate for unemployment has been improving for the last three months ...

The seasonally adjusted rate for unemployment has also improved for the last three months. If I used 'trend' when I was referring to unemployment, I apologise. I have so, made the point, however, and it is a point worth making, that the trend rate of employment growth has actually been improving. It might be worth reminding the Leader of the Opposition of what he said last night. He said, 'If unemployment improves, we will welcome it'. Actually, unemployment on a seasonally adjusted basis has improved for the last three months, so why do you not welcome it? Last night you said that you would welcome it, but all you can say is that Australia is on a slippery slope to nowhere. ",79

122,Mrs JAKOBSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Prime Minister aware of reports that a goods and services tax on food would represent an unjust imposition on the Australian community?

123,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the Government he considered major taxation reforms in the middle 1980s, we invited the various interest to sit in the chamber of the Parliament the last and put their views for a week. Mr Riggall-That was outrageous.",79

125,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it is, because you did not want any views from anybody who matters. You are not prepared to listen to community views and you do not facilitate them, and even when they are put you disparage them. I refer to the publication by the Catholic Social Welfare Commission which states: It is argued that taxing people for their consumption of food undermines the essential human dignity of every Australian. Further, a regressive system of taxation, one which places the tax burden on the less well off, contravenes the Catholic principles of the common good, human solidarity, human dignity, preference for the poor, and the common use of goods. There was great umbrage taken at that by the Liberal Party and the National Party. The Catholic Social Welfare Commission was attacked and invited to a meeting which was held this week between the honourable member for Pearce, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Senator Alston and the honourable member for Bradfield, whereupon the honourable member for Pearce attacked with a broadside Bishop Power, the Chairman of tile Bishops Committee. They jumped right into the Catholic representatives-Father John Usher, Father David Cappo and Bishop Patrick Power-hopped right into them about daring to have the right to express their views. Apparently it was an awful meeting; a vicious little meeting. Is it not shocking that the Catholic community comes along and puts a view about their tax! Yet we find that Senator Alston wrote to Father Cappo in the last week and said in regard to taxation and food: It was a second-rate polemic parading as a moral argument. Sweeping, absolutist pronouncements. Yet despite the initial front, the pamphlet proceeds to the mealy-mouthed assertion that taxing food ... Yet, it makes no attempt to do the hard work, instead preferring to opt out of the economic debate altogether and rely instead on moral arguments.",80

127,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The arrogance of it! There is more. It continues: Airy pronouncements about the preferential option for the poor and upholding the principle of human dignity are simply not at issue and of no assistance in the real life taxation debate in this country. He says that upholding the principle of human dignity is not at issue. He continues: We are told that the foundation of the document is the primacy of human dignity and, therefore, people need freely available life sustaining elements such as food. He continues: It is understandable that those untrained in the laws of economics should at times feel uncomfortable about debating them. social The arrogance of this! You arrogant lot. You nasty lot. Senator Alston continued: The crass attempt at moral indignation is surely no substitute for a practical poverty alleviation dialectic. Mr Snowdon-They should be ashamed.",80

129,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He goes on to say: To put forward a few broad moral principles about which there is no community disagreement and then claim the high moral ground on the basis of an utterly superficial attack on the GST is not even good advocacy. Finally, he says: Christians who propose schemes for poverty relief have a commensurate duty to know the laws of economics and do their homework. Shame on the Catholic Bishops Committee and the Catholic Social Welfare Commission. Shame on them for not doing their homework and not knowing the laws of economics. Senator Alston says in his last sentence: Sensible poverty policies take account of economic laws rather than childishly dismissing them as unfair. The arrogance of you is just unbelievable.

It is hard to see this document as non-partisan. There is the charge. In other words, the Catholic Bishops Committee and the Catholic Social Welfare Commission is actually proLabor and working for the Labor Party. What are you going to do, Fred-take their names and put them on the antagonists list? Are you going to put them on the list? Are they going to go on the list?

It is worth recalling that most countries of the world with consumption tax either zero rate food or reduce the rate on it. Even .in Britain,just in the last couple of months Prime Minister Major has objected to food being included in the VAT. How dare the Catholic Church raise the issue when in fact most countries either exempt food, zero rate it or reduce the ratel One could debate the tax treatment, but what we are debating here is the sheer conI ask the tempt that the Liberal Party has for someone who dares question its policy.

To get Bishop Power, Father John Usher, Father Cappo and other members of the Commission together and boot them around in a meeting where you take politicians' licence against them for daring to raise these issues shows what a scornful, biased, selfish and spiteful little group you are. This week's Catholic Weekly has on the front page-and good on it-'Hewson's tax on food unfair'. It goes on to quote the views of the society of St Vincent de Paul and other people associated with the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission. But the real lesson in this is the contempt which every interest group has received. Nobody is sacrosanct from copping it, whether it is Mr Prescott; the Managing Director of BHP; whether it isMr Sharp-What about Arvi Parbo?",81

156,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The honourable member for Gilmore is suspended from the service of the House for 24 hours. The honourable member for Gilmore thereupon withdrew from the chamber. Mr KEATINGIn answer to the question, the Leader of the OppoSition is all confused. The question was not about a value judgment-it did not ask me about taxing food. The question was, 'Can the Prime Minister say whether the Governm-nt accepts the right of community organisations to express such views?'. I never called any of the people seated in the 1985 Tax Summit childish. I never told them that they do not understand the laws of economics. I did not tell people that they were partisans, that they were Liberals or that they were wolves in sheep's clothing. In fact the Government never proceeded with the tax - and food was a very live issue in the debate as to whether it would proceed. The fact is that groups were invited along and heard with the respect that was accorded their positions ill Australian society. They were not treated with this sort of contemptchildishly dismissed, told that their assertions were mealy-mollthed or that they were partisans or that their policies were distortions. The honourable member for Pearce hopped NOES into a couple of non-politicians at a political meeting in the privacy of their quarters-good old knee-bending Fred, hopping into a couple of Catholic priests behind closed doors- Of course, in all of this, the humbug of it is that, after these quite savage. attacks upon this group and upon their motives, the Leader of the Opposition has got the hide to invoke the Pope's teachings in an encyclical. It takes a fair bit of gall to hop into people PAIRS in such an unceremonious, dism!ssive and arrogant way as this and then invoke their spiritual leader, the Pope, in an encyclical",83

They are all out of step-the Japanese are out of step; everybody is out of step with good old Dr Hewson. He is the only one who understands. When he was up there at the merchant banks in the 1980s, he was having vested in him the god-given right to understand all the moral and economic questions. How dare any group come along and say to him that it does not like his policies! I say to the Leader of the Opposition: do not think that, because you can have some debate about whether or not food is taxed, it will excuse you from this vile treatment of an interest group putting the interest of the poor to you as .the alternative government. You have slapped them in the face while invoking the words of their spiritual leader to defend your rotten policies. J obskills Program",83
162,Dr CATLEY,NOES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can the Minister infonn the House of the benefits available under the Government's Jobskills program; has the. program been successful in retraining people for re-entry to the work force; is the Minister aware of alternative program proposals; and what are the Government's intentions in this matter?",84
163,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"The Jobskills program is an extremely effective training program which was initiated by this Government. Through public organisations and local government bodies - n. opportunity is provided to people on a trammg wage of some $280 a week to undergo a process of training to reskill them for the. "",:ork force. There are now many beneficlanes of this program around the country. One of the beneficiaries was referred to in Que-tion Time yesterday. Greg Read, who is a VIetnam veteran, was mentioned in a que-t-on by.the I;eader of t-e National Party. IndIVIduals m thIS community are entitled to their privacy, unless they choos'e to involve themselves in the political process and then comment might be made on them. I do not know whether that applies to Mr Read; I suspect not. Nevertheless, his name was raised in this chamber yesterday by the Leader of the National Party. Mr Tim Fischer-And he is doing a course.",84
164,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! The Leader of the National Party will cease interjecting. . Mr BEAZLEY-He is getting very defenSIve, and well he might. In an interview that Mr Read did on the radio today, he was asked: Now you are currently undergoing a jobskill program? Mr Read replied: Yes- - hat's right. What I've taken upon myself is realismg that the electrical industry itself is suppressed, so I am obtaining training in the computer industry. Next, he was asked: And do you feel confident that when you finish that retraining you will get back into the work force? He responded: Yes, I do. I feel as though I have a lot to offer the computer industry. The interesting thing about that Jobskills program is that it is lined up for abolition. People from the Opposition stand up here and ?0I? into us on the question of retraining, but It IS absolutely essential these days that people be able to take advantage of employment opportunities as they come through in the labour market. Jobskills has bee- succes-fu- in giving people that opportumty and It IS now successfully placing people in the Australian work force. That is precisely one program of many in the labour market area that the Opposition intends to abolish. What unbelievable humbug it has been for the Opposition to raise this program in this place! To pick up on a further point in the honourable member's question, it is the intention of the Opposition to cut some $585m off these labour market programs leaving $555m of the $1,140m proposed fo; 1992-93. In addition, Jobtrain would be restricted by Fightback to the level that would have been provided in 1991-92-in effect, a cut of $15Om, bringing total initial cuts to some $735m, leaving $405m behind. Basically, some 220,000 positions will be cut out of 420,000 under the proposals in Fightback and the subsequent statements by the Opposition in dealing with the proposals that came forward in this Budget. The propositions the Opposition is putting forward would mean that 220,000 people like Mr Read would be denied the opportunity that Mr Read now has. As I said at the outset, I do not think this is an appropriate place to discuss the position of Mr Read, and we would not be discussing his position in this place were it not for the fact that the Leader of the National Party decided to raise it here. I wish Mr Read luck and compliment him on the confidence that very he has that the program he is going through will provide him with an opportunity to reenter the labour market. That is a very good thing for him. Others who are interested in his situation might bear in mind what the Opposition would have in mind for him and others like him were it to be elected and were it to implement what it is increasingly becoming obvious is its position. It would bring forward a recession that it wants to have in order to go through all the processes th-t it intends to go through: suppressing opportunity in the labour market, cutting wages and using the plight of the unemployed-not in the sense of it being an opportunity to retrain people so that they have further opportunities in the work force, but as a pool of unemployed labour to hold down wages. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",84
165,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I move: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith-That the Prime Minister be required to explain to this House how he has 'saved' Australia with policies which plunged the economy into the worse recession in 60 years, created 927,000 unemployed and 500,000 more not getting enough work.""",85
166,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,Thanks very much. We will take that on.,85
167,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Reith-I second the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative, with an absolute majority.",85
168,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I move: That the Prime Minister be required to explain to this House how he has 'saved' Australia with policies which plunged the economy into the worse recession in 60 years, created 927,000 unemployed and 500,000 more not getting enough work. In the course of Question Time today we saw the lengths to which this Government will go to distort and misrepresent the facts in order to ensure its political survival. On both occasions it was completely blown out of the water. The first attempt was by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), who made the claim that the trend rate for unemployment has actually been improving for the last three months. He went on to say: You have to make up your mind whether you are going to distort the facts in order to make your grubby points about talking Australia down. Damned out of his own mouth, because in the subsequent question he had to withdrawOpposition members-And apologise.",85
169,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"and apologise and admit that he had deliberately and knowingly distorted the facts in relation to that. Then the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gets up, as only he can, in his pure and sanctimonious fashion, and mounts an argument about the exclusion of food from the goods and services tax, when he argued the most persuasive case for the inclusion of foods-damned out of his Orders mouth! The highlight of the week was the two absolutely incredible and outrageous claims made by the Prime Minister-again blatant attempts to misrepresent the facts-in an attempt to ensure his political survival. They were: 'The recession was over long ago' and 'The Government saved Australia'. What could be more than just a set of words from a desperate man, a man who is absolutely out of touch and a government that is absolutely out of control. They have no idea what they are doing or, if they claiIl1 to have any idea of what they are doing, they do not care what damage it does to the people of Australia. We are now into a pre-election mode where Government members will say or do anything, Motion misrepresent anything or distort anything for short term political gain. We can almost pick the daily routine of the Prime Minister and his colleagues. They generally have a stunt of some type to massage expectations, catch a headline or grab the moment to try to divert attention from the major facts and the economic debacle that the Prime Minister has inflicted on this· country. The Government basically is run by PR and not by policy. It is dominated by politics and not by policy. The Prime Minister has no answers to Australia's economic ills so he diverts attention with a stunt or some attempt to grab a headline. He does not care what it is and he does not care how important it is to the people of Australia. He will attack the flag, the Queen, the issue of the monarchy itself, the British",85
170,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"And the Americans. He even uses his overseas trips not to represent the interests of Australia in a foreign country but to score cheap political points back in Australia. Since November last year there has been a whole succession of stunts designed to divert attention from the real issues. The second part of the daily routine of Government members is to get up and be negative and to carp and whinge about the coalition and its policies, the fact that we have solutions that will deal with Australia's economic problems. Members of the Prime Minister's back bench sit back on a daily basis and hope that somehow he can deliver a phrase that will let them live another day in terms of their standing in the polls. I can tell the Prime Minister that, as far most Australians are concerned, the recession is far from over. He might get a warm inner glow by quoting some growth numbers and the end of negative falls in economic activity but, from the point of view of most Australians, the recession is far from over. Rather than saving Australia, the Prime Minister has stuffed Australia. The Prime Minister will go down in history as the man who has done the most damage to this nation in the course of just eight or nine years in term as both Treasurer and Prime Minister. Every time he goes for a headline he dashes the hopes of the average Australian. Today I challenge the Prime Minister, as I did almost a couple of years ago now, to leave Canberra and to get out and determine for himself whether the recession is actually over. Mr Snowdon-What do you think he has been doing?",86
171,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Oh, you are a fool!",86
172,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I am a fool, am I, for actually suggesting that you talk to the people of Australia? I am a fool for suggesting that you actually get out of here and go and talk to some of these people who are enduring the pain and hardship of your recession. I am a fool, am I, for saying that? There are a lot of people out there who would desperately welcome the opportunity to put their case to you. For example, there are nearly one million people who are unemployed in this country. In the last month alone there was a 43,800 fall in employment - a further destruction of jobs-and in the last two months about 100,000 Australians have given up looking for work because they find it such a hopeless exercise. The ones that the Prime Minister should go and talk to are the 680,000 children that live in homes where no-one has a job. He might ask them whether they think the recession is over. Mr Snowdon-Fraud! You are a fraud!",86
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory!,86
174,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"He might ask them whether they feel that he has saved Australia. There are 680,000 children who live in homes as where no-one has a job, or nearly 700,000 children currently living in poverty in Australia. The Prime Minister should go and ask those 700,000 children whether the recession is over and whether they see him as a saviour of their nation and of their livelihood and families. Perhaps he should go and see the one in six Australian children aged under 14 who have no breadwinner-a member of their family in employment. He should ask some of them whether the receshis sion is over, whether he is seen as their saviour and the saviour of Australia. Let him go into any class of 30 kids in Australia and see five children in there who have parents who are either unemployed or out of the work force. He should ask five children in every class of 30 whether the recession is over and whether they think he has saved Australia. Go out and talk to the 50 per cent of sole parent families, mostly headed by women, who live in poverty under your policies. Ask them whether they feel that the recession is over and that you saved Australia. Go down and talk to St Vincent de Paul, for example, which helps 40,000 people per month in New South Wales alone. Ask to be introduced to those 40,000 people and ask those people whether they think your recession is over and whether you saved Australia. Go and see the Wesley Mission, which estimates that every night 10,000 children sleep on Sydney's streets. Go and ask to be taken out on one of its buses and meet some of those 10,000 kids who sleep on the streets. Ask them whether they think the recession is long over; ask them whether they think you are their saviour. Go and see the Salvation Army, for example, which cares for 1,340 homeless people nationwide every single night of the year. Ask to be introduced to the 1,340 homeless people across Australia. See whether they feel that your recession is long over and you are the saviour of Australia. Go and ask the Salvation Army about the 1,021 food vouchers and the 5,432 meals it provides per day around Australia. Ask to be taken along to one of the Salvation Army soup kitchens and sit there and talk to those people to see whether they think your recession is long over and that you are their saviour. I am sure they will welcome you with open arms. Go and see the inner city crisis centre of the Salvation Army, which has experienced a 100 per cent increase in the number of people seeking help in the past year. Go and look at the Sydney inner city crisis centre of the Salvation Army and ask to be introduced to those people. Ask them whether they think your recession is long over and that you are their saviour. Go along to the Smith Family which has announced a 35 per cent increase in the number of people seeking assistance. Agencies are having difficulty meeting the demand for food hampers. Go and ask them to take you along when they are confronted by somebody who as- for a food hamper. Ask that person whether he or she believes that your recession is long over and whether he or she thinks that you are the saviour of the nation. Go along to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, where there are 10,000 people seeking clothing and fumiture-a 100 per cent increase on the same period in 1991. When those people come in asking for a chair or sweaters to keep them warm, ask them whether they think your recessionMr Keating interjecting",86
175,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"You do not like it, do you? Mr Keating interjecting",87
176,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"But you are going to hear it, because this is what is going on out there. You sit around here and play your stupid political games as their hardship grows day after day, week after week, and month after month. They have had enough of it. Go and ask those people whether they think your recession is long over and whether you are their saviour. Go along to St Vincent de Paul which has assisted three-quarters of a million people in 1991. That is a 27 per cent increase in the demand for its services over 1990. Its emergency assistance costs it $25 1hm. Ask to be introduced to all of those people and then ask those people whether they think your recession is long over and you are their saviour. One hundred .thousand Sydney residents have phoned Lifeline for assistance. Go and ask to speak to them. Go and sit on the telephone and take one of those Lifeline calls. Tell them, 'Listen mate, don't worry; my recession is over. I am your saviour-St Paul-I am here'. Do not be ridiculous. Go and ask one of your own, such as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), about income inequality. He says that in the last 10 years the distribution of wealth has become more unequal. Go and ask him about it. Go and ask some of your own backbenchers. You can talk to only about half of your back bench-at least that was the number at the time; you probably cannot talk to that many now. Most of them are persona non grata in your office which is run by your PR types who are looking after your image, trying to make you look good and organising your next stunt; when in fact they should have you out in the streets talking to some of these people upon whom you have inflicted pain and hardship. Go and look at the extent of family breakdown in Australia and the way it spins off into crime. One of the reports I saw in recent days-I think it came from one of the Catholic bishops conferences which you seem so intent on quoting-states that at least two million poor Australians face lives 'that are greatly and sometimes brutally shortened by malnourishment, disease, drug addiction, violence, crime and a pervading sense of hopelessness' . Mr Chaney-Under whose policies?",87
177,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,Under the Government's policies. Mr Chaney-Keating's policies.,88
178,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,His strategy is about trying to forget the recession and trying to distract people's attention from the recession because he has no answers. He haS no capacity to put in place,88
179,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,The recession is over.,88
180,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Oh, the recession is over. It is long over?",88
181,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Yes, it is.",88
182,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"You are going to repeat it again, are you? I think you should go out and meet some of those people and tell them that you think the recession is long over. I am sure they will have a real warm inner glow; I am sure they will believe what you say. You have a history of deliberately and knowingly misrepresenting the circumstances in relation to the recession. It is no better summarised than in today's Courier-Mail cartoon with a person who looks distinctly like you, blindfolded, and with a nose that continues to grow. At the end of the nose it says, 'To be continued'. At the start of the nose it says, 'We are not in a recession'; in fact, you went on and guaranteed that there would not be a recession. It turned out, of course, that there was a recession. What happened? 'It's the recession we had to have'.",88
183,Mr LLOYD,UNEMPLOYMENT,Here is a bigger copy.,88
184,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I need a bigger one. We should have known; we should have recognised the fact that this was the recession we had to have. Then what happened? 'The recession was over long ago'-the last great whopper. You go all over the country knowingly and willingly distorting every single fact, every single development, in order to try to make yourself look good and save your political hide. It has nothing to do with looking after the people of Australia, it has absolutely nothing to do with saving Australia; it is all about saving Paul Keating and nobody else. It is not about creating a job for any of those people. It is all about saving your jobone job at the expense of all jobs. That is the type of government you have built: the type of government that is incessantly focused on the short term political headline, the favourable press. We need no better evidence than what you do every single day in answer to almost every single question. What do you do? You read quotes from newspapers. You must get up every morning and pour over them to see whether you have a decent day's press. I know you are such a nice guy that when the press goes against you, you just grin and bear it. You do not ever ring them up; you do not ever attack them; you just grin and bear it and say, 'Oh, golly gosh, look what they have done today. They are off the mark again'. Look at them up there, they can tell you what life is like. They have had one of those phone calls. I had some time as a journalist and I felt the heat occasionally, too. I think he demanded that I get fired almost every week. The Prime Minister is driven by the political headlines. He does not care about the issues; in fact, some people go so far as to say that he does not know much about the issues. He certainly does not care about the issues. He does not go out of his way to try to put policies in place which he knows are right. Back in the middle 1980s he had just been made-what was it?-Finance Minister of the Year or Treasurer of the Year, which we heard about incessantly for months. Mr Reith-The world's greatest Treasurer.",88
185,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"'The world's greatest Treasurer', that is the expression I am looking for. It went to his head a bit.. He decided, 'There is a bit in this, there is a good headline in this. I had better go out and try to reform the taxation system'. So he went out and advocated what he knows is right: genuine tax reform. Including what? A broad-based goods and services tax. He argues very persuasively. In fact, the best case I have seen for a broad based goods and services tax was mounted by this bloke in 1985-pages and pages of quotes. I have four pages of specific quotes just on food-on why food should not be exempted from the goods and services tax. He used to go around the country and say, 'You have got to be able go home at night and know that you have done the right thing'. To get to sleep at night you have got to be able to go to bed and say, 'Yes, Paul, today I did do the right thing'. Have you had any sleep in the last couple of years? Have you had any sleep at all in the last couple of years? What happened to the Paul Keating of 1985? Where did he go? He argued very strongly the case for not exempting food from the goods and services tax, and he put a whole string of arguments. I probably have a couple of them here. Mr Beale-Read us some.",88
186,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I will put a couple of them on the record: Exempting food from the tax would:he said, do four things· make the tax exceptionally cumbersome, particularly for small businesses ... Opposition members-Right!",89
187,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,Secondly: significantly increase the possibility of evasion; Opposition members-Right!,89

189,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,And: · raise the issue of what types of food should be exempted which is already a major anomaly underUnder what? The wholesale sales tax system. Opposition members-Right!,89
190,Dr HEWSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"He went on to explain how it was much better to target compensation to people through the expenditure side of the Budget and have a generalised tax on expenditure on the other side. He said: · .. the Government is strongly opposed to exempting food from the tax. Indeed, I would not contemplate introducing a retail tax which included exemptions of items in the supermarket basket. This was in Launceston on 18 June 1985. Then in Hobart the next day he did a radio interview and was quizzed about it, because it was a live issue. He said again: Indeed, I would not contemplate introducing a retail tax which included exemptions of items in the supermarket basket. ... I'm not cutting it off, I'm killing it stone dead ... killing it stone dead. It's not a matter of cutting off an avenue for a day, I'm killing it stone dead. Then he used to go around and argue that people would try to distort the argument. People in his position had a responsibility, he said, not to distort and misrepresent and go for the cheap headline. Remember that? He said how easy it would be to try to mount a scare campaign to frighten people that would set the cause of this country back for years. This is the man who today claims he saved Australia, but on one test-whether he could bring in effective tax reform-he fell completely over the hurdle. He was unable to deliver the tax reform and has now resorted to this constant, incessant distortion and misrepresentation of the facts for his own short term political ends. It shows just how far this hypocrisy goes that members of the Government still say it. In letters sent out by the Treasury, for example-and I have one here in front of me-the Treasurer talks about the issue of exempting things and targeting assistance. He says: The Government believes that in virtually all cases the most efficient way of providing assistance to needy people is through the expenditure side of the Budget and not through the tax system. This way the money can be targeted to those whose income levels are the lowest. This was said by the Treasurer in recent correspondence. Those opposite still argue the case, but they still go out and misrepresent the circumstances to the people of Australia. Prime Minister, you have made two of the most outrageous and incredible claims this week. The recession is far from over for most Australians, and I genuinely urge you to get out of here and talk to some of the people that I listed to see what they feel about it. Rather than having saved Australia, Prime Minister, you have absolutely stuffed Australia.",89
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Is the motion seconded? Mr Reith-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,90
192,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I move: That all words after 'that' be omitted with to substituting the following: 'the Leader of the Opposition owes this House and the public an explanation for his determination to impose employment destroying policies such as the GST, the cuts in labour market programs and zero tariffs. The House is further of the opinion that the Leader of the Opposition owes the public an explanation for his contempt and intimidation of the various groups in Australia who question or oppose his policies and his negative comments about Australia such as his statement yesterday that Australia ""is on the slippery slope to nowhere'''. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a point of order. Mr Beale-Sit down. Mr Reith-Sit down. Mr Ronaldson-Sit him down! ",90
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Order! The honourable member for Forrest is out of order. The honourable member for Bendigo and the honourable member for Ballarat! I warn the honourable member for Ballarat. The Leader of the National Party has the call. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the wording of that amendment moved by the Prime Minister. I point out that there are quite specific rulings on the construction of amendments to motions. I ask that you rule that that amendment, as worded, is out of order.",90
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The important test is whether or not an amendment addresses the substantive matter dealt with in the original motion. In this case the amendment does, so the motion is in order.",90
195,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,The Leader of the Opposition got up to move his motion having hardly asked a question all week. He has hardly participated in the debate.

196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,The honourable member for Bruce!,90
197,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"In a very weak introduction to his remarks he said, 'The Prime a view Minister has mounted a case for the exclusion of food'. I made no such case whatsoever.

199,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"In fact, what I was responding to was this question: Can the Prime Minister say whether the Government accepts the right of community organisations to express such views and indicate whether the Government intends to continue to consult the community about major policy issues? That was the issue I directed myself to. I directed myself to the savage remarks in the letters of Senator Alston and the honourable member for Pearce to the Catholic Church and its groups.

202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,The honourable member for Higgins!,90
203,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Those are the facts. It was good enough for this Government to sit the whole of Australia's interest groups in the chamber of the House of Representatives in 1983 for the economic summit, as it was good for the tax debate to sit them there for the 1985 tax summit and listen and take like a man their criticism without spiteful rebuttal or abuse. It was good enough for us to sit down, as I did with my colleagues this year, and consult with people right around the country on the One Nation package, as we did at the recently concluded youth summit, where we again heard abuse and criticisms of Government policy without spiteful rebukes or attacks. That is the issue here-not trying to manufacture a case that I was actually arguing for the exclusion of food. That is another matter. What I was talking about was your viciousness-your vicious behaviour. You have now attacked just about every group in the country. One has to wonder just what sort of a goveriunent yours would be. Mr Connolly-You have lost the jobs of one million people.",90
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,The honourable member for Bradfield!,91
205,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I do not think the Australian community has ever seen a government, any government-conservative or Labor-led by a person and a group who have developed such characteristics of scorn and spite about virtually the whole of the interests of this country; whether it be the Treasury, the ABC, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, the RBA Board or its Governor, the financial markets, the environment groups, Phillip Toyne, the Press Gallery, Mr Groom, the business community, the Public Service, ACOSS, the Australian Catholic SQcial Welfare Commission, Jac Nasser and John Prescott, the ethnic leaders, or all the Australians who are· told that they are rationalists, losers, bludgers arid that they will not work. Mr Connolly-What about the million and a half whose lives you have ruined?",91
206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,The honourable member for Bradfield!,91
207,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"These are all of the groups that you have attacked. Now, of course, the Catholic Social Welfare Commission has had the temerity to say: It is argued that taxing people on their food undermines the essential human dignity of every Australian; further, that a regressive system of taxation, one which places the tax burden on the less well off, contravenes the Catholic social principles of the common good, human solidarity, human dignity and preference for the poor and the common use of goods. That is a view. It is a very respectable view. Why should it be met with words such· as 'mealy-mouthed assertions'? Why should that view be met with words such as 'They are untrained in economics' and 'a crass attempt at moral intimidation'? Is this the Liberal Party of Malcolm Fraser, Bob Menzies 'or John Gorton? Of course it is not. It is a Liberal Party of spiteful, small people who cannot accept criticism from anybody. This notion is that of a creature of the eighties boom, driving around in a Ferrari telling me about people and their jumpers; about the poor whom this Government has provided for with a massive increase in unemployment benefits-someone who wants to tip people off unemployment benefits after nine months. We had the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) yesterday invoking the valour of a Vietnam veteran to make a lousy point about unemployment only to find that the man is actually retraining himself from one industry into learning computer usages and techniques-under a program which the Leader of the National Party and the Leader of the Liberal Party would abolish. The gall of you! The viciousness of you! The issue here is whether we would see under Hewson one of the most spiteful, vile governments in the Western world-that is, a party masquerading as a party within the democracies but with such contempt for individuals that, as he says, it will take their names. There is a list of thoseOpposition members-Where is your newspaper?",91
208,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,Here it is-'Hewson draws up a list of Fightback's friends and foes'. I have been in public life for 23 yearsMr Connolly-Too long! Too long!,91
209,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Too long, some say. Bob Menzies would roll in his grave at this sort of stuff. He would roll in his grave at the viciousness, the callousness, the singleminded savagery of the responses to all these people. And we dare to say, 'How dare you thug around a couple of Catholic priests in a Parliament House committee room' to someone who is retiring from politics, who knows that he does not have to run the gauntlet of public opinion' again-the honourable member for Pearce. We are saying, 'What a shocking thing to raise'. The Liberal Party says, 'We have a right to knock around the Catholic church'. Not only does it knock the church around; it actually invokes an encyclical of the church's spiritual leader, the Pope, to attach to its lousy policies. How duplicitous and brazen are you? I will give you marks for being brazen. You flew into the Catholic Church, while you have actually invoked the Pope as a source of the basic policy material of your Party. How contemptible are you? Then we heard the Leader of the Opposition talking about Lifeline at the Wesley Mission that used to be in Castlereagh Street, which he would burn past in his boom time Ferrari. He was talking about the Wesleyans. You are not worthy to tie the Wesleyans' shoe laces, much less mention their Lifeline. You omitted, of course, to tell us about telephone calls to Lifeline about the HowardHewson recession of 1982-83. When you all scurried off into the private sector to make your money, you forgot to tell us about the misery we were left with and had to try to pick up through the 1980s. Having removed Australia from being basically a quarry, a mine and a farm without hope and without economic salvation to a country which is now engaged prosperously with the rest of the world, when we would otherwise have seen our current account deficit double, you ask how I dare say. the Government has saved Australia's economic hide.",91
210,Mr REID,UNEMPLOYMENT,Because it is not true!,92
211,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,It is absolutely true.,92
212,Mr REID,UNEMPLOYMENT,It is not!,92
213,Mr KEATING,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It is absolutely true. We have given Australia back its future. As a .trading country it can lift its head up around the world. What are we left with? The dullards of the Opposition who did not know what to do. I remember in 1983-and I have said this before-the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was glad the burden of responsibility had transferred to the other side of the House. He thought, 'Thank God someone knows what to do with the place, that someone has a policy to pull Australia out of the vacuous gloom it is in, slipping away as a primary producer without any hope of paying for its imports or maintaining a First World standard of living'. How glad he was that I was sitting there until midnight and one in the morning working out a strategy in early 1983 with my colleagues; that the Treasurer was sitting in the ERC for six and seven weeks on end trying to fathom a policy. He was so glad we were there to internationalise Australia and to see the great shift to exports, competitiveness and low inflation. As if you would ever have the wit to get the inflation rate to 1112 per cent when it was sitting around 10 per cent for a decade and the so-called people of business managing the economy knew naught what to do with it. You knew nothing about what to do with the the changes to enterprise bargaining. All you want to do is change down to lower levels of remuneration, not change up to more innovation and flexibility. Just down, not upas always! As· I said yesterday, the speech made by the honourable member for Bennelong could have been made in the middle of the Britain of the late nineteenth century, because that is about ,all you are good for. You do not understand people. Then the Leader of the Opposition· comes forward with this brazen humbug about unemployed families, the very o-es he would tip off and send to the soup kitchens· after nine months. After nine months he would do it to them, as the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said yesterday, all to jockey fora position outside the closed doors of Australia House in Britain to find some shelter for the night. That is what he would do. He would take the unemployment benefits off deserving people who, through no fault of their own, have been unemployed. Of course unemployment is too high and has to be got down, but why treat these people so savagely as to knock them off unemployment benefits after nine months? Then we heard the bleat about sale parent families-the gall of you; the ones that you will knock off benefit if they have children over 12. So sale parents with a child over 12 are tipped off unemployment benefits into the street, and yet you have the cynical gall to raise their fortunes here in this debate, from the comfort station of your position in life. Shame on you for uttering such words. Then there was his diatribe about food, and he quotes my words. I may have said it, but I also agreed on the last day of the Tax Summit deliberations to exempt food from a goods and services tax. Not only did the Government exempt food from the implication of a VAT or a GST, but we did not impose such a tax because in the end we did listen. When the Catholic Social Welfare Commission and other interest groups gave their views about taxing food and the impact of a GST, they were not savagely and brutally attacked.

224,Unknown,UNEMPLOYMENT,Government members interjecting,93
225,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Order! Members .of the Government should not interject on the Leader of the National Party.,93
226,Mr TIM FISCHER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It is a sad state of affairs when we have a Prime Minister with such a selective memory, particularly with regard to events of 1985-the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) caught him out absolutely red-handed today-when he was arguing for a GST, and when he was arguing . for a GST on food without qualification. He was caught out and he could not take it. He had to come back into this House and crabfish and crawl out of the circumstance that he was caught in and exposed in today. I will remind the House of what really happened at the Tax Summit.· I will remind the House of how this man, right to the end, pursued option C; how this man argued in support of a goods and services tax being introduced in this country; and how, late one night, in a motel room-a grubby motel room, we are told-the previous Prime Minister met with members of the ACTU behind the back of the then Treasurer, the present Prime Minister, and at that meeting with members of the ACTU sabotaged option C, sabotaged the then Treasurer-left him high and dryand caused the then Treasurer to come up with the words, 'Bob Hawke is a jellyback'. Do honourable members remember that comment? The Prime Minister cannot take it, and he cannot take the series of quotes which I would like to remind him of right here and now. I ask honourable members to remember the Prime Minister's attack of about two years ago, right here on the floor of this House, against Nobby Clark. It was an attack against a person who was not a member of the Parliament, an attack under privilege, an absolutely abusive attack of a banker who was prepared to state the truth. What did the Prime Minister say? I quote: I will ... start on Nobby Clark. · .. whenever bankers scream' about interest rates we know that the public interest is getting a kicking somewhere. When it is heard from Nobby, we can generally believe that the public interest. . . is · .. getting a kicking ... Had I not saved his bank from insolvency in 1986, he would have been. I remind honourable members that Nobby's ... bank went insolvent in 1986 and was saved by the bank subsidy introduced byrne on behalf of the Government. He goes on to say: · .. Nobby's board would certainly have had him selling shoelaces and pencils in Collins Street. That is abusive language, which we have heard from this Prime Minister time after time. Today was one of those key turning points. Today was the turning point to the Federal election-where the Prime Minister went over the top, where the Government went over the top. The Prime Minister, in his call that the recession had ended long ago-that he had saved Australia-finally broke any remaining shred of credibility that he might have had with some of the Australian people, and lost the plot. Labor has lost the plot. Labor has lost the Victorian State election, has lost the elections beyond Brisbane, and is now on the way to inglorious defeat at the hands of the people of Australia. The sooner that comes, the better for all our sakes. I tum to the arrogance of the Prime Minister. We learnt from the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) that he is going to Blackall this weekend. I would like to remind the House of what happened when he went to Charleville in the floods around ANZAC Day 1990. First, he had to be dragged screaming to visit those floods. The then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, rang him twice from Gallipoli to tell him to get up there. Eventually he went. When he went, what did he do? He could barely extend two fingers to shake hands with the people of Charleville in their desperate time. He raced around the place, took off, and gave very little hearing to their real problems on that occasion. To this day, the people of Charleville talk about their contempt for this Prime Minister for the way he approached that visit to that tragedy affecting that town at that time. It gets worse. I refer to the famous visit to the Tree of Knowledge, that Labor icon buried up in the middle of Queensland in Barcaldine. The Prime Minister went there some little time ago and made one of those brief visits that he is inclined to make-plenty of sunglasses, plenty of Italian suits, plenty of tight scheduling so that he is not exposed to meeting the people in front of the post office or the council chambers. What happened on that occasion? He was caught out again. He was overheard to say loudly and clearly, 'How soon can we get out of this place?' How soon can we belt off back to Sydney, or back to the pig farm in the Hunter Valley, or back to the resort in the Northern Territory'anywhere other than meeting the people in Queensland on that particular occasion. So we will watch closely his schedule next weekend. We will see how much time he is spending in fair dinkum contact with the people. There has been no more arrogant a Prime Minister in the history of Australia than the current Prime Minister of this Labor Government. Bob Hawke, to his credit-we never agreed with him politically-when he made a visit to an area in Australia, for example, during the 1988 bicentennial program of visits, or pursuant to floods and other suddenly arising events, went out of his way to greet the local member, whether he was from the Liberal, Labor or National parties. Bob Hawke went out of his way to meet people in genuine circumstances. He heard them out and listened to what they had to say. Bob Hawke, in his years in the prime ministership, in many ways had far more ability to listen, to learn and to take account of what the people were saying than this Prime Minister would ever have, no matter how long or how little time he spends in the office of Prime Minister. That is what annoys this Prime Minister: he is not even Bob Hawke's bootlace in tenns of his governance of Australia. The Prime Minister's record economically did so much to sabotage the perfonnance of the Hawke Government. Whether we look at Keating and the foreign debt legacy that he leaves to this country, or any we like to look at, fundamentally Keating got it wrong as Treasurer, Keating has got it wrong as Prime Minister",93
227,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Order! The Leader should use the appropriate title.,95
228,Mr TIM FISCHER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Labor and his Government have lost the plot. If those opposite want some more figures in relation to that, I draw their attention to the ABARE figures in respect of the fann sector. That sector has gone to hell and back in recent times, partly due to world recession-I acknowledge that-but also due to the policies of this Government adding to the burden on the fann sector, the small business sector and, indeed, on so many hard-pressed families around Australia. So it was that, on the official ABARE statistics, last year fann income was a negative $29,100; this year, a negative $25,700. There is real and abject poverty and agony across so many of the fann households of Australia from one end of Australia to the other-a degree of agony, a degree of deprivation which few people, including members on both sides of this House, would have had to personally endure in their lifetimes, but one which could have been partly avoided, and the burden of which could have been partly eased if we had had a Treasurer who had not been so arrogant as to maintain those interest rates so high for so long and drive this country into recession ahead of the rest of the world, into recession deeper than the rest of the world and into a recovery which is fragile and slower than that in many other parts of the world at this time. I want to say also that it is not just the fann sector that is affected. As the Leader of the Opposition so correctly and effectively put to this House a few moments ago, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Salvation Anny, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and a wide range of organisations are bearing an enonnous burden in this recession. I want to quote from Greg Fitzgerald from the St Vincent de Paul centre in Wodonga. These were his exact words last weekend as reported in a newspaper article, and I bring them to the attention of the House: ""On Wednesday we had people lined up waiting other legacy that for help"" ... ""We didn't get a break-it was like a doctor's clinic with one person after another. ... $3,500 worth of food vouchers and parcels had been given out last month. This is in the town, the centre of Albury Wodonga, where 60 years after the Great Depression there are three soup kitchens, community kitchens, operating. It is a disgraceful situation. Mr Fitzgerald went on to say that in two days last week they had given out another $700 worth of food parcels. He is reported as saying: ""Domestic violence has definitely been one of the reasons we are so busy. I think it has a lot to do with the pressure people are under these days,"" he said. "" We get cases from all over the place where the mother and children have just grabbed whatever they could and run for their lives. ""They have got nothing when they arrive herenot even a cup to drink out of. ""We have to set them up with pots, pans, tea towels, furniture-all these sorts of things. ""We have had to set up eight families this year with furniture, clothing and food. ""It's a good thing we don't get personally involved ... These people come under enonnous pressure. Mr Staples-Tell us what you would do about it.",95
229,Mr TIM FISCHER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I will tell those opposite what we would do about it. We would give $100m to the Salvation Anny, to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, to St Vincent de Paul-to a wide range of organisations-to provide some coalface assistance in these horrific circumstances. In relation to the related matter, Skillshare, let me take this opportunity to say to the House that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) got it wrong and the Prime Minister got it wrongand quite deliberately. In fact, I spoke with Mr Greg Read before I asked that question yesterday on the floor of the House. What he had to say about the Prime Minister was unprintable. That is why I did not quote those aspects from Mr Greg Read. He told me that he is on a job training program, Jobskills. In very clear-cut terms, Fightback states: To achieve this, we will establish Local Employment Boards, comprising locally based business people, voluntary agencies, community representatives and Departmental officers to decide the allocation of funds between the various alternative programs including Skillshare, Job Search Assistance, a refocussed JOBTRAIN (providing longer-term training), JOBSKILLS and Special Intervention programs to provide basic literacy, numeracy andpresentational skills. So we are not, abolishing the governance of this country with some scorched earth approach. What we are about is fair dinkum jobs, not mickey mouse jobs. What we are about is a fair dinkum vision for Australia; one with less government, less taxation, more incentive, more productivity and more jobs. After all, Australia is one of the few countries in the Western world persevering with a payroll tax. We have one million unemployed, a 10.8 per cent unemployment rate and a trend rate, which has been rising over the last three months, of 11 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, my colleagues and I would welcome any fundamental downturn in the unemployment levels and any fundamental economic recovery in all sectors of the Australian economy. But it is not there. If the Prime Minister and his Ministers got out of their capital city circuit they would hear loud and clear the extent of suffering, poverty and agony. The Prime Minister might then start to be a little more empathetic, rather than dishing out bashings to so many people on so many occasions. It was only last week on the John Laws program that the Prime Minister decided to have another lash at the wool growers of this country and the woolgrowing industry. He attacked them up front in a gratuitous circumstance which was unnecessary and revived elements of a debate long since gone. I think it is about time this Prime Minister came back into this House and gave a fair dinkum statement on behalf of the people about the direction of his government and the economic policies which will get this country back on the rails. He has his opportunity. He had the One Nation statement. If the Prime Minister had come in here in presenting the One Nation statement-it would have been a big ask-and said, 'I was right in 1985. For the national interest, I will take up the cause of tax reform and abolish payroll tax, sales tax and fuel excise tax; greatly reduce income tax; and introduce a GST', he would have had support from this side of the House. Okay, that was too big an ask. What if he had even come into the House and said, 'I'll abolish the holiday leave loading in the circumstances facing Australia at this time. '? That would not have been an unreasonable ask. He could not even bring himself to do that. The truth of the matter is that the One Nation statement has failed Australia. It has failed to bring economic direction to Australia and it has failed to ignite rail reform, which is so much needed in Australia. That has fallen off the tracks and is badly in need of a rescue plan again. The Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has equally failed Australia, and the unemployed know that loud and clear. I must say that in all those circumstances it is time we had a Federal election to give this country a coalition government with the alternative vision, the fundamental tax reforms and the industrial relations reforms that will get Australia back on the rails, and the sooner the better.",95
230,Mr DAWKINS,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I rise to support the amendment moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). This debate proceeds on the basis that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) believes that the Prime Minister should be listening to what the people of Australia are saying. He says that the Prime Minister is ignoring what the people of Australia want and that he should listen to what they say and, apparently, change his ways. The extraordinary part of this debate is that it comes from the man who has prided himself on his inflexibility and the fact that he will not listen to people. When he does go through the pain and the anguish of actually listening to an alternative point of view, his response is not to say, 'That's a very interesting point of view. I will take it on board'. No, he proceeds to thump the table and abuse those who have a different view from his, and he does so in what I understand is the most colourful of language-language which is unrepeatable here. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Me Reith) ought to talk! He also is known for his colourful language in the way in which he has dressed down those organisations which have dared to criticise either Fightback or any of its particular ingredients. The point which the Leader of the Opposition has to contend with is that not only is he not listening to people who are talking to him now and trying to impress upon him the folly of his policies; he is not even listening to his own back bench. The Party is in revolt because its members have had thrust down their necks this totally unsaleable policy by a leader who is becoming not only incomprehensible himself but also a total albatross as far as the coalition is concerned. I would love to have been at the party meeting this week when the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) and the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) had the courage to draw themselves to their feet and begin the process of tearing down this Leader who is leading their Party nowhere. It is people like the honourable member for Ryan and the honourable member for Dawson who understand where their Leader has gone wrong and where his polices are wrong for Australia and seen to be wrong by most Australians who have taken any notice of them. What the honourable member for Ryan said in the meeting was, apparently, that the consumption tax was an electoral problem and that it was no good saying that it was not. The Leader of the Opposition is stuck with a policy on which there was no consultation, no involvement of the wider Party and not even any involvement of the parliamentary Party. The content of this policy was kept the most intricate secret by two or three of them who said, 'We know what's right for Australia. We will listen to no-one. We will not even listen to those people who elected us to these positions of leadership within our Party'. It is not just the honourable member for Ryan and the honourable member for Dawson who are expressing their views. They join an extending list of members on the back bench, including the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) and the honourable member for Boothby (Me Steele Hall). And how many others would there be if they had the courage to express their views about what they know is wrong with the Liberal Party and the coalition? I mention the coalition only in order to bring in the National Party. and its poor, pathetic Leader, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who has been dragged along as the mute supplicant to this policy. He was not involved in it. He was not consulted about it. He was just told, 'If you want to be in this, you've got to accept this in' every detail'. So he has a Party in revolt, most particularly in Queensland. The Party members know that this policy is wrong. They know it is wrong for Australia, they know it is wrong for their constituents, and what is most galling for them is that they know it is wrong for their majorities as well. This is an opportunity for us to examine the alternative approaches of the Government and the Opposition. Those opposite have come in today when there has been a release of unemployment data and tried to portray the Government as trumpeting this employment data as evidence of the fact that the economy is on the mend. Has anyone done that? Has the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Me Beazley) done that? Has anyone here tried to say that the data which has come out today is unambiguous evidence of the fact that the labour market is improving? No, we have not. What we have done, however, is repudiate the attempt of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to say that this is evidence things are getting worse and to question what we are going to do about it. The Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy will look for any piece of negative information, any negative statistic, in order bolster their squalid case about what is wrong with this country. That is what is wrong with this Opposition. It will not, as it proclaims, participate in a sensible debate about what . needs to happen within this country and the kinds of changes which have occurred and need to continue to occur. It wants to talk down the efforts that have been made not just by the Government but by hundreds of companies around Australia as they have made the transition. The figures that the Prime Minister mentioned for our improved export performance have not come out of the blue. They have not come from the man in the moon. They have come from the conscientious efforts of Australian companies and Australian men and women working to improve the performance of their enterprises and, therefore, the perforworse mance of this country. The fact that we are now exporting 23 or 25 per cent of GDP is not just evidence of the success of our policies; it is evidence of the fact that Australia has changed and that there are hundreds and thousands of Australians who have been part of that process of change. Do we ever hear from a Liberal politician any sense of congratulation or commendation for those companies or for those working Australian men and women? Do we ever hear any grudging respect for the efforts that they have made over the last 10 years to make their companies more competitive, to redirect them from the small market in Australia to the growing market in the region and in the rest of the world? I am yet to hear from a Liberal politician any indication of commendation for the great efforts that have been made by so many enterprises and so many workers in Australia. All Opposition members will do is talk down, disparage and then abuse anyone who questions whether, in the light of this transition process which is under way in Australia, we need to embrace this mad policy that which the Opposition is trying to inflict on Australia-a mad policy which has as its centrepiece the bit which Opposition members want to disguise and keep as secret for as long as possible: this tax switch which will to involve the transition of $40 billion worth of taxation from one source to another in the most inequitable way imaginable; a way which will advantage the .rich and disadvantage the. poor. The point of this debate about the contribution from the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission is that it is making the simple point that if you do tax food and if you do tax the necessities of life, you are taxing people regardless of their circumstances and regardless of their wealth. You are taxing the poorest in the community on the same basis as the richest in the community. The Catholic Welfare Commission is only making exactly the same point that the Treasury made earlier this year when it said that 70 per cent of households would be off. What does the Opposition do when confronted with this evidence, whether it is from the Catholic Welfare Commission, the Treasury, or anyone else? Do Opposition members ever sit down and say, 'Let's go through this. Let's look at what can be done about this.'? No, they do not do that. They simply disparage, abuse and traduce the authors of this criticism. It does not matter whether they are from the Treasury-hard working public servants who are dedicated to this Government, as they have been dedicated to every other government that has ever been elected to office in this country-or they are members of the Catholic Welfare Commission who are concerned about the poorest in the community. What is the vested interest of the bishops other than to protect the poor and to speak up for the poor who on their own are voiceless and without an opportunity to represent their cases effectively? This is a question of whether or not the Opposition comes to this debate with clean hands. What Opposition members want to disguise is the fact that with their policies they actually want to make things worse in this country. All the sensible advice and all the sensible analysis of their policies reveal one important thing: the Opposition has no ability to deal with the question of how to handle the inflationary consequences of its policies. Opposition members admit there will be inflationary consequences. What we know, and every sensible observer knows, is that there is only one way in which they can handle that-that is, by squeezing inflation out through higher interest rates. It may be that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is unaware of what he has been shackled to. What he has been shackled to in his .leader is an unreconstructed monetarist who believes that these questions can be dealt with simply as a result of the exercise of the policies of the central bank. Even the Leader of the Opposition thinks that the way in which you can deal with the inflationary consequences of the Opposition's policy is to put up interest rates. The consequence of that will be to reduce output and increase unemployment. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may not yet be aware of that. This penny may not yet have dropped with him, but it certainly has with the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition knows precisely what he is on about, and that is why he is proposing two dramatic changes to the way in which public policy works in Australia: first, by insisting upon the independence of the Reserve Bank, and secondly, by removing from its charter any concern about employment. The reason for that is simple. First of all, you instruct the Reserve Bank to concern itself only with price stability-that is, with low inflation-then you say to it, 'Under no circumstances can you have any concern for the social consequences or the employment consequences of that policy'. Then you say, 'Because you are independent, we are unable to influence you'. When, as a result of the inevitable exercise of the Reserve Bank powers, interest rates go up and unemployment goes up, the Opposition Leader-or the Prime Minister, as he would be under those unfortunate circumstances-can stand up and say, 'This is nothing' to do with me. This rising rate of unemployment is nothing to do with me. It is that wicked Reserve Bank Governor who is actually putting up interest rates and creating unemployment in this country'. This is the German solution to the Austmlian economy: you have an independent Bundesbank where you can set yourselves up with an alibi against the inevitability of a prolonged recession and increased unemployment in this country. I make the point that Max Walsh made in the paper this morning: you would have to be raving mad to embrace the policy of the Bundesbank in Australia and inflict that upon Australia. The important point about this debate is that it is not only about the fact that the Opposition wants to extend recession and make it a pennanent feature of the Australian economy; worse than that, it actually wants to withdraw the support from those people who are affected by it. The fact is that it would remove 90,000 of the poorest people in .Australia-those now on unemployment benefits-from any government support. Of course, Opposition members say, 'That's not what we want to do', but if we take their savings at face value, they would have to rip 90,000 people off in order to make those savings. So 90,000 people who are now dependent entirely on unemployment benefits would get nothing-a big fat zero-from the Liberal-National coalition. The Opposition wants to rip away all the support which might be available to help people back into the work force. This is a squalid policy for government on the part of the Opposition because it tries to disguise the fact that it not only wants a prolonged recession in this country but also wants to penalise the victims of such a recession. That is what is so absurd, ridiculous and outrageous about its criticising us under these circumstances today. (TIme expired)",96
231,Mr REITH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I suspect that people in the gallery and those listening to their radios today who have just heard the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) speak would be asking themselves, 'What's he talking about? What's he on about?'. I will start by giving people the words of the motion we have moved. They are: That the Prime Minister be required to explain to this House how he has 'saved' Australia with policies which plunged the economy into the recession in 60 years . . . Behind all the diatribe and all the convoluted logic that we have had from the Treasurer is one simple fact: this week, after putting the Australian economy into the worse recession for 60 years, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) . had the incredible gall to get up and say that the recession ended long ago and that he was the one who saved Australia. No wonder he did not make any sense; that is beyond defence. No-one in his right mind would believe the Prime Minister's proposition that he has saved Australia. I suppose that as I rose to speak to this motion there were some on the Government side who were feeling a wonderful sense of relief. They have been feeling a lot better that the Labor Party and more particularly the Prime Minister-our new Messiah, shall we call him-has actually saved Australia. Those opposite were feeling a lot better and happier and they were happy to believe it. Some might have believed it because the man who said that he had saved Australia was the very same bloke who, when first elected Prime Minister by Caucus, said, 'In future I'm going to tell you the truth. I'm not going to gild the lily. I'm going to tell you honestly exactly how things are'. Some might have believed him when he got up to make the claim that he has saved Australia and that the recession was brought to an end a long time ago. If it were true, I suppose some honourable members opposite might have been able to hear the proof that the Prime Minister has saved Australia. We should be able to hear, even in this chamber, the revivalist chants of salvation sweeping across the country. Mr Deputy Speaker, can you hear that chant of salvation, 'Hallelujah, we've been saved.'? Are the one million people who are unemployed and on the dole queues singing, 'Hallelujah, we've been saved.'? Are those half a million people who would like to work a bit more, if they could find a job, the underemployed singing, 'Hallelujah, we've been saved.'? Are the thousands of people in business who have seen their whole life savings lost, who have lost their businesses and have had worse to sack people that have worked for them and been close to them for a long time saying, 'Hallelujah, we've been saved by Mr Keating.'? What about the parents of young adolescents who have been trying to get into a university and could not get in, or the parents of young people who have tried to get a job and have not been able to get one? Can honourable members hear them in the distance beyond Canberra-out in the real worldsaying, 'Hallelujah, thank heavens; we've had a recession and Mr Keating has saved us.'? No-one in the country believes that Mr ' Keating has saved Australia-not a person. The Prime Minister could not even find a Minister yesterday who would get up and say unequivocally, 'It's obvious that the recession was over long ago'. No-one believes that Labor has saved Australia. No-one is hearing the Prime Minister's delusions. I will tell honourable members what people are hearing: they are hearing the sounds, they are hearing the noises and they are hearing the recession. They are hearing the agony and the pain of the recession. The real people are hearing people knockingon the doors of employers saying, 'Have you got a job for me?' and employers saying, 'Sorry, there are no vacancies'. The real people outside hear the auctioneer's gavel coming down at a mortgagee's auction. They see people's assets that they have worked hard for being sold under their feet and doors of businesses being closed. They do not hear the Prime Minister's delusions; they hear doors being shut and slammed in the face of young people who have turned up at a university or a TAFE trying to get in and give themselves the chance of an education so that they can better themselves during their lifetime. There is no chant. There are no revivalist cheers from the crowd and people standing in queues saying, 'Thank heavens, hallelujah for Mr Keating. He has saved Australia'. The reality is to be seen, as it has been so strongly highlighted today, in the latest labour force statistics. They are not just numbers; these are literally tens of thousands of our fellow Australians who bear the brunt of this man's recession. The man created the recession and boasted that it was a recession that we had to have. Now that it hurts him politically, he has the incredible gall to get and deny the existence of the damage that he has created. r will show honourable members how bad these people are. Today r asked the Treasurer a question. It was a pretty simple question. Basically r asked him why the trend rate for unemployment was still going up. He denied it. It was the proof positive that these people will lie through their teeth to deny the existence of the recession. He actually denied the fact which he must have known, and which even he ought to have been able to read, that the fourth paragraph on the first page-one poes not have to read far to get to it-of the statistics that came out today and which everybody would have been reading states that the trend estimate of the unemployment rate continues to increase and now stands at 11 per cent. It has actually gone up. These guys reckon there is a recovery and it started ages ago. The unemployment trend rate actually went up and the Treasurer had the gall to stand up and try to deny its very existence. Instead of just getting up and saying, 'r was wrong; r apologise', it was qualified. It was always qualified. When one looks at the figures, one sees that in terms of employment, last month we lost 43,800 jobs. We lost 60,000 in the last two months. Where are the cries of 'hallelujah' for that? Sure, the trend estimates for employment have shown some very small increases-taking the figure from this document-but they are very small. The trend estimate for full time jobs-that is, the jobs of breadwinners-has actually been going down; it continues to fall. There is no recovery evident in those figures. As useful as the figures are, they do not tell us the whole story. This morning Ed Shann appeared .On radio. He is a well recognised expert and has done some figures. He has not only taken into account the official unemployment figures, but also he has worked out how many people are underemployed and would like to work more if they had a chance. We do not have 927,000 people unemployed, according to his numbers; the real figure is about 1'/z million. It is not today's figure of 10.8 per cent; it is up 17.8 per cent. The Prime Minister said in here that the recovery started ages ago, that the recession finished ages ago and that he had saved Australia. What is reflected in today's figure is the fact that a lot of people have just given up hope. If one takes into account the technical change in the participation rate and if those people had not given up hope and were still looking for job, our unemployment rate today would not be 10.8 per cent, it would be 11.9 per cent. There is no salvation in a figure of 11.9 per cent. Going beyond the official statistics, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) did today, the Wesley Mission has done an estimate of the number of children sleeping on the streets in Sydney; the Smith Family has announced a 35 per cent rise in numbers seeking assistance; and St Vincent De Paul assisted three-quarters of a million people in 1991-that is, a 27 per cent increase over 1990-and its emergency assistance costs were $25.5m. How can these people stand here as they do? They claim to be the great champions of social justice, but look at the damage they have wreaked on our fellow Australians. And they come in here and deny it. It is incredible that they come in here and deny the existence of a problem that they are responsible for and created. One does not have to believe me. Put the party politics aside and look at what Merle Mitchell said: Whether or not we're technically out of the recession is really irrelevant. The pain is far from over. Those are simple words. It is a simple fact that cannot be denied. Let us look at the number of people who are long term unemployed. The figure was about 325,000 in August, and that is not the end of the matter. A number of experts have told us that that figure is going to go to half a million people-half a million Australians who are unemployed for 12 months and more. Yet the Prime Minister came in here and said that the recession finished long ago and that he had saved Australia. That is appalling. What contempt these people show for those who are suffering from this unemployment to actually say that the problem that they created is now over, when we know that 160,000 or 170,000 fellow Australians are going to be long term unemployed in the next year or so over and above the 326,000 who are, today, long term unemployed. Of course, the anecdotal evidence is only part of the story. The unemployment figures give a picture and as you talk to your friends and the welfare agencies that gives a picture-as do the State Bank of New South Wales and the Chamber of Manufactures. What is business saying about this so-called recovery which has been long under way? The September quarter result states: Manufacturers will be disappointed that their expectations of a September quarter recovery were not fulfilled. Where is the recovery in that? Where are the manufacturers who are saying, 'Hallelujah! Australia has been saved.'? It goes on to say, 'Employment remains weak with little lowing, improvement in sight'. And we could go We see constantly a sorry tale of deception from this Government. These were the people the who said, 'We won't let there be a recession'. philosophy. They deliberately set out to mislead people We before the last election. When the recession finally came-and it was like drawing teeth to get an admission out of the Prime Minister that in fact we were in a recession-he said, 'Great news, this is what I wanted all along. This is the recession that we had to have'. now find that the recession is over, the recovery is on its way and he was the one who saved Australia. One of the best cartoons you will see appears in today's Courier-Mail. What a ripper it is. I hope people in the gallery can see it. It depicts Pinocchio-actually it is not Pinocchio; it is a bloke who looks like Pinocthat chio. It is very telltale actually. This bloke has a cork in his ear: he· does not listen. says, 'We are not in a recession' , and is about six inches long. He continues, 'It is the recession we had to have', and his nose has grown a foot. He then says, 'The recession was over long ago', and his nose is about a metre long and a bit more. At the end it says, 'To be continued'. We should expect more of the same. Those opposite will lie and cheat all the way to the next election. We had it in front of us again todayexample after example. The Treasurer got up and denied that the unemployment trend rate was rising and he was forced to withdraw his distortion and lie. We then had the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) saying that we were going to scrap the Jobskills program, and we are not. It is there in writing on page 254 of Fightback!. On the question of taxing food we heard the most convoluted argument from the Prime Minister. But the fact is that in 1985 he was in favour of taxing food and the introduction of a consumption tax. Yet in the last few days he has been trying to fudge the issue and say what a nasty terrible thing it would be. He is playing politics on that issue. He also misrepresented our approach to the Catholic Social Welfare Commission. We said: Human dignity and freedom is enhanced by alas much as possible, for decisions to be on. made by individuals and by families. IThe objective of the Catholic Church is shared by Coalition Parties and, in fact, is central to our also share the Church's recognition of the need to protect the poor and disadvantaged. We acknowledge its right to be involved in this debate and we have acknowledged that for the last couple of years. It is just a lie to say otherwise. Our motion ought to be supWe ported and the Government's motion deserves to be chucked out.",99
232,Mr BRERETON,UNEMPLOYMENT,The reason we are having this debate in the chamber this afternoon is to provide a smokescreen to cover the revelation the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his colleagues have scandalously He attacked the bona fides of some of the best his nose motivated people in Australia. Mr Reith-Rubbish.,102
233,Mr BRERETON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that they have not attacked the bona fides of these people. I remind him of what the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) had to say in attempting to cut down the paper of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission by calling it 'a wolf in sheep's clothing'. He went on to say that he was very sorry that the Commission had, by its actions 'appeared to put the Catholic Church behind such weak and incomplete arguments'., That is what he said. That is not cutting it down, is it? He said that the Commission had produced 'a sadly flawed paper'. Oh yes, those opposite are very keen to listen and take notice. People have a legitimate right to participate in the process, but the first time they speak out and express a view on behalf of their constituents they are belittled, attacked, abused, intimidated, threatened, treated with contempt, rubbished, and finally they are thugged. It does not just stop and start with the honourable member for Pearce, because his efforts were greatly elaborated on by Senator Alston. He took It upon himself to say to a group who had legitimately expressed a view that they had produced 'a second rate polemic parading as a moral argument'. He said that they had made 'sweeping absolutist pronouncements' and that they were 'mealy mouthed assertions'. He said that there was 'no attempt to do the hard work'. This is terrific stuff, is it not? These people have said what they think and this is how they have been treated by the Opposition. He said that it was: · .. not good enough intellectually, let alone morally, to rail against the regressive nature of one element of tax reform. . . He continued: · .. all we get from the pamphletof the Catholic Social Welfare Commission· .. is a childishly fatuous cop out that ""the real impact of the Coalition's GST and the compensatory measures are unknown and are in dispute"". He goes on to say: It is understandable that those untrained in of economics should at times feel uncomfortable about debating them, let alone canvassing the often technical implications of proposed economic solutions. They are finally treated with absolute contempt, belittled and vilified. I will explain to the House just who is behind the paper. Mr Ronaldson-This is coming from the NSW Right.",103
234,Mr BRERETON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Here we have it again. The honourable member for Ballarat says that the paper is a product of the NSW Right He again seeks to belittle the Catholic Social Welfare Commission. He seeks to belittle the people of goodwill who have devoted their lives to helping the poor and the underprivileged. They have taken, as far as the priests are concerned, a vow of poverty and have devoted their whole existence to this area of concern. Yet they are treated with disgust. These are people such as Father John Usher, Father David Cappo and Bishop Pat Power. He did not just speak on behalf of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, but as the Chairman of the Bishop's Committee on Social Welfare. Speaking on behalf of all of the bishops, his remarks, along with those of all the rest, are described as a 'crass attempt at moral intimidation... surely no substitute for a practical P?verty alleviation'. That is what has been saId. Of course, none of his remarks are given any intellectual credence at all. %en we look at who has been doing a lot of the leg work in this area we find Dr Terry Dwyer. He is a product of the Commonwealth's own Treasury; a PhD and a brilliant economist. He is hard-nosed with a brilliant scientific reputation. How is his work treated? It is treated like all the rest-with contempt. We find people like Esther Doyle, who is a great Catholic Churchwoman, has devoted her whole life to this work and is a charitable woman in every sense of the word. She has been treated with contempt. I see that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has come to the table and he is going to take part in this debate. It would be very instructive if he would tell us the laws exactly what his colleague the honourable member for Pearce had to say about Bishop Patrick Power. As the honourable member for Bradfield was there, I dare him to give us chapter and verse as to what the honourable member for Pearce, in his thuggish way, said about the Bishop's work. It is worth looking back at what has provoked this great outburst from the Opposition. It is worth looking at the paper itself-volume 1, No. 2 of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission bulletin. It argued that: . . . .taxing people for their consumption of food undermines the essential human dignity of' every Australian. That is what it said and it said it in good faith and for a good reason. Furthennore, it continued: ... a regressive system of taxation, one which places the tax burden on the less well off, contravenes the Catholic social principles of the common good, human solidarity, human dignity, preference for the poor and the common use of goods. All laudable sentiments, all properly expressed by people with a genuine concern for their constituency. What does the Commission get for its trouble? It is abused. The Catholic Social Welfare Commission goes on to say: The introduction of any system of regressive taxation goes against the Australian sense of a fair go and the principles of soHdarity, common good and option of preference for the poor and disadvantaged. What was it met with? It was met with and threats, it was treated with contempt rubbished and, finally, it was thugged by the honourable member for Pearce. There is nothing new about that. That is how those opposite have treated every critic who has ever said anything that was at all difficuJtfor them to live with in their run up election. Anyone who has reflected on any one of their policies has been treated with exactly the same sort of abuse, the same sort of belittlement. It is worth looking at the views of those behind the paper. Eminent people, such as Father David Cappo, is quoted in this week's Catholic Weekly. He was asked what he had to say about the argument that a tax on food would affect the rich more because they spent more money on food. That was the argument put to Father Cappo by the Catholic Weekly. He said the following in response, which tells us where Father Cappo is coming from: The argument is true because the rich have got more money to spend on food. But that argument misses the point that the poor or low income families will spend a higher proportion of their income on essentials of life such as food than the rich. That is where Father Cappo is coming from; that is his concern, and it is a very real concern. It is a concern that is shared by everyone on this side of the House. Speaking about the people and on behalf of the people he represents, Father Cappo went on to say: They were paying rent and had other commitments and were also trying to obtain meat, vegetables, dairy products, cereals, butter for their families. They are his legitimate concerns. He continued: If you then start putting a tax system in place on essential foods, even though you have compensatory measures in place, the low income family in particular is going to suffer, because they are going to have to pay an extra percentage of increase on essential foods and they have a very limited income, compared with a wealthy person who can afford to spend more money on food even though it is a small percentage of their overall income. When someone like Father Cappo says this in good faith, someone who has devoted his life to helping the underprivileged in society, what abuse do we get? We get the same as the car and makers, the Reserve Bank, the Nurses Federation, the environmentalists, the social welfare lobby-ACOSS, the renters, and our major trading partner got the week before last. And now the Catholic Church is getting the same sort of rubbishing: being belittled, to the next abused and intimidated. I do not believe there is any place for this sort of conduct in Australian public life. This is a very robust place. We are able to trade political insults with the best of them. But those opposite are dealing with a very different class of people when they take it upon themselves to attack the Catholic Church, when they take it upon themselves to attack well-motivated people who are simply trying to point out the concerns they have for the underprivileged in the community. The second point-after we get past the reality that this afternoon's debate is a smokescreen to try to get around that-is the attempt by the Opposition to obfuscate the issue by suggesting that its policy is in some way the same as the proposal of the Prime Minister (Me Keating) in the early 1980s. That is what those opposite put up this afternoon; that has been their defence. There is a world of difference. Those opposite know that there is a world of difference, and the world should know that there is a world of difference. If we go back to 1985, what did we see? We saw a Labor Party, a government, listening and taking notice. Having a consensus view expressed, there was an opportunity for all concerned to have their six pennyworth, to meet, to talk, to say what they think and to have it taken on board. They had an opportunity to have all those views properly analysed and carefully considered by the Government. Finally, it was rejected. Why? It was rejected for a very good reason: after all that process had been gone through, there was no way that anyone could find a way of properly compensating people for the imposition of such a tax. That is exactly the point that the good priests and lay people in the Catholic Social Welfare Commission have been saying, the point that they have been making. The concern that they have today is the same as the concern expressed back in 1985. However, there is one big difference. It is a far cry from suggesting that the position of the Opposition in any way reflects the position of the gentleman, who is now the Prime Minister of Australia, back in 1985, because we listen and those opposite do not. We did not abuse. We walked away from the goods and services tax on food when we could not find a way of doing it to cover the interests of these people. After that, the Labor Party walked away from it completely. We did it without abusing Catholics or anyone else. We did it after careful consideration, the most careful analysis, and for the very best of reasons. The efforts of the Opposition this week in further abusing and adding to the insults of the honourable member for Pearce and Senator Alston, by having the honourable member for Pearce attack personally the bona fides of the good Bishop, are beneath contempt. Quite frankly, the Opposition should be walking away from them. They should be hanging their heads in shame, and then they should be apologising profusely. That is what they should be doing. I say to those opposite and to the House: there is no place for this sort of conduct in Australian public life. They can attack us all they like, but they should not attack wellmotivated people who are doing their best for the people they have a genuine concern for. Those opposite stand condemned in this place and around this country from their own words: the words of Senator Alston, the words of the honourable member for Pearce and the words that have been expressed in the House today. Those opposite even came into the House and intoned the St Vincent de Paul Society as something that we should look at. They might like to have a look at the front page of the Catholic Weekly this week, because St Vincent de Paul has rushed into print on this very issue. They are not just fighting the Catholic Social Welfare Commission. A front page article by Me Cliff Baxter states that the Catholic Social Welfare Commission: . .. was supported by the New South Wales president of the St Vincent de Paul Society, Mr Robert Fitzgerald, who said: ""The Society in NSW has been concerned about the goods and services tax as it affects those in greatest need. ""We note with interest the comments of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission and would support in principle the exemption of food. ""Clearly, we don't support the taxation of essential food items. That is where the St Vincent de Paul Society is coming from. It goes along with every other concerned element in the community in expressing that view. If those opposite had any sense, they would listen and would walk away from it. In the meantime, they certainly ought to apologise for what is a very black day in Australian public life this week.",103
235,Mr CONNOLLY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Bradfield) (4.33 p.m.)The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) has just asked the Opposition to apologise for what he calls a black week in Australian politics. Let me say this to the honourable member and to all other members present: if there is any apology to be made, it is to be made to the Australian people. It should be made by this Prime Minister (Mr Keating), by his Ministers and by every single member of the Senate and the House of Representatives representing the Australian Labor Party. Never before in the history of this nation have over 1112 million people been forced into unemployment by the deliberate failure of policy of this Government. Never before in the history of this nation have so many people, their families and their children, seen their future destroyed before their eyes, a position completely brought about by a government that simply has failed utterly to regard its primary responsibility, which is the welfare of the Australian people. We have heard nothing at all here today in support of the Government's case. May I read, for the benefit of the House, what this motion in fact stated: That the Prime Minister be required to explain to this House how he has 'saved' Australia with policies which plunged the economy into the worse recession in 60 years, created 927,000 unemployed and 500,000 more not getting enough work. That is the subject before us today. We saw the Prime Minister come in here, in his usual mealy-mouthed, mew ling manner, complaining because the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his colleagues have had the guts to stand up and say, 'Enough is enough'. We have had the courage to say to the Australian people, 'We will look after your interests when this Government has plainly failed to do so'. We had the courage to go to the Catholic Social Welfare Commission the other daynot, as suggested by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith and by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), with the intention of being overbearing or with the intention of forcing our position upon them-simply to point out that if the Commission wishes to enter into a major area of political concern and debate, it is only fair that the basis of our analysis be seriously taken into account in the totality of its final report. The members of the Commission said in this report, and perhaps this paragraph emphasises the weaknesses of it more than anything else: The real impact of the Coalition's GST and the compensatory measures are unknown and are in dispute. In the case of life sustaining food it would, therefore, be more just and more appropriate for maintaining human dignity not to tax food. The difficulty is that there is no price on human dignity, and no price at all contained in this document which in its very first paragraph said: The message of this document is a simple one. The message is: Food is a necessity for life and a tax on essential food is neither a good nor a just imposition on the Australian community. We had discussions two days ago and incidentally, for the benefit of members of the Government, these discussions did not take place in some room in this building. We went to the Catholic bishops themselves. We did not demand that they come to us; we went to them. That is hardly the action of people who are overbearing, domineering and determined to force their point of view upon others. At the end of our discussions it was agreed that the bishops would report back to us on the basis of their claims, and they have now done so. I now want to take the opportunity to read into Hansard what the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission reported to us in a letter dated 8 October: Dear Mr Reith The members of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission have asked me to express their deep and sincere appreciation to yourself, Senator Alston, Mr Chaney, Mr Connolly and Mr Barron for meeting with us on Tuesday 5 October 1992. We also wish to acknowledge receipt of Senator Alston's letter in relation to this Commission's recently released document entitled 'Taxation and Food', we also note Dr Hewson's letter to all Australian Catholic Bishops and priests in Australia and Mr Chaney's Press Release and his letter to all Australian Catholic Bishops. The letter then goes on to say this, and this is the most important part of all: The members of this Commission wish to express their admiration'their admiration', noteThe second point-after we get past the reality that this afternoon's debate is a smokescreen to try to get around that-is the attempt by the Opposition to obfuscate the issue by suggesting that its policy is in some way the same as the proposal of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the early 1980s. That is what those opposite put up this afternoon; that has been their defence. There is a world of difference. Those opposite know that there is a world of difference, and the world should know that there is a world of difference. If we go back to 1985, what did we see? We saw a Labor Party, a government, listening and taking notice. Having a consensus view expressed, there was an opportunity for all concerned to have their six pennyworth, to meet, to talk, to say what they think and to have it taken on board. They had an opportunity to have all those views properly analysed and carefully considered by the Government. Finally, it was rejected. Why? It was rejected for a very good reason: after all that process had been gone through, there was no way that anyone could find a way of properly compensating people for the imposition of such a tax. That is exactly the point that the good priests and lay people in the Catholic Social Welfare Commission have been saying, the point that they have been making. The concern that they have today is the same as the concern expressed back in 1985. However, there is one big difference. It is a far cry from suggesting that the position of the Opposition in any way reflects the position of the gentleman, who is now the Prime Minister of Australia, back in 1985, because we listen and those opposite do not. We did not abuse. We walked away from the goods and services tax on food when we could not find a way of doing it to cover the interests of these people. After that, the Labor Party walked away from it completely. We did it without abusing Catholics or anyone else. We did it after careful consideration, the most careful analysis, and for the very best of reasons. The efforts of the Opposition this week in further abusing and adding to the insults of the honourable member for Pearce and Senator Alston, by having the honourable member for Pearce attack personally the bona fides of the good Bishop, are beneath contempt. Quite frankly, the Opposition should be walking away from them. They should be hanging their heads in shame, and then they should be apologising profusely. That is what they should be doing. I say to those opposite and to the House: there is no place for this sort of conduct in Australian public life. They can attack us all they like, but they should not attack wellmotivated people who are doing their best for the people they have a genuine concern for. Those opposite stand condemned in this place and around this country from their own words: the words of Senator Alston, the words of the honourable member for Pearce and the words that have been expressed in the House today. Those opposite even came into the House and intoned the St Vincent de Paul Society as something that we should look at. They might like to have a look at the front page of the Catholic Weekly this week, because St Vincent de Paul has rushed into print on this very issue. They are not just fighting the Catholic Social Welfare Commission. A front page article by Mr Cliff Baxter states that the Catholic Social Welfare Commission: . .. was supported by the New South Wales president of the St Vincent de Paul Society, Mr Robert Fitzgerald, who said: ""The Society in NSW has been concerned about the goods and services tax as it affects those in greatest need. ""We note with interest the comments of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission and would support in principle the exemption of food. ""Clearly, we don't support the taxation of essential food items. That is where the St Vincent de Paul Society is coming from. It goes along with every other concerned element in the community in expressing that view. If those opposite had any sense, they would listen and would walk away from it. In the meantime, they certainly ought to apologise for what is a very black day in Australian public life this week.",106
236,Mr CONNOLLY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Bradfield) (4.33 p.m.)The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) has just asked the Opposition to apologise for what he calls a black week in Australian politics. Let me say this to the honourable member and to all other members present: if there is any apology to be made, it is to be made to the Australian people. It should be made by this Prime Minister (Mr Keating), by his Ministers and by every single member of the Senate and the House of Representatives representing the Australian Labor Party. Never before in the history of this nation have over 1112 million people been forced into unemployment by the deliberate failure of policy of this Government. Never before in the history of this nation have so many people, their families and their children, seen their future destroyed before their eyes, a position completely brought about by a government that simply has failed utterly to regard its primary responsibility, which is the welfare of the Australian people. We have heard nothing at all here today in support of the Government's case. May I read, for the benefit of the House, what this motion in fact stated: That the Prime Minister be required to explain to this House how he has 'saved' Australia with policies which plunged the economy into the worse recession in 60 years, created 927,000 unemployed and 500,000 more not getting enough work. That is the subject before us today. We saw the Prime Minister come in here, in his usual mealy-mouthed, mew ling manner, complaining because the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his colleagues have had the guts to stand up and say, 'Enough is enough'. We have had the courage to say to the Australian people, 'We will look after your interests when this Government has plainly failed to do so'. We had the courage to go to the Catholic Social Welfare Commission the other daynot, as suggested by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith and by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), with the intention of being overbearing or with the intention of forcing our position upon them-simply to point out that if the Commission wishes to enter into a major area of political concern and debate, it is only fair that the basis of our analysis be seriously taken into account in the totality of its final report.

The message is: Food is a necessity for life and a tax on essential food is neither a good nor a just imposition on the Australian community. We had discussions two days ago and incidentally, for the benefit of members of the Government, these discussions did not take place in some room in this building. We went to the Catholic bishops themselves. We did not demand that they come to us; we went to them. That is hardly the action of people who are overbearing, domineering and determined to force their point of view upon others. At the end of our discussions it was agreed that the bishops would report bl!-ck to us on the basis of their claims, and they have now done so. I now want to take the opportunity to read into Hansard what the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission reported to us in a letter dated 8 October: Dear Mr Reith The members of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission have asked me to express their deep and sincere appreciation to yourself, Senator Alston, Mr Chaney, Mr Connolly and Mr Barron for meeting with us on Tuesday 5 October 1992. We also wish to acknowledge receipt of Senator Alston's letter in relation to this Commission's recently released document entitled 'Taxation and Food', we also note Dr Hewson's letter to all Australian Catholic Bishops and priests in Australia and Mr Chaney's Press Release and his letter to all Australian Catholic Bishops. The letter then goes on to say this, and this is the most important part of all: The members of this Commission wish to express their admiration'their admiration', noteof the stated commitment of the above delegation to the well being of all Australians, particularly those who are disadvantaged, distressed or devalued- In particular, the Commission appreciates the willingness of those present at our meeting to give witness, in their parliamentary roles, to Christian values about human dignity, the role of society as a protector of human dignity, the right of people to participate in society, the priority of distributive justice, the promotion of adequate access to resources for every person and the importance of human rights and responsibilities. It goes on to say: This goodwill was exemplified in your willingness to dialogue honestly and openly with the Executive Committee of our Commission so that we might redress any perceptions that ""the Church"" views members of the Coalition, and the policies of the Coalition Parties, as lacking morality. The Commission would like you to consider this letter as a public appreciation of ourrespect for your commitments to the well being of Australians. Note the silence that we now have from members of the Government! A few minutes ago they were so pompous, so determined and so self-righteous. Now they are hearing not from a mere, miserable politician but from the bishops themselves what they thought of our delegation, and they give us their views on what we had to say. The letter goes on: The opinions of this Commission do not pretend to represent the views of every member of the Catholic Church and are ""official"" only in so far the Commission is mandated as an official organ of the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference ... Furthermore, . . . we also would be in agreement with Fr James Sadawsky, who was quoted by Senator Alstonthe person who has been attacked so roundly by members of the Government here today""those who wish to solve the problems of poverty while ignoring the fundamental necessity to do so by increasing productivity will end by simply redistributing poverty and disadvantage"". That fundamentally is a difference between what the coalition parties stand for, in both their economic and social policies, and this gaggle of people over here. They have spent far too much time ruining Australia for the last decade and now, in a moment of absolute desperation, they cling on to the coat-tails of any bishop they can find in a desperate hope that the bishops will come to their aid when, quite clearly· from the letter I am now quoting, they can expect no comfort whatsoever from that source. They know, as we know, that the human indignity brought upon the Australian people in the last few years has been second to none since the worse days of the Great Depression. How any individual members of this Government can go back to their working class electorates and seriously ask the people for support-as their colleagues failed to get in Victoria only last week-is merely a demonstration of· how totally out of touch those opposite are with the fundamental realities, the difficulties and the horrors of sustained unemployment and the cost that that is having for the Australian people. Let me continue to quote this letter: Hence, it would be irresponsible of us not to consider those propositions that speak about appropriate compensation for those who may be most affected by a goods and services tax that applies to food and other essentials of life. I quote, especially: We were pleased, therefore, to receive further assurances from yourself and your colleagues regarding the extent and nature of these compensations. We also note that you were unable to guarantee that every person affected would receive adequate compensations. Unlike you, we have been utterly honest from day one. The letter goes on to say: as As Senator Alston pointed out in his letter to me, it is not good enough for us to intellectually or morally rail against the regressive nature of one element of a tax reform package without having regard to the total package proposed. We do recognise that the package was specifically designed to redress any inequity to the poor that may result from its implementation. Indeed, as stated at our meeting, the doubling of family allowances to those with incomes of less than $30,000 and a 50 per cent increase for those with incomes of up to $40,000 deserves support. We wish it to be publicly known that we support changes to our tax and welfare systems that will enhance the well being of the poor, particularly families. In one of the final paragraphs the letter says: Again I wish to thank you and your colleagues for your kindness and considerationnote, 'kindness and consideration'and we welcome ongoing discussions. This Commission also wishes to state publicly our appreciation of your conscientious efforts to reform the Australian tax and economic systems. That letter was written by Father David J. Cappo, National Director. If ever there were a time when I would say to the Prime Minister, to the Treasurer and to the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith that they should have the guts, the gumption and the courage to come into this House-and all three are notably no longer here-to apologise, not only to the Opposition but to the Australian people on two countsMr Chaney-And to the Catholic church.",108
237,Mr CONNOLLY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Pearce. It should apologise on three counts. Firstly, in a most grotesque and clearly political manner the Government has tried to use a Christian denomination to support its own evil ends. Secondly, it has set about deliberately to misinform the Australian people about the substance of our policy. Thirdly-and I emphasise this point againthe Government continues to be determined to ruin the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and, with the passage of time, the lives of another 100,000 to 140,000 schoolleavers early next year. We in the Opposition ask the Government, this motley crew:· what future does it have to offer those young people? The Government has been prepared to change its policy position in terms of the impact of taxation. The then Treasurer, the present Prime Minister, was interviewed by AAP on 13 June 1985-the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith chortled about his earlier expositions; it is interesting how something can be true in 1985 but somehow or other be a total contravention of reality and fact today, but I will come to that at a later point-and said: The best way of making these taxes operate effectively and efficiently is with minimum exemptions and with a single rate. That is a lesson which comes from all over the world. On 18 June in the same year he said in Launceston: Exempting food from the tax would cost almost $1,600,000. Of that amount only about $300m or 19 per cent would benefit the poorest 30 per cent of households, while about $67Om or 42 per cent would benefit the top 30 per cent of households. That is exactly what the Treasurer and members of the Opposition have been saying. We do not achieve equity in the tax system by making exceptions to one's taxation base; we achieve equity by making absolutely sure that those at the top end of town do not have an additional advantage, while at the same time we ensure-as the Opposition has done-that our compensation package makes certain that pensioners, low income people, and people with children especially, are fully compensated for the impact of the introduction of a GST. Anyway, the then Treasurer went on to say: Clearly, most of the benefit of exempting food from the tax would go to those who do not need such assistance. I repeat, 'those who do not need such assistance'. He knew the truth back in 1985. What has changed? I will tell honourable members what has changed: the ACTU put the steamroller over it. That is what has happened. Ever since then he has been running a race walking backwards: walking backwards against the reality of what this country needs; walking backwards against the wishes of the Australian people; walking backwards against the fundamental social and economic changes that this nation desperately needs. If we look at any set of statistics-they are all here to be looked at; they are all official statistics-we see that total investment as a percentage of gross domestic product is down; productivity in terms of the OECD average has been an absolute disgrace since 1987; private consumption investment shows an awful, growing gap between real private consumption and investment, demonstrating that we are now borrowing other people's money even to pay for welfare;. and unemployment rates compared with the OECD are another absolute disgrace, we are so far above the average of the OECD. That is the future that Australians have to inherit. (TIme expired)",110

239,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT," Order! If honourable members try to shout the Chair down, they will get the same response. If they treat the Chair with respect, they will get respect.  the Opposition's very best efforts with outrage, indignation, mock concern and all the rest of the emotions that we have seen exhibited this afternoon, the harsh fact for opposite is that this debate this afternoon well beyond just the GST. This debate is about their ability to govern. It is about the Opposition's supposed ability to govern a decent, caring, tolerant and, what is most relevant in this debate, pluralist society. is more, it is about leadership. ability of honourable members opposite to take and deal rationally with criticism. It is not about keeping hate lists-lists of supposed enemies-as the besieged Richard Nixon did in the 1970s. That is not leadership; that is not dealing rationally with criticism. This debate is about the ability and the of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to deal with his own frontbenchers, who have gone well beyond the pale-excessively so. My friend the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) has read to the House a number of quotes from the despicable pieces of correspondence from Senator Alston and the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) referred to earlier. They are cowardly pieces of paper-cowardly in the extreme. They are excessive words expressing excessive spleen and excessive behaviour on the part of a group of people which supposedly is an alternative government for this country. They are led by a man who, we must all remember, came into this place after the last election and said that he would promote new standards for this place. Some new standards! Those letters are not an attack on another politician in this place, as we give and take with the best in this place and the other. They are not an attack on a businessman who has an interest in profit for himself or for his shareholders. They are an attack on the Catholic Social Welfare Commissiori of this country, an attack on Catholic bishops in this country and an attack on a Catholic priest in this country. I want to say, because I am legitimately outraged, that it is so rough, so beyond the pale and so beyond the norm and the standards which are acceptable to ordinary Australians, that not even the Queensland National Party in its worse years ever dared to those do such a thing. I look at the honourable goes member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and know that he would be able to vouch for that too. Not even the Queensland National Party at the height of its arrogance in the 1970s and 1980s would have dared to do what Senator Alston What and the honourable member for Pearce have It is about the done on this occasion. I say to the House fairly and squarely that if the Leader of the Opposition really does exert leadership he must now demand unequivocally the resignations from the front bench of Senator Alston and the honourable member for Pearce. As my friend the guts honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has just said, they are guilty of the worse political thuggery. They must be unequivocally disavowed by the Leader of the Opposition himself. They must be seen to be belittled by him walking away from them. That sort of thuggery is simply not acceptable in any taxation or other debate in this country. That, I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), would be leadership-real leadership displayed by his colleague. The Leader of the Opposition is on trial in this debate. If he does not disavow Senator Alston and the honourable member for Pearce; if he does not sack them-as I suspect he has not got the guts to do because that is the. attitude that pervades his side of the House at the moment-I suspect that every Australian, whether Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Anglican, Jewish or Buddhist, will find great trouble in believing that the Leader of the Opposition has not either endorsed what they have said in those letters or, at the very worse, encouraged it. The Leader of the Opposition is on trial in regard to this issue; make no bones about it. I ask the Deputy Leader whether he is prepared to stand at the dispatch box and openly endorse what the honourable member for Pearce and Senator Alston have said, word for word, letter for letter. This debate arises out of what the purpose is of the Catholic Social Welfare Commission document. I will read to honourable members on the other side what the document's purpose is. It states: The purpose of this document is to alert the Australian community to the injustice of any regressive system of taxation on essential foods. The document goes on to say in another part: The arguments presented against a tax on essential food are not economic arguments. Instead, moral arguments are presented which are based on the sound and fundamental Catholic social principles of the common good, human solidarity, human dignity, preference for the poor and the common use of goods. That is the purpose. I invite honourable members opposite to look at page 2 of Senator Alston's despicable lettet. The last paragraph of his thug creation states: It is simply not good enough intellectually...,of course, it is a great intellect speakingSenator Alstonlet alone morally, to rail against the regressive nature of one element of tax reform-a GST. I repeat in Senator Alston's own words: ... let alone morally; to rail against the regressive nature of one element of tax reform-a GST. He admits to 'the regressive nature of the GST'. Then in the same letter he has the absolutely astonishing hide-more hide than a herd of bulls-to admonish the Catholic Commission's stated purpose in this document, which I have just read to the House. This line in Senator \ Alston's letter puts beyond any doubt-as I can judge by the silence now on the other \side of the House the moral right of the C!ltholic Commission to state its opinion in the terms that it has. The Liberals have once again unsuccessfully attempted to justify their own warped views on taxation this afternoon. There is an admission here in Senator Alston's letter that it is a regressive tax. The purpose for which this document from the Catholic Social Welfare Commission was written was to expose the purpose of a regressive tax. It is signed, sealed and delivered-the guilty party. If the Leader of the Opposition does not seek and accept resignations from Senator Alston and the honourable member for Pearce, it will be an exhibition of the worse political arrogance in living memory in this country. It will show that the Opposition Leader believes that his side of politics can attack without respect, without dignity and without restraint the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, Catholic bishops and a Catholic priest. That should be regarded by all of us in . this House and the other place as beyond the pale. If he does not seek and accept those resignations, he will quite rightly be pilloried from now on by everybody across this country for exhibiting arrogance worse than Nick Greiner could ever have shown. The Greiner Government was at least, in its own words, warm and dry. We have on offer here a supposed alternative Hewson government that is cold, unrestrained, disrespectful and arid of any human compassion. I want to raise one more issue, with the permission of my good colleague from. Tasmania, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). I for one would never accuse someone of religious discrimination without very good cause. I make the statement right at the start that I am not so doing now, but I have a very legitimate question and I want some answers. This is a debate in which a number of questions are now posed to the Opposition front bench. Bronwyn Pyke, of the Victorian synod of the Uniting Church, went on the 3LO midday news on 1 October this year as a spokesperson for the church. The presenter and the journalist introduced her as a spokesperson on justice and social responsibility. Bronwyn Pyke cited the coalition's proposed goods and services tax on basic food items as an example of the problems of the elevation of market forces. Pyke said: There are certain aspects of the GST that don't provide for the preservation of basic human rights and dignity for all people. Honourable members should check it out themselves. It was on 3LO midday news on 1 October. She is from the Uniting Church, not the Catholic Church. At the moment a number of Uniting Church discussion papers are circulating, one of which is A Christian Response to the Fightback Package, by Reverend Ann Wansbrough. She is from, I think, the New South Wales synod of the Uniting Church. Whilst I have only just received this, it is worth reading a couple of sentences: Instead, we must take seriously the concern that Fightback would result in a more regressive, ie a more unjust, tax system. In another pJace it says: Fightback has the effect of delegitimising taxation, by its emphasis on tax cuts without corresponding emphasis on the cuts in services which fund them. It goes on. I challenge honourable members on all sides of this House to read the Uniting Church's paper because I am sure that it, like the Catholic Church, has something very constructive to say. It is the place of the churches in this country to say constructive things, to be ahead of the debate and ensure that what the politicians are doing is subjected to review and, if necessary, criticism. That is the role that the churches in this country have taken on for themselves, and a very legitimate role it is, too. I pose a question to the Opposition here and now. Following Bronwyn Pyke's comments on 1 October 1992-and after the release of various discussion papers from the Uniting Church-did anyone from the Uniting Church receive the sort of vindictive correspondence that Senator Alston and the honourable member for Pearce' are guilty of creating? Was such correspondence sent to anybody from the Uniting Church? Were they treated with that disrespect? Were they described in these terms and subjected to this abuse? I want to know, and many more Australians will want to know. One response from the Opposition can surely be measured by the next, particularly when it is in similar terms to these comments we are talking about on an alternative taxation system. I notice that those opposite have once again gone quiet, perhaps because they are' not too sure of the answer to that last question. In conclusion I want to say this: as to whether they have pilloried the Uniting Church like they have pilloried these institutions of the Catholic Church, they are damned if they have and they are damned if they have not. Are they treating all people in Australia .the same, with the same disrespect, or have they managed to narrow down disrespect for only selective institutions in this country? Like Richard Nixon keeping his hate lists, these people too will come undone because of this. It is excessively poor form. It is beyond the pale and it is an absolute disgrace.",110
240,Mr SMITH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Yes, we are still going because the Opposition chose to have five speakers a side and we will keep going all night if the Government would like to so that we can make our points. For the people who are listening to this debate, we should reiterate exactly what is taking place here today. We are considering a motion to suspend Standing Orders to debate the matter that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) raised during Question Time, and also what he raised during the course of the week in two of the classic bloopers of all time politically: saying that the recession was over long ago and that he is the saviour of Australia. The classic rebuttal, of course, came home today when the unemployment statistics were released. We started Question Time today by looking at the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures and posing a series of questions to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). In the course of one of those answers the Treasurer made a classic mistake. He said that things are getting better. But, when one looks at the third or fourth paragraph from the Bureau of Statistics, it says that the trend estimate of the unemployment rate continues to increase and now stands at 11 per cent. We have moved to suspend Standing Orders for the following reason: That the Prime Minister be required to explain to this House - and the nationhow he has 'saved' Australia with policies that plunged the economy into the worse recession in 60 years, created 927,000 unemployed and 500,000 more not getting enough work. That is 500,000 underemployed in this country-nearly one million people unemployed. The reason we have suspended Standing Orders is so that we could hear from the Prime Minister why this country is in its current mess. In the course of parliament this week he said to us-not just to members on this side, but to the people of Australia, and many will be listening as they drive home tonight-that the recession was over long ago. I wonder how many of them believe that the recession was over long ago. How many of them remember the memorable words that this is the recession we 'had to have'? How many remember that, prior to that, he had to say, 'We are not in a recession. These are a beautiful set of numbers. The glass is effervescent and it bubbles along positively.'? We all know, objective observers know, and many on his own side know that the Prime Minister is clearly overstating his case. He is a desperate man in a desperate political position. Clearly, the Treasurer muffed his lines today in trying to dissemble the figures. The tragedy that exists behind these figures is the point I want to make this afternoon; the human tragedy that is behind these figures is the issue that he chooses to ignore. Before passing on to that, I have to make some comment about the contribution of the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch). In the short time that I have been a member, it has always worried me when I have heard politicians from the other side start to drag in religion. This afternoon we had a tirade from the honourable member for Barton. Perhaps he was a little impetuous in trying to grab the Catholic Church to his side of this debate. I warn him that I think that is very dangerous. There are many varied views within all the religious groups in this country about the best way forward for this nation. By doing what he did this afternoon I think he may have displayed some impetuous tendencies which, obviously, given that he was a Minister and is now on the back bench, have been the hallmark of his political career. I want to start this afternoon by quoting what the current Prime Minister said not long after he stabbed Bob Hawke and got rid of him. He wanted to make a pledge. There were three elements to the pledge he made to the Australian people. The first pledge was: 'I pledge to give everything I have got to the job and to the country'. We would expect nothing less from someone who aspires to lead this country. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) would make a similar pledge; we would expect nothing less. The second pledge, which I ask honourable members to listen to, was: 'I pledge to deal honestly with the people and to tell them the truth' . I often think that cartoonists are just that little in front of the community sentiment in this country. We have the classic cartoon of all time here. I do not often think it is necessary to hold cartoons up every time, but this one, linked to the pledge, tells the story. It is a classical example of a picture telling the story. If those opposite want to talk about truth and about Pinocchio, they know that their nose gets longer when they do not tell the truth. This is exactly what has happened; the Prime Minister has broken his own pledge. Members on this side of the House know it, as do the people in the community. The people driving home tonight know that they are paying too much' for petrol; they know that they are paying too much for a whole range of things. Many of them are not driving home from a job. Many of them are driving to homes where their wife may have lost her job or their son or daughter cannot get a job. They are the issues that people are thinking about. This classic pledge of the Prime Minister has been broken. The third pledge of the Prime Minister was: 'I pledge to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy I can muster'. The unemployment figures came out today. The trend is an 11 per cent increase in unemployment. It is not going to the opposite extreme, as he would have us believe; it is increasing. The pain is increasing. Who did we see rolled out this afternoon to defend the political ineptness of the' Prime Minister? Who did we see stand by him? We saw the lieutenants, the ones who marched the corridors on behalf of the Prime Minister so that they could be there and share in the spoils of victory. We saw the Treasurer, the honourable member for Fremantle, the member for an electorate that he never visits. Honourable members will remember he got the job over the man who probably should have got it, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). He is a loyal man. He sits there and does his job. The Treasurer was here this afternoon. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), one of the mates from New South Wales, then got to his feet, and we have just heard a speech from the honourable member for Barton. We saw the mates. We are going to have a concluding speech from someone who is not necessarily one of the mates, but I assume it will be the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). Mr Bruce Scott-He cannot be ignored.",113
241,Mr SMITH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"He cannot be ignored. Custom has been changed a little this afternoon. We have gone to five speakers so that the Leader of the House can have a chance to speak. But the mates went first. Do not forget that, in the tribal warfare that is carried on within the ALP, the mates get precedence. That is what this Government is all about. It is not about understanding the pain that. is taking place in Australia; it is about looking after its own. It is not about looking after the nation. I say to the Prime Minister that he has transgressed that fundamental, basic issue in his pledge: to tell the truth. The Leader of Opposition is telling the truth to Australia. has got a plan. It has got its pain and it has got its difficulties, but it is there, and it is He said: going to fix the issues we know have to be addressed. There was some irony in Question Time today. I have to say that I am delighted to be able to speak. Honourable members might have heard the Leader of the Opposition quote from a speech the Prime Minister made to the King's Meadows Jaycees in the city of Launceston, the heart of the electorate of Bass. I was only a freshman member of the chamber in 1985, but I remember when the Prime Minister came to my electorate and gave this major speech in Launceston about the need for tax reform, the need for a GST. I remember standing on the comer after the lunch at the Albert Hall and seeing all the good burghers of Launceston, the businessmen of Launceston, the people from the churches of Launceston, coming back. The editorial in the Launceston Examiner said how this man had a vision for Australia. He was going to change it, he was going to fix it because we all knew the tax system needed to be changed. What happened? Mr Rocher-He ratted on them.",115
242,Mr SMITH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"He ratted on them. The honourable member for Curtin is so right. He got dudded, remember",115
243,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,The honourable member for Curtin might not interject out of his place.,115
244,Mr SMITH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"late one night in a motel here in Canberra during the Tax Summit. So we missed the opportunity to have true and lasting tax reform in this country. Let us remember what the Prime Minister said in that famous speech. He said: For all these reasonsthat is, a whole range of reasons; this was the issue that caused this motion this afternoonthe Govemmentthat is, the Government of Mr KEATING is strongly opposed to exempting food from the tax. Indeed, I would not contemplate introducing a retail tax which included exemptions of items in the supermarket basket. the It might have been an aberration, but he went He south the next day to Hobart and again he repeated it and said exactly the same thing. Indeed, I would not contemplate introducing a retail tax which included exemptions of items in the supermarket basket. .. I'm not cutting it off, I'm killing it stone dead ... killing it stone dead. It's not a matter of cutting off an avenue for a day, I'm killing it stone dead. What happened to truth and honesty-the pledge that he made recently? The Prime Minister was caught out this afternoon, and people· should have seen the ashen faces of those sitting behind him. They knew that this day had to come where he would be caught by his own rhetoric, his own approach to politics, which is to win at any cost and hope people forget what he has said. The people of Bass have not forgotten, the people of Australia have not forgotten, and we certainly have not forgotten. We are going to remind you every day until you decide to give the people of this country a chance to make a determination about the path they want to try for the future of this country. One of the points that I made as' I commenced was about the pain of this recession and how it has been visited on families. There were excellent examples given in speeches by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly); the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith); the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer); and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), dismissing the outrageous report of the Treasurer who, when he came back from England, said that he saw people sleeping outside our High Commission in London. But he neglected to understand what is taking place in his own backyard. There was a whole series of material developed and put down in the House today about the Wesley Mission estimate that there are in the vicinity of 10,000 children sleeping on Sydney streets alone overnight. Those issues have been ignored by the Government. But in no sense am I accusing the Government of being the catalyst. I quote from an editorial of the 7 October edition of the Launceston Examiner. It is called, 'Suicide-the last taboo'. Anyone who has ever been involved closely with that sort of event would know that it can be. very painful. I quote from the editorial: The recession in Australia has had a big impact on young people. Career choices have shrunk, even for those with skills. A university degree, a trade or other tertiary qualifications are no longer a tee of work. Even in the professions of law and medicine, employment opportunities are shrinking fast. The best long term community response to the problem is to rebuild economic hope and confidence. The Opposition is about rebuilding economic hope and confidence, but that cannot be done uriless we make an honest assessment of what the problems are. That is all we ask of the Prime Minister. We ask him to make an honest assessment and to tell the truth to the Australian people about the difficulties that we face. We do not ask any more than that. He cannot be asked to do any more than that. Once we have an honest assessment, then let us plan how to address those problems. What we are seeing is an obfuscation of the facts. We are not seeing people coming to grips with the reality of the problems that we face as a nation. During this week, the Prime Minister said that the recession we had to have was long over. That statement was met with a response from the cartoonists, and was met with incredulity by people from outside this House and by broader commentators. It has been described as a political blooper made by the Prime Minister. But it is more than that. It indicates a state of mind of the man who is leading this country. He chooses to ignore the pain which has been inflicted on familiesthe pain that needs to be ameliorated as quickly as possible. With all. the constraints that are upon governments of whatever colour, we must address this problem. The starting point has to be an honesty in dealing with this. We have to recognise the pain that has been visited upon people. We have to recognise that youth suicides are increasing. We have to recognise that crime is increasing. It is not all the Government's fault.",115
245,Mr MELHAM,UNEMPLOYMENT,"And the GST will fix it, will it?",116
246,Mr SMITH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The honourable member for Banks should listen. We have to realise that, unless we haV'e an honest assessment of the problems. that we have as a nation-and address them honestly, openly, and transparently in front of the community-we guaranwill never solve them and we will never stop this country from getting on to that slippery slide to economic oblivion, which carries with. it a social cost that none of us here ought to ever contemplate as being acceptable.",116
247,Mr BEAZLEY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Swan-Minister for Employment, Education and Training)(5.18 p.m.)-The problem for the Opposition in dealing with this motion that)t has moved, and the criticism that it implies of the Government-and also the amendment that the Government has moved-is that the ch!lnging nature of the Australian economy at the moment does not suit it electorally. As time goes by, it suits the Opposition less and less. As that. situation obtains and focus comes on to its policies, it has to deal with the fact-and it knows this-,-that what it is proposing, far from being an honest solution, is not even a sensible solution. What it must do, in order to be able to put its policies through, is to take the economy back into recession and to take the economy back into a position in which people are going to be thrown out of work. In so far as there has been any honesty in the portrayal by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) of the policies that he puts forward-and there has not been a great deal-we have heard him make these statements: I am not making any promises about the level of unemployment. There will be transition effects. Transition can involve some increase in unemployment or, at least, dislocaticlfl - people move from one job to another. Then we have heard the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), saying: I do not pretend that overnight you can reduce unemployment and I have said all along that of itself a change of Government is not automatically going to bring unemployment down. The problem for the Opposition is that its policies will increase unemployment. It knows those policies will increase unemployment. It hoped that the recession would continue, that there would be no growth in the economy, but that if there were growth it would not start to take up .the slack in the labo'ftr market and allow unemployment to begin to recede. That is what it hoped. It is now beginning to comprehend that that is not so, that that is not· going to happen, and that we have had growth over the last 12 months. We have had a 1.6 per. cent growth; That is not enough to deal with those young people and others coming into the labour market, particularly not given the enormous encouragement to employment that there has been in the country with that absolute surge in opportunities that has occurred in the last decade. That is not enough to pick up those new people, but it is trending in the right direction. Those opposite are asking themselves the question: what if we confront that situation at the time when the next poll comes? It is obvious to the public, as it has been obvious to those who have assessed our economy, that the recession has ended. It has become obvious to the public in the area that concerns it most; that is, of course, the area of unemployment. What will the public say to an Opposition whose policies would manifestly increase unemployment? Regardless of whatever outcome the Opposition thinks might occur in the long term-and we can argue about that there is a unanimous view, not only on this side of the House but on its side as well, that its policies, at least in the short term, will create more unemployment. If the Opposition's industrial relations policy were to be put in place-we argue that it would come into effect - utomatically with the Opposition's goods and services tax, tariff proposals and the like-what impact would it have' on the electronics industry in South AuStralia and New South Wales if, for example, Telecom were privatised and if its obligation to buy domestically were removed? We would argue about all these sorts of issues. The Opposition has a positive desire and a concern that there should be a level of fear in the labour market, otherwise there is no prospect whatsoever of the industrial relations policies that it' pursues being put into effect. The problem for us on this side of the House in dealing with these issues politically-and this has been of advantage to the Opposition-to this point in time has been the perception that there is no growth in the Australian economy and that, as the economy develops, there will be' no prospects for employment. As that perception recedes, the Opposition must handle the consequences of . its economic policies. Many of those opposite know that they cannot do that, and they know that they will be left exposed like a shag on a rock in the political arguments as they proceed next year on the question of who has the best propositions for a resolution of the economic problems of this nation. The concerns that the Opposition has expressed about the problems and difficulties being experienced by the poor and the unemployed are compromised essentially by two positions: firstly, that it is the Opposition's intention that that is exactly where they should remain for other purposes; and secondly, because in keeping them there, it also has propositions for them in terms of the support and the opportunities that it would give them to re-skill. It intends to massively reduce those opportunities. If it cannot massively reduce those opportunities, it cannot introduce its income tax changes. It knows that. It knows that, unless it can massively cut unemployment benefits and our labour market programs, it does not have the resources in its package to provide income tax cuts. It would have the horror of all horrors, a goods and services tax, and no income tax cuts. It knows that. It knows very well that nonnal, decent human beings-and there are some honourable members on the other side of the House who are incorporated in that category-cannot stand by in a situation where unemployed people are told, 'We simply do not care. We will not give you labour market programs that will give you a re-skilling opportunity'. Decent human beings will not stand by when an unemployed person is told, 'If you have become adjusted out of the work force because there is structural change in the work force, we do not care about the fact that you have skilled yourself for the last 20 years to a particular job which is no longer needed. We are simply going to cut you off'. Nor is it acceptable for them to be told, 'If you are supporting a family, we will simply remove you from unemployment benefits because we need a $750m saving in that area to bring in those tax cuts'. Honourable members opposite fear that those who have some element of decency among them will say, 'No, you can't do those cuts, and in those circumstances you cannot do income tax cuts'. The Opposition is becoming more and more hoist on the dilemma of the extraordinary contradictions of its own policy. It is arguing a moral perspective on what it thinks are the failings of this Government, knowing that what it proposes is manifestly more harmful for both the people who are unemployed now and the people who are yet to be unemployed if the Opposition's policies are put in place. If the Opposition gets that opportunity, it will understand what is meant by dishonesty in politics. Those opposite have been parading what they regard as their honesty. Dishonesty in politics is telling people that one intends deliver something and that it will have various consequences, in the full knowledge that it will not have those consequences but, in fact, the adverse consequences one argued against in the first place. The growing realisation amongst those opposite that this is their position and their political difficulty is also now manifest in the way in which they treat other people. It is not because those opposite are natural Nazis that they wander around the place waving lists of people whom they will condemn. Because they fear the consequences of an understanding of their policies becoming more general in the community and the desperate effects of that on a party which has been out of office for 10 years, they feel that, above all else, they must heap calumny and intimidate people to deter them from saying the things that are obviously sensible and logical. This can be seen in Senator Alston's letter. I do not know Senator Alston well enough to know whether he is a natural Nazi, but I do know the English language well enough to know that the sorts of phrases that he has used in this letter are extremely intimidatory. Whether or not they are taken by the Catholic social justice people to be as intimidatory as he means them to be is neither here nor there. I take offence not so much at the tone of his letter as at the sheer stupidity of some of his arguments. He says: Christians who propose schemes for poverty relief have a commensurate duty to know the laws of economics and to do their homework. What laws of economics oblige the Opposition to introduce a goods and services tax? What laws of economics oblige the Opposition to put a 15 per cent tax on food? What a load of nonsense that there are some economic laws per se in behavioural science, which one would have thought were a little difficult to sustain philosophically, which say that across the world there must be a 15 per cent consumption tax on food, that it must be levied on all goods at an equal level, that the level must be 15 per cent and not some other and that there can be no exemptions because that would cause the thing to be fatally flawed. In one sense, what is the difference, when it comes down to exemptions, between to essentials of life such as food and clothing and essentials of life such as medicine and education? What is the difference in the end? There are exemptions in the one area, which the Opposition says it cannot open up exemptions for, and not in the other. Senator Alston lectures the Catholic bishops on the fact that there are economic laws which mean that there can be exemptions for education and health but not for food. Are they all supposed to bow down and worship the economic law from Senator Alston on that particular subject-that we have exemptions for education and health but not for food? It is the sheer illogicality and nonsense that causes offence as much as.the vituperativeness of the position of the Opposition in this area. The bishops might well write to those opposite and say that they think that they are decent and moral men. The bishops live, as bishops and all Christians must live, in neverending hope for the salvation of the human soul and the essential perfectibility of human beings and the belief that, if they are not capable of being perfected, at least they have a saviour to deal with that problem in the afterlife. That is what Christians and all who have that view must live with. They must approach members of the Opposition with the same set of assumptions that they might have about anyone on this side of the House or anyone else in the community. They have the view that there is hope for the Opposition yet. That is their view. Good luck to them. It is a terrific thing that they do feel that way about life and the situation in which those opposite all find themselves on this matter. But we do not have to have quite the same view about the Opposition and what its intentions are. As far as the Australian economy is concerned, there are two things that can be noted. The first is the enormous increase in our international competitiveness over the last decade. This is undeniable. There has been an enormous increase in our international competitiveness. We do not increase the proportion of our GDP being obtained through exports from 14 per cent to 23 per cent without an improvement in our competitiveness. We do not produce the sorts of figures that are now being produced on the waterfront and through enterprise bargaining without improving our competitiveness.

There are many matters to come before the House, including a matter involving Vietnam which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Me Humphreys) will speak about, which are important to the Australian community.

259,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,PAIRS,"I say to honourable members opposite that clearly the circumstances are that a proposition was put before the House this afternoon by the Opposition which they are now seeking to cut off. One can understand that because they have been running out of steam this afternoon. As the debate has gone on they have lost momentum. We were more than happy to accommodate them. Given that they had disrupted the procedures of the House, we were more than happy to accommodate them by having further speakers. What we have just seen is a 15-minute diversion because they did not want to get onto the content of the debate. That does not trouble the Government because we are happy to get onto the content of the debate. The basic propqsition before this Parliament and the Australian people is this: which view of the world do they accept? The view of the world that the Government is putting very clearly is that the country can have an economic policy that addresses the question of economic growth well and that also deals properly with people's social needs and social rights. At the moment, the Opposition is very worried largely because it is not finding the chorus of support it thought it would get. It has been pointed out in this debate this afternoon, and in Question Time, that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is now in the difficult situation of having people, and organisations such as the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, critical of the policies of the Opposition. The thing that has to be explained to people in the Australian community is that, despite all the talk about where it is going to go, at the end what the Opposition has to sell to the Australian community is the 15 per cent goods and services tax and an industrial relations policy that is not saleable in a genlline sense. I draw to the attention of the House, and those who are listening to this debate, the fact that it was one of my jobs to look at industrial relations in workplaces. One of the things I encountered in a very large manufacturing operation was the question of sexual exploitation in the. workplace. The point I want to make is very clear. Mr Costello interjecting",121
260,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Higgins will cease interjecting.,121
261,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Higgins cannot hide behind the Dollar Sweets experience and expect to get out of this. He has to face up to the fact-I say this to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as well, and it needs to be recorded-that in this particular workplace there was substantial sexual exploitation. I am not talking about something frivolous. I am talking about something substantial. If a woman wished to get a job there or work overtime-there were some 59 different nationalities there-she needed to perfonn favours for the foreman. This had been going on and, when it was draw to the attention of management and the union, the matter was addressed. The matter was addressed because there was a union in the place and there was an award in place. The honourable member for Bennelong has to face the fact that out there in the Australian work force there are people who are totally powerless in the industrial relations arena. The Opposition has to understand that it is them, their wives and their children that will be facing that situation if its industrial relations policy comes into play. People do understand that. As this election campaign goes on, they are going to see more of what happened just now. We will be at the ball first, as we were just now. The reason for that is that people understand that substantially the Opposition's policy removes any attempt. to redress an imbalance ,of power in the workplace. That has clearly been one of the roles that unions perfonn. It is all very well to come in this placeand I hear a lot of this-and criticise the peak trade union bodies. But in the actual workplace-and the Australian community would be facing this-unemployed young people, men and women, would be forced to try to bargain for their own work rates with employers who have many people in the queue. I saw a workplace the other day where all the examples that we can point to about sweated labour were present. If there was not a trade union to intervene-honourable members would certainly see it in their electorate offices-these people would have no way of seeking justice or redress in the workplace. All the way to the election, the Government is going to be pursuing the Opposition because people know that the end point of its industrial relations policy is to remove those protections from workers in the workplace. In the case to which I referred, had there not been a trade union and access to awards, we could not have redressed the matter. I will continue the story briefly. When I asked many of the women why they worked there, they told me they were doing so to get their family to school. I am talking about regular schools in the Sydney area. Women were prepared to work for 10 or 12 years while their children were at school. They were not prepared to squeal because they needed the money. In such circumstances, where women were prepared to say they needed the money and were not going to complain about their conditions of work, the opportunity is ripe for exploitation. I can tell the Opposition that in this situation exploitation of every kind was present. Had there not been a mechanism of a trade union and an award to refer back to, that exploitation would have continued. It is all very well to get up in this place and talk about workplace bargaining and workplace refonn, but at the end of the line in many of those places around Australia where the characteristic is high levels of migrant labour with unskilled manual work in which women play a predominant role, the capacity for exploitation is present. What the Australian work force and the Australian community will come to understand is that that is one of the products of the Opposition's policy that it will have to try to sell. Let me move to another issue-that is, the economy generally. One of the things the Opposition has talked about today is unemployment. One of the things the Government has to say to the Opposition is that the unemployment position, particularly in my home State of Western Australia, is improving. As a result of One Nation there are projects coming on stream in which people are getting jobs. What really irritates me and irritates other people in the Australian community is the number of times that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) have disparaged the Australian economy and talked it down, when there are many people out there trying very hard to succeed in the Australian economy. The Opposition does no service whatsoever to people in the Australian work force by talking down the Australian economy, because there are people out there who are proud of the perfonnance they are putting in. As the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said earlier, we now have a situation where exports constitute 23 per cent of GDP. That improvement has not been achieved by some magic wand. It has been achieved by hard effort and by the restructuring of this Australian economy. No matter what happens when honourable members go out and talk in the Australian community, that is the substantive position. No-one pretends in this place that the picture is altogether the way we would want it. The level of unemployment has been unacceptably high. What we have to aim for is improvements in economic growth that will bring down unemployment. That has been happening. As a consequence of that we are finding that people in Australia are at facing the future with some confidence. There is another very important issue to be addressed. The Opposition also carries on about the One Nation statement and its commitment to infrastructure. I paint to the House a picture which is very telling about what happens on the world scene. This is the sort of picture that the Opposition must come to understand. With the Channel tunnel that is being built there are two different ideologies on different sides of the tunnel. There is the English view that said it was a matter for the private sector and, as a consequence, money would not be put into infrastructure. As a consequence of that, business is locating on the French side of the tunnel. The reason is that the infrastructure is better. A major component of the One Nation statement was expenditure on infrastructure. If those opposite who seem to have trouble with this issue read the Economist of 12 September, they would find that it addresses very squarely the issue of the importance of infrastructure spending on making an economy competitive and efficient. If we do not have proper infrastructure spending and we do not have a commitment to improving infrastructure we will not get those sought after improvements in economic activity. This Government, in the One Nation statement and subsequent to that, has been committing resources to infrastructure. I point out to those opposite a contrast which they can see. It is very important to talk about what is happening on both sides of the Channel. On one side there is a commitment to infrastructure, with the TGV from Calais to Paris. Industry will clearly locate there because that is where it will get the benefits of good infrastructure spending. If we take up the Opposition's policy, which is to opt out of a sensible role for government, we will get what is happening on the other side of the Channel: a reduction in economic activity. No benefit will be generated for the people of England. That is really a good contrast in terms of attitudes. But let us not conclude there; let us move on to the question of the treatment of least people. One of the issues which concerns us is that the Opposition would knock people off unemployment benefits after nine months. It is not good enough for those opposite to come in here and talk about their concern for the unemployed when in fact they would remove people's right to benefits. People understand that, and they understand that if they also have to pay a 15 per cent goods and services tax on their household essentials that is clearly a recipe for social inequality. Those opposite also disparage the employment, education and training programs which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, is responsible for. I will give them a good example of a partnership at present. It is one which I spoke about recently. It involves the work being done by BP and the Federal Government through Skillshare in retraining middle-aged people and getting them back into the work force. It is an excellent program. We are seeing people who had previously been out of the work force back at work in service stations. Yet those opposite are committed to removing these important training programs to try to restructure the work force. One of the issues the Opposition has to address is how it can go down this path. It will cut expenditure by $150m. The duality of those opposite worries me. They get up on the public platform and say how concerned they are about the unemployed and the needs of people, yet they would come in here and bring down policies which would act against the people in terms of removing them from the unemployment benefit lists and certainly removing training programs. The training program I evince is the one talked about where BP and the Federal Government are in partnership retraining middle-aged people to get them back into the work force. And it is working. I have talked to people participating in the program and I have talked to people in the workplace. Those opposite have to understand that these are the sorts of programs that have to be faced up to these days. To talk about cutting money away from them is to not address the real needs of the community, and the people understand that. The Opposition's recipe is not a recipe for improving the social mix in Australia; it is in fact a recipe for social disaster. Those opposite well understand that and they have to square it up. We are finding that that is the case in Britain and the United States. People are discovering as a result of the US Presidential campaign that the failure to have a proper medical program in the United States has left people out of medical insurance and is a major issue in that country. More than 30 million people have no medical cover whatsoever. In a specific case in my electorate, a family Crawford, M. C. had to send their young baby to Melbourne and back for treatment. Medicare picked up the entire cost. That would not happen under a coalition Government, because it would cut back Medicare. Those opposite have to understand that their policies will be rejected.

278,Mr HUMPHREYS,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"I move: That this House congratulates all those connected with the planning, fundraising, design and successful unveiling in Canberra on 3 October 1992 of a memorial to those Australians who served, suffered and died during the Vietnam War. Members of this House will be aware that last weekend a memorial to those who served, suffered and died in the Vietnam War was dedicated in Canberra. The overwhelming majority of participants and commentators judged the dedication, the march past and the many other activities of the October long weekend an outstanding success. I would certainly endorse that conclusion from my perspective as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Much has been written about the emotional significance of the unveiling, about its therapeutic value, and about. its particular significance for the families and friends who lost a loved one during the war. I do not intend to cover that ground again today, for there are amongst our number several Vietnam veterans who are perhaps better placed than me to do so. Rather, I should like to take this opportunity to place on record my sincere appreciation and, I should think, the appreciation of all members, to the very many people who contributed so significantly to the success of this project. In doing so, I will single out a few-and in so doing, undoubtedly miss some, and for that I apologise. Members might recall that in 1988, when I brought down the Government's response to the Evatt Royal Commission report, I indicated that we would support, and contribute towards the cost of the construction of a memorial subject to approval being received from the Canberra National Memorials Committee. It is now history that that approval was given, a site allocated, and a memorial built. For an event of this magnitude to be pulled off successfully, a number of requirements must be met. Those driving it must have vision, they must have courage, and they must have a capacity for hard work. They must have the support and trust of their peers, of all levels of government, and of the community as a whole. These qualities were exemplified in the small group of veterans who had worked as the Australian Vietnam forces 'Welcome Home 87' Pty Ltd to stage the welcome home parade in Sydney in . October 1987. At the completion of that task, .the organisers would have been justified in putting their feet up and congratulating themselves on a job well done. But not .this group. Its members decided that they had the organisational skills, the contacts and the record of success to keep going and build on the very positive outcomes of the march by proceeding with the construction of a memorial. The Welcome Home Committee was re-formed as the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial Committee. With the backing of the Returned Services League and the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, and with the full support of the Government, it began the enormous task of having a memorial constructed and ready for dedication in October 1992, five years after the welcome home parade. Without giving chapter and verse, let me just relate the stated aims and objectives of the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial Committee. It set as its goal: direct involvement in the financing, design contest, assessment, construction and unveiling of the national memorial on ANZAC Parade, Canberra. It nominated as its objectives: raising $1.2m by August 1991; participating in the Australian Government design· competition and assessment panel; securing the site on ANZAC Parade next to the Light Horse Memorial; preparing a concept for the national memorial; receiving the endorsement and support of the Federal and State governments; and unveiling the memorial on 3 October 1992. It sounds easy when you read it quickly, does it not? But these are major undertakings and every one of these objectives was met. The Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial Committee has understandably experienced changes of membership over the course of the past five years. Remember that these people were volunteers, working part time, with careers and family lives to balance. But a solid core of members remained to the end, and it is to those people that I first wish to address my thanks. I thought it entirely appropriate that, following the unveiling of the memorial, the march past was led jointly by the patron and the Chairman of the Memorial Committee, Major General 'Sandy'  Sandy Pearson provided solidity and frequent wise counsel to his younger 'troops', and to my mind was a settling influence during the proven Committee's many difficult times. Peter Poulton, as Chairman, drove his Committee hard, leading by example. He negotiated a path through most obstacles which were placed in his way-and when that did not work, he crashed through. Whether it was his background as a New South Wales policeman, or his army experience or some other factor, it is hard for me to say, but he pursued his dream in a tough and thoroughly tenacious way, and through it all lost few friends and gained literally thousands. I have come to regard him as a special person, a special . veteran and a good friend. Charles Wright, Peter's deputy, did an enormous amount of work behind the scenes, especially with the Federal, State and Territory governments. His generosity extended to the provision of accommodation for many Committee members who worked in Canberra for the .three months leading up to the dedication. I should also like to make special mention of several other Committee members who were in the thick of things right up to the end: Colleen Thurgar, Jack Thurgar, Carey MCQuillan, Jack Mitchell, Tom Samways and Douglas Barnes. Their roles were indispensable. The Committee was supported by scores of people performing a wide range of tasks-too many to name individually. But I am sure that the Committee would want me to make special mention of the years of secretarial assistance provided by Betty Howe and Hala Nasar, and the work done by John Vautin, Adrian Barnes and Hugh Jordan. The Australian Defence Force has been enthusiastic, generous and entirely professional in the support it has given to the recent major commemorative program which started with the seventy-fifth anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli and which has gone on to mark many significant fiftieth anniversaries of World War II. Its contribution to the success of the Vietnam Memorial unveiling cannot be overstated. May I extend my thanks to the Chief of the Defence Force, to the chiefs of the three Services and to all those in the forces who assisted and participated in the events of the weekend. May I make special reference to the work of Major Ray Curtis and Warrant Officer Kevin Noon who did much of the detailed planing for the unveiling and march past. It was a triumph. Without taking up too much more time, might I mention a few other groups which deserve the commendation of this House. We should not lose sight of the fact that the memorial was paid for by donations. The Federal, State and Territory governments contributed about one-third of the cost. The rest came from corporate sponsorship and individual donations. Thanks to each and every contributor. I want to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his strong backing, and my ministerial colleagues who have assisted in this project. The Australian Capital Territory Government has been firmly behind the Committee in its work, and the ACT Tourism Commission, the ambulance service, ACTION buses and other local services all contributed significantly to the event. The people of Canberra showed enormous generosity and deservedly earned the gratitude of visiting veterans and their families. The Australian Federal Police were terrific. I know that there may have been some apprehension about the influx of 30,000 Vietnam veterans into Canberra, but the Australian Federal Police approached the weekend positively, the veterans were extremely well behaved and the result was that policing was effective but unobtrusive. The media, for the most part, were also very positive in their approach to reporting on the lead-up to the dedication and the events of the weekend. The ABC is to be particularly congratulated for its national coverage of the key elements of the weekend. I would also  the Australian, and of the Weekend Australian of the weekend just past. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the work done by a small team in my Department, especially in respect of arranging travel for a considerable number of next of kin, and for the provision of a wild-and I say 'wild' - array of administrative and logistical support. To them. I say many thanks. I am grateful to honourable members for their indulgence in letting me move this motion and in so doing enabling me to mention just a few of those who helped to make the unveiling of the Vietnam veterans memorial an event of truly national significance, and an event in which all Australians can take great pride.",131
279,Mr TIM FISCHER,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"I rise to support the motion moved by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). It is one of those special occasions when there will be unanimous support from both sides of the House of Representatives, and a similar motion in the Senate will also be so supported, as an appropriate I recognition of the unveiling and dedication of the Vietnam war memorial. In particular, I will be joined on this side by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) and the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) who, with me, I understand are the only Vietnam veterans serving in the Parliament at this time, but there will be participation reflecting the bipartisan dimension of the Welcome Home parade in 1987 and of the activities of the last weekend here in Canberra. The second thing I would like to say is that perhaps the most magnificent moments in the weekend of many memories-many sad memories, many other memories and some happy memories-were when I attended on two occasions reunions of my own battalion, the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, at the Lithuanian Club. But the most magnificent and spinechilling moment in many ways was a moment that I think meant so much to all of us who were there at this particular part of the weekend. was just after the magnificent dawn service, in front of the Australian War Memorial at the top of ANZAC Parade, looking down ANZAC Parade. We could just see a slight sign of the Vietnam memorial down on the right-hand side and the other memorials on the right-and left-hand sides across the lake to the old Parliament House and beyond that to the new Parliament House in the early dawn glow of last Saturday. Just as the dawn service came to an end there was that slight hum in the distance which always used to cause all of us who served in Vietnam to take note immediately, to be alert and to relate to the circumstances arising. It was none other than the Iroquois helicopter, in this case a sole Iroquois helicopter. The particular beat of its rotor chopper blade is such a distinctive beat that, no matter how long I live on this planet Earth, whenever I hear it I will always think immediately of Vietnam and distinguish this helicopter beat from any other type of helicopter beat. In many ways the beat of the chopper blade of the Iroquois helicopter was the signature tune of Vietnam, and it was a very moving moment for me and my colleagues as that sole helicopter swept over this new Parliament House building, over the old Parliament House, across the lake, up ANZAC Parade and across the 10,000 people who were standing in front of the war memorial at the end of the dawn service-including the Minister for Veterans' Affairs-and across and out to Fairbairn. I have to say that that was part of the commencement of all the procedures on the Saturday which of course included. the unveiling and dedication of the Vietnam war memorial. I must say that that memorial is understated brilliance in terms of the design. It is every bit as good and distinguished as the much quoted, much vaunted and equally superb Vietnam memorial in Washington, which some of us have had the privilege to see. It is different from the Vietnam memorial in Washington. It is distinctive and it is dignified in its whole approach to honouring the memory of those Australians who served in Vietnam but who made the supreme It sacrifice in terms of that service, and the Australian commitment to the Vietnam war. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and others spoke at the unveiling and I particularly draw attention to some of the comments from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition when he said: Today we can acknowledge, as a nation, the debt we owe Australia's Vietnam Veterans, and particularly the debt we owe to their colleagues who never returned or who have died since. And we do so with respect, with pride, with affection and with gratitude. To our Vietnam Veterans, so many of them here in Canberra today, I want to say in a simple and a heartfelt way that Australians are proud of, and thank you for, the service you gave and for the courage you showed in Vietnam. You served your country with professionalism and with honour in a war that was fought in an unfamiliar and treacherous environment and that made great demands on your minds as well as on your bodies. The heroic battles that you fought at places like Long Tan, Binh Ba and Coral/Balmoral are now forever part of Australia's proud ANZAC tradition. The events of last weekend have furthered the healing process associated with the Vietnam war. There are perhaps three events that have done much to contribute to the progress along that path. The first event was the very successful 1987 welcome home parade which of course also involved Peter Poulton and many others in the RSL and elsewhere. It was held in Sydney on a magnificent day and it really commenced the process. The second event was in many ways the Gulf war which showed that, sadly, many years after World War II occasions will still arise when democratic governments will feel the need to come to democratic parliaments and commit soldiers, sailors and airmen to conflict and to war, as was the case with the Gulf war. So, in its own indirect way, it helped the healing process associated with the Vietnam war because there were other elements that ran an agenda along the lines that once World War II was over never again would a democratic government want to commit forces to a conflict. Yet the Gulf war was another case where, sadly, that was necessary. The final event was the unveiling of the memorial, which went so well last Saturday. We then joined with the Minister in saluting those who helped to bring it about, particularly Peter Poulton, Charles Wright, Sandy Pearson and his Committee, elements of the RSL and everyone associated with the construction, approval and completion of the project and with the arrangements relating to the weekend. In that context, it has been noted-and I admit it-that I have often been critical of the cocoon of Canberra. But on this occasion I say loudly and clearly that I salute the people of Canberra for the magnificent response they gave on Saturday-the large number of civilians who turned up at the dawn service at 5 a.m.; the thousands of Canberrans who turned up along ANZAC Parade for the dedication, the march and parade; the Canberrans who provided the general assistance, whether it was university students mopping out rooms and providing extra billets for those who came to stay here, the many hotels and motels that went to special effort, including the good quality accommodation provided by so many hotels and motels such as the Canberra International Hotel, or the armed forces themselves and the many individual families who provided the billeting for the veterans. I salute Canberra for its response and the help that it provided during the dedication of the Vietnam memorial. Finally, I salute those in my unit and all units who served in Vietnam with the Navy, the Army and the Air Force and who made the supreme sacrifice. It was never going to be an easy task. The burden arising has now-to the extent that it can ever be-been eased that fraction more by the events of last weekend. It was a particular privilege to return alive to march again last Saturday with the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, to mingle with all the units that were present and to observe the fine commitment and standard of today's armed forces in contributing to the activities. The Navy band, the Army band and the Air Force band had to perform almost continuously for 2112 hours in those circumstances without flinching and they provided real stamina in terms of the effort that they put forward on Saturday. I say to all my colleagues who served in Vietnam that now is the time to continue to look forward, but they should also be proud of the service that they gave to their country. Now is the time to build those extra bridgesif they have not chosen to do so thus far-and to join a wide range of organisations relevant to looking after ex-service people and veterans, in particular the RSL, so that we can ensure that as a body of men and women the contribution is never lost and that equally they too can make a further contribution to the well-being of the veterans' community by their membership of such organisations. Congratulations to all involved with bringing about the advent of this truly magnificent Vietnam memorial right here in our magnificent national capital.",133
280,Mr BILNEY,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (8.22 p.m.)It i- a privilege to follow in this very important debate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and the Leader of National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), both of whom have said what every member of this House feels about the events which happened on the occasion of the dedication of the Vietnam memorial. I was privileged to be present on that occasion with a great number of other interested members of the public, next of kin and, as the Leader of the National the Party has so rightly said, ordinary Canberrans who opened their hearts and their homes to accommodate the huge number of people who came to Canberra for this occasion. It was a healing occasion. There was no doubt that, as we watched those men and women swing by when marching-and a lot of them had not forgotten how to marchMr Tim Fischer-Including the chaplains.",135
281,Mr BILNEY,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Including the chaplains. As we watched them swing by, we saw the spirit which they displayed. We saw the reaction of the crowd. We heard them singing their regimental songs and the bands playing the regimental songs. Some of those are not printable, as members of this House would know. But we saw the great cross-section of the Australian community which was bound up in that conflict. We particularly noticed the 504 flags which were borne by marchers in the various units as they came by, each one representing the death of an Australian soldier in Vietnam: Anyone who failed to be moved by that occasion is not a true Australian. It is quite true that it was a divisive conflict. In 1965 I was 26 years old and I had just finished university. There was a great foment in the universities at that time in opposition to the war, and that opposition grew greater as the war progressed. It was not always so. In 1966 I recall that there was an election in which one of the main issues was the Vietnam war, and the then Government secured a record majority in this place. I think at that time there was a different sentiment to what prevailed as time went on. I think, in that respect, the war in Vietnam began a process of greater maturity-it was a sad start to it, I must say-in our relations with South East Asia. I recall that shortly after that, as the Deputy Speaker in the chair would recall, we both joined the Commonwealth Public Service; My first posting was in Manila. When I went to Manila as a very junior diplomat, we made our homes available to sailors, particularly sailors who were fighting on the ships on the gun.line off Vietnam. They came in and told us their stories of what life was really like over there. My point in making this remark is that, while there was political opposition to the war in Australia, I do not believe that any political party ever made it its intention, its practice or its policy to oppose the soldiers who had been sent there to fight, or the sailors and airmen who took part in the war. Those people did suffer unfortunate circumstances. When many of them came home, they found life had profoundly changed for them. But that was something that happened outside the policies of the major parties. As I say, it did begin a process of maturity; a process where we realised once and for all that political events in South East Asia were not always black or white, or red or blue, or whatever we might have thought about them. We realised that life was a great deal more complicated than that and I think that has informed our relations with South East Asia and the countries of Indo-China, in particular, ever since. I found a particularly moving aspect of the dedication ceremony was that so many Vietnamese marched. We too often forget that, while many of our own people suffered trauma and, indeed, death in that war, very many more of the unfortunate people on whose territory that war was fought suffered greatly and, indeed, suffer to this day. I, for one, found it moving that so many of them were marching on the occasion of the dedication. For that matter, it made one think of the successes that those people have made, many of them as migrants to Australia, in leading a better life and contributing to this country. The Vietnam war also signalled the end to another institution in this country, and I am speaking of conscription. One of the original stimuli for opposition to the Vietnam war was the feeling on the part of young people that, if they had a conscientious objection to that war, they ought not be conscripted to fight in it. I was privileged to bring into this House earlier this year amendments to the Defence Act which, I am pleased to say, had the support of the Opposition. We did abolish the provisions in the Defence Act which enabled conscription across the board. One is now able to register objection to a particular war, and I believe that that is a sign of our maturity as a country. I think the Leader of the National Party very rightly referred to the parallels between the conflict in Vietnam and the Gulf war. That commitment to the Gulf war was supported by all parties in this place, and again I feel quite rightly. One of the great lessons that we as a government and as a people learned was that we must not send young men away to fight for their country if there is not unanimity at home, particularly amongst political parties, that that is a just and right thing to do. I can assure the House that it was very much in the mind of the Government at all stages of the conflict in the Gulf that we had to work hard and give attention to maintaining the consensus within Australia that we were doing the right thing in resisting Saddam Hussein and his designs on Kuwait. I believe that was referred to by a number of speakers at the dedication ceremony, and rightly so, that we should have leaint that lesson and that we should never again send young people into a conflict which is not supported at home. Another aspect that I would particularly to mention that has not been referred to in this debate is that I was extremely privileged to be able to bring about recognition, in the form of a medal, for many of those who took part in the Vietnam campaign. There ,are thousands of people, possibly as many as 20,000, who supported that campaign in a logistic or other support capacity whose claims for some recognition of that service have not been assented to until now. . About a month before the memorial ceremony I was able to announce that Her Majesty the Queen had agreed to the striking of a new medal, the Vietnam Logistics and Support· Medal, to recognise the service of those people. I believe that that has been widely welcomed. The Leader of the National Party had campaigned for that, and I give him due credit. The RSL, the Vietnam Veterans Association, the Vietnam Logistics and Support Association and all the kindred organisations, with perhaps one or two exceptions, had campaigned for the striking of that medal. I am informed by the Chief of the Naval Staff, who believes that there are some 8,000 possible recipients of that medal in Australia, that already, with perhaps only a month since the announcement of it, over 4,500 people have already applied for that medal. I believe that shows that there was a demand in the community. Far from the idea that other people might return their medals if this group should receive it, I believe that it has been widely welcomed by all concerned. The medal will take the same form as the Vietnam medal itself, but it will have a distinctly different ribbon so that the distinct and different but nonetheless vital service which this group performed is recognised. I believe that no-one so appreciated the service of these logistic people-the people who served on the troop ships, in the RAAF and in oth-r capacities; and I make particular mention of the CMF observers-as the troops in the front line. That is as it should be. I want to make two or three other references. The first is to pay my tribute to the work that Peter Poulton and his team, including Charles Wright and Major-General Sandy like Pearson-just to name two of the more significant members of that team-did to bring about this event. It was a remarkable achievement. As Peter Poulton said in his remarks, it meant that he had not seen a lot of his family for a long time beforehand, but I think he would be the first to agree that it was all worthwhile. The second tribute I pay is to Canberrans themselves, who supported the march not just by being there but by doing a great deal besides that, as honourable members will know if they have read the letters column in the Canberra Times in the last couple of days. It seems to me that the Vietnam war heralded an unhealthy change in the relations between civilians and military people in this country. When my.father returned from the Second World War-what people of my generation are accustomed to calling 'the War' - civilians had no doubt as to the essential contribution which the military had made to their lives and their security. When he came home there was nothing but praise and acceptance of what had been done in the war against Hitler. It was different for many of those who came home from Vietnam. I think that from that time one can date a 'them and us' mentality between civilians and military in this country. It is feIt by those on the military side that they are not understood and not appreciated and that the uniqueness of their profession is not entirely understood or thought well of in the wider civilian community. In the civilian community there is always a feeling that these are the people who have had to do things which are nasty, bloody, dangerous and which for many people excite ideological objections. I have the feeling that a gulf had begun to grow between the civilians and the military-something which is entirely unhealthy. It is part of this Government's policy that that split between the civilians and the military should be reduced and that the civilians should think of the military as part of their community, just as the military should think of civilians as part of their community. That is one of the reasons behind our acceptance of the Wrigley report, the consultants report which had as one of its main themes the bringing together of the civilians and the military and the greater dependence which the military now will increasingly have on the civilian community. That is a good thing. In the long - n· it will be healthy and will make possible the bringing together of that split which Vietnam signified, which was .such an unfortunate aspect of that conflict and which, I hope, will never occur again.",135
282,Mr ATKINSON,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"As one of only three Vietnam veterans serving in the current Parliament, and as a former member of the 8th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, I welcome the opportunity to join the debate this evening and to pay tribute to the veterans of the Vietnam war, and in particular t9 the 504 Australians who lost their lives in that conflict. I listened with great interest to the speeches given by the· Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), and I am pleased to associate myself with the comments made by these gentlemen. This speech offers the opportunity to say many of the things that have angered me over the past 25 years with regard to the conduct of the Vietnam war and the treatment of Vietnam vetera'ns. But I have decided to restrain myself from making those comments as it will serve little purpose to reopen old wounds. The Vietnam war was very different from all other wars that this nation had previously engaged in. The fact that it has taken 20 years for a memorial to be established in the national capital is symbolic of the hurt and frustration experienced by veterans of the Vietnam war. Far worse, the families and the friends of those young Australians who died in Vietnam have had to wait 20 years to see their sacrifice formally recognised by the Australian nation. The wait has been too long, and I thank God that it is finally over. The hurt and confusion experienced by the Vietnam veterans on their return to Australia is one of the saddest and most unfortunate episodes in this country's history. On their arrival home, the anti-war movement was in the ascendancy, and many of our politicians allowed our veterans to be treated in an inexcusable manner. It has taken nearly two decades for the situation to change. Saturday's ceremony was a very important occasion for all those who served in Vietnam as well as for the families of those who served. It was an exceptionally important occasion for the families of those who died in Vietnam. The Vietnam war changed Australia. It certainly changed the lives of the young Australians who served there. It changed the lives of the families and the loved ones who were left behind. For 20 years these young men and women have been a forgotten part of the ANZAC tradition. Last Saturday's unveiling of the Australian Vietnam forces national memorial corrected some of the wrongs associated with the Vietnam war. The political and social turmoil of the early 1970s denied our Vietnam veterans a triumphant welcome home, as witnessed at the end of the First and Second World wars. Our Vietnam war veterans had to wait to be welcomed home, until that day in Sydney in 1988. Last Saturday's memorial dedication brought us closer to the end of a very unfortunate chapter of Australia's history. As a nation, it is very important that we acknowledge the debt we owe to Australian Vietnam veterans. It is particularly important that Australians, and in this instance the national Parliament, pay tribute to these young Australians who did not return or have died since the end of the war. The names of those who fell in Vietnam are now entombed in the Vietnam memorial and it stands as the nation's symbol of pride and gratitude. Thankfully, this memorial now places those who served in Vietnam in the same exalted position as those who served in Gallipoli, the Somme, Tobruk, Kokoda, Malaya, Korea and many other places. The long march home of the Vietnam veterans has finally ended. As a Vietnam veteran, I remember with pride the courage of Australians at places like Long Tan, Binh Ba, Coral-Balmoral and in the Long Hai hills. The Weekend Australian published a supplement in honour of last Saturday's event. The supplement included photographs of the 504 Australians who died during the Vietnam war. I knew at least 20 of those young men and I was not expecting to see the faces of two young men who I knew during infantry training but did not know until the release of that newspaper on Saturday that they had been killed. The supplement was a vivid reminder to me of the sacrifice made by so many young Australians. It was a welcome contribution to last weekend's events and would be very special to the families of those men who did not come home. The Vietnam war was a very different war from the earlier conflicts in Europe, the Middle East and even in Korea and Malaysia. It was the first war to be seen on television. Public opinion in Australia and the United States was largely shaped by this phenomenon and resulted in a strong anti-war movement in both countries. One could debate the merits of the Vietnam war forever and never reach a conclusion. What is certain, however, is the young Australians who fought in Vietnam did so with courage and distinction and out of loyalty to this nation. As in the two world wars, and as in Korea and Malaysia, the young men who served in Vietnam did not serve to gain personally from Australia's involvement. Their commitment was to their country. It was a sense of duty and many paid a high price in terms of suffering and loss. The Vietnam chapter is almost closed for me. But, as a Vietnam veteran, and I know I speak for many, I will consider the chapter finally closed when an end of war list is produced. This list will allow recognition of acts of valour by Australians who served in that conflict. It is a final allocation of honours, decorations and medals for individual acts of gallantry. An end of war list can be established with the approval of the Minister for Defence. Excluding the Gulf War, an end of war list has been drawn up at the conclusion of every conflict, with the exception of Vietnam. I call on the Government to produce this list and conclude this chapter of our history. I join with other members in paying tribute to the returned Vietnam veterans, the 504 Australians who paid the ultimate sacrifice, and the families and friends who have felt the loss and sadness ever since.",138
283,Mr JOHN SCOTT,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"In supporting the motion, I wish to say a few things about my views and about the need to support veterans. Before doing so I place my credentials before the Parliament. I served in uniform for three years. My father served for 6 112 years during the war and my grandfather and brother were in national service. So I know what a uniform means and I know what being a veteran means. I have to say that veterans are respected much more in Australia than they are in any other country. I salute Australia for that. I am glad to be a part of that recognition of veterans from any conflict. On Monday my wife and I visited the Australian memorial to the Vietnam veterans in Canberra. I salute our young men and women that we sent to Vietnam. I was also fortunate enough, with my wife, to visit the that memorial to the American Vietnam veterans in Washington, which was referred to earlier. Those who have not seen it should take the opportunity to do so if they visit Washington. It is quite a moving memorial. The long black wall of marble contains the names of hundreds of thousands of young people who died in that conflict. I now wish to say some things which may not sit easily with others, but I think I have a right to say them. I think they should be said. I support the veterans. I hope that all honourable members on both sides of the House and those who will take our places when we leave will remember the veterans from any conflict. As I said earlier, Australia has a very fine record, but sometimes we slip back and do not look after our veterans as we should. The Vietnam veterans were crying out for aid and help, recognition and sympathy, particularly those who suffered from agent orange. I am glad to say that this Government did something about it. We now shake hands together on both sides of the Parliament and realise that we have an obligation to these people, no matter on which side of the conflict one might have stood at the time. I also salute those who fought in the Vietnam conflict in the streets of Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney, and in New York, because their motives were purist in that they did not want their young people to be sacrificed in that conflict. I was active and learnt many political lessons from that conflict. I hope that all of us learnt lessons from it. As the Secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union at that time, I played an active part. I make no apology for that because we were concerned about what our young people were being dragged into. They were forced to put on uniforms and go and fight. I wish to take the time of the House to go back to December 1969 and refer to a document that I came across in my files only last night. The document was headed 'For whom the bell tolls'. It was taken from an article in the Australian newspaper. The Australian was very prominent in its coverage of the Vietnam conflict. Douglas Brass, a correspondent for the Australian, said a few things about Vietnam. It will hurt those opposite, but I ask them to bear with me as I quote from the article: 'There was a little boy walking towards us in a daze. He'd been shot in the ann and leg. He wasn't crying, or making any noise. 'A GI knelt down beside me. He fired three shots into the child. The first shot knocked him back. The second shot lifted him in the air. The put him down. The GI simply got up and walked away.' This testimony by a former US army photographer about one of the incidents in the massacre of My Lai, appears in this week's Life magazine, along with color photographs of piles of bodies of men, women and children. I do not accuse my colleagues on the other . side of the House of that. I just want us to make sure that these kind of things never happen again. If we make a mistake and send our young men and women in uniform to fight for this country let us make sure that the cause is just and that we will look after them when they return. We sent them there and, as a government, we have a responsibility to look after them. The memorial to the Vietnam veterans in Canberra, Australia, is also my memorial. Vietnam is very much a part of Australia. So many of our new citizens come from Vietnam. Australia and Vietnam are closely bound and let us hope that in our maturity we will recognise that binding and determine to build a closer relationship with Vietnam. All veterans from any conflict who come through the office of John Scott, the member for Hindmarsh, in Adelaide are VIPs. My staff know that; my veterans in the electorate of Hindmarsh know that. I have an obligation to them and this Parliament has an obligation to all of our young people in uniform whom we send into conflicts. Old men make war, but young men have to fight it.",139
284,Mr BRADFORD,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"I am not sure that I agree with everything the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) said, but I certainly appreciate the fact that he takes care of veterans and I applaud him for that. I also wish to be associated with this motion which congratulates those who were connected with the event last Saturday and the events leading up to it. I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), I am sure without whose cooperation, encouragement and help this event would not have happened at all. I pay that tribute to him. The dedication of the Vietnam memorial is a particularly fitting tribute to the Australians third shot who died in Vietnam and whose names are entombed within the memorial. The veterans who marched on Saturday did so to pay homage to those who died. As far as I could tell from talking to them, they did not march because they wanted recognition or plaudits for themselves. For many, even the Sydney march in 1987 was 20 years too late. But now, as others have said in this debate, with this new maturity I suppose it is time for those who survived Vietnam to look ahead. We only look back to remember those who died. Of course, we also need to ensure that those who continue to suffer physical or mental trauma are properly cared for. As others have said, there can be no doubt about the fact that they deserve this, in the same way that veterans of all wars need ongoing care. I went to Vietnam as a national serviceman. I was conscripted straight out of university and it was quite a contrast. There were 237,048 Australian men. conscripted for national service and, over the years, balloted into the Army. Of those, 16,654 national servicemen subsequently served in Vietnam; 184 national servicemen died there. The Nashos, as we were called-and other than putting that on the record Ido not want to distinguish them in any way from· the regular soldiers who served---:were well integrated into the ARA. They were thoroughly professional. I suppose most of the time the only thing which distinguished us was our regimental numbers. Like the helicopter sound which the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) referred to, any of us who served will have our regimental numbers etched into our brains forever. Mine comes back without the least trouble2788624. I am sure the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) can remember his number without any difficulty as well. I have never been other than proud of my service for my country. Like the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bllney), I am also proud of the service of my late father. He served in the 2nd AIF froin 1940 to 1944. I am proud to have had the opportunity to serve my country in the way he did. Very few veter-ns whom I have spoken to'are in any way - shamed of what they did in Vietnam. Sometimes the press would have us believe otherwise-that our reunions and public events are somehow a call to be forgiven. But this is not so. We have not hung our heads in shame. I understand that tonight is not the time to re-debate the pros and cons of the Vietnam war, for I believe that only history will put into its true perspective. For my part, I would do it again in view of the circumstances which existed in the mid-1960s. We did not know when we went there that we would not win the war. But, in the same context, was Gallipoli wrong? Was Tobruk wrong? The fact is that Australians served and died in Vietnam and they did that in the service of God, Queen and country. Ultimately, perhaps the honourable member for Hindmarsh is right: war is not the best option. But wars seem to be a fact of life on this planet and, unfortunately, there seems to be little hope of this changing. Many Vietnam veterans continue to suffer. By and large, they are not whingers, but unless they make their situation known they will be forgotten. As far as I am able to find out, since returning to Australia more than 2,000 Vietnam veterans have committed suicide. Last year, Gold Coast veteran David Pye, who was 43 years old, dropped his 15year-old daughter at school before driving to Southport police station and shooting himself. He left a tape recording in which he apologised to his family and asked that Alexandra, his daughter, be collected from school. He was haunted by his memories of the war. His wife described him as a very caring, loving person who never got over what he saw in Vietnam. We can only ask for an ongoing understanding. Many have had difficulty readjusting, as one would expect. I was fortunate, I am happy to admit, to have served as a headquarters officer. My two colleagues in this place served with battalions and probably had a very different experience of the Vietnam war than I did in that I did not experience directly many of the traumas that Australians, and I know particularly Americans, did. At Vung Tau where I was based we were close to the airport and I frequently heard the helicopters which the Leader of the National Party spoke about. The 1st Australian Field Hospital was based there and when the dustoff sirens went and the word went across the base that Australians were coming in, the war became very real to us as well. I believe I have a very real responsibility, it particularly as a member of parliament, to do whatever I can to make life easier for veterans. I am particularly happy with the High Court's decision yesterday in respect of the so-called Bushell case. I believe strongly that the law should be biased in favour of veterans, not against them-particularly now that so many of them are aged. Saturday was a day especially fot: those who died in Vietnam and for their families. I was pleased to be able to participate in the event and I support this motion congratulating all those who were involved in organising it.  Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (8.S9 p.m.)-I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and other members of the House who have contributed to the debate. A lot of my constituents ask whether there are times when oppositions and govelliments agree. I think this is one of those very special occasions in the House. I also extend an apology that I only returned to Sydney on Saturday evening and I would have liked very much to have attended the dedication service. As other people have commented, and if 1 could repeat the comments of the Prim,e Minister (Mr Keating) at the weekend, no war divided Australia like Vietnam, and too many years have passed until this memorial was built and finally dedicated. I was one of those whose birthday number was not called out in the ballot. I also had very strong views about the Vietnam war. But on this occasion those things are not important. What we need to focus on is the fact that SO,OOO Australians-as has been pointed out, some professionals and some conscripted-did what is normally done in democracies; that is, they responded to the call of their duly elected government and served overseas in a conflict. They had no say in it but responded. Regrettably, some S04 people lost their lives. It is true enough to say that people returning from conflicts find it hard to adjust. The division around the Vietnam war made it even harder for those veterans to adjust. If it was hard for the individuals, as other members have said, it has been even harder for families and friends. It is not only to those who lost their lives; or indeed those who served, that this memorial is important. In particular I would like to highlight how important it is for the families and friends of those SO,OOO Australians. I fully support this motion and particularly the bipartisan way in which the House is drawing together on such an important occasion.",140
285,Mr TAYLOR,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"As the longest serving and most senior ranking former member of the Australian Defence Force in this Parliament, it is with a mixture of honour and deep pleasure that I speak briefly to this motion. I do not want to take up too much time of the House, as my colleagues on both sides have made many of the points that needed to be made and many of the thankyous that needed to be said. I would say simply that Vietnam was about service under adversity. It was about service for one's country. It was about service for oneself and self-respect. It was about service for mates. It was about service for others less fortunate and, regrettably, it was all about sacrifice. I regret that my brother and I were not able, under the rules as they were at the time, to serve together in that combat zone, on the gun line, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) has put it. I recall that in early 1969 when the DDG Brisbane sailed for the gun line I was very disappointed indeed. However, it is now history that my brother served with distinction and was awarded a mention in the dispatches for his service on the gun line. As I hope the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) would agree, he continues to serve the Royal Australian Navy with distinction as the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff. My only regret is that my recently deceased father is not here to hear me say it once again. I would also like to pay tribute to one of those S04 who died, an old school mate of mine, a brilliant young artillery captain by the name of Ken Bade, who fell in the Hobo Woods in January 1966. I simply take this opportunity to say to Ken that he is not forgotten. History tells us that mistakes were made both militarily and politically at the time, and wisdom in hindsight is very easy indeed. However, that is not what last Saturday here in Canberra was all about. It was a day of remembrance; a day of honour; a day of reflection; as the Minister has said, some therapy; a day of fellowship; and, importantly, it seemed to be a day of fun. On all of those scores I think it was clearly outstanding success. We remember that until a few years ago the Vietnam veterans really were the forgotten group, shunned by the nation for about 20 years. For many of us that was indeed a very hard cross to bear for so many years. Last Saturday was another homecoming, and for some a very long march, for many thousands of veterans who now take their places very proudly and without apology alongside the veterans of many other conflicts involving this nation. I pay tribute to the honourable member Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) and just say to him that I think the past is important but, course, the future is far more important. seems to me that the veterans and the nation are now very united on that point. I wish finish by reading into Hansard three extracts from today's Canberra TImes which encapsulate the views of some of the veterans and some of the Canberrans who were so political impressed with what happened here last Saturday. The first one said in part: Thank you Canberra, in so many ways you helped us tei ""come home"". Our mates can now in peace in your beautiful city. It is good to they're in safe hands. The second one said: Thank you in particular to the Commonwealth time. police officers and security staff at the old Parliament House who assisted me, wheelchair bound, during Sunday's concert. Thank you to the Ainslie chemist who refused payment or deposit for the wheelchair ... thank you to the Vietnamese restaurant; also at Ainslie, who treated us like royalty ... Tears well in my eyes as I write this. I feel very humbled. You have helped the healing process. I trust that this life will not be too short me to return and once again take solace in that magnificent memorial dedicated to those who served, gave their lives, and still suffer. Finally, a very short but poignant letter said: CONGRATULATIONS to all involved with the .Vietnam war memorial: to the veterans, to the planners, to the builders. You have created a haunting remembrance of a turbulent time. a day of The writer finished by saying: most Normie Rowe is right: real men do cry. an I just finish by saying three words, which I know we say over and over again: 'Lest we forget' .",142
286,Mr LEE,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"I also wish to associate myself with the comments which have been made by not only the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) but also the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and honourable members on both sides of this House. I know that many veterans who may be listening tonight would welcome the fact that these comments are being made in such a bipartisan manner by for people on both sides of the House of Representatives. I rise to support the motion of which has been moved by the Minister as the It representative of 80,000 residents of the central coast of New South Wales. Those to residents include a very large number of Vietnam veterans, their wives and children. The Vietnam war divided Australia like no other. But it was not the first war to provoke controversy. During the First World War two referendums on conscription split our country. Even during World War II, when Australia's very existence was threatened with rest invasion by the Japanese and Hitler's Reich know occupied most of Europe, Curtin's decision to recall troops from Africa and send conscripts to New Guinea provoked opposition at the The difference with Vietnam was that the wounds opened by political controversy were not washed clean by victory. It was wrong that Vietnam veterans felt that they had to carry the burden for so long for the decisions made by the elected Government, which we should not forget won a landslide election victory in 1966 with Australia's commitment to allow to Vietnam as the central issue. Our Vietnam veterans did not simply act in accordance with the instructions of the lawful Government of the day; they discharged their responsibilities with the same courage and valour as their fathers and grandfathers in Kokoda and Gallipoli. TIle very high proportion of the surviving Vietnam veterans who attended last Saturday's dedication and the massive public turnout was a fitting tribute to the 504 Australians who sacrificed their lives in Vietnam and the many tens of thousands of Vietnam veterans who will carry the physical and emotional scars of that conflict for the rest of their lives. As the Federal member for Dobell, I am very proud to have been invited to be a patron of the central coast Vietnam Forces Association. A few years ago Vietnam veterans on the central coast decided to help their colleagues by building a hostel for in need. After many years of fundraising, and with the financial assistance of the Federal Government, and also Brisbane Water Legacy and many others, the Keith Payne VC Hostel was built at Norah Head. As honourable members know, Keith Payne is the only surviving Vietnam veteran who was awarded the Victoria Cross, and I am pleased to say· that he attended the opening of that hostel along with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I was pleased that Keith Payne was chosen to help unveil the plaque commemorating the dedication of the national Vietnam Memorial last Saturday. In the grounds of the Keith Payne VC Hostel, central coast Vietnam veterans are now building another memorial, a local memorial, with their own hands. Like the national memorial in ANZAC Avenue, and the Australian War Memorial nearby, it will be dedicated to those who have suffered so much and to those who continue to suffer so much for the service they gave their country.",143
287,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"I wish very briefly to associate myself with this motion, and to express the view that the gathering, the service, and the events of last Saturday were a magnificent occasion and, indeed, a fitting tribute. I want most heartily to congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and others associated with this. For my own part, I was in a situation where I had a nephew whose lot it fell to serve in Vietnam. He in fact did return safely. I think I had more to do with student conflict on university campuses than the conflict in the war itself. I would like to add that, for my part, it is very disappointing, almost a scandal, if I might use that word, that it has taken so long for this memorial, this recognition, and this reconciliation, if you like, to have come about. It has now, and I feel proud, privileged and honoured to be associated with this motion.",144
288,Mr HALVERSON,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"I am deeply honoured and grateful for the opportunity to speak in support of this motion. During my 25 years in the Royal Australian Air Force I did not personally see active service in Vietnam, but many of my those classmates, friends and colleagues were directly involved in this conflict. Some died in the air, and others in the jungles, villages and dties of that war-ravaged country. Many were injured and some died as a result of their injuries after they had returned home. Within the precincts of this Parliament there are several members, attendants and other staff who served Australia on the battlefields of Vietnam. I congratulate them for their service, and honour their presenc- in. this Parliament. In serving, they helped preserve and further develop one of the proudest traditions established during the relatively short history of this nation-the tradition of ANZAC. The unveiling and dedication in Canberra on 3 October 1992 of the memorial to those Australians who served, suffered and died during the Vietnam War represents the final stages of what has been a long, hard and, at times, a very traumatic healing process. We are often told that healing is but a matter of time. However, we are all only too well aware that for many veterans, and their families and friends, the physical and emotional wounds sustained as a result of the Vietnam War will never heal. Hopefully the unveiling of this magnificent memorial for our Vietnam War veterans will help lessen some of that personal suffering. At the same time, there is at last a permanent and visible public tribute, a shrine which stands to honour these brave Australians, to recognise their courage, their loyalty and their dedication to duty and to remind us all of the enormous sacrifices they made and of the debt they are owed by this nation. This is a noble and sacred memorial for it serves to acknowledge noble deeds and sacred memories. People may die, but in this memorial their deeds and their memory will always be revered and remembered. This is their legacy, and here they live forever. In the limited time available this evening it is simply not possible to attempt to list all those responsible for the planning and building of the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial. However, I do believe that such a list would most appropriately commence with the names of the 504 Australians who died on active service in Vietnam. In any event, the many thousands of others-veterans and civilians-who have been involved in or have supported, financially or otherwise, this sacred project, were not motivated because they were seeking publicity for themselves but because they were determined to gain the long overdue recognition their mates and loved ones deserve. They know who they are and they can be unashamedly proud of having achieved their objectives. Finally, this memorial does not venerate war but is a plea for peace, for goodwill and for understanding. It does not highlight fear, frustration or despair but courage, commitment and hope. It does not promote the concepts of conflict and hatred, but serves to commemorate devotion and love: The love that asks no questions, the love that stands the test, That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best; The love that never falters, the love that pays the price, The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice. In closing, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask-I know it is a little unusual, but I think it appropriate-that all assembled here join in rising in our places for a minute's silence on behalf of all those who served in order to pay homage to very brave Australians not now here gathered. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1992-93 In Committee Consideration resumed from 7 October. Schedule 3. Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce Proposed expenditure, $1,370,685,000. Department of Industrial Relations Proposed expenditure, $162,159,000.",144
289,Mrs CROSIO,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"In speaking on the appropriations for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, at a time of high unemployment a debate on the level of tariff protection is inevitable. Unfortunately, much of that debate is ill-informed. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) wants to drop tariffs in Australia to zero, giving industries no protection as they restructure to become more efficient. The Keating Labor Government is reducing tariffs gradually, in full consultation with business. It will maintain moderate tariffs for industries that need them; for example, 25 per cent tariff protection for clothing and 15 per cent protection for cars in the year 2000. Our Government also provides support for restructuring. The Labor Govetnment is not abolishing tariffs. The current tariff on imported clothing is 51 per cent. By the year 2000 it will still be 25 per cent. The current tariff on imported motor cars is 35 per cent. By the year 2000 it will be 15 per cent. The current general tariff is either 10 per cent or 15 per cent. By the year 2000 it will still be 5 per cent. Some industries will need continued protection. Our Labor Government will give it to them. The coalition will not. The coalition is committed to zero tariffs across the board. The contrast between the Government and the coalition positions is clear. Labor is phasing tariffs down to 25 per cent for the clothing industry; 15 per cent for textiles; 15 per cent for cars and 5 per cent for most other industries. The coalition proposes a zero tariff rate for everything. The Government's primary objective in reducing tariff protection is to encourage industry to restructure towards activities in which it is internationally competitive. Until now, Australian industry has been sheltered from international competition and has contributed very little to our tradeable wealth as a result. Much of our manufacturing survived largely on the basis of subsidies from other industries and ordinary Australians, as both consumers and taxpayers, In the past, tariff protection allowed investors to earn subsidised profits in low wage, unskilled industries in which Australia could not compete internationally with newly industrialising economies. This hindered the transfer of productive resources into internationally competitive industries. It also increased the input costs of our efficient export industries such as agriculture, mining, services and some manufacturing industries. It imposed high living costs on Australian consumers. Furthermore, it encouraged noncompetitive attitudes and practices among producers. It disguised the huge costs of inefficiencies in our ports and our transport system. The Government has consistently accompanied its reductions in protection with increasing support for investment in the determinants of competitiveness: research and development, capital re-equipment, new management and work practices, export market development, alliances with overseas partners, and the pursuit of quality and excellence. In the last year there has been a significant increase in the number of companies which have applied to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, or TCFDA as it is called, for Government support in restructuring. The· Government rejected proposals for a pause in the tariff phase-down for these industries and came to the view that such a pause would not result in Australian manufacturers employing more people. Nor would it result in manufacturers keeping people on who otherwise might loose their jobs. Support for a pause in the tariff phase-down is generally based on the inroads which imported goods have made into the Australian market for textile, clothing and footwear products. But, in fact, imports have risen steadily since 1983-well before the tariff cuts began. This is a direct result of the increasing competitiveness of these industries in other countries. In some countries this competitiveness arises from low wages, which we certainly could not compete with and which we would not wish to match. In other countries that competitiveness is based on the attention paid to quality, innovation, design and marketing. These issues have been ignored by many of our TCF industries in the past, thanks to tariffs and quotas. However, tariffs are only part of the way in which Labor assists industries such as the textile, clothing and footwear and motor vehicle industries. The car industry, as well as benefiting from tariffs, ·benefits from an export facilitation scheme. The benefits of this scheme are linked to the tariff rate. So ·zero tariffs under a Hewson government would wipe out that scheme altogether. Combined, the Government's 15 per cent tariff and export facilitation scheme in the year 2000, give an effective protection rate of some 36 per cent. This marks a certain contrast with zero tariffs-which the Opposition is purported to always want to introduce-and marks that difference even greater. Tariff policy, however, is a major headache for the coalition. The Nationals strongly support slower tariff reductions and the retention of some tariff protection. Even the Liberals disagree with the Leader of the Opposition. I will quote from a speech of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) in the Hansard of 9 September 1992 where he said: It would seem, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Australia's Rambo-like obse!ision with reducing industry assistance is clearly an increasingly dangerous and exposed minority position in the world at large. Again, I say that that is from the Hansard of 9 September 1992. The zero tariff policy of the Leader of the Opposition has not only sparked a serious and very divisive row in the coalition but has caused great concern among industry leaders. In contrast to the coalition's policy of abolishing tariffs, over the eight years to 1991 tariff protection was gradually reduced by this Labor Government. But Australian manufacturing grew at an average of 2.5 per cent a year. In the eight years to 1982-83, when tariffs were high, manufacturing grew at less than one per cent a year. Manufactured exports have been increasing by 12 per cent to 15 per cent each year since the mid-1980s and in 1991. Manufacturing exports matched agricultural exports for the first time at,around $15 billion. These facts show that current Government policy is working. The Government knows that the process of phasing down tariffs hurts, but it is creating a better, stronger economy. It is encouraging industries to develop and grow. Tariff policy, backed up with sensible Government support, will help Australian industries to emerge from the recession and to become more competitive and better able to contribute to Australia's growth than ever before. What we do not need is a crazy zero tariff policy which leaves Australian industry at the mercy of overseas competitors. Tariff policy should be part of a wider industry policy approach to manufacturing and to primary industries. Competition is what Australian industry has to be all about. That is what the Government is striving for. An instance has recently been brought to my attention by a concerned businessman and constituent in my electorate where competition with imported products is sending businesses broke. I am talking about the industry of reconditioned engines. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in 1991 there were some 60,371 second hand petrol engines and some 6,108 second-hand diesel engines imported. (Quorum/ormed) (TIme expired)",145
290,Mr CADMAN,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"It is just as well that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), had to resume her seat. She was speaking so much bunkum about opposition policies and was totally misrepresenting the strong industrial and commercial policies that we have to encourage and foster competition and good, strong businesses in Australia providing jobs for Australians who want jobs. Perhaps the honourable member has not noticed that western Sydney has an incredible number of unemployed people. Half of the population of New South Wales is in western Sydney, and a great number of them are unemployed. The Government's policies have done nothing for them. They are not providing jobs. They are not helping people of western Sydney, and so it is time that the Labor Party came to grips with what it counts as its call for international competitiveness by Australian industry. This call for international competitiveness has been brought about by a massive debt of $150 billion created by the Government bent on borrowing rather than trying to create policies whereby Australians become selfsufficient. The impetus to become internationally competitive has been brought about by the deficit because people have realised that to start with we need to have import replacement programs and, as the opportunity arises, move into the export of Australian manufactured goods. Buying overseas in the massive quantities Australians are is only further exacerbating the problem. We have not been able to capitalise on the decline of the Australian dollar, and the investment in manufacturing industries has stayed continually low, despite the opportunities for eJ!:port and for improved competitiveness offered by the advantageous level of the Australian dollar. Estimates of rates of investment in the early 1980s, if continued through to this time, would mean that an extra $18 billion would have been invested in Australia in manufacturing industries. That is the legacy of the honourable members opposite. If they had maintained reasonable policies through the 1980s into the 1990s, they would have had an additional $18 billion invested in manufacturing industry; it would have been gone forever never to be recovered. That $18 billion worth of investment would have created thousands of jobs. Instead, we· have businesses closing down at a record rate because they cannot continue to operate profitably and they are going offshore because of the policies that the Government has adopted. The cry from one industry after another to be able to reach international competitiveness and reach international standards has been for reforms in all areasreforms in the taxation system to increase the productivity in Australia and to do something about unit labour costs. The Labor Party has done nothing about any of those major areas which would improve our competitiveness internationally. There are big benefits for Australia if we can be internationally competitive. There would have been big benefits to Australia if the Labor Party had maintained the impetus of the early 1980s carrying through to this date whereby there would have been an additional $18 billion invested in manufacturing industries. Investment is at a record low and it continues at a low. People do not have the confidence to continue to strive, to provide jobs and to go into manufacturing industry. Despite the depreciation of the Australian dollar, we have not capitalised on it. The of return for investment in Australia are far below those comparable countries that we like to evaluate ourselves with. The rate of return against all of the DECO countries in Australia is much lower, and is certainly a very much lower return when matched against the United States, Canada, Japan and New Zealand. Here we are in the south part of the Pacific with a little neighbour, New Zealand, where investment to create jobs is far more attractive than it is in Australia. We have lost out in this race to be able to provide an environment where people want to invest and whereby jobs will be created. The unit costs in manufacturing in Australia put us right out of whack with the rest of the world and make it incredibly difficult for anybody to have confidence under the current policies of the present government. In Australia and Canada, unit costs have been rising in relative terms over the period 1987 to 1993, whereas in the United States, Japan and New Zealand the relative unit costs have been falling. We have a massive debt related to increasing unit costs as compared with our competitors having falling unit costs, and it easy to see why we are not internationally competitive. Even in the raw taxation system, it is best calculated that Australian manufacturers have a 3 or 4 per cent tax disadvantage, just in that one area straight off the top. They have been calling for many years for refonn of the taxation system, but we have a government hell-bent on adding tax on tax on people who should be the productive part of the Australian economy. These continuing increases in taxation are not direct taxation so much as imposts and levies imposed on industry so that the real cost of employing somebody continues to rise, even though the take home pay may not rise. Time and again we have seen the ACTU being prepared to do a deal which will increase the cost of employment, but will provide little benefit to the actual employee. That has just been a con stunt pulled by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Mr Kelty. I think it is a shameful thing that Australian rates workers have not had the benefits of their hard work, but at the same time employers have been continually loaded up with increasing costs. Our productivity is lagging behind the rest of the world, and we will not catch up where there is no incentive for people to work a bit smarter, work a bit harder and work a bit more in the style that is followed in Europe or the United States. Australians used to say, 'We don't want the living standards of Japan to be competitive. If we want to be competitive we will not sink to the level of Japan in order to reach that level of effectiveness'. Now the scene has changed and they are saying, 'No we don't want to reach the level of Korea because Japan has by-passed us in living standards'. People who oppose the proposition of Australians being competitive overlook the fact that they are constantly changing their goalpost. First of all we did not want to be like Japan and have its standard of living, then we did not want to be like Korea which is fast catching up with us. Next it will be we do not want to be like the Philippines or Indonesia because one after another countries is in Asia are catching us and passing us by as they use new technology, very productive practices and an incentive that applies to people in the work force. The Government needs to change its policies completely. I think the Prime Minister really does not believe that this esoteric argument of 15 per cent or 5 per cent for the car industry in years time is really something of significance. He is really trying to earn himself a place again as Prime Minister. It is not an argument that is worth having. It means nothing when we compare the difficulties Australia has to overcome. The Opposition is offering the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, excise on petroleum products and customs duties over a period. Taxes on exports are to be reduced to 5 per cent by the year 2000. Mrs Crosio-Add it up. We will even give you a calculator.",147
291,Mr CADMAN,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Those opposite are trying to argue that there is a big difference between 15 per cent and 5 per cent-a 10 per cent difference. That will amount to $400 a car in the year 2001. Who can tell what it is going to be that far ahead? The Opposition is offering the abolition of the training guarantee levy; the capital gains tax will be lowered and revised; there will be additional allowances for goodwill in the capital gains tax; there will be full capital gains tax exemptions on capital gains under $3,000; and full capital gains tax relief on roll over of business into a like business where the disposable price does not exceed $5m. These are the concessions that Australian manufacturers need. Those opposite are not even prepared to abolish payroll tax. They try to argue that payroll tax is beneficial to small business. What rubbish! It is in the documents of those opposite, and used by them, that payroll tax is good for Australian manufacturers. That is bunkum. (TIme expired)",149
292,Mr CAMPBELL,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Many years ago I had the painful task of taking the Navy and, in fact, my own Government to the Ombudsman because I believed that there was collusion in the tendering for a very significant military contract. The Ombudsman had a look at it and he decided that I was right, there was collusion in the tendering. In his report he made it quite clear that that was the case, but he said it happened at such a low level that he did not think it had any outcome on the eventual awarding of the contract. That low level was a parliamentary committee, and at eight the time. I was incensed. Having heard this debate in this chamber, I understand absolutely what the Ombudsman meant because I have never heard more puerile dogma than what has emanated from the Opposition on industry policy and industrial relations. Truly, the Liberal Party today is the radical party of Australia. It is hell-bent on change. It does not know why or where it is going as long as it gets change, and we see this with the GST. There is no rationale for the GST other than that it is differ-nt, and it ceqainly is different. The main reason, the justification for the GST, is that those opposite are going to change the income tax system. They say that the income tax system is complex. Of course it is complex. It has to be, because if we are going to enshrine equity in the ta)\:ation system we have to have laws which make it impossible for the smart lawyers to get around it. Honourable .members in this Parliament today will remember the years when tax was optional for the rich. The poor-the workers-never had any option; they had to pay their tax because it was taken out of their pay. But for the rich it was optional. We have added to the complexity of the tax system, and that complexity is designed to enshrine that equity. While we are committed to equity in a taxation system it is impossible to have one that is not complex. It is utter nonsense to suggest otherwise. Anyone who thinks about it will realise that. One of the other disturbing things is that the Liberal Party takes the view that the problem in Australia is taxation. The problem was never taxation, it was always the inappropriateness or the lack of an industry policy. What has Australia had for an industry policy? In the years of MCEwen-I do not blame Black Jack MCEwen entirely-the idea was that we would protect industry. Any industry got massive protection. We had a very cosy relationship between the metal trades unions and the metal trades employers. The employers knew that they could give wage rises and pass on their costs ad infinitum. In the long run this was untenable, but it was also very foolish from the start. it was no less foolish than the dogma adopted subsequently of the level playing field, because the reality is that there is no such thing in the world as a level playing field: Nobody plays on a level playing field except 'good old Aussie', batting away on its own level playing field in isolation. We have to look at what sorts of industries we want in this country. I already hear the clamour-not only from those opposite, but on this side too-that we cannot pick winners. Is it not amazing that every successful country in the world has picked winners in its industry but we are incapable of doing it? That is absolute nonsense. But we do not have to pick winners, we just have to pick a direction for industry. If we determine what sorts of industries we need for strategic reasons and what sorts of industries we are good at, we can get the mix of industries where we can survive and, in fact, excel. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Chairman, that this is not difficult. The reality is that there are some things in which Australia has a natural advantage. There are things that we do well for one reason or another. Australia produces by far the world's greatest amount of fibre wool fabric. The reason we do so is that we have the right climate, relatively cheap land, and the genetic pull. However, we do not value add to that. Value adding is a very overused term. It has been used by everybody. People say to me, 'We have got to value add our mineral products'. This is fine and large; it is motherhood stuff. The reality is that our customers do not want value added products. The customers that we supply to, mainly in Asia, know that value adding means jobs. Therefore, they raise tariffs against our value added products or in fact border boundaries. We simply cannot get any elaborately transformed manufactured product in those countries at all, so we are left supplying them with raw materials. Let us look at what has happened with raw materials. Western Australia, in terms of the economy of this country, is without Ii doubt the most important State. Last year, Western Australia's contribution to our foreign earnings was something like $12.7 billion nett, But nearly twice as much as Queensland. It is true that not a lot of that benefit stayed in Western Australia, but for Australia it was extremely good. The largest contribution was from mining. Let us analyse mining. There was a 15 per cent increase in mining year on year. In 199091 there was a 15 per cent increase from the previous year. This was achieved in the face of commodity price downturns. So we did not have to dig out just 15 per cent, we had to dig out a lot more than that to gain that very worthwhile increase in productivity. What was the reward to labour for that? It was less jobs. The mining industry got more efficient and shed labour. The mining industry in Australia will continue to become more efficient. It is the most efficient mining industry in the world because it has been the most innovative and the most advanced in the introdu-tion of new technology. The consequence-the end sum of that-is less jobs. We have to provide the jobs somewhere. Quite clearly, we cannot value add our mineral products. What we should have been doing all along is manufacturing the equipment that we use in the mining industry. Instead, we import $1.6 billion worth of equipment a year. Most of this equipment we could either make better or cheaper. In the mining industry, better is the same as cheaper. If we had introduced this equipment we would have sold it because people buy from those they think are the experts. Clearly, we are the best miners in the world, and we would have had a head start in selling it. I believe that a government that neglects this area is incompetent and gutless. I do not know whether the Labor Party will have the nous to bite that bullet, but I do know that no-one in the Liberal Party is ever going to venture anywhere near it. Those opposite will say, 'The level playing field is king and we must leave it to the market'. The market is dominated by foreigners and they will do everything they can to stop that development taking place in Australia. I heard an honourable member speaking recently about Australia being surpassed by the standard of living in Japan. Does he really believe that? Look at the disposable income of the people of Japan. It is meagre alongside Australia. Even today this country probably has one of the most enviable lifestyles in the world, and that is simply why there are millions upon millions of Asians who want to come here, but not a lot of Australians who want to go there. That is a simple, basic truth which should be understood by everybody. I do not want my kids to work for Korean wages or to have a Korean lifestyle, let alone a Filipino or Bangladeshi lifestyle. For Australia the future must lie in those niche markets where we are competitive or in those areas where we determine that we have a strategic need. I could go into that, but I will not because I want to deal in more depth with other facets of this argument. We are told that one of the problems is industrial relations. The truth is that under Government there have been enormous increases in productivity. There has been cooperation between workers and management, just like in the successful countries overseas. One of the hallmarks of Japan was negotiation-cooperation between management and the workers. It is easier in Japan because it has a much more cohesive society than we have allowed to develop in this country. But still this Labor Government has achieved great strides in productivity and that cooperation. This is likely to be thrown out of the window by an Opposition party that wants to bring in confrontation. The Liberal Party of Australia is the radical party of Australia. I believe that the Australian people will always support the middle ground. I believe that the Australian people want steady progress. They want to know that there is a job for them next year. They will reject a radical party, just as for years and years they rejected a radical Left in the Labor Party. They will reject the Liberal Party because they see it today and they fear it for the instability that they know it will bring to the whole of industry. Those opposite talk about costs. The reality is that the workers in Europe-in Germany and France-enjoy far more paid holidays than do the Australian workers, and have an hourly rate of pay which is higher than in Australia. It is true that in the United States people do not enjoy the quality of life that we enjoy; I am told that two weeks is quite a long time for paid holiday in the US. But their hourly rate of pay is much higher. (TIme expired) .",149
293,Mr REID,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"It is always interesting to follow the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) in a debate in this House. He has overlooked one of the main messages of the 1980s, which is the damage that has been done to industry and commerce by a Labor government. We have had high taxes, lack of incentive and high interest rates-going from 18, 19, 20, 21,22 and up to 23 per cent; up they wentwhich industry and commerce could not cope with in the period under a Labor government. There have been no incentives for them. The this Labor governments have just kept on putting up interest rates-pushing up interest rates and driving industry and commerce out of this nation. We have seen high taxes and charges, high interest rates and a high level of government interference. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie mentioned picking winners. The Keating and Hawke governments have not picked winners; what they have done has been to interfere with business getting on with business; that is what they have done. They have got in the road. Business can manage its own affairs without a Labor government trying to get in and pick winners. What those governments have done to industry and commerce throughout this nation has been disgraceful. I cannot believe what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has said. Certainly, we have proposed a different tax regime for this nation-but which countries is it different from? Most countries in the world, certainly those throughout the European Community, have a VAT or a goods and services tax. What we are doing is providing some reward for effort. I know that that is a foreign word for the Australian Labor Party; it does not believe in it. We need to have reward for effort, to give people incentive to get on and do the job, to go out and be enterprising, and to run their businesses free of interference from government. We need to get government off their backs. We need to let business get on and run business as it best knows how to do. One of the things that the coalition has put forward is a major package of reforms to provide some reward for effort. Business will be one of the big winners from the coalition's Fightback package of reforms. We will lower business costs-not do what the Labor Party did. We will lower the tax burden on business. There will be greater competitiveness and, ultimately, better profits, of which will involve major gains for business owners. The coalition's Fightback strategy will reduce the costs of running a business by abolishing seven taxes. I heard the honourable member for Kalgoorlie say that the goods and services tax would be complicated. Who could get anything more complicated than the legislation that we have now for wholesale sales tax? Has anyone in this House ever seen it? It is so high that we could not jump over it. There is page after page of products that attract different rates of wholesale sales tax. We have three different ranges of tax-lO per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent-on a whole range of products. They all attract different taxes, which makes the system so complex. The Government tried to bring in a wholesale sal- tax simplification Bill-,and it could not even get that right. What a mess it made of that one, trying to simplify the wholesale sales tax system. It is a nonsense system involving costs against business. It is difficult to administer and it is complex. Let us take the case of, say, an electrical sales organisation in the retail area which would have at least $200,000 worth of stock on its shelves on most of which it would have paid maybe 30 per cent sales tax. That would be $60,000 in wholesale sales tax sitting on the shelves doing absolutely nothing-not earning a dollar but actually costing the organisation many thousands of dollars to keep on the shelves. Most small retailers carry more stock than that, and they pay that wholesale sales tax in advance. The products just sit on the shelves and cost the retailers big money. They have had to borrow that money to keep that stock on the shelves. While they were borrowing that money, the Hawke and Keating governments kept jacking up interest rates. Month after month, week after week, interest rates spiralled and no effort was made to do anything about them and the impact they had on industry and commerce. What we are proposing to do is to make a number of other major changes to assist business. Transport costs in this country are one of the major expenses that reflect on every business. Every industry and every all activity in the commercial world is affected by high transport costs. That is why we will . remove the fuel excise. That will mean that the price of fuel used in business will fall by around 26c a litre. Of course, that 26c a litre is on every litre of fuel that businesses use, and every one of their suppliers pays it as well-so the costs run on and cascade through the whole system. It ends up as a cost on every industry and every commercial activity in Australia.",151
294,Mr KERR,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,What are your secret road charges? Tell us about your secret road charges.,152
295,Mr REID,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"We will remove all of that wholesale sales tax on commercial vehicles. Office equipment will not attract sales tax. Phones, faxes, even office stationery-all of the equipment used in offices-will fall in price because the 20 per cent wholesale sales tax will be abolished. A numb-r of firms in Australia do not pay payroll tax. There is a very good reason for that: in many instances' employers and business' owners keep the size of their business below the payroll tax threshold. Payroll tax will be abolished under the Fightback package. What people do not recognise in regard to many industries and commercial activities in Australia is that many firms are deliberately restructuring their businesses so that they do not have to pay payroll tax. It works to their detriment every time they try to expand or to put on another employee. We will assist business by ensuring that business costs remain low by rebating the business GST paid on inputs and purchases. This will make a very big difference to the tax burden on business. The business costs will be further reduced by our commitment to prune government spending, cut the size of the bureaucracy and target welfare assistance to the. genuinely needy people. That is something that this Labor Government has not done. We recognise that there are many welfare agencies in the community that can do a much better job of delivering services. Organisations with which I have a very close relationship, such as the Salvation Army, deliver welfare services much more efficiently and they deliver them right to the people who need them. Businesses will also benefit from the coalition's low interest rate and low inflation rate policies. Our commitment is to create a healthy and stable economy which will allow people in business and commerce to plan for and invest in the future of their business with certainty and confidence. They cannot do that at the moment. There is absolutely no confidence in the business and community world, particularly in industry and commerce. Noone is prepared to spend or invest any money because people have no confidence. That was expressed very clearly in the Victorian State election last weekend.",152
296,Mr KERR,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"It seems that we are to be having a platitude led recovery from the Liberal Party. Regrettably, in these kinds of debates people seem to wheel out their favourite hobby horses. Often ideological statements are disguised as truths to which we have to be exposed. We have honourable member after honourable member standing up and repeating statements which they obviously believe are guiding lights for the future. Regrettably, debate does not seem to be infected by fact very often. The infection of fact is rarely allowed to occur in these debates. Let us have a look at some of the things that may surprise, people in this debate. Firstly, in the area of elaborately transformed manufacturing, Australia is seeing a very significant growth in exports. That is something that surprises many honourable members on this side of the chamber as well as the Opposition side. Many members, including me, were led, through documents such as the Pappas Carter Evans Koop/Telesis report, commissioned by the AMC, to suspect that we ne,eded to take a significantly more directive approach to government policy setting to get the kind of strong export growth in elaborately transformed manufacturing that we are seeing. This is a tribute to the success of entrepreneurial small business in the real sense, not in the paper shuffling sense that we saw in the 1980s, where we see the emotional soul roots of the Liberal Party. The Opposition seeks through its policies to rekindle the policy environment of the 1980s. It wants a policy setting which directs tax resources from those least able to afford it to those on higher incomes. It would arrange the affairs of this nation so that the emphasis would be on what it would say is enterpreneurialism. But the entrepreneurialism of the 1980s essentially saw people waste the opportunities that were given to them. Through various strategies and industry plans that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has developed, Labor has created a new environment in manufacturing in this country. It has created an outward looking environment which is surprising many of us on this side of the chamber and ought to surprise those on the Opposition sideif they look at the facts of Australia's manufacturing. Part of the success of the Government's positioning in this regard has been to link its strategies with support for research and development, commercialising research and development, getting business engaged in thinking outwardly into export orientated markets and getting away from simplistic notions that the Government has nothing to do with industry policy. We hear time and time again from the Opposition that we should just let business get on with being business. Nowhere else in the world where there is any success in industry policy do governments simply adopt a hands-off policy. I recently travelled to Taiwan with a number of colleagues from this side of the chamber. We were treated extraordinarily well by the Government of Taiwan. Taiwan is often put up as an example of a free market economy. It is urged that it is one of the South East Asian tiger economies, where government plays little or no role in shaping the environment. We sat down with Government leaders who told us proudly about their six-year plan. They expressed to us the hope that Australia could participate some ways in building up the infrastructure objectives of that nation. They explained precisely what they were doing in order to facilitate the kind of growth in industry strategy that they saw Taiwan needing if it were to continue the rate of growth that had in the past. The Taiwanese Government was very directly involved in policy setting and seeing a framework for the way in which that economic unit would develop. In Australia we also need to look at our industry and, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) says, to take a very pro-active stance in relation to it. We need identify whether we want some particular industries. Do we want a car industry, for example? If we do, we have to look at the cost structures inherent in that industry and look to maximise the efficiencies of that industry. But we need to make sure that we do not allow it to go under with respect to competition which is infinitely more able to increase volume through production in large plants in countries such as Japan. If we want an indigenous industry in car manufacturing, we obviously have to look to the bottom line on tariffs. Senator Button hl:\s ruthlessly engaged in dealings with the industry in order to come to that bottom line. We have concluded that it is about ·15 per cent on tariffs. The Opposition, on the other hand, says, 'We have a purist position. We don't really mind whether or not there is a car industry in this country. If it can compete at zero tariffs or5 per cent tariffs, well and good. But if it can't, we would rather not have a car industry'. Regrettably, that dismisses out of hand the interests of the thousands of Australians who have their future in building, making and retailing Australian made cars. If we are, for example, to look at future opportunities for export in this country, we obviously need to do something about food. We grow and process some food, but we have unlimited opportunities for value adding in the food industry. As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, we have opportunities to further value add in the wool industry. Government does have a role in these areas, in as it does in encouraging research and development and the commercialisation of to us research and development. One of the things that I would commend to the attention of honourable members, if they are looking at issues that really do need it has addressing, is the commitment of our institutional investments to commercialisation of research and development. Because of the involvement of government over decades, through institutions such as the CSIRO and a number of other important and well established research bodies, this country simply jumps and sizzles with great research. to It is a fantastic and lively place, if one is looking for ideas, impetus and enthusiasm. Once we get imtovation, there is a very great degree of difficulty in finding the funding to commercialise it; for example, what is called the order of tens. If R&D costs $1,000, it costs 10 times more to develop it to a prototype, so that would be $10,000. It would be 10 times again to commercialise it, so then we are talking about $100,000. Where Australia is deficient is in commercialising its research and development. . Some time ago I spoke in. the House about the Government compelling superannuation funds and other institutional investors to provide a base component of their investment portfolio for commercialisation of research and development. That has not found favour with the Government at this stage, but I think we really do need to look very hard at at least mandating compulsory reporting of the structure of investment. Investment in this country too often has gone into what has been perceived as low risk investment strategies in property and other passive investments. Now that the back of inflation has been broken, it makes no sense for institutional investors to overlook the very real attractions of investment in commercialisation of research and development. The export success of those small business sectors which have gone through this process and are actually exporting shows that there are dollars to be made, but with the trustees of superannuation funds we do have a powerfully cowardly investment environment. There is a big education job to be done and I commend the Government to mandate compulsory reporting. (TIme expired)",153
297,Mr NUGENT,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Aston) (1O.12p.m.)Tonight I want to draw the attention of the Committee to some of the evidence of where the Government's industry policy has generally failed. I acknowledge that there are some success stories, but nowhere near enough to get us out of the troubles that we are in. I want to look briefly at how we are missing a number of those opportunities. I want to relate some actual case histories that I have personally experienced recently in which Government policies clearly are not working. I want to briefly talk about the car industry, so the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) may wish to stay and learn some facts. I want to remind the Government of the broad business community's satisfaction with our current situation. Mr Kerr':""-I would like to stay, but the chances of having any facts revealed to me are slight.",155
298,Mr NUGENT,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"But I will give the honourable member for Denison the facts that he is asking for. He said that he wanted to be infested with facts and I have lots of them for him. First of all, I refer to an article which appeared recently in the press which I think is very instructive to our situation. This article, written by Helen Meredith, appeared in the Australian: . . . Australia is a sophisticated buyer and we should be able to trade on that advantage. A senior executive of a leading US aerospace company was quoted recently as saying: 'The Australian market is around the tenth largest for long-range aircraft. For us it is a very attractive market.' Well, come and get it! But here is the deal-a deal. based on the premise that we are trying to build a strong industrial base for ourselves and we want to make some impact on our trade balance. This means ensuring that every foreign salesperson is required to make a commitment to our market. This might be in handing over some R&D to locals, doing some local manufacture, shopping some out to local firms, or it might be letting us piggy back with them into the world-wide market as 'value added' to something of theirs. This way we acquire manufacturing skills and maybe develop some intellectual property of our own. And, down the track, we earn some export dollars. Australia is one of only two nations in the Asian region that has its own telecommunications industry. Australia and Japan could, without help from any other nation, supply all the regions' needs today in terms of network infrastructure, hardware, software, training and long-term management of telecommunications systems and networks. To continue and improve our telecommunications export role, we will have to keep up the level of local R&D and sustain our investment in modern plant and advanced techniques. In short, the opportunity is very much there for us to take by the throat. But what is actually happening? The reality, of course, is that unfortunately businesses are going down the tubes at a great rate of knotS. We can talk about th- broad statistics: a 70 per cent increase in bankruptcies in my part of Victoria in the last 12 months.",155
299,Mr KERR,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,It's yours!,155
300,Mr NUGENT,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"It was this Government's policies-and it was the State Labor policies-that caused it. In some senses, except to those who are directly affected, the gross figures hide what is really happening. Let us look at some specifics. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), who is at the table, should listen, because this is what is happening under his Government's environment. Last month I visited an auto industry supplier not far from my electorate-company X. Within the last 12 months at its Melbourne operation it has cut its numbers from 1,600 to 300. In its South Australian operation it has cut its numbers from 1,400 to zero. It has closed down. Because of the better infrastructure in that places such as New Zealand, which has done what our side of politics is advocating, 400 jobs have been created from scratch. In Western Samoa 1,400 jobs have been created. Those jobs have gone straight offshore. Why have they gone Qffshore? It is because of the oncosts which under this Government have become totally out of control. The payroll tax, the Workcare, the paper work, the regulations, the superannuation guarantee levy, the training guarantee levy, the wholesale sales tax, the petroleum excise duties and customs charges-all these things have driven these companies offshore. The companies have said that if those were done away with, as we are proposing to do, they would come back tomorrow. There would also be some advantages from industrial relations refonns. If Government members want to know what is going on in the real world, they should go to Nissan. Since Nissan announced that it was stopping manufacturing, without doing anything else, its industrial relations have not changed fonnally in any sense, but the motivation has changed because people want to keep their jobs. There has been a 30 per cent improvement in worker productivity just because there is a bit of competition. People are not getting paid any less; they are getting better pay because a lot of them are working overtime. Productivity has gone up dramatically. That is an industrial relations freeing-up of the system. While this Government fiddles, industry out there is burning. I will tell the honourable member for Denison, who could not remember the portfolio of Senator Button, what Senator Button's title should be. He should be called Nero, because he is fiddling while our industry burns. We have four large car multinationals. Let us be clear on what they are about. They are looking after their own interests-they are multinationals-they are not looking after Australia's interests. They are again coming up to an election, looking for protection. They regulation: use bully boy tactics. I was at Toyota talking to its management last month. It is all about pressure: flash a few figures on the screen; it country; will not let anyone take notes; it will not let anyone go away; it is not prepared to sit down and talk about the validity of its figures. It is not interested in logic and numbers; it is all about political pressure. I want to talk briefly about the car industry. The industry generally agrees that on a $15,000 car the difference between the two tariff rates-that is between the Government's proposal and the Opposition's, the 15 and the five-is a net loss of revenue of about $1,000. Data from the industry indicates that car producers will pick up cost savings of $350 to $400 per car on payroll tax, $150 to $220 on wholesale sales tax, $50 to $80 on fuel excise and additional savings on superannuation. That is well over $600 a car. The honourable member for Denison wants facts. Let us talk about the facts. Even the car companies agree that they will be better off until 1996-97. Another $150 per car or more could be gained as a result of increased throughput. The throughput will come because the $15,000 car will come down by $4,000. These are Industry Commission figures, not mine. Because people out there will have more money in their pockets through tax reductions, there will be greater sales of cars; therefore, the number of cars made will go up. That goes on all the way through the industry. There are many facts. I have a paper which I would be delighted to show to the honourable member so that he can improve his mind on the subject. I remind the chamber of another recent document entitled Liberating enterprise to improve competitiveness supported by many of the major organisations in this country: the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; the Australian Chamber of Manufactures; BCA; MTIA; and many others. In part that document-it is an extensive document but it is instructive for those opposite to read because their Government could learn some lessons-states: Compared with other countries, and especially those in our region, our systems of business are major barriers to developing the international competitiveness of companies operating in this . are complex and extensive, being difficult to understand and penetrate by most people in business and covering an unnecessarily broad area of activity; are very dense, because of the multiple layers of government and overlapping jurisdictions which leads to delays, inconsistencies and additional costs to business investment. Those are the sorts of things which the Government is bringing in. It is bringing in extra regulation all the time. I could quote further from this extensive document but because of time constraints I will not do so tonight. But I commend it to honourable members. These are not my words; I have been quoting the words of independent sources.' We have had 10 years of the HawkeKeating Government and it has now been condemned by the major business organisations. We have record levels of unemployment and record levels of bankruptcy. If we talk to business,· it will tell us what is going on. We all knew about unemployment months before it hit us. Yet the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stood up in this place saying that it was not going to happen. We all knew it was going to happen. Those opposite knew, as I did, because we went out there and saw it. If those opposite are still going around the factories and companies in their electorate, they will know that the situation is not getting better at the rate that it needs to to get this country off the hook. There is too much red tape and green tape. There are too many regulations and there are too many taxes cascading right through the system. There are also huge oncosts.",155

The business community is saying these things and those opposite should be listening to the business community. We have spelt out in detail what we are going to do and are addressing the issues that the business community wants us to address. The Government should take serious action, in spite of its union mates, before it is too late for the next generation of Australians. (TIme expired)",157
305,Mr LES SCOTT,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Oxley)"" (10.22 p.m.)Mr Deputy Chairman Mr Martin-This will be more sensible",157
306,Mr LES SCOTT,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"I certainly hope it will be. The only word that the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) said which was true was the word 'dense'. Obviously he was talking about the people on the back bench of the Opposition. They are quite dense in believing what Fightback is all about, because quite clearly it contains no proposals that will assist industry in this country. As the honourable member for Aston well knows, it will do quite the reverse. The honourable member spoke about the problems in his electorate. I am not surprised he has problems if he goes around trying to sell the Fightback package and at the same time talks down the Australian economy with the negative attitude that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and all Opposition members have. As long as they keeping talking things down in that way, this country will go nowhere. We on this side remain positive. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has illustrated quite clearly to those opposite in a couple of debates just how things are moving in this country. The debates that have taken place in this chamber in the last couple of days have shown quite clearly that Australia does have a great future provided it does not accept the stupidity of the Opposition's Fightback package. I remind the chamber of the figures that the Prime Minister has cited in the last few days. The Prime Minister said that productivity was trending upwards and that interest rates and inflation were both low, while exports continued to trend upwards. The Prime Minister said that we are now exporting nearly a quarter of all we produce. In 1982-83 we were exporting 14 per cent of GOP. This year we are exporting 23 per cent of GOP. The difference is 9 per cent of GOP. The Prime Minister has reminded the chamber about that on several occasions in the last few days, and rightly so. We all know what the Opposition's Fightback package would do to industry, particularly small business. I was· surprised when I heard some honourable members opposite say tonight that a payroll tax would benefit small business. We all know that it would not affect small business at all because small business does not pay payroll tax. Those opposite seem very slow to grasp that. In the last few days the National Party of Australia has been shown to be particularly slow on a few' things. However, those on the farm know what will happen under a GST. The Budget contains many initiatives for industry. It continues the Government's record of providing for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the growth of scientific research in Australia. That is very important. The major announcements in the area of industry, technology and commerce include an extra $30m to assist the clothing and footwear industries to restructure, meaning that over $ 160m will be spent in this area over the next four years; and $12.7m to encourage increased productivity in food production and greater focus on the developing export markets. A new reform package for the construction industry will also be introduced as a result of Australia. the Budget, building on the micro-economic reforms that this Government has introduced over recent years, and which certainly would not be produced under a coalition government. The $2.5m will be used to reform building regulations, including the building code of Australia,. the fire safety code of Australia and the building standards of the Standards Association of Australia. These changes will significantly reduce the costs of building, including housing. Of course, under the Fightback package all those things would go up with the Opposition's 15 per cent GST. The 1992 Budget also continues the Keating Government's support for Australia's science and technology effort. Obviously those opposite do not know much about science and technology. Support for science and technology has been increased in this year's Budget to $2.9 billion, an increase of almost 40 per cent since 1983. The Government's plans for science and technology are contained in the White Paper on science and technology that was released on the same night as the Budget. The most important initiative is that the present 150 per cent tax concession on research and development wi11 remain, a strong indication of the Government's commitment to ensuring the success of Australia's research effort. The concessions have been a major boost to private sector research and development since they were introduced seven years ago. Amongst the other changes in the area of science and technology contained in the Budget was the introduction of an extra 200 postgraduate research awards; an increase in the funding available to the CSIRO to allow it to undergo a major upgrading; and an expansion of Australia's research data network. The White Paper represents a landmark in the history of science and technology in Australia, as it sets out Australia's first truly national science and technology policy. The Keating Government recognises that it is unsustainable for Australia to allow the products that result from Australian ideas to be bought by overseas investors. More needs to be done in terms of keeping those in To address this situation, two aims will guide national policy in this area over the next decade. The first will be to increase private sector involvement in research and development and the second is to forge closer links between private sector research users and public sector research institutions. These closer links will not only lessen the dependence of these institutions on the Federal Government for funding but also will give the private sector access to their research expertise. In comparison, the Liberal and National parties' attitude to science and technology is based on a virtual Stone Age outlook. The only mention of science in the Fightback package is to outline the spending cuts that the Opposition plans to make. We have increased our spending by 40 per cent since 1982-83. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), the Opposition science spokesperson-just in case honourable members were not aware-is a member of the National Party, a party which is famed for producing eminent scientists. ·and intellectual giants of the calibre of Joh Bjelke-Petersen and the current honourable member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). The honourable member for Gippsland has made it clear that if he were ever science Minister he would axe many of the successful programs the Government has introduced since 1983. This is because in the Opposition's scale of things science and technology does not rat-. Of course, as in many other areas where it is hoping to pull the wool over the eyes of the A.ustralian public, the Opposition is yet to produce a detailed science policy of its own, as is the case with industrial relations and a few other things. That is because it does not have the guts to tell the scientific community what its real plans are. To their credit, many honourable members opposite are embarrassed and appalled by the performance of their shadow science spokesperson. I understand that the Opposition's industrial Budget. and structural reform task force is growing very tired of the spokesman's repeated promises that the policy is still in the process of being finalised. I am surprised that not yet used the excuse that the cheque is themail or that his dog ate his policy, alis though I am sure he will try as he becomes increasingly desperate. One has to ask why the Leader of the Opposition has not money demanded of his shadow Minister that he complete his policy immediately. It is a a wonder to us all. We have to assume that is because he considers science and techenhance nology and our national research and developof ment effort as being very low on the Opposition's scale of priorities. The only proposals the Leader of the Opposition has are ones which would involve the winding back of government support for research and development. As an article page 188 of the July edition of Search inopportunities. dicated: . . . all leads indicate that there will be public money for R&D under a Hewson Government (indeed, less when the· GST factor is taken into account, but even this is so imprecise that universities and CSIRO cannot say where they stand). The coalition has demonstrated that it has no understanding of Australia's requirements from science and technology. All the coalition has to offer is millions of dollars in cuts to the CSIRO budget-a cut of $60m to science and technology organisations and $39m in cuts to energy research. The GST, along with the other nasties in the Fightback package, would cost science and technology millions of dollars. Every research organisation would have to add 15 per cent to the price of everything it produces, placing such research out of the reach of many firms who would otherwise use the information. The reason for these draconian measures is that those opposite fail to understand the central importance of science and technology to economic growth. This Government will, however, continue to place research and development high on its agenda and we will continue to build on the gains of the past decade in the way we have in this One of the initiatives which I meant to mention earlier, as far as improving our export opportunities and ensuring that a lot of he has those good initiatives developed by in Australians do not go offshore are concerned, the working capital guarantee facility. The Export Finance Insurance Corporation will underwrite new guarantees to banks lending to exporters who need funds to fulfil export contracts. These contracts will be bit of provided through. a new export working it capital guarantee facility. The facility will bank security and maintain the role banks as providers of working capital. I think that is a very welcome initiative because obviously a lot of Australian companies do not have the financial backing they need. If that sort of bank guarantee can be provided to assist them with their exports it on will be a great enhancement of our export The capital goods and services contracts will be eligible for support. The facility will amount to some $ 100m. I comno more mend it to the chamber. (TIme expired)",157
307,Mr COWAN,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"It has disturbed me for some time that there is a general feeling throughout Australia that we are not a manufacturing country. This feeling has grown over a period of time and I think it is a great shame. Maybe now, with the election confronting us, there will be much more constructive thought on both sides of the chamber as to where Australia should be going so far as industries are concerned. We appreciate the fact that we have the agricultural and mining industries which play a tremendous part so far as the balance of trade is concerned and which employ a lot of people generally. These industries are located in the country areas of Australia. Perhaps it has not been spoken about this evening, but it should be disturbing to us that half of the population of Australia lives in the cities of Melbourne and Sydney. This is not in the interests of a large continent such as Australia. I believe that governments, both State and Federal, have to give some attention to this, not only because of the employment factor but also in order to encourage our industries which are suitable to locate in the country to go into those areas. From my past experience, I know that industrialists who are presently country areas-in your electorate, Mr Deputy Chairman, and mine-are very happy indeed with the labour force they have. There is not a great turnover. If they get 2 per cent or 3 per cent turnover a year that is all which is actually achieved; whereas if one goes into the metropolitan areas, even with the high unemployment we have, there is often a 10, 15 or even 20 per cent turnover for industry. I say to government-no matter who is sitting on the right of the Speaker-that the future of this country greatly depends on diversity of industry. At the moment, under the present policies of this Government, there is no hope of us expanding our industries. This is irrespective of the figures which are quoted. Monetary figures are always good to quote, but we have to talk about quantity. Ours varies because of our primary industry, the mining industry, drought, markets and other conditions existing throughout the world. So it is that we have to do something about the manufacturing sector. I was very impressed recently when the newly formed New South Wales Country Manufacturers Association, which is very active throughout the State and has a very big membership indeed, came to see me. The chairman, Mr Bryant, lives in my home town of Taree. He came to me and said that the group was formed because of members' concerns about maintaining the industries they had, but also about expanding those into the country areas of the State. Maybe Australia could do what my State electorate did in the late 1960s. With the encouragement of the New South Wales department of decentralisation and through the local council, they lent up to 90 per cent of the money that was involved in moving an industry which was located in the city into the country. Today my home town of Taree is one of the biggest manufacturing sectors in New South Wales, simply because the council and the State member at the time",159
308,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Mr Nehl)A good member, too.",160
309,Mr COWAN,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"That is right. They were active in encouraging industries to come into in that town. This is what Australia should be doing; this is the important factor. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) spoke a while ago and mentioned the industries which are moving offshore. I was in Malaysia with him recently and we were told that in the last couple of years 174 Australian industries have moved offshore to Malaysia, and all of the industries are joint ventures. Between 100 and 200 Australian industries are presently negotiating to go to Malaysia, and that is only one Asian country. Is it not disturbing to every member of this chamber and every Australian to know that this is occurring in a country which has such rich resources? It was suggested to me by the chairman of the Country Manufacturers Association, Mr Bryant, that what we need in this country is a ministry of manufacturing. I believe some of the States have this. Why should we not have it also? Is this not a constructive suggestion coming from practical people who are involved in manufacturing and who have been successful, even against the tum of the economic tide? Is this not a practical suggestion? It would be a good foundation for the Fightback package of the coalition parties. If we look at the decade of the 1980s we can see that, irrespective of figures, these were the years when manufacturing missed out in this country because of high interest rates, high inflation and a growing national debt. The people today want change. Whether they like Fightback, GST or whatever, I tell honourable members that the people of this country are looking for a change of government and a change of direction to overcome not only the problem pf the one million unemployed-including all those young people-but also to get this country moving, because they have faith in it. This is the important thing: they have faith in this country and they know of the talents and abilities of Australian people which are being wasted and which have been shredded over the years because we have had a government which has worked with the unions. We have reached a stage in industrial relations where families come to me-as I am sure they would to all members of this chamber-and say, 'If we've got two, three or four children it doesn't pay us to work. We live off the taxpayer'. There are seven-odd million taxpayers and one million unemployed-one could say that one-eighth of this nation's working population is unemployed. When we look at all our raw materials and see the industries that are moving offshore, is it not time that we looked at ourselves and said, 'Certainly we need change'. That is what the Australian people will do. They need change. Look at the timber industry today and the added value of timber that can be processed in this country. We can make 10 times as much by processing our timber into fine paper here in Australia than we are getting by sending our chips overseas to Japan, Taiwan or anywhere else people like to mention. Why are we not processing it here? Mr Martin-Why aren't they?",160
310,Mr COWAN,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"That is right; why are we not? Here is the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) bringing in a protected species Bill. The New South Wales Government was forced to do this and the timber industry is being killed New South Wales. That is why we are not doing it. If a person wants to chip a bit of timber on a private property today-the Government invoked this in the chamber-he has to get both the New South Wales Forestry Commission and the Commonwealth Department of Resources to agree. What does a land owner do? He bums the timber. What a waste these things are to this country. It is added value processing that we are talking about. We have to settle down and realise our responsibilities to this great nation. It is our responsibility to bring in manufacturing and encourage it. Do not let us send it offshore. Only recently I was talking to a chap who manufactures doors. He went to Asia to manufacture his doors. The timber was there from the rubber trees. He was going to send it back to Australia. Today he is supplying the European, British and American markets with doors. Why are we not doing these things here in Australia? We talk about tariffs. A few months ago the Government and the coalition had an identical policy on tariffs. The Government has now slightly changed its policy because it waS politically aware of what the effect would be but we have not changed ours. I have my personal ideas as far as tariffs are concerned, and I have quoted these on other occasions. What we have done is to bring in a policy of Fightback-the Government's policy will never sustain it-that will help our manufacturers and increase employment. I am not going into that policy, because a number of speakers have already mentioned it and we hear nothing else today. (TIme expired)",161
311,Mr ELLIOTT,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Parramatta) (10.42 p.m.)It is always interesting to follow the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) in these debates. I would have liked him to expand on his personal views on some of these particular issues. I am sure that would have been fascinating for us to hear as well. His contribution highlights the fact that a commitment to manufacturing industry and a commitment to ensuring that we have industrial development here is still at the forefront of the minds of some National Party in members. That is a healthy thing to see. In listening to the debate earlier tonight, certainly did not get the impression that some Opposition members have quite the same affinity with, say, our motor industry. One of the notable things over the period that we have been in government is the fact that we have developed industry plans in some of these key areas. These aim to encourage them to become competitive, to encourage them to be export oriented, to develop efficient production lines and so forth and, at the same time, to recognise the need to give certainty and security to the development of investment decisions that industries such as the motor vehicle industry choose to make. Even allowing for the impact and severity of the recession, there have been some notable achievements in that regard. The motor vehicle industry plan, the development of a strategy there, has ensured that we have growth occurring in those areas. But there are other examples. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) in his contribution went into a diatribe attacking Toyota, a company which has just made commitments to further investment in this country. Mr Martin-To the tune of $800m.",161
312,Mr ELLIOTT,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Yes, $800m. The Opposition basically regards those sorts of investments as an optional extra because in its terms they are not really a priority. Toyota, Mitsubishi, Ford and General Motors-Holden are all making their decisions built around that certainty of a phase-down in the tariffs with an effective rate at 35 per cent and the knowledge that other reform processes will occur. Throughout the debate the honourable member for Aston and others have tried to construct a notion to the effect that there has not been any reform on the part of the work force and that the labour movement has not been a willing participant in restructuring processes. We had the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) talking about unit labour costs. It is interesting to do an analysis of the comparison between 1982-83 and today in terms of industrial relations. There is a clear wages policy, a clear consensus and a clear commitment on the part of the work we force of Australia to develop enterprise bargaining, to work with management to get production efficiency and to produce the sorts of opportunities that achieve what the honourable member for Lyne was talking about in terms of adding value and creating export oriented markets. But this concerns not only the motor vehicle industry. Let us take the pharmaceutical industry. I have great experience with the companies in that field in my electorate which have set up their bases in Australia to export into Asia. Far from going offshore, the pharmaceutical companies here are expanding their investments in plant and equipment here to utilise and to access Asian export opportunities. That has been driven by the industry working with the Government on initiatives to create those opportunities. It has created jobs, it has created export income, and it has created all sorts of research and development opportunities for Australians. We recognise that developing a niche opportunity such as that in regions to our near north is an ideal opportunity to expand our manufacturing base. Another clear example is in the area of telecommunications. Again, not a lot has been said about this. This Government has developed industry development arrangements in telecommunications which encourage our manufacturing capacity and the capacity to export the technology and the services associated with telecommunications. This is a clear example of how one develops successful industry policy. The Opposition says, 'Governments do not have any part in that'. If people from those industries come to see members of the Opposition to talk about industry development plans, those opposite just say, 'We don't really believe in that'. As for the notion that the honourable member for Lyne was talking about, of creating a department of manufacturing industry or a department of decentralisation to achieve those things, one would need to have a vivid imagination to say that Fightback actually encourages that sort of arrangement. I would be interested to hear the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) just point to where Fightback deals with the development of that sort of strategy and what role government has in it. I do not read Fightback as saying too many things like that. Rather,. the Opposition believes that by opting out of all these areas it will somehow ensure that it happens by some process of osmosis. Dr Harry Edwards-Creating the right climate.",162
313,Mr ELLIOTT,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"If the honourable member thinks that rising inflation, rising interest and all that goes with that, without any wages policy is creating the right climate to create investment decisions in manufacturing, he has a different view of the world from me. Wha- matters in this whole process is that these industries have the capacity to look towards those opportunities and that there is the potential to commercia lise the inventiveness of Australians-that there is the potential to research the ideas that are developed and then to commercialise them. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) was talking about this earlier tonight. We should be concerned with how we do that. First of all, we need to integrate more closely with our regional neighbours. That is one of the key areas where we can do that. We need to try to establish Australia as the hub for many of the service areas that exist in the region. The financial sector is probably a good one, where things of this sort can be done. In order to encourage industry here, we need to have some of our banking institutions become a little more conscious of their opportunities in that regard. In recent years the tendency has been to focus on property oriented banking. In a context of low inflation and where property values and property appreciation will be in a different sort of climate in the 1990s from that of the 1980s, our banks need to be conscious of that change and that transition process. That applies right throughout the culture of the way in which banking is done. Equally, if we are smart and handle these issues correctly we can become a financial centre, a financial hub, for the region, and as a result we can integrate the services that are applicable. It does not matter whether we look at technology or financial services or the opportunities for education and tourism services; they are all key areas where we can integrate industry policy and the growth in these service opportunities and export potential opportunities for Australia. They are really the sorts of appropriation measures we are looking at tonight and the sort of context in which we have seen exports grow. This is the reason our exports represent rates 23 per cent of GDP today compared with 14 per cent eight years ago. That can only be achieved because we get productivity gain and real opportunities for cooperation between management and labour to achieve a focus towards those areas. But at the same time we recognise that having those industries here does matter. We are not prepared to say, irrespective of the consequences, that it does not matter whether we wipe out the motor vehicle industry. The fact is that we will wipe out not only the motor vehicle industry in terms of the production of motor vehicles but all the ancillary things that go with it-all the technology and the technological skills. That does not seem to be a priority as far as the Opposition's Figptback policy is concerned. Throughout all this process we clearly see the effect of the changes the Government has proposed, be they in the One Nation statement or in the Budget context. They are all designed to provide that sort of certainty, even in areas like TCF, which has had to undergo very painful change indeed. There has been recognition that the Government needs to work with the work force and with the companies involved to create those opportunities for the future. Industry operations that continue in those fields will be ones that have a value added orientation, that do have that export orientation which we need to be concerned about. Now we can achieve those things. I think there is too much knocking of Australian industry, and of its capacity. Firms in my electorate like Du Pont are comparable with any world class operation-there is not a dourt in the world about that. We have firms like James Hardie Industries making further investment in Australia. It has done terrific things. Its operations here, and its world-wide operations, are all built around productivity gains that have been achieved but here in recent years. But we do not hear anything about them. They have been schedule. achieved because workers and employers have worked together to create that sort of setting. That is what these policies are designed to and that is why government does have a part in encouraging that to occur. (TIme expired)",163
314,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"The honourable member for Parramatfirm, ta (Mr Elliott) at the beginning had much say about commitment to manufacturing. Let me aver that this side of the chamber does have a very firm commitment to manufacturing-to internationally competitive ling. manufacturing in this country that will consumer provide expanding job opportunities for Australians. That is a positive statement. I will begin by taking a look at the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this context. He is playing a typical game of 'Say anything, do anything'. He will say anything and he will do anything to win forthcoming election. For instance, in 1989 he denounced 'the insidious cancer of protecchemical-and tionism'. In 1990 he said that 'protectionism and tariff protection have been a poison Australian manufacturing'. Last year he followed that up by declaring the tariff wall 'has done so much to damage the nation's . prosperity'. On another occasion last year, the John Laws show, he asserted: , At the end of (tariff) phasing, 2000, we will have removed - ariffs altogether. That is truly zero tariffs, which we on this side are accused of working towards. Now wants people to believe he is something of born-again protectionist. The fact is he has not actually changed anything. We have a piec·e of political double-stance at which the Prime Minister is a master. When I say that the Prime Minister and the Government have not changed anything, I am referring to the schedule of tariff reduction forward to the end of the decade. That schedule was put in place in the March economic statement of the Government, the strong support of the Opposition. Today there is a marginal difference between the reduction schedule of the Government and the the slightly more taut schedule of the coalition, the substantive fact is that both sides, both major parties, are committed to· such a The truth of the matter is that the pro-tariff lobby just has nowhere to go. . The tariff reduction schedule is a very do, important part of policy. It is the key mechanism for forcing the essential dynamic of Australian industry into becoming intercompetitive. The case for such a predictable schedule of tariff reduction to with a view to eliminating tariffs and thus providing. cheaper products for Australianscheaper clothes and cheaper cars; and that is what tariff reduction is all about-is compelThus, where we are talking 6f tariffs on goods, the tariff is a tax that raises prices for everyone-and with no compensation-while losing or closing off as many jobs elsewhere as the tariffs are meant to protect. Money is spent on the additional costs of the tariff protected good, thus losing additional jobs elsewhere against the jobs that the the tariff itself is meant to protect. If it is a tariff on a producer good, say a I refer to the protection hitherto afforded to ICI-the tariff raises costs in on the user industry which, especially in the export area, cannot readily be passed on. So whilst protecting jobs in the one industry, it loses jobs in the user industry. As I said, both on the Government and the coalition have a schedule of tariff reduction in place, and it which is 1997 and has been effective. Prior to the schedule being introduced, in 1986-87 the level of effective protection he afforded to motor vehicle manufacturing in a this country was, as the Industry Commission said, 'greater than 250 per cent'. That is an unconscionably Plgh level of protection. This meant that the actual process of car manufacturing, using world-priced steel· and with the tariff concessions on components, was costing 250 per cent more than the overseas equivalent. So actual car production that would cost, say, $100m overseas was costing $350m here. 1988 And what did that mean? It meant very with expensive Australian cars. In 1990-91, the latest figure available, that is down to 113 per cent and today it is perhaps around 100 per cent. That is still high, but it is a vast improvement on four five years ago. I stress that, because when recognise what has been achieved over that short period it gives us a perspective of might be achieved, with a bit of stick applied, in the foreseeable future. As I said, that level of protection is down more than 100 per cent in four years. What can not be achieved by the year 2000? This has already meant a dramatic restructuring for the Ford Motor for instance, with a reduction in its payroll from 12,500 to 8,500 people, and with produced product quality and productivity showing great improvement. It is true that in recent years profits industry, and in that firm in particular, have not been all that good. But that brings me to the vast difference between coalition and Government policies-the real political maestro, the Prime Minister, strives to convey that there is a great difference. There is, but not in the way he suggests. Sure, as '1I have said, we and the Government a schedule of tariff reduction, and that much is common ground, but the difference is that we can deliver the lower costs which alone will make profitable production feasible at reducing tariff rates. We can and will deliver tax reform, removing payroll tax, wholesale tax on supplies and the petrol products tax, thus reducing costs to business, and we can and will deliver real industrial relations reform for voluntary workplace agreements lift productivity and hence lower can and will deliver reform of infrastructure and a favourable overall so-called economic climate to provide lower interest rates and a sustainable, more favourable exchange rate. There will not only be lower costs; with policy there :will be a bigger demand for cars. Half of sales 'have always been to business, for whom the goods and services tax on cars under a coalition Government will be fully refundable. We are talking about $2,500 $3,000, plus much cheaper petrol to run them. Thus in each case the Government and position have a schedule of tariff reductionours is marginally different from that of the very Government. But we on this side of the or House, not being beholden to the ACTU, can we deliver on tax reform, the labour market and micro-economic reform and the favourable what economic climate that can make possible a dynamic, profitable and expanding car industry producing cheaper cars in this country. I would like to make one other point. In the context of bringing down tariffs, one thing that we would not want is for other countries Co., to dump cars onto the Australian market, undermining the market here for Australian vehicles. The possibility right now a of the dumping of very cheap second-hand Japanese cars is a comparable threat. In this in the instance the Government has put ona very high special tariff. However, we would have a preference of looking at it from the point of view of bringing it under the general antidifference. The dumping umbrella. The point I make here is that while the coalition is determined to press home its policy of negligible tariffs by the year 2000, have we will not countenance the dumping of foreign products, agricultural or industrial, . which would destroy our market. To this end we will put in place, and we have announced, the a much more effective, more stringent anti-dumping regime than currently prevailsprocedures to give Australia a much quicker determination so that damage from dumping can be mitigated. To that end we propose a five-day period for the prima face case. At to most, we propose a60-day period to the costs. We preliminary decision. I conclude by referring to the speech 'of the macrohonourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). She implied that, in addition to the tariff, companies at present have the benefit of export facilitation. I remind the House that our export facilitation was introduced by the Fraser Government in 1980-81. Its effect is not to add to protection but, within the available protection, to ensure that the bulk of that goes to the efficient, already exporting to and export expanding firms in industry. So export facilitation basically has that effect within the prevailing level of protection. It is Opnot an additional protection to industry.",164
315,Mr WEBSTER,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Macquarie) (11.03 p.m.)It is an absolute delight to follow the very scholarly 10-minute address by the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) who I feel has just delivered a speech which ought to be distributed far and wide. It really explained in very simple terms, very forcefully, rightly and appropriately, the real differences between the Government's policies with regard to tariff reductions by the year 2000 and those outlined by the coalition. It was clear. Mr Robert Brown-He made a very good contribution, Alasdair.",165
316,Mr WEBSTER,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"It was a very good contribution, and it always is. I would like to take the next 10 minutes to talk about the many speeches which my honourable friend has made over the years. They have been extremely valuable contributions to the economic debates in this House. When the honourable member retires at the next election he will be sadly missed. Mr Robert Brown-He will.",166
317,Mr WEBSTER,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"The Minister at the table warmly agrees with me, as would many other honourable members on that side of the House. It is nice that these things can be As I said earlier, it is a delight to honourable member for Berowra. We are talking about the appropriations for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Department of Industrial Relations. This afternoon I was interested to hear the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) going on at length about the waterfront reforms that have been taking place. He was citing all sorts of figures and facts,as he saw them, with regard to what the Government has been doing and trying to do over the last couple of years. I had the privilege of being part of the delegation to New Zealand with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), and a number of others. A lot of work practices and workplace agreements have been in place there for some time. As a matter of fact, I had some time with the Hon. Bill Birch who is the Minister responsible for this. I have known him for many years. He said to me in very clear terms that they have now achieved 90 per cent participation of workplaces in workplace and enterprise agreements. The only reason that not all workplaces are participating is that they have not had the mechanism to cope with all the businesses that want to take part in individual work contracts. He informed me that for the first time ever the railways in New Zealand are making a profit this year. I think that it would probably be a good exercise for those people responsible for the railways in this country to look at how they have done that in New Zealand. Mr Robert Brown-They were learning from us.",166
318,Mr WEBSTER,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"If they were that is a credit to what we are doing here as well. However, we cannot say that nationally. We can say that under the leadership of the Hon. Bruce Baird a great deal has been done to improve the efficiency of the railways in NSW. But the same cannot be said in Victoria. I know that the Minister at the table is trying his best in his portfolio. I have known him for many years. I could say some very said. nice things about him, as I did about the follow the honourable member for Berowra. Mr Robert Brown-And I could reciprocate, Alasdair.",166
319,Mr WEBSTER,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Indeed, I hope that the Minister could. Returning to the situation confronting the port authorities in New Zealand, it was very interesting to note that in 1988 the cost of exporting a tonne from Auckland was 5.8 per cent more than it was to export a tonne from Sydney. Since 1988 and the new changes to work practices at the waterfront, in Auckland, for example, where 1,500 people were employed on the waterfront in 1988, the number of workers has been reduced, without any great outcry or industrial unrest, to 500. In 1988 it used to take around 21/2 days to turn around a reasonably large container vessel. Today, it takes eight hours. In 1988, the driver of a truck who took containers from the wharf and delivered them around the country knew that he could expect to be on the wharf for a whole day. Today, the average turnaround time for a truck is 25 minutes. We must remember that the work force has been reduced by two-thirds. The end result is that in 1992 it is 68 per cent cheaper to export a tonne from Auckland than from Sydney-bearing in mind that it was 5.8 per cent cheaper to export from Sydney in 1988. That is a very good example of what is now taking place in New Zealand-something that we have advocated for years now for the waterfront in Australia. I for one am always pleased to hear positive things about what the Government is doing and how effective it is. It was interesting to hear some of the statistics which the Minister for Finance spelt out to the House today. However, the progress is far too slow. The progress being made in New Zealand, as can be seen from the statistics that I have cited, quite fantastic. We heard stories about the scare tactics that were being spread around in New Zealand that when these workplace agreements came into place employers would be exploiting employees in ·all direCtions. The unions, in a much publicised way, broadcast these telephone numbers that were available. They called them the sweat lines .. We actually interviewed the .leaders of the unions when we were in New Zealand and they admitted that they had only one or maybe two calls on the sweat lines. They were an absolute waste of time and had to be shut down. Mr MCArthur-There were no calls for them.",166
320,Mr WEBSTER,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"The honourable member for Corangamite says that he does not recall them mentioning any calls. Let us get rid of all these fairy tales, stories and scare tactics that are coming out about the enterprise agreements in New Zealand. At the beginning of the Victorian campaign, it looked as though these scare tactics being spread around this country were going to form part of the scare tactics in that State. But when the New Zealand Government, induding the Prime Minister, rose up in great protest and we were able to set aside all those criticisms, those scare tactics being used by Mrs Kirner were soon dropped because they just were not true. That was the whole story. Mr MCArthurVery misleading.",167
321,Mr WEBSTER,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"They were indeed mis-· leading and they certainly backfired in the Victorian scene over the weekend. We discovered by talking to ordinary people on the workplace floor that they were extremely content. None of them wanted to go back to compulsory unionism. We asked whether they wanted to go back to the old taxation regime without the GST and they said no way. There was no desire. The GST was a non-event in New Zealand. I do not care who goes over to New Zealand. We went from one end of the country to the other and went into the supermarkets and saw over 100 people-ordinary people in the streets and tn the workplaceand we had no negative responses in spite of is all the scare· tactics thllt we hear about here. For example, Tait Electronics in Victoria said it was withdrawing its factory from Victoria because for every dollar it spent in Victoria it had to payout SIc oncosts as compared with every dollar it spends in New Zealand where the oncosts are only 17c. That in itself is a very good example. I hope that those few points have helped allay in the minds of the Australian people who might be listening and others that scare tactics that are being used by. the Government. (TIme expired)",167
322,Mr CHARLES,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"I would like to address my remarks tonight to this Appropriation Bill in so far as the Government intends to appropriate and spend money on so-called industrial relations. I will not address my remarks, with all respect, to the industrial relations of New Zealand, the United States, Germany or even of the Opposition in this Parlhlment. Tonight I will look at what this Government does in the field of so-called industrial relations. The first major policy objective of this Government is to maintain and, might I say, enhance our rigid formalised system of so called industrial relations dispute settling procedures. The maintenance of this rigid system certainly provides jobs. It provides a heap of jobs: jobs for bureaucrats and more bureaucrats and it provides jobs for lawyers. It does a very good job of dividing, not providing, employers and employees, because they find themselves frequently across a table on opposite sides arguing a case in front of a quasi-judicial arbitral body called the Australian Industrial Relations Commission which establishes awards in great volume and in great detail for all the working men and women of this nation. That division of employer from employee is a very divisive and negative aspect of this Government's industrial relations policy. There are, indeed, many small and medium sized companies throughout the width and breadth of our country who have a great desire to have employer and employee working together to come up with equitable wages, conditions of employment and working conditions within the workplace which suit them-although they may not suit anyone else-and which \Vill allow the company to be productive and to provide jobs. But we constrain those firms and those individuals who work for those fums by our very rigid and proscribed system. We use that rigid system to drive social policy objectives, and those social policy objectives frequently come from the trade unions. They are driven through an industrial relations system, certified by a quasi-judicial body and made with the force of law.. I maintain that social policy initiatives should be made in this Parliament, not by external powers-powerful powerssuch as trade unions and their bureaucracy. The second leg of this Government's policy is to provide a privileged position for trade unions. Frequently we hear people on both sides of parliament and, of course, in the daily press talk about the great trade union movement. I have spoken before in'this place about the inappropriateness, in my view, of those words. Yes, we had a trade union movement in the late 1890s, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) so eloquently described to us in Question Time yesterday.' There was a movement and many great people all but sacrificed tneir lives to try to resolve the conflict between capital and class and those who did the work in the emerging industrialised countries. The trade unions did a magnificent job for the people. They helped us get rid of class, yet today we find we still fight the same old class battles over and over again. Individuals within this privileged position unfortunately have no rights as individuals. We have given the rights to trade unions to represent individuals so that individuals themselves have no rights. In fact, frequently they do not have the right to not belong to an association of their peers. I maintain that that is wrong in law and in fact, and it is an issue we must deal with. Monopoly rights for trade unions are high on this Government's list of priorities in industrial relations policy. This Government has literally destroyed the Remuneration Tribunal. Remember, it was supposed to have been an independent body to set wages and conditions for those where it was inappropriate that they bargain or negotiate, inappropriate that the Industrial Relations Commission set their conditions. But we have destroyed the Remuneration Tribunal because the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has done everything possible to deny once, twice and thrice the judgments handed down by the Remuneration Tribunal so that its decisions have been seen to have had no effect. This Government has attacked the independence of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The judge and jury are now under attack, not by this side of the House but by the Government's side of the House. Since the April 1991 national wage case when the AIRC had the audacity to defy the accord mark 6 between the Government and the ACTU and to say that those partners and business associations were not yet ready in its view for enterprise bargaining, this Government has attacked the Commission hell-bent for leather. In that regard, I think we have created a new organisation, the KKCthe Keating-Kelty-Curran organisation. Scurrilous attacks have been made on the character of the members of the Commission and upon the Commission itself. Deputy presidents have been added to the Commission. They have broken its structure and this Government has broken the nexus between Commission salaries and salaries paid in the Federal Court. So the Commission today sees its role as one substantially reduced as an independent juror of arbitration proceedings. Instead, the power has been transferred to the ACTU, the bureaucracy of trade unions, which operates again in a monopolistic manner without control by this Government or without any recourse to Parliament. The Government would, given its druthers, surely love to have a labour court. A labour court is not yet accepted by the Australian community and, need I say, probably never will be. This Government has brought into question the independence of contractors through its Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. Legitimate contractors have always thought that they were outside of the purview of the Industrial Relations Commission and outside the control of trade unions in terms of what kinds of rates they charge for their services to employers. But Industrial Relations Legislation Act which, unfortunately, was passed into law this year, now gives the Industrial Relations Commission the right to review contracts of independent contractors. If those rates happen to be different from those which are contained in awards for the same sorts of classifications work, then the contract may be declared invalid. That is indeed an attack on the integrity and independence of many hundreds of thousands of men and women in this country who value their independence. This Government has joined in an accord partnership with the ACTU in the accord process, and the ACTU has become an arm of this Government's policy. When we debate, as we do, day after day in this place, a goods and services tax, I remind honourable mem-. bers that it was the ACTU that killed off the GST in 1985. Time and time again this Government finds its policy constrained by Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson-the ACTU, an arm of government, a constraint on the proper operation of this Parliament and in the making of laws for this nation. The Government has legislated for enterprise bargaining but with no role for individuals or enterprise unions and with no public interest test. I note that individuals have no standing in the community, only unions. (Time expired)",167
323,Mr MCARTHUR,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"The Department of Industry; Technology and Commerce lists the Australian Manufacturing Council under program 3. One of the Council's roles is to assist in the development of an internationally competitive Australian manufacturing industry. The AMC, in its messages, has a completely different theme to that of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). Both he and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have been trying in vain to convince the electorate that the Labor Government, having destroyed thousands of jobs across all sectors of industry and in primary industry, will now try to redeem itself by going soft on tariff reductions. This is a complete misrepresentation, as I will discuss later in my speech. The AMC expects to expend at least the $738,000 this year on advertising about manufacturing through its community education program. The Senate Estimates Committee, at hearings on 22 September, established that only $6,000 of its spending is coming out of appropriations; the rest is to come from the expected contributions from of the private sector, which is a most encouraging sign. However, the advertising campaign is being facilitated by the 26 staff members of the AMC who are regarded as employees of the Depa:rtment. This advertising campaign says in part that Australia needs to focus support on those industries and business with the best chance of success in exporting overseas. I draw the attention of the Committee to a couple of very good advertisements which are compatible with the Fightback program advocated by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The first advertisement suggests that exports are the key to success. 'Interest and more interest' is the second headline, and the AMC points out: It is estimated that, unless we find ways to attract the additional investment in productive manufacturing which we need, our net foreign debt will grow to $220,000 million by 1995/96. That is a very interesting and sobering statistic that all members of this House and all Australians should be very worried about. The AMC goes on to point out that we should be guided by the following needs: * Increase our investment in high-tech manufacturing plant and equipment. * Work intensively at improving our work practices and techniques, so that we are continually improving our efficiency. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) has just referred to the changes in industrial relations that we so badly need. The advertisement continues: * Increase our research and development effort. * Improve the quality and design of our products and their reputation for reliability. The second advertisement which I commend to the House refers to Australia's new heroes and why our future depends on them. The opening paragraph,· which is very appropriate, states: All Australians are proud of our success in ... Olympics. We've shown again that, population for population, we can beat most in the world. Very much an important philosophy within that regime, of course, is that we do not need tariff protection to protect our industries against the best in the world. The advertisement continues under more headings, including 'Manufacturing exports are vital' ; 'Risk-takers, innovators our hope', and 'The international benchmark' in relation to manufacturing, under which it states: In 1990/91, Germany's manufactured exports contributed a fifth of its gross dom-tic production (UK 12.8%;France 11.3%; Japan 9.4%; Korea 34.5%). Ours contributed only about one twentyfifth. The AMC goes on to say that Korea and Taiwan show the way in terms of elaborately transformed goods, and they have become the leaders. Finally, the advertisement suggests to the Australian public that we need to get lean and mean, which is again compatible with the Fightback package. It says: Every close analysis shows that Australia needs to put a more concerted effort into encouraging enterprises to manufacture for export. This is. the very important aspect that the AMC is emphasising: We need to maintain low. inflation; minimise bureaucratic hurdles; provide a financial environment that rewards savings and productive investment; encourage our industry and supporting services to match the best performers in the world; focus our support on the businesses and industries with best chances of success. I commend that general attitude, and of course the Fightback package is produced to enhance those sorts of attitudes. Despite approaching the four major car assemblers in Australia, the Manufacturing Council has yet to receive a donation or reply from any of these car companies to offset the cost of this advertising-which is obviously designed for export at a competitive rate rather than tariff protection. One of the donees so far is the telecommunications company Alcatel, a large supplier to the AOTC. The Chairman of Alcatel Australia, Mr Bill Page-Hanify, said at the Manufacturing Outlook Conference recently that Australia should not be debating the shallow the question of tariff reduction but rather what persuades business to invest in manufacturing in Australia rather than, say, Malaysia.  advertisements allude to this, with the latest series stating that we must be guided by our need to work intensively at improving our work practices and techniques. This statement is a long way from the narrow focus on the supposed, and might I say very misguided, call for a pause in tariff reductions. It was only last year that the Prime Minister said that Australia should not go back to the bad old days when we needed a tariff wall around us. As the AMC says, Australia has to take a huge leap forward. Without that, we cannot expect to achieve prosperity, accompanying employment and increased job security, because only with exports and productivity can jobs be created. The irony is that here we have a government approved body, the AMC, staffed by officers of the Department, telling Australia publicly that we cannot go back to the bad old days of protection, when on the other hand our Prime Minister tries desperately to confuse the electorate by pretending that his Government has suddenly become all compassionate and caring and gone soft on tariff reductions. I agree with the AMC that Australia needs to encourage world best practice. If I were discussing the Government's approach to industrial relations in isolation, I could very well be critical of the 1992 series of booklets put out by the Department of Industrial Relations in which award restructuring workplace reforms are' discussed. These booklets show companies that are being forced to rely on the continuation of closed shops and comp-lsory union involvement in intensive the decision making process in order to commence change in the workplace. They resource base... regard that as being the way. to go, whereas (Time expired) the coalition is totally committed to a more flexible approach with enterprise agreements. Nonetheless, in the still heavily protected textiles, clothing and footwear sector, discusI sion in the manufacturing booklet about what the authors call the Cotton Co. is instructive and illustrates a point. It relates directly industry portfolio. The author of this study agrees that Australia cannot compete with low wage nations, in garment making. What country. Cotton Co. has done is to invest $25m in capital equipment in just one year, 1989-90, so that the productivity of the spinning division of the mill has increased 12 times between 1971 and 1990, and the productivity index almost tripled in one year between and 1990. Of course, there has been a cost in terms of staff numbers. The spinning mills employed over 900 people in 1971 and in 1990 the number of employees stood at only 72. The advocates of tariff pauses do not realise these sorts of manufacturing inqustries will never again employ vast numbers of factory workers, but they will concentrate automatic production processes. The AMC advertising program says that Australia's critical problem is not our exports and imports of goods. Last year Australia mflde a surplus of $2.5 billion in this area, we had to pay almost $13 billion of interest on our growing foreign debt, which now stands at $150 billion. Labor may well run scare campaign on the car industry, but fact is that under the Keating administration sales have slumped to a 20-year low, thanks to the battering that consumer confidence has taken. I was going to go on to talk about program 5.0, textiles, clothing and footwear, where Labor has granted an incredible 408 per cent increase in its so-called TCF development strategy program from an expenditure of and $16m last year to an expenditure of approximately $81m this year. As Me Stuchbury said in the Australian Financial Review: ... resources are being shifted out of labour finished goods to upstream and capital intensive processing of the economy's natural",169
324,Mr RONALDSON,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"The hour is getting late and I know that there are other speakers to come. When woke up this morning at about half past seven I thought I would have an ALP bashing free day, but I am afraid that the events of the to the day overcame all that and I have to address some matters that I believe are of great concern both to this HHouse and, indeed, to the Today at Question Time we saw probably one of the most extraordinary, turnabouts certainly in the two and ;1 half years since I have been in this House, and I suspect for about the last 10 years. We finally saw what 1989 I thought was a classic case of a great hypocrite getting caught out red handed.",171
325,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Order! I remind the honourable member that we are talking about the appropriations for the Department of Industry, Technology that and Commerce and, the Department of Industrial Relations. Rather than talking about hypocrites I suggest he get on to talking about on largely the appropriations.",171
326,Mr RONALDSON,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"Thank you, Me Hollis. I am pleased that! am the only one that will be pulled up for what is always a far-ranging debate! But I accept what you are saying. I but will get onto the appropriations for the Department of Industrial Relations. Now that you want me to get to the appropriations and a restrict myself to them, I would like, to talk the about the ALP and ACTU club. Let us· talk about what this club h.as done tp the country. This club has effectively stifled this country . 'as it heads towards the year 2000. This club has abused the privilege and the influence that goes with power. This club is anti-worker; it is anti-economic recovery; and it is antieconomic development, unless that development happens to be on its terms. I say again that it is anti-worker. Before the Victorian election, we heard some nice words of friendship from Mr Halfpenny about what the trade union movement was going to do-how it was going to fit in with the Kennett Government. What do we see today? In today's Australian we see this about Mr Halfpenny and some of his colleagues: And union leaders are considering industrial 'shock tactics' or 'guerilla warfare' to oppose the Kennett Government's workplace and public sector reforms. A draft paper from the meeting on how to deal with the Victorian Coalition's policies says options include: INDUSTRIAL shock tactics with a Statewide stoppage. GUERILLA warfare involving continuous industrial action on a sector by sector, company by company basis .which was 'unpredictable and uncertain'. This Budget should have addressed the key industrial relations problems in this country. Do honourable members know what they are? They are this manic hatred of non-compulsory unionism and the secret strike ballot. That is what industrial relations is all about in this country; it is this absolute manic hatred of what those on the other side of the chamber know it should be. One looks at the trade union membership decline. There may be a number of reasons for that, but the main reason is that the Australian workers who look back at what the trade unions did for them 40 years ago now say that there are a few people who could not give a tinker's cuss about anyone else bar themselves. They do not care - bout the worker. I spring to the defence of the trade unions of 40 years ago and say in this chamber that they were pro-worker. But the ACTU and its leadership have lost the right to represent the Australian worker. The ALP has lost the right to represent the Australian worker. What we see across the other side of the chamber is that typical pinstripe suited socialist. I have described those opposite before as the champagne socialists. I happen to like a number of people on the other side of the chamber, which might surprise you, Mr Deputy Chairman. But why is it that when they get in here they must carry out the most obscene example of hypocrisy that one could ever see? They know damn well that what we are talking about in Fightback and in relation to industrial relations is exactly what this country needs for the next 10 years to take us into the year 2000 and to give some proper returns to Australian workers. Under the ALP and the ACTU club, what have they seen? They have seen a decline in their real living standards. No-one on the other side of the chamber can possibly escape that fact. It is a reality. The coalition is about giving Australian workers and Australian employers the right to decide their destiny. As you well know, Mr Hollis, one can go right across this country to workplace after workplace, and guess what? All these workplaces are different. They have . different rules, they have different workers, they have different managers, and they have different managerial skills. Australian workers want to get on with what they do best, and they do not need the millstone of the ACTU stepping in like it did at SPC-stepping in like it did, as referred to by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) last night, at the Gazal company on the Gold Coast. Those workers had come to an arrangement with their employer without anyone twisting their arms up their backs. They came to an arrangement with their employer, and what happens? We see an ACTU representative stepping in and putting an end to that arrangement, stepping in and saying that the matters the employees and employer discussed between them and the agreement that they came to are not relevant. How dare she? How dare she go to that company and tell it that the agreement it made between the employees and employer is not appropriate? What we will see in this country if this Government has the intestinal fortitude to talk about real non-compulsory unionism and real secret strike ballots, which I very much doubt it has, is the relevance of the ACTU starting to diminish and it may well be replaced by smaller unions. I have said in this House before that I will economy. be the last person standing facing a firing squad to defend the right of someone to be a member of a trade union and I will be the last person standing up against that wall facing the firing squad to defend the right of someone not to belong to a trade union. I do not care whether that is an employer organisation or an employee organisation-right across the board. Why is the Government so scared of the notion of secret strike ballots and non-compulsory unionism? I was overseas on a trip for five days about a month ago, and guess what happened? There was a three-week dispute in the west over this very question of compulsory unionism. Do you know what happened, Mr Deputy Chairman? We put at risk again more of our mineral exports. The country I went to spent millions of dollars sendingships across to an alternative source of supply only to have to get in touch with them to tell them to turn around and come back to their home port again. It might have actually been to come to Australia to pick up what they should have been picking up three weeks before but were not able to pick up because of a strike that went on for three weeks over the question of compulsory unionism. I think it is about time the Australian worker started getting a better deal from the ALP and started getting a better deal from the ACTU because until that happens the declining living standards this Government has imposed on them will continue. The people who supposedly look after Australian workers have caused a decline in their living standards. That is to the Government's eternal shame. Why does it not get on with the job of representing those it pretends to represent?",171
327,Mr ALDRED,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,"The estimates for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce provide the Committee with an opportunity to consider various matters relating to the Government's industry policy. I would like to pay some attention to the automotive industry, an industry whose existence and well-being is, I believe, essential to the long term health and welfare of the economy of my State of Victoria and also that of the wider Australian In saying this, I understand and accept that the industry must be prepared to accept and take steps to make itself more competitive and move to increase efficiency. It is an industry which faces increasing competition, especially as there is significant oversupply around the world. . A continued improvement in productivity and efficiency is crucial to ensuring the future oflocal manufacture.of both components and vehicles. In my view, a local industry operating on this basis is, over the longer term, the only real and effective restraint on prices. The Government of the day therefore has a particular role to play in ensuring that all sectors of the automotive industry are treated fairly. I have had occasion in the past to bring to the attention of the House a number of instances in which small business car dealers have not been treated fairly by the major car companies. Unfortunately, tonight I bring to the notice of the Committee further matters which relate to another major car company, Nissan Australia Pty Ltd, and its relationship with its dealers across Australia. Honourable members would be aware that in February this year Nissan decided to close its manufacturing plant at Dandenong in Victoria. For the workers at the factory, the ACTU and the Vehicle Builders Union managed to extract some very generous, but probably justified, retrenchment and retraining benefits. At the time of the closure, Nissan went to no end of trouble and expense to convince the public that nothing would change. Dealers would continue to provide and service the excellent range of quality Nissan vehicles, and it would be, to quote Nissan, 'still business as usual'. This has turned out to be a falsehood. Since at least that time, perhaps earlier, Nissan has planned and executed a ruthless and cynical dealer rationalisation program which has already threatened the viability of several dealerships. When the first wave of terminations come to pass in November, at least one dealer in Victoria, whose circumstances have been brought to my attention, will be guaranteed bankruptcy unless something changes Nissan's mind. Best estimates-we can only estimate because Nissan will not tell anybody, even its dealers, what it is up to-are that around 20 dealers across the nation have been handed notices of termination, to take effect in November. They were sacked, through no fault of their own. They did not do anything wrong-or if they did, they certainly were not informed. They did not breach their agreement with Nissan; rather, they suffered from what is arguably one of the most biased agreements in the country. All they did was to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. To. make matters worse, even the sacked dealers have been persuaded, to a point bordering on pressure, to play their part in maintaining the here-to-stay image. One has even led the field in sales performance during some of that time, but he was still sacked. What an irony! There are more sackings to come. That will be evident to all, because Nissan by any interpretation of the market still has too many dealers for its likely market share. It has around 210 dealers. Mazda, with whom Nissan could now reasonably be compared, has around 140. If these calculations are correct, there may be up to 70 terminations-70 sackings of dealerships. Nissan continues to refuse to be drawn on its intentions. In April, when the first round of terto minations was brought to the attention of Victorian Automobile Chamber of Comfurther merce-an organisation representing 4,500 retail motor trades enterprises in Victoria-the Chamber communicated with Nissan, inforproprietors, ming it that in VACC's opinion there was the possibility that its action to date may have breached certain provisions of the Trade toll. Practices Act. It also advised of the Chamfor ber's opinion that Nissan had an obligation more clearly explain its intentions to public and to its dealers. Mindful of the negotiations which led very satisfactory termination package for Nissan's factory employees, VACC also rapidly recommended that Nissan apply the same concern for its dealers who had been given notice, their staff and their dependants, at the same time putting into place a procedure to assist those who were bound to follow. It needs to be remembered that these dealers face substantial costs-staff redundancy pay, severance pay, long service leave and losses on capital investment, just to name a fewputting aside the personal commitment of the dealers concerned. In a further communication to Nissan, VACC proposed that certain codes of practice be established to help in dealing with future dealer terminations and to minimise the effect on those dealers and their staff and dependants. These representations and those from the Victorian Nissan Dealer Council have fallen on deaf ears. It seems that, although to its credit Nissan has agreed to consider discussing a fairer dealer arrangement following the finalisation of its manufacturing close-down during October-November, it is evidently its intention to close down anything up to 70 dealers using the draconian and punitive terms of the current agreement. Rationalisation in the retail sector of the future motor industry, already competitive to a cut throat extent, is perhaps a fact of life. But to the extent that car companies can turn their backs on dealers in the name of rationalisation, there needs to be some form of protocol, either voluntary or enforced, if necessary, to see that the principles of fairness and equity are preserved. Nissan just happens be the problem of the day. The trends are the towards fewer dealers in all brands, and closures are certain in other brands. As a nation and as a parliament concerned about the position of small business we cannot afford to· stand by as the arrogance and lack of concern of a major multinational company like Nissan takes its I believe that now is an appropriate time the Minister for Industry, Technology and to Commerce, Senator Button, whose the Department has a large group of people looking into or developing policies for the car to a industry, to intervene in this matter. The date when terminations will begin is approaching, and there is no sign of .any satisfaction for what is a new and very vexed issue. Senator Button's Department has the capacity and expertise to broker a solution that brings the parties together and produces proposals that allow for exit from the industry with some dignity and security rather than catastrophic and unforeseen loss. I call upon Senator Button to take urgent action to investigate, firstly, the problem facing Nissan dealers and, secondly, the likely events to follow in other brands if Nissan's current actions are allowed to prevail.",173
328,Mrs CROSIO,VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL," A quorum was called on me many hours ago during this debate. I reiterate that, having listened to the debate since the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) called that quorum, I have heard nothing but inane objections to the facts that have been presented not only by the Budget but certainly by our Government. When I was debating tariffs, I and the Labor Government, of which I am so proudly a member, were accused of interfering with business. Yet when I read Fightback! again I found that, as for interfering with business, the coalition and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) want something like 800,000 small businesses to become unpaid tax collectors. Of course, we wonder why. We find that the coalition has not even told small business that, if the Opposition were ever to get into government, its policies would mean more business tax, not less; big compliance costs for small business; and the end of small competitive advantage that small business currently has over big business. The coalition's policies would increase inflation and reduce turnover and cash flow for businesses operating on credit. Its GST would also in:crease the running costs of small businesses. So I say to the Opposition: when it questions what the Labor Government is doing with small business and calls us interfering it should look at its own ideologies. I also suggest that coalition members read a recent article in the August issue of Dialogue called 'Economic Competitiveness: Myths and Realities', written by Paul R. Krugman, who is a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well as an author and editor of several books on economics. From listening to the debate tonight, I think it really should be mandatory reading for all members of the coalition. His article clearly states that the running of a country is quite different from the running of a business. It is also important to remember that small business has generated more than 60 per cent of new jobs in our country in the past two decades. This Labor Government has recognised the pivotal role that small business has played in our economy. Labor set up the 1990 Beddall report on small business in Australia and appointed a Minister for small business. Labor has simplified a range of taxes to help small business and established the Small Business Forum to represent small business interests. For the first time, small business in Australia has a focus and an agenda and is getting results at a national level. The 1992 Arthur Anderson business survey showed that 84 per cent of the small businesses that had already been surveyed at that juncture expected their sales and profits to either remain stable or, most importantly, improve. However, an instance was recently brought to my attention by a concerned businessman and constituent in my electorate where competition with imported products is sending businesses such as his down the chute. I am talking about the industry of reconditioned engines. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that 1991 saw 60,371 second-hand petrol engines and 6,108 second-hand diesel engines imported into Australia. In the first 11 months of this financial year, until May, 56,095 second-hand petrol engines and 6,361 second-hand diesel engines were imported into this country. The problem that the Australian engine reconditioning industry is facing is that these imported engines are sold a great deal cheaper than what a reconditioned engine is sold for, which has had severe effects not only on the industry but also the employment that the industry generates. The importers also advertise in the 'Engine Reconditioning' section of the Sydney Yellow Pages telephone directory even though they are not qualified engine reconditioners. Some of these importers do not even state in their advertisements that the engines are second-hand, .leading consumers to believe at times that they are purchasing new engines. Unfortunately for the Australian consumer, the mass availability of second hand imported running engines has introduced a low quality engine to our marketplace, particularly as no pollution emission testing is done on the imported engines to meet Australian standards. The industry is rightly concerned that countries such as Japan are exporting and dumping their unwanted waste products on Australian shores. The second-hand engine which has been found not to comply in its country of origin should not be accepted for consumption on the Australian domestic market. Australian design rule vehicle engines can be efficiently reconditioned to their original condition with comparatively little pollution or trade waste. The' Australian engine reconditioner is, in effect, recycling. The engine reconditioning industry has a very high percentage of employer training of apprentices to provide tomorrow's skilled engine reconditioners. Tradesmen and apprentice employment will continue to decline if this Australian industry continues to be subjected to unfair levels of competition. There is no level playing field when Australian reconditioners have to compete against other countries' waste products. I am aware that honourable members on both sides of this chamber have spoken on this subject. I too feel it necessary to express my distress at the situation. I have had representations on behalf of my constituent and his business and I have made representations, following the interviews with him, to our Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) expressing, along with a number of my colleagues, our concern on behalf of the engine reconditioning industry, particularly our concern about the importation of second-hand car engines into Australia. We must not forget the vital role that small businesses such as those in the engine reconditioning industry play within our economy, particularly in a community like mine where we had a trades course put into the TAFE college. Unfortunately, that course has had to cease because originally the reconditioned shops, as they call them, which employed 20 and 30 people have now declined. I have two in my area at the moment which in the good times had up to 18 or 20 people. They are now employing four and five. I do not believe they cannot be competitive. What I do believe is that they should not have to compete with another country's waste prodl!ct. We needed to take that on board and we need to do it effectively. We need to see that we get results from it. I commend this part of the Appropri-tion Bill to the Government. ' - r FREE (Lindsay-Minister for Science and Technology) (11.59 p.m.)-Bearing in mind the time, I will be brief. I want to thank those 15 members who participated in this debate and make some short comments. Last evening the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) spoke about the performance of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. I re-read his comments in Hansard because I was not quite sure of the point he was attempting to make. In his remarks he ignored remedial action which has been taken. A number of points need to be made. It should be understood that the losses will be covered by retained profits. There will certainly be no call on the government guarantee which backs the AIDC. Like most other financial institutions, AIDC did tend to lose its way during the late 1980s and made some bad investment decisions. However, ''the honourable member for Barker, as a former director of Elders, would appreciate, I am sure, that AIDC was not unique in this respect. Once Senator Button and the board of the AIDC became aware of the problem they acted and, after consultation with the Minister, the 'Chairman and the board carried out an exhaustive review of the operations and the structure of the company. I am infomied that there have been changes in senior management to introduce additional expertise in the company. For example, a new managing director took over in January and a new business strategy has been put in place. I understand that the new management has identified every problem investment and loan and that adequate provision has been made for the realise in potential losses. Further, new management has brought in specialist advisers on a contract basis to handle problem accounts and the· board is confident that the company will return to profitability this financial year. The company's new strategy focuses much of its work on what it does best, that is, the funding of development, particularly resource based development and infrastructure projects. The honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) made some telling observations on the consequences of the Opposition's zero tariff policy. Indeed, a lot of the debate this evening focused on tariff policy. It was interesting to listen to Opposition speakers, who were quite schizophrenic in their approach to this question, some claiming that the Opposition was being terribly brave and different on tariff policy, others claiming that their policy was just like the Government's. In this respect, I commend the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) for his courage. At least he had the courage to defend the policy of his Party, which of course will kill the Australian car industry. In contrast, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) claimed that coalition tariff policy was slightly more taut than that of the Government, which is a delightful phrase. It is a bit like describing Cyclone Tracy as a stiff breeze. I would be intereSted in the comments of the car industry on this slightly more taut interpretation of Opposition tariff policy. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) gave us a diverting account of some journey through fantasy land. The country he described was certainly .not the Australia of the 1990s-a country which has an industry which is vastly more competitive; which has experienced growth in manufactured exports, to which I will return later; and which has experienced productivity gains which we have heard about during Question Time in the last two days. I remind honourable members that all of this has been achieved through the policies of this Government. We heard during the debate a great deal of repetition from the Opposition of that dangerous drivel which passes for Opposition the tax policy these days, particularly by the honourable member for Mitchell and the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), which prompts me to share the view of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) that they are simply doing this to be different. If this is their objective, they have certainly succeeded, although perhaps not in the way in which they intended. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) spoke of the problems of commercialisation of research. He rightly pointed to the need to encourage institutional investors to take a greater interest in commercialisation of the very good research and development that we do in this country. I take the opportunity to inform the Committee of some progress that has been made on two important initiatives announced in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement that were aimed, at least in part, at addressing this problem. I refer to the pooled development funds and the Australian technology group. The pooled development funds have progressed since that time. Members of the registration board were appointed in July and advertisements were subsequently placed in the national press inviting applications for companies to establish pooled development funds. I am informed that the Department has received expressions of interest from a very wide cross-section of the investment industry and has provided information on the PDF program to some 300 parties. The board met on the 23rd of last month to consider several proposals to establish pooled development funds and it is anticipated that the board will shortly be in a position to announce details about successful applications. The Australian technology group, also announced in One Nation, has progressed considerably since that time. A discussion paper has been circulated, considerable interest has been received from the investment community; and I expect to be in a position soon to announce the appointment of three interim directors from the private sector to progress the development of the Australian technology group. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) in his remarks correctly pointed, as did the honourable member for Prospect, to the devastating impact of a goods and services tax on small business. I understand that, increasingly, the small business community is becoming aware of the danger that a GST will pose to not simply its successful operation, but its survival. The honourable member for Prospect also placed on record her concern about the importation of second-hand motor vehicle industries. I am advised that this is a problem about which Senator Button has received numerous representations, not just from the honourable member but from a variety of· people. It is not a simple problem, given that the major reconditioners also happen to be major importers of second-hand engines. To that extent, it is a problem which is contained within the industry and which needs to be addressed very carefully. Nevertheless, I am sure that the portfolio Minister will pay close attention to the representations of the honourable member. Finally, a number of speakers referred to their view of the export perfonnance of the Australian manufacturing industry. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) pointed to a number of success stories within his electorate of manufacturing industries doing well, particularly in the area of exports. I think it is worthwhile at this stage to remind the Committee of the recent release of ABM's top 500 exporters list. ABM states: There is exciting news for Australian industryand the Australian economy generally-in ABM's Top 500 Exporters list this year. The excitement comes from the dramatic push into the top ranks of our biggest national exporters of companies selling not the raw commodities that have been the mainstay of our international trade for so long, but many of our most sophisticated high-value-added manufactures. From 1990 to 1991, Australia's exports of goods and services increased by 8 per cent. The principal areas of growth were ETMselaborately transfonned manufactureswhich rose by more than 19 per cent over a wide range of items; in service credits, which rose by 9 per cent; and in minerals and fuels, which grew by 8 per cent. The changes in the Top 500 Exporters list reflect these growth areas in Australian industry exports. I think that is an appropriate, realistic and optimistic note on which to conclude this debate. Proposed expenditures agreed to. Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories Proposed expenditure, $705,897,000. Progress reported.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Sales Tax: Luxury Cars (Question No. 663) Mr Cobb asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 14 March 1991: (1) What effect did the luxury car sales tax surcharge have on the sale of those cars. (2) What sum was collected from the surcharge in the period it was imposed. (3) What sum was collected from the sales tax which applied to luxury cars over the equivalent period to that referred to in .part (2) immediately before the surcharge was introduced. (4) Why was the surcharge abolished. (5) What are the projected sales of lUXUry cars under the new arrangements. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 50 per cent rate of sales tax on luxury cars was introduced on 9 May 1990 as a flat rate and was adjusted in the August 1990 Budget to a progressive split rate structure (up to a maximum of 50 per cent). The 50 per cent rate was removed on 12 March 1991. (During that period, cars priced below the lUXUry threshold were taxed at 20 per cent.) A 30 per cent luxury rate applied before 9 May 1990 and after 12 March 1991. The period when the 50 per cent rate applied coincided with a contraction in lUXUry car sales. However, not all this contraction can be attributed to the increase in the rate of sales tax: other factors affecting sales included the slowing in economic activity; the bringing forward of sales in this market sector prior to 9 May 1990 to avoid the increased rate of sales tax; and the possible postponement of purchases up to 12 March 1991 amidst speculation that there would be a return to the pre 9 May 1990 treatment. (2) The total collections from the luxury car sales tax in the period when the 50 per cent rate applied (ie, 9 May 1990 to 12 March 1991) amounted to around $76m of which some $23m was attributable to that portion of the rate in excess of 30 per cent. (3) The total sales tax collections on lUXUry motor vehicles taxed at 30 per cent is estimated at $285m over the equivalent period prior to the introduction of the 50 per cent rate (ie, June 1989 to April 1990). A considerable proportion of this NA revenue reflects a more buoyant level of sales associated with higher economic activity during this period and a bringing forward of purchases in the period after the Government's intention to introduce the 50 per cent rate was announced and before its implementation. Further, the higher revenue collections in this period also reflect the prepayment of sales tax at 30 per cent by some retailers on their stocks of new cars which were sold subsequent to 9 May 1990. (4) I refer the honourable member to the Statement by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator, the Hon John Button, of Tuesday, 12 March 1991, in which he announced the return to the pre-May 1990 sales tax arrangements for lUXUry cars. I table a copy of the relevant part of the Statement. (5) As noted in my answer to (1) above, a number of factors affect the demand for luxury vehicles. Nevertheless, in the period immediately following the return to the 30 per cent rate of sales tax on luxury cars, there was a modest recovery in sales which has been maintained. State Railway Systems (Question No. 1040) . Mr Hollis asked the Jreasurer, upon notice, on 4 September 1991: Further to the answers to questions NoS 213 (Hansard, 13 November 1990, page 3969) and 560 (Hansard, 9 April 1991, page 2234), is he able to obtain from the Australian Bureau of Statistics the data for the (a) operating result, (b) subsidies received and (c) cost recovery in respect of each State railway system for 1990-91. . Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) no longer separately identifies data on the financial aspects of each State's railway system but, on a State by State basis, compiles data only on the transport sector as a whole. The attached tables provide data from 1980-81 to 1989-90 on the operating results, subsidies and cost recovery from State public trading enterprises in the transport sector. The data in these tables are based on data obtained from the ABS.

The Government provided additional resources to the Commission to help overcome the problems .. This enabled additional telephone lines (008 lines) and additional staff to be employed to respond to the telephone enquiries. Also, the legislation was amended to require determinations to be submitted with taxation only in cases where benefits received were in excess of the reasonable benefit limit. This enabled the number of final determinations issued to be greatly reduced, the bulk of the determinations issued being interim determinations calling for adjustment of incorrect or incomplete information supplied to the Commission. The result of these changes is that this year the Commission has issued all the determinations for benefits received up to 30 June 1992 and telephone enquiries are being handled without delay. Superannuation (Question No. 1463) Mr Mack asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 31 March 1992: (1) Is the Government encouraging workers to provide for their retirement through contributions to private superannuation schemes. (2) Is the Government offering tax concessions and rebates to encourage contributions to superannuation schemes; if so, what sum did the concessions and rebates comprise in 1990-91. (3) What was the cost - o the Commonwealth of providing the aged pension in 1990-91. (4) What is the projected cost to the Commonwealth of providing (a) tax concessions and rebates for superannuation contributions and (b) the aged pension in each year from 1992-93 to 1999-2000. (5) Will the Government (a) place more emphasis on superannuation as a means of providing retirement income, (b) place less emphasis on the importance of the aged pension and (c) reduce or eliminate the aged pension. (6) Will the Government identify in each year's budget the cost of tax concessions and rebates given to superannuation contributors. (7) Are tax concessions and rebates nuation contributions of greater value to (a) high income earners than to low income earners and (b) full-time employees than to part-time or casual employees. (8) Will the Government limit the proportion of workers' superannuation contributions which can be consumed in commissions and fees charged by superannuation advisers, agents and fund managers; if so, through what steps. (9) What measures has the Government implemented to (a) protect the investment made by workers in private superannuation schemes and (b) require superannuation fund managers to disclose the nature of the investments they make with contributors' funds. (10) Does the Government monitor superannuareturns tion fund managers; if so, how. (11) Does the Government impose requirements on superannuation fund managers to ensure (a) that contributors' funds are secure and will be available for their retirement when their schemes mature and (b) that they report regularly and truthfully to their contributors on the performance of their investments; if so, what are the requirements. (12) Can contributors to superannuation schemes complain to a Commonwealth agency if they find themselves in a dispute with their superannuation fund manager, agent or adviser; if so, (a) which agency and (b) what powers may the agency exercise to redress those complaints. (13) Will the Government require superannuation companies, advisers and agents to (a) disclose the full amount of advisers' or agents' commissions to be paid by the customer, (b) meet strict standards with respect to the truthful advertising of products and especially predicted final payouts and (c) fully disclose before commencement any penalties which will be imposed if the contributor ceases to make payments to the scheme. (14) Will the Government require superannuation companies, advisers and agents to (a) provide plain English explanations of their schemes to prospective customers and (b) ensure that customers fully understand their rights and obligations; if so, how. (15) Will the Government ensure that workers entering a superannuation contract have a legal right to a reasonable cooling off period to enable them to withdraw without penalty; if so, how. (16) Which Commonwealth bodies regulate the superannuation industry. (17) Will the Government review existing regulatory arrangements with a view to establishing a single regulatory agency with adequate powers to regulate the activities of superannuation advisers, agents and fund managers and to protect the infor superan- terests of contributors. (18) Will the Government establish an independent superannuation advisory service. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's original question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Government provides substantial taxation concessions to encourage superannuation savings. In addition, the Superannuation Guarantee Charge, which took effect from 1 July 1992, will ensure minimum levels of superannuation cover for virtually all employees. (2) The cost of superannuation and other employment termination tax concessions in 1990-91 was $3590 million. (3) The cost to the Commonwealth of providing age pensions and allowances in 1990-91 was $9207.5 million. (4) These forecasts are not available. However, my statement of 30 June 1992, 'Security in Retireresponsibility, ment', provides simulations of the possible impact actions of fund managers. of the Superannuation Guarantee. Charge on the budgetary cost of funding retirement incomes. (5)(a) Yes. (b) No. (c) No. (6) This figure has been provided annually since 1986 in the Treasury'!;> Tax Expenditures Statement. (7)(a) Tax deductions are of greater value to incoq1e earners who face higher marginal tax rates . than. to. people facing lower marginal tax rates, while rebates have a uniform dollar value for all recipjents. (b) The value of deductions and rebates is dec pendent on the marginal tax rate a person faces and not his or her status in the work-force. (8) The Government does not intend to introduce any such limits at this stage; Ih conjunction with the 1991-92 Budget, the Government announced enhanced information disclosure requirements for superannuation funds with 5 or more members. These requirements were announced on 20 August 1991 and are being phased in from 1 July 1992. The new requirements include full disclosure of fees charged to· members' accounts. Requiring trustees and fund managers to be more accountable to their members will enable members to better protect their int-restS and increase petitivepressure on funds' fees and charges. (9)(a) The Government announced, in conjunchave tion with the 1991-92 Budget, its intention to introures. duce a range of measures to enhance the supervito sory framework applying to superannuation. These measures will minimise prudential risks, thereby ducing the risk of fund failure· and maintaining public confidence in superannuation savings. (b) The enhanced information disclosure requireworking ments referred to in (8) require disclosure of superannuation fund's investment objectives and policy and strategy being used to meet those objectives. This includes disclosure of the classes of assets in which the fund has invested, the amount or proportion represehted by each class asset, and· disclosure of any single investment or related investments which exceed 10% of the total value of the fund. (10) The Government's prudential supervision superannuation is directed at superannuation fund trustees and managers. While bility for the viability and prudent operation of a superannuation fund rests with the trustees of superannuation fund, the Government is concerned to ensure that where trustees elect to contract out the investment function, funds managers will be fully accoulltable to trustees. Trustees take full on behalf of fund members, for the . In addition, the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) has responsibilities for supervision of fund managers. Questions in that respect should be directed to the Attorney-General. (ll)(a) See (10). (b) Disclosure requirements fOI superannuation . funds are set down in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act and associated regulations high and have been extended with the implementation of the additional disclosure requirements which took effect from 1 July 1992. The existing superannuation standards include requirements for the provision of information to members of superannuation funds: on joining a fund,.for example, details on the kinds of benefits, conditions relating to those benefits, and method of determining entitlements; annually during the currency of membership, for example, details on the amount of vested and preserved benefits, the rate or amount of net earnings, and the amount of member contributions; on termination of membership, for example, the amount of benefit entitlements including any amounts which are required to be preserved; and on request, for example, a copy of the auditor's report. (12) There is currently no disputes resolution commechanism covering the superannuation industry as a whole. However, many superannuation funds their own internal disputes resolution procedSpecific mechanisms ljre in place in relation public sector schemes and there are mechanisms in place in cases where a dispute involves a life reinsurance product or service (covered by the Life Insurance Federation of Australia's Complaints Review Committee). The Government is currently with industry participants to develop a a suitable low-cost disputes resolution mechanism for the superannuation fund members. Fund members can also approach the Insurance and Superannuation Commission where they consider that there has been some breach of the Occupational Superannuaof tion Standards Act or related regulations. (13)(a) See (8). In respect of superannuation business transacted by life insurance companies, the question of disclosure of commissions is expected of to be considered in the inquiry into life agents' activities being conducted by the Trade Practices the primary responsiCommission. (b) There are existing laws (including Trade a Practices Act requirements) with respect to truthful advertising of products which apply to superannuation schemes. In respect of life insurance business, ISC Circulars Nos 276 and 290 lay down minimum information that must be disclosed before consumers can purchase life insurance products which are often used to provide superannuation benefits. There are also guidelines (lSC Circular No. 291) on how predicted final payouts from such policies can be calculated and presented. (c) Enhanced information disclosure requirements which are being implemented from 1 July 1992 will require the disclosure of a summary of the fund's policy with respect to fees and charges applicable to accounts, including initial or establishment charges, continuing management charges and termination charges. In respect of superannuation based life policies, ISC Circular No. 276, covering single premium life policies, requires all charges to be disclosed at the time of applying for the product, while Circular 290, covering regular premium life policies, requires termination values of the policy after 1,2,3,5, and 10 years to be disclosed so that consumers can see the effect of fees and charges. (14) Trustees are required to provide prospective members, before they join a fund, with a copy of the annual notice provided to existing members which contains all such information as members of superannuation funds would reasonably require, and reasonably expect to have provided, for the purpose of making an informed judgement as to the financial condition and administrative arrangements of the fund. This includes details of any significant material change subsequent to the date of annual information provided to existing members. (15) Where superannuation is effected through life insurance products there is currently provision for a cooling off period of 14 days. (16) The Insurance and Superannuation Commission has primary responsibility for the regulation of, inter alia, the superannuation and life insurance industries. Where funds are structured as prescribed interests they are also subject to the separate disclosure and other provisions of the Corporations Law and as such also are subject to the jurisdiction of the Australian Securities Commission. (17) The Government's 1991-92 Budget-time announcement on prudential supervision indicated that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission will remain the primary regulator of the superannuation industry. The ISC will maintain close links with other regulatory bodies to ensure a consistent regulatory framework and to avoid unnecessary duplication of regulatory requirements. The Government is currently developing a number of measmes, including better enforcement powers for the ISC, to implement the announced br9ad approach, and will be making a further statement on this issue in the current sittings. Additional resources for audit and prudential supervision have been provided to the ISC in the 1992-93 Budget. (18) The Government has no current intentions to establish such a service.

(7) Is he able to give general patterns of stockpile sales. (8) Is it a fact that the Australian Wool Realisation Committee withheld certain details of prices and availability of stockpile wools from general publication, if so, why. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable rltember's question is as follows: (1) Table 1 provides closing stock for each month. Stock peaked at 4.7 million bales in February 1991. (2) The composition of opening stock by micron category for fleece, skirtings, combing lambs wool and cardings is summarised in the first column of numbers in Table 2. (3)(a) A total of 538,593 bales was sold in 1991/92. This number is the farm bale equivalent of sales of greasy and processed wool at standard conversions. (b) The composition of sales for the same categories as in the answer to question 2 are contained in the second column of Table 2. (c) (d) The total value of sales made in 1991/92 Wool: Sales was $331 million. This converts to an average price per bale of $614.56. (e) The policy of the Commission initially was to set all prices at not less than the current market quotation at the type or the value of that lot in the accounts of the former Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). Initially a minimal premium above whichever of these figures was the higher was used. ' Commencing in December 1991, this pricing policy was replaced with the setting of type level prices at a premium to the latest market quote or a four month average, whichever was higher. The adoption of this change in policy was phased in for finer fleece wools over a period of three months and higher premiums were adopted initially for processed wool. The premium above the guideline price was varied throughout the season depending on market circumstances. (4) It is likely that the effect of stockpile sales on auction prices has been minimal since stockpile sales for the 1991/92 season comprised about 10% of the total trade clearances of wool from Australia sales were confined to the strongest sectors of the market including cardings, skirting types and cross bred fleece where the market generally strengthened throughout the season and in which, without stockpile sales, some business in price sensitive knitted goods would have been lost by wool to other fibres in many cases, stockpile sales complemented purchases at auction enabling customers to complete orders to meet shipping deadlines, to purchase types not currently available at auction or to take advantage of short term orders in the marketplace. (5) It is not possible to be accurate about what might have happened if a different policy had been adopted towards stockpile sales in 1991/92. However, for 1991/92, estimated costs of holding a bale of wool for a year was $71.00 of which interest was $60.00 and storage (excluding handling and administration) was $8.00. Allowing for the timing of sales of wool sold in 1991/92 and the pattern of interest rates over the year, the estimated total cost of storage would have been $19.7 million. In the Australian Wool Realisation Commission's (AWRC) view, freezing the stockpile would have done considerable damage to the wool market. It would have continued the speculation and lack of confidence that did so much damage in the wool market in 1990/91. Wool prices would probably not have been higher if the stockpile had been frozen. In addition, the trade did not support a freeze. (6)(a)(b) This is commercial-in-confidence information. Sales are made to anyone wishing to buy wool at AWRC prices though the buyer is required to nominate an Australian-based company through which sales are to be invoiced. (c) All wool in the stockpile is from Australia. (7) The information in Table 1 can be used to derive pattern of sales on a monthly basis. Information on sales each week is published by AWRC. (8) The AWRC is required under Performance of Functions Guideline 6.1 to ensure that conduct of transactions is as open as possible in the management and disposal of the wool stockpile, consistent with its overall charter.

The AWRC decided not to disclose the price of each individual transaction made, because this is normally regarded as confidential information to the parties to such transactions. Despite this, AWRC asking prices for specified wool groups in its catalogues are available to anyone who makes a request for an offer on specific types. Initially, the AWRC did not disclose a detailed breakdown of stocks of processed wool held overseas. Wool processing was conducted by the former AWC in commercially confidential arrangements with individual mills/merchants. It was necessary first to discuss disclosure with the companies involved and, once that had been completed, a detailed catalogue of all processed wool stocks was published.
