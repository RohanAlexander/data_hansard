1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. NA Public Works Committee: Air Traffic Services Centres-Brisbane and Melbourne",10
2,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE REFERENCE,"by leave-I wish to make a short statement to the House regarding the inquiry by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works into the proposal by the. Civil Aviation Authority to construct air traffic services centres at Brisbane and Melbourne. This project was referred to the Committee by the House on 26 February 1992. As I made clear at the Committee's first public hearing on 8 April, the role of the Committee is to examine and report to the Parliament on the building works involved with the Australian advanced air traffic system project, or TAAATS. The main component of· the TAAATS project is the consolidation of the five major air traffic control centres to two centres, Brisbane and Melbourne. The cost estimate of the building works when referred to the Committee was $5Om. I am sure that honourable members are aware that there has been considerable controversy regarding the CAA's decision to name Thomson Radar as the preferred contractor for TAAATS. The CAA has also announced that the Hughes Aircraft Co. is the alternative contractor. While the Committee has attempted to stay clear of issues relating to the TAAATS equipment contract, it has proved to be impossible. In fact, I stressed at the beginning of the inquiry that the Committee did not wish to involve itself in issues relating to the TAAATS equipment contract. The Committee's .task has been made difficult owing to the turnkey nature of the contract for the TAAATS project. Under the turnkey contract the successful contractor will also be responsible for the provision of the building works. This has presented the Committee with a situation where very few details of the building works have been made available to it. However, this is a matter on which the Committee will comment in detail in its report, which will be tabled in the Budget session. It is true that the principal role of the Public Works Committee is to satisfy itself of the need for public works. However, section 17 (lb) of the Public Works Committee Act, while empowering the Committee to make a report to both Houses of the Parliament concerning the expedience of carrying out a public work, also provides that the Committee may report to the Parliament concerning any other matters related to the work in respect of which the Committee thinks it desirable that the view of the Committee should be reported to the Parliament. Despite arguments put by the CAA and an impertinent letter from the Chairman of the CAA, Mr Butcher, my Committee did not exceed its mandate. It is surprising that key officials of the CAA and key witnesses before a parliamentary committee did not bother to familiarise themselves with the role and duty of the Public Works Committee. My Committee found the comments by Mr Butcher impertinent and insulting, as he attempted to lecture the Committee on its role. The mem-:bers of the Public Works Committee are well aware of their role and duty and do not need to be lectured to by bureaucrats. The Committee was also frustrated in the exercise of its duty by the unwillingness or inability of key CAA witnesses to answer relevant questions. Reluctantly the Committee conducted two in-camera hearings, but even with this protection the CAA witnesses were still unwilling or unable to answer key questions. By their refusing to answer these questions even in the general terms sought by the Committee, the Committee finds itself in the position of being unable to fulfil its duty to this Parliament. The Committee believes it would be failing in its duty if it did not bring to the attention of the House the concerns which have been expressed during the Committee's inquiry regarding the CAA's decision to award the equipment contract to Thomson. These concerns include the following: whether the Thomson equipment is the best available; whether the selection process conducted by the CAA was doctored to favour the Thomson bid; and why the preference of the technical and operational evaluation teams for Hughes was overturned. In these circumstances, the Committee has decided to take the unprecedented step of recommending that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) set up an independent panel to carry out a thorough review of all aspects of the awarding of this contract to Thomson. This review should be completed as a matter of urgency so that the CAA can appoint a final contractor with a minimum of delay. The Public Works Committee stresses that this issue is too important for it not to be settled as soon as possible. The Committee feels that, because of the serious COilcerns it has regarding the TAAATS project, it cannot report to the Parliament until this review is completed.",10
3,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEE REFERENCE,"by leaveArguably this reference has been the most difficult for the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in the last four or five years. That process has not been assisted by CAA officials and their ambivalence, some hostility and a refusal, as the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has said, to alli!wer pertinent questions in public interest. As he also said, it has been impossible for the Public Works Committee to divorce the bricks and mortar element of about $50m from the more costly hardware and software elements of TAAATS, which make up about 80 per cent of the projected cost. Both responsible Ministers, Senator Collins and Senator Cook, must be left in no doubt, as the result of the statement this morning, that there' are three big question marks that persist in tenns of, firstly, the technical and operational aspects which, on the evidence presented both in camera and in open forum, leave unanswered questions concerning the rationale for selecting the Thomson bid over the Hughes bid; secondly, the tendering process and its unorthodox variations by CAA in this project; and, finally, the role of the CAA board in the whole process of this sorry state of affairs. Much of this has been the subject of media comment and debate over the last couple of months. Both Ministers need to understand the degree to which this project could raise further questions of public accountability if left unattended. My Committee colleagues and I are concerned that a public scandal is in the making if the Ministers do not take action to have it reviewed by an independent expert panel. This Parliament and the Australian people deserve nothing less.",11
4,Mr MACK,COMMITTEE REFERENCE,"by leaveFirstly, I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and his Committee on the way they have handled this matter so far and on bringing it to the attention of the House. Quite obviously, there is serious concern in many quarters concemmg this contract, the tendering process and the recommendations of the CAA. But now I feel these concerns are overshadowed by the amazing attitude to tendering and public accountability expressed by a senior officer of the CAA, Dr Edwards, and the Chairman of the CAA Board, Mr Butcher. Not only have these two public servants presided over, at best, a highly unorthodox tendering procedure involving around $300m the of public funds, but also they have refused to provide tender information to a parliamentary committee. Their actions in' refusing the requests of the Committee are not only illegal, but also are an unashamed, basic rejection of any proper process of public administration. As such, I believe' that they should be removed from their office along with those board members who have endorsed their decision, irrespective of the result of the inquiry' into the tenders. Given the history of this tender and the recent conflicts of interest on the CAA Board with various appointments, there is no. question that a shake-up is long overdue. The pathetic excuse for refusing to divulge information has been rightly dismissed by the Attorney-General's Department and, frankly, after 20-odd years of assessing public tenders in a professional capacity, I can say that when I hear the tenn commercial-in-confidence, the only thing to do is to press the alarm bells and put one's hands on one's money. In the last decade, there has been an endless series of corruption scandals concerning the awarding of contracts around the world, involving everyone from national governments to the smallest subcontractor. The common factor of all those scandals is secrecy. When dealing with public money, not only does the public have a right to know, but also those involved should want to avoid charges of corruption. The only defence against that is openness. Public tenders must be as open as possible at all times. The potential for corruption cannot be ignored as the Royal Commission into the Building Industry in New South Wales has shamefully underlined. Dr Edwards is already, I understand, subject to a parliamentary inquiry in New Zealand for the last contract he managed there and it is clear that his attitude to public administration is fundamentally flawed. The letter from the Chairman of the Board, Mr Butcher, to the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, in which he strongly disagrees with the right of either the Committee or the public to know tender prices, and even disputes that it is any business of parliament, is elitist at best and it breaches the basic principles of public accountability. I strongly support the inquiry as recommended by the Chairman of the Committee, but I hope that the inquiry will be open to the public. NA",11
5,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP,"I inform the House that I have received advice from the Opposition Whip that he has nominated Mrs Sullivan to be a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure in place of Mr Shack, and Mr Riggall to be a member of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I have also received advice from the Government Whip that he has nominated Mr John Scott to be a member of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts in place of Ms MCHugh. NA Privileges Committee Consideration resumed from 1 June, on motion by Mr Gear: That the House take note of the report. upon which Mr Thckey had moved by way of amendment: That the following words be added to the motion: ""and requires Dwyer and Company, Solicitors, to formally apologise to Mr Nugent, MP, and to the Parliament for their action"". Amendment agreed to. Original question, as amended, agreed to. NA BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Baldwin: That the Bill be now read a second time.",12
6,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The purpose of the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill is to provide a matching grant with the industry, dollar for dollar, which the Government will also subsidise. It was introduced in 1987. At the moment, the maximum rate is lOc per tonne of cane, which should be equally divided between the grower and the mIller. I understand that, until last season, it had been put in by regulation at 6c a tonne and that, from now on, it is to be lOc per tonne. There is no doubt that as this rises from lOc to 15c, there will be further calls on both industry and the Government for additional assistance. The funds support the activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The Commonwealth is committed to matching SRDC expenditure, dollar for dollar, up to a limit of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production of sugar cane. It is suggested that the current maximum levy of 15c per tonne represents 0.29 per cent of gross value of production; still less than 0.5 per cent. The Commonwealth's estimated contribution for 1992-93 will be $3.15m. When we look at the 0.5 per cent of gross value of production as against the 0.29 per cent, it is interesting to see that somebody has omitted in the calculations to take into account the 12c per tonne that is paid to the Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations by the farmers, the 5c per tonne for productivity groups within the industry in various areas, and also the fairly considerable levy that is paid by the sugar mills to the Sugar Research Institute. If those three additional amounts had been taken into account, I am sure that the 0.5 per cent of gross value production would be exceeded. So the suggestion that the industry is being under-researched is not true, as was indicated by that comparison. If the 14c maximum levy is paid by regulation, this would mean an expenditure of $280 per annum for an average size Queensland farm of 4,000 tonnes, spread over some 6,000 growers. This additional cost is recognised by canefarmers as essential in order to maintain their efficient record as an industry in continuing research and development. Besides the proposed 7c per tonne, as I mentioned before, the growers do pay the Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations and the productivity groups. Research and development is well recognised within the industry. The only reason the sugar industry is in its present efficient state is that the effective research and development programs have given the canegrowers the current efficiencies they want maintained today. When we look outside this type of research and development, we see that many farmers have turned to thrash blanketing, minimum tillage and contour farming to ensure the continuation of the land as a viable resource. Many of the by-products of the milling-for instance, filter mud and, in some cases, molasses-are returned as nutrients to the soil. These are costs borne by the sugar industry in the face of the reduction in tariffs from $76 per tonne to $55 per tonne on 1 July 1992, which means further losses to an average Queensland farm of some $1,300 and about $3,600 for a New South Wales farm. I note that, of the SRDCs 9 members, three have close associations with cane farming and milling. The Deputy Chairman is Mr Kelso Greenwood, a constituent of mine from Proserpine, there is a practical person from Bundaberg and also somebody from the New South Wales industry. That leaves six people who are more technically inclined than people who have the experience within the industry itself. There was a rather interesting comment made at the Agricultural Outlook Conference this year that the people who are attracted to that conference are more and more the technocrats and less and less the farmers. In fact, on the night of the wonderful speech by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), at my tableMr Crean-I learnt a lot from that.",12
7,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I bet you did, too. At my table of 10, there was just one farmer, Kelso Greenwood. This means that 90 per cent of the people at my table-and I would assume 90 per cent of the people attending the conference-now look after technical matters and financial interests. The farmers, the graziers, cannot attend these conferences because they cannot afford it. It is getting more and more out of hand. I hope that the SRDC does not take that view in the long term. People do need that practical experience, particularly in a research and development group, to do what should be done. I mention this particularly because economic rationalism seems to have taken over from practical advice and experience of the farmers and graziers around Australia. If we want a good example of that, I think we only need to read the Industry Commission's report, where some of these economists rush through an area and become five-minute experts in an industry that is very difficult to understand. We need only to look at the Industry Commission report to get a good example. The sugar industry is told that by world comparisons it is the most efficient of any of the world's sugar industries, particularly in cane sugar, and I believe it is the only developed country selling sugar from cane on the export market. Its competitors are Third World developing countries. With the 5 per cent preference, that is not an easy position to maintain. It has achieved this rate of efficiency only because it has continued to support research and development. Even the farmers and people in the industry have contributed to this. I would like to mention a person in my own city of Mackay, Mick Hodge, who is always developing implements necessary to keep pace with the technical advances in farming. I also mention the Toft brothers, harvesters from Bundaberg, who have not only played a massive part in the mechanical harvesting of sugar in Australia but also earn export dollars in that regard. Given reasonable weather and other conditions, the Queensland industry can match any sugar industry in the world. But it is still saddled with costs that our competitors do not face. The European Community, Thailand and many other sugar producing countries do not face the extra costs that are embedded within the Australian industry-not only the sugar industry but right across the board. When I mention wholesale sales tax, I know the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will immediately say that there is no sales tax in connection with the sugar industry. That is not true. He knows the cascading effect of sales tax that is built into the services for which farmers and manufacturers have to pay. There is payroll tax. Again, somebody says that payroll tax is not paid by canefarmers. We made this allegation, not to a canefarmers' meeting, but to a meeting in Bowen of the growers of small vegetables. We said, 'We know that you do not pay payroll tax, but you get the cascading effect' Immediately the wrath of one lady descended upon us. She said that her farm paid $65,000 in payroll tax the year before last, and would be continuing to pay payroll tax now. So it is a myth that farmers do not pay payroll tax. Certainly, the cascading effect of payroll tax is very much a part of the costs that they pay. Australian industry across the board also bears an excessive fuel excise compared with overseas competitors. At 26c a litre-and not all of that being rebated as far as the diesel subsidy is concerned-that is a big on-farm cost. We can now look at the 3. per cent superannuation levy as from 1 July. As the levy and those costs are incurred across Australia, labour will be put off, adding to unemployment pool. We might also talk in terms of the income tax regime which the Australian farmer faces in good times as opposed to those in overseas markets. The graziers and farmers of Australia have gradually reached the position where they are now unable to pay tax because of the dramatic change in market conditions and weather conditions right across Australia, and also because of the impact of additional costs within their inputs. As a result of this, not too many of them pay the income tax that ordinary Australians pay, but we cannot say this with any joy. Farmers of today are being pushed into the peasant mentality-the new rural poor as opposed to their situation several years ago. Since that time we have seen such things as income equalisation deposits taken out of the system. I know that income equalisation deposits still exist, but they are of no effect whatsoever in equalising income from one year to another and in providing farmers with their own equalisation scheme, which is so necessary. They are the direct inputs and costs that Australian farmers face as against farmers in other countries. I mention also that our canefarmers, our millers and our marketeers of sugar, along with other industries, suffer massively from the need for labour market reform, transport reform and waterfront reform. We need only take one or two of those to indicate what might happen. For . instance, I understand that sugar can be freighted from Bangkok to Sydney at exactly the same rate as it can be freighted from Bundaberg .to Sydney or from Mackay to Sydney. The cabotage arrangements in Australia, which exclude foreign flag shipping, mean that it costs the average Queensland canegrower $437 a year because of those extra freight costs. We do not have that competitive aspect operating in other fields; yet the Industry Commission expects it to operate within the sugar industry. We can talk in terms of waterfront reform. It has been necessary to bulk transport the sugar to other markets, especially those further south, in order to get the best rates. the Waterfront reform is necessary in order to add the value to our product that the Industry Commission suggests. It talks about the added value in various areas, but if Australia had an efficient waterfront, whereby we could move the same number of containers as is the case in the rest of the world, we could refine our sugar, package it in the way that it is necessary and enter into a competitive market with the rest of the world. I suggested to the Sugar Board three or four years ago that there was a market for refined sugar in a Pacific destination. I was told then that it would cost about $68 per tonne to get that sugar across the wharf as compared with the cost of the bulk sugar. That is because of the smaller packaging and the fact that it has to be containerised and subject to the unions' lack of productivity in this regard. When I was in Hong Kong about two years ago, a boat could be put in the harbour-it was not berthed-unloaded by barges and cranes, and turned around within 24 hours. I believe that we have to have some significant amount of waterfront reform in that connection. The Opposition's policy is well and truly on the table in regard to labour market reform. I believe that additional profit could be gained by farmers and millers if they engaged in the practice of employers and employees talking to each other across the table, and not through a centralised wage fixing system. Obviously all of these costs are a massive burden on the Queensland sugar industry. When 80 per cent of its crop is exported as it tries to compete in the world market, where its premium sugar and reliability give it priority access, but at a premium price, these are obviously very important items. If we could allow the industry to operate free of those costs and without those burdens, it would probably enjoy a much better place in that world market than it does at the moment. The Industry Commission is said by a prominent industry leader to be a joke. That is probably repeated by every canefarmer throughout Queensland. He said it is made up of theoretical economists from Canberra who have not had any exposure to the real world and should be replaced with more practical people. The sort of person it employs, of course, is an economist from within a department who has the security of a 9 to 5 job and does not want too much exposure to the outside. Such people go out and talk to certain individuals and come back making assumptions without knowing the reality of working at the coalface. In spite of everything that has been said in the Industry Commission report, the fact is that the sugar industry is said to be the most efficient in the world. The industry continues to pay for its own research and development in more ways than the Bill would suggest. It is also a fact that massive restructuring has already taken place throughout the industry: the embargo has been removed; a Queensland sugar industry corporation has been established; the Sugar Cane Prices Board has been removed; land assignments have been opened up and transfers of these assignments have been provided for; and some sugar mills have amalgamated. In fact, quite a few have closed down. In my electorate two sugar mills have ceased to function. We are told that our bulk sugar terminals are the most efficient in the world. The Queensland sugar industry exports its sugar against the most corrupt competition, particularly from the European Community and Thailand, because of the massive subsidisation of domestic prices which feed into international exports and reduce the effective world price. I notice that the Industry Commission report says that subsidisation does not affect the world price. Of course it does. If the production which has been grown under not the benefits of fairly high domestic pricing arrangements is surplus to growers' requirements, they can afford to put it on the world market at a substantially lower price. If that practice has encouraged overproduction of sugar, there will be an automatic reduction in the world price of sugar. The Australian industry has to retain its present level of efficiency in order to compete against internal costs imposed by government and the external factor of subsidisation within world markets. It does this with the exchange rate at a dirty float which decreases the dollar by about 10 per cent. It has been suggestedI am not an economist; if I were I would not be talking about them in this way-that the dollar is floating at the dirty rate of about 10 per cent above its value. If it were reduced its proper level there would be a massive increase in income from that 80 per cent the Queensland crop that goes onto the export market. The Industry Commission basically recommends a one-off payment of $47m to remove the tariffs in the 1992 season, provided the Queensland State Government deregulates the rest of the industry and removes ashe signments. I believe that effective control by assignments is actually dead now from the point of view of what has happened over the last few years. To suggest that the deregulation should include the removal of assignments is not listening to what pening in the industry at the moment. Also, with that removal, the Commission recommends the removal of the one marketeer of sugar concept. This would have to be done with the concurrence of the State not Government. What this does is provide for broad acre farming. With the complete removal of the tariff, we are providing broad acre farming and marketing of sugar right across the board. It must be said that John Andrews, in term as Chairman of the Sugar Board, was probably the most effective controller of market that we have had. I know of occasions when CSR was the one market seller onto the world market and it was suggested by John Andrews that other players would be brought into the market. Apparently the threat had some effect because CSR was not moved from its sole position. In the one market seller position, the hedging of prices and buying of futures were undertaken at great benefit to the Queensland industry and to the whole sugar industry. It has been suggested that with the removal of tariffs all these things should come into place. If we sell off the efficient minals to private concerns, the question of who owns the sugar terminals comes up. What has happened over a number of that, while governments have borrowed funds to establish sugar terminals, the farmers have paid for those terminals by a reduction in sugar price year by year. All these things to be done with the concurrence of the In the to dustry Commission which says that there is no improvement necessary to the current antiof dumping measures. Nobody in the industry believes that the current anti-dumping measures will be sufficient. Mr Truss-Not worth a cracker.",13
8,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"As the honourable that member for Wide Bay says, they are not worth a cracker. He ought to know because comes from a substantial growing industry. It is interesting to note that on Qantas flight 81 from Adelaide to Singapore on Wednesday, 6 May 1992, the sugar that was put out for use, which came from Adelaide, was is happacked by a German company and was produced from beet. Mr Bruce Scott-A national carrier.",16
9,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"That is right. I say this for, the benefit of those people who do believe that sugar is coming into Australia and being used. I can recall something about Canadian pork. I suppose some people will for say, 'Well, Canadian pork is actually Australian pork'. The unfortunate fact about this case is that the packet had very clear instructions as to where it was packed and his manufactured. Because of the lack of competition provided by sea freight, we will see the more and more products coming in. So anti-dumping measures are absolutely essential. There was no recommendation in the Industry Commission's report about those other impediments, which I have mentioned, against the industry-for instance, labour market reform, waterfront reform, and so on. I wish to place on the record quite clearly our position on tariff reductions. That is a question which I could debate long and loud in this House for a couple of hours. In our Fightback package we say that we will remove tariffs to negligible levels. We have established that there will be 5 per cent tariffs sugar terby the year 2000. Mr Crean-You don't say that in years is Fightback at all. Read it.",16
10,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"There is another clown at the table. The only circus that he the could get a job in was the Labor Party. The are only clown that would employ him would be Labor Party. In our Fightback package we have established that by the year 2000 there will be 5 per cent tariffs, but only in conjunction with the other reforms that I have mentioned-labour market reform, waterfront reform, sea lanes reform and tax reform. They all have to be introduced at the same time. In this regard the Labor Party's position has not been made clear to me. I have had calls from the industry suggesting that, as with the dairy industry, the Minister himself should take complete control of the Industry Commission's report into sugar; that he and the Minister for Primary Industries in Queensland, Mr Casey, should take control and not leave the matter in the hands of somebody from the back bench. After all, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table, has taken great credit for the fact that he had sole intervention in the Industry Commission's report into the dairy industry and achieved a splendid result. I believe that the sugar industry deserves no less than that. The structure of the Commonwealth-State agreement in connection with the embargo protected the interests of Australian consumers. Figures would show that, if Australian consumers had been subject to fluctuating world prices at the time of the embargo, they would have paid more for their sugar. It is a myth to suggest that the sugar industry has been corrupted and protected by that embargo in the agreement. The interesting thing here is that the sumers are pleading for a reduction in tariffs. But I suggest that there has been no reduction in prices as a result of that decrease from to $76 last season. I suggest there will be no reduction in the price of the products following the reduction from $76 to $55. I believe the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) would agree with that. Mr Harry Woods-One thing is for sure: you won't get that price when you stick 15 per cent on it. .",16
11,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Obviously the honourable member was not here at the beginning of my explanation. We will take everything off that price that is encompassed now in the labour charges and taxes and the GST will not apply on exports, so it will be a cheaper product. I come back to the point about the confectioners. There will not be one cent of reduction in their prices. I suggest to the confectioners that a reduction in the price of their product will come from labour reform, waterfront reform and all those other aspects that are part of our package. It is very important that these reforms should take place. On the aspect of opening up assignments, the Industry Commission report overlooks the fact that 48,000 hectares have been allocated for additional assignment within Queensland and these have not yet been taken up or come into production. While some of it may be a timing matter, basically what has happened is that people would not want to buy assignments in Queensland at the moment because they are not worth anything. That is the situation. Those 45,000 hectares are still out of production because of the costs involved in sugar farming these days. With the infrastructure and maintenance costs, people realise that it is not possible even in the best of circumstances within the Burdekin to put this ground under cane. There is a limit to the soil available. The Industry Commission report makes some grand calculation that $500m worth of extra exports could be gained from opening up the industry. It ignores the fact that the best soil has already been taken up. Some of the soils con- that have already been taken up have to be farmed differently from soils in the past because of their inappropriateness. On top of $90 that, we have the increasing challenge from all people around Australia to look at our heritage to make sure that it is not degraded to any greater extent. All of that flies in the face of the report of the Industry Commission, which has not had the opportunity to have an in-depth look at this right across the line. As far as a farmer is concerned today, two-thirds of the price of the cane represents the wages and input costs; only one-third is then available for the payment of the rates, the farmers' own wages and interest on mortgage repayments. So there is a very thin line and that line has been reduced again this year because of Labor's reduction in the tariff from $76 to $55 per tonne. The sugar industry has never been slow in making sure that proper research and development has gone into the industry, with the support of the various institutes and bodies right around Australia. We find that CSR, CSIRO and even ABARE itself are participating, through the various grants, to further the interests of the sugar industry. Australians generally should understand that, if it had not been for the sugar industry, the decentralisation of the population of Queensland would never have taken place. They owe a lot over many decades to the efforts of those 6,000 farmers within the Queensland sugar industry.",17
12,Mr COURTICE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased, as the only member in this House who owns a sugar cane farm, to support the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the maximum rate of levy on sugar cane to 15c per tonne, as provided for in section 7 of the Sugar Cane Levy Act of 1987. The Bill has been prepared following a request from the Australian raw sugar industry. The request was made by the Australian Cane Growers Council, represented by Canegrowers, and the Australian Cane Farmers Association on behalf of the sugar cane growers, and the Australian Sugar Milling Council on behalf of the millers of sugar cane. The Sugar Cane Levy Act of 1987 provides for an industry levy on sugar cane produced in Australia and accepted for processing at a sugar mill to provide funds for the activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The Act provides for a maximum rate of levy which is currently set at 10c per tonne of sugar cane. The Government provides funding to match the industry levies up to 0.5 per cent of the annual gross value of production in line with the established policy of encouraging increased rural productivity and profitability through research and commercialisation of research findings. The sugar industry is committed to industry funded research and wishes to increase its commitment to the Commonwealth scheme through an increased levy in order to maintain its competitive export and domestic market position. The current rate of levy is 6c per tonne. However, the sugar industry has indicated its wish to increase that levy to 14c per tonne for the 1992 season. The current maximum levy rate of lOc per tonne is thus hindering this increase and so preventing the sugar industry from utilising the full potential of the Commonwealth R&D scheme. At the outset I would like to pay tribute to Mr Don"" Byth, who is head of the Sugar Research Development Corporation, and also the acting Chairman, Mr Kelso Greenwood of Proserpine, not only for his commitment as a canefarmer and chairman of the Proserpine canegrowers but also for the hospitality he has shown me in the time he has given to take me through the Proserpine district to look at some of the problems that the growers have there and for his willingness to contribute, as with all the executive canegrowers throughout Queensland, to the committee that I have been asked to chair to look at the Industry Commission report. Over the next 12 months we will be working with industry to do just that. Mr Truss-It will take a year.",18
13,Mr COURTICE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Wide Bay said that it will take a year. He is not even on top of this issue. I will tell him that the canegrowers want it to take a year; they want it to take time. I will tell him why they want it to take time. It is because it has taken 77 years since T.J. Ryan established the sugar industry as we know it today. After 77 years, surely the canegrowers are entitled to 12 months to put forward their views and responses to the Industry Commission report and not be railroaded through. The difference is that the Opposition is committed to the IC report and to zero tariffs. It does not matter what those two turkeys from the National Party on the back bench say, that happens to be a fact. It might be embarrassing for the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Wide Bay but, if they are not prepared to stand up and say that they support the IC report and zero tariffs, they should resign from parliament, because that is the Opposition's policy. They do not like to be exposed, any more than do the Queensland Nationals like to be exposed for corruption. I understand why they are dirty because they have been shown to be fools up in Mackay, Maryborough and right throughout the sugar industry. The facts are that the coalition at the Federal level is committed to the IC report and to zero tariffs. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and my committee have worked closely with the dairy industry and we have come up with a package that is not only acceptable but welcomed by the dairy fanners of Australia. Indeed, John Watson and Pat Rowley came to see my committee yesterday and said, 'We are very pleased and we want to say thanks for putting together, in cooperation with the industry, a very sensible package'. That is what we are committed to do with sugar. It is sad that these two blokes on the National Party back bench do not want that. They want to say one thing up home in their constituencies, to please the backwoods regulators and the State National Party administration to whom they owe their allegiance and control, and come down here and try to sound like statesmen. Well, they cannot walk on either side of the barbed wire fence, as one of their former State colleagues used to say. They have tried to do it and they have suffered the consequences. But that is not my fault. There has been a lot of argument from those opposite, saying, 'Well, look, we are going to abolish tariffs in line with abolishing some taxes; the taxes that we will abolish will compensate'. I will go through the taxes that they say they will abolish. First of all, they will abolish the wholesale sales tax. We have made an exemption for wholesale sales tax right across the rural spectrum. So they are going to abolish something that we have already exempted. Those opposite will also abolish payroll tax. Over the last two years farmers across this country have had it very tough. They would all love to pay payroll tax; they would love to have that problem-but they do not. There are some horticultural growers who pay payroll tax, and I am more aware of that than anyone else because I have the biggest horticultural centre in Australia in my electorate. But the fact is that that payroll tax is a State tax. Also, cane-farmers do not pay payroll taxnot one of them; but I bet they wish they did. The Opposition will abolish the excise on petroleum products. Canefarmers do not use petrol to grow cane, and have not done so for 30 years. I guess that shows the thinking of the National Party. Let us just stick to the subject of abolishing excise on petroleum for a second. Those opposite say, 'Okay, a lot of farmers have four-wheel drive vehicles and use diesel'. Let us assume that some farmers do use petroleum for their cars, as I do. Those opposite will abolish the petroleum excise. Will that saving be passed on to the consumers? Of course, it will not. It will be held from the top level of fuel companies right down to the distribution point. That money will not be passed on-and those opposite know it. Not only do they know it; they will also abolish the Prices Surveillance Authority, the very organisation that could make sure the saving was passed on. Better than that, the Federal Government allows a diesel fuel rebate. I support that totally. It is worth half a billions dollars$500m. We can call it a subsidy; we can call it a rebate; but it is backing up production of agricultural products. It is there now. One of the other taxes that those opposite will abolish is automatic indexation of excise. If they are to abolish the excise on petroleum, abolishing automatic indexation is not very rational. It does not have any effect at all. Those opposite will also abolish the training guarantee charge. The honourable member for Dawson said what a great thing that would be. In a smart and clever world and a smart and clever country, the very thing in which we need to be competitive in every industry is training. Training is the very essence of being a smarter country. The backward thinking of the voodoo economists and the Mississippi hicks in the National Party is shown in their wanting to limit the ability for us to be a clever country. Of course, this is probably the best of the lot: those opposite will abolish the coal export duty! That will really help canefarmers. I can just see the National Party wading across a cane field saying, 'We have some good news for you blokes. We will abolish the coal export duty. That will really make you competitive and that means you can wear zero tariffs, because you will not have to pay any excise on your coal'. The problem is that canefarmers do not export coal. If we look through the taxes proposed by the coalition, we see also the one relating to customs duty. The final one, the seventh one, is a beauty! Those opposite will increase excise on tobacco products by 25 per cent. When the canefarmer who is depressed about zero tariffs and the Ie report goes to light up a smoke, he will have to pay 25 per cent more for the privilege. They are the taxes that those opposite want to abolish and increase. According to the Opposition, they will put canefarmers in a better place to wear zero tariffs, to accept the Ie report, and on top of all that to accept a 15 per cent goods and services tax. Have those opposite not got some great news for canefarmers? That is about as good as bringing foot-and-mouth disease into this country. Mr Harry Woods-They have foot-inmouth disease.",18
14,Mr COURTICE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"They certainly have. The big crises for agriculture in this country are the National Party, the Hewson right wing ideologues, and the GST. Let us look at the other things that the honourable member for Dawson and the National Party have been trumpeting as the other three things which will allow farmers to welcome zero tariffs and the Ie report. These are beauties! The first area mentioned was waterfront reform. We have addressed it and it is in place. It is happening. Of course, those opposite do not want to listen to that. The second area mentioned was transport. Obviously, those opposite are not aware of the One Nation statement. It is interesting that this week, as we have debated national issues-whether transport and communications, waterfront reform or whatever-we have not had one question from those on the other side, from either the National Party or the Liberal Party, on these fundamental issues. They trumpet these ideas out as some grey, flowing areas that will deliver some extra dollars to compensate for a 15 per cent GST. The third area mentioned by the honourable member for Dawson was the exchange rate. I do not think he understands that we floated the dollar. Under the characters on the other side with the MCEwen monkey on one shoulder and the backwoods regulator on the other, we had an overvalued dollar all through the MCEwen, Menzies and Fraser years. The dollar is trading lower than ever before. The other problem relates to what the GST does to exports. It allows inflation to run at about 7 per cent. Our international competitiveness would be destroyed under a GST, yet those opposite have the hide to come in here and talk about exports. There is one other facet to this-the labour market. Those opposite always have an attitude of nastiness in this respect. They are on about taking away wages, award conditions, for millworkers, sugar workers, right across the country. They see that as a way of making us more efficient and of benefiting farmers. Those opposite do not have a very good understanding of the sugar industry, because it has had-and still has-the best industrial relations system of any industry in Australia's history. There has been a fundamental understanding that workers in the sugar industry deserve a fair wage. Throughout all the years that the sugar industry has been established, since 1915, we have seen virtually no disputation of any considerable degree. This is because otthe understanding that canefarmers and the industry have of the need to get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. Those opposite want to abolish the award system and to bring in voluntary agreements. Of course, they back that up by saying they want troops on the waterfront. Let me tell them that they cannot handle sugar mills and all exporting sugar with troops. It will not work. It never has. We have seen what the National Party is like in relation to industrial relations in Queensland. We had it for 32 years. We saw the SEQEB dispute. We saw the marchers in the streets. We saw people dragged off to gaol and, lastly, we saw National Party Ministers dragged off to gaol. Industrial disputation, industrial turmoil, is not the way to help the sugar industry. Every time it gets down to that, the last thing that those opposite trot out is the argument that, if we attack the workers, it will somehow make us more competitive. The countries that have done well with exports have a good understanding with the work force-they do not have slave labour. That attitude has never worked in the past and it will not work again. It is about time that those opposite stopped trotting out that argument. I wonder how brave the honourable member for Dawson will be when I speak to some of his rank and file millworkers over the next few weeks and tell them what he has been saying here, that he wants to take money out of their pockets. Let him front up and tell them that he wants to dud every working family in Mackay. Let him tell them that he wants to take away their holiday leave loading. Let him tell them that he wants to take away all the over-award payments. Let him have the courage to say that. He did not have the courage to talk about what zero tariffs were about until he was flushed out like a quail being chased out of a paddock of com. At the end of the day he has to face his own constituency and tell them that he wants to dud workers and that that is his way of improving the lot of the sugar industry. Another issue that was mentioned related to expanding the production of sugar cane. It is true that some areas have not been taken up; Some of the assignments have not been taken up. There is a reason for that. Every area has peculiarities and some areas are more prone to the opportunity to expand, others are not. That is dependent o- circumstances. They are the sorts of things we will be looking at over the next 12 months. I think everyone should know, if they do not already, that there is one area that can put in another one million tonnes of cane tomorrow, given the opportunity; that is, the Tully area, the King Ranch area. That also was not mentioned by people on the other side. It is interesting to see that tariffs have the big issue in the sugar debate over the past few months. An article in the Courier-Mail newspaper reported: Pork-barrelling and Queensland-style National Party politics must end, the Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, said yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) went on to say: Quite frankly, the days of pork-barrelling and the Queensland-style National Party politics are finished in this country. That ·about says it all. It is ironic that in the bush in Queensland the State National Party regime is still saying, 'We are against the IC report and we are against zero tariffs'. It still has not dawned on those opposite, any more than it has dawned on the hillbillies in Tennessee and Mississippi, that this is 1992 and the Leader of the Opposition will drag them screaming into his brave new world. Under the conservatives there will be zero tariffs and the Industry Commission report will be adopted in full-no matter what the honourable member for Wide Bay or the honourable member for Dawson might say, no matter how often they say it. It is interesting that the Gatton Star of 27 May reported a big meeting of National Party supporters-those who are still left and are not in gaol-at which they said to the Leader of the National Party: The message for you to take back to Canberra is that we are coalitionists at heart but we do expect something in return for the support of the Fightback package. They really want the tooth fairy, a pot of gold and a lot of luck. Those characters out there in the bush know that the Fightback package is about as good for the bush as the bubonic plague was for London. It has nothing whatsoever to offer. At the end of the day, the Opposition will impose a 15 per cent tax on the farm produce of every farmer in the Australian marketwhether they be fruit and vegetable growers or dairy producers. We could also talk about the export side of things, where farmers will face added inflation and lack of competitiveness. But a 15 per cent tax will be imposed on farm produce in the Australian been market. That is what farmers will get from those characters on the other side of the House. It is also interesting to note the comments of Joe Farley from the Australian Cane Fanners Association. He never pulls his punches; he is a very forthright man. I certainly have a lot of respect for him. He said: The Australian Cane Farmers Association today accused Coalition Leader John Hewson of hindering world trade refonn. ACFA General Manager Joe Farley said Dr Hewson's stubborn detennination to introduce a zerotariff structure for Australia was just like playing poker with all your cards face up. The sugar industry has no confidence in the Opposition. I have met with-and will continue to meet in the next 12 monthsgrowers, millers and confectionary workers right throughout the country. Mr Harry Woods-That is how it should be done. Mr COURTICE"""":""'As the honourable member for Page says, that is the way to do it. It is not yuppieville. We cannot do it Hewson-style, 'Here is the IC report, and there you are'. I can understand why, under those circumstances, the Queensland Nationals are screaming and running around trying to be different. They are different in many waysthat is obvious. But the problem is that they are married to the IC report and they are married to zero tariffs. The honourable member for Dawson can talk about 5 per cent and he can say it is negligible; but the fact is it is zero. He knows that and he does not like being pinned with it. Mr Harry Woods-That is why he's on the back bench.",20
15,Mr COURTICE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Exactly; he is on the Australia. back bench because he would not toe the line. But he will be married to this policy right until election day, and then the people Dawson will have the chance to chuck him out. It is also interesting to note the part that Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee have played in this debate. They have done more to create disinformation in rural Australia anyone else. I am sure it must be a headache for the shadow Ministers-certainly for shadow Minister for immigration, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddesperate dock). All of their colleagues in the Liberal Party must shake their heads when they open for Hinkler. the newspapers and see this 1940s-style stuff from Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee. They are the Laurel and Hardy of Australian politics. They wander around Queensland telling the audience what they think it wants to know. They do not know themselves what they are about, but they are trying to guess what the audience wants to know and wants to hear. We heard little Billy O'Chee, who is yet to get into long pants, stand up and say how he was going to stick up for sugar. The only thing he would know about sugar is that one puts it in one's tea. Mr Harry Woods-He's a sweet fella.",22
16,Mr COURTICE,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I would not even say that. But, at the end of the day, when it came time to vote in the Senate, what did little Senator Billy O'Chee and big Ronnie Boswell do? They squibbed; they did not vote. One could excuse Senator Bjelke-Petersen. I will not criticise that lady because I do respect her. But those two so-called macho men turned out to be macho midgets. At the end of the day, they squibbed it; they would not even go into the Senate to vote for a Democrat motion. To squib a Democrat motion is really saying something-and these are the two macho cowboys from the National Party! Is it any wonder that Andrew Lloyd Webber is considering putting the Queensland National Party to music? I think it would surpass the Phantom of the Opera and Cats. I think it would certainly add to the culture of We may be able to get it into the Opera House so we could see the old 1940s up stuff brought to life and set to music, with of stage production by Andrew Lloyd Webber.",22
17,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"What a disgraceful performance by the Chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). I thought he would get up and say than something positive about the sugar industry, but he stood up here and said that there was the nothing positive in the Opposition's tax reform package. That is the sign of a very member. He is not only a desperate member, but also a very temporary member Mr Courtice-You said that last time; you have been saying it for five years.",22
18,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Hinkler has had his go and I hope he will allow me to have mine. I want to answer a couple of points that the honourable member for Hinkler raised. He said that there were no gains in our tax reform package. The Government's own Treasury document has confirmed that there are gains for farmers and gains for a broad cross-section of the Australian people. The honourable member also said that these gains will not be passed on. But the Government's own Treasury documents indicate that each and every Australian farmer will gain $8,000. Mr Harry Woods-Sixty per cent of farmers are going to be worse off.",23
19,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"That is the way we read it. Mr Crean-Yes, but you can't read.",23
20,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"We can read. The Minister will have his chance at the end of the debate on the Sugar Cane Levy Deputy Amendment Bill and I hope he will allow me to have my say in the time allocated to me. The honourable member for Hinkler is a Prices canefarmer; he did declare his interest at start of the debate. He will be a beneficiary the Fightback package and the $8,000, which will be passed on even to the honourable this House. member for Hinkler. He is a temporary member, so he will soon be back home farming under a tax reform regime the like of which Australians have never seen before. He will be able to go home and enjoy the fruits of our Government's policies, as opposed the damage that his Government has inflicted on all Australians. He suggested that we will abolish the Prices Surveillance Authority. is wrong again. Mr Courtice-Thank goodness you've Australian come out and admitted it; that's great.",23
21,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,It is in Fightback. Why does the honourable member not read instead of getting up here and sounding off about something of which he knows nothing? We say quite clearly that we will retain Prices Surveillance Authority. Mr Harry Woods-Tell us what you say about tariffs.,23
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Mr Hollis)Order! There are far too many interjections in the House. I invite honourable members on my right not to provoke the speaker and I would also ask the honourable member for Maranoa not to respond to the interjections. We will get back to the debate and confine our remarks to the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. If the honourable member for Hinkler is going to be so disorderly as to interject, he might be asked to resume his seat.",23
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Dundas for his advice. All members know that all interjections are out of order. There should be no interjections if members are not in their seats-in fact, there should not be any interjections even when they are in their seats.",23
24,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. For the benefit of honourable members opposite, it is quite clearly stated in the Fightback package that we will retain the Surveillance Authority and that its role the will be enhanced. I hope the honourable of member for Hinkler takes that on board. He should get his facts right before he comes into The purpose of the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill is to increase the maximum research and development levy from 10c to 15c a tonne. The levy is payable on sugar cane to produced in Australia and accepted for processing at a sugar mill. The levy is collected on funds and activities of the Sugar He Research and Development Corporation. The request for this amendment has come from the Australian Cane Growers Council, the Cane Farmers Association and the Australian Sugar Milling Council. Sugar research is currently poorly supit, ported, with growers providing only 6c a tonne-or about 0.17 per cent-of the annual gross. value of production. One can compare the this figure with meat producers and wool, wheat and oilseed growers, who contribute 0.5 per cent. Canegrowers have recognised that fact and they now want to increase the amount that they pay by 8c a tonne to 14c a tonne. The Government also provides primary industries with a dollar for dollar research development grant up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. The sugar industry ranks as one of Australia's most important agricultural industries. As the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) said, it creates jobs and has been a major contributor to decentralising Australia's population. It is a major contributor to the wealth of this nation and it is terribly important in terms of Australia's regional development. Approximately' 95 per cent of total Australian sugar production is based in Queensland. A further 5 per cent is produced in northern New South Wales. Perhaps those two figures will reflect the score that we will see in the State of Origin match in Sydney tonight. As a result of widespread drought, the Australian cane harvest in 1991-92 was 23.1 million tonnes-the lowest harvest since 1979-80 and a fall of 15 per cent on the 1990-91 harvest. I think that reflects the severity of the drought. Sugar production fell by 400,000 tonnes from the 1991 harvest to 3.1 million tonnes. The value of sugar sales from the 1991-92 Australian crop declined by $255m to $949m. Those figures reflect the plight of many sugar cane farmers-a decline of $255m in the value of the crop-because those dollars were lost to canefarmers right across Australia. In 1992-93 cane production is forecast to recover to 25 million tonnes. The importance of research and development cannot be overstated. Australian farmers are recognised throughout the world as leaders in efficiency and productivity. There are several lessons the Queensland and New South Wales sugar farmers could teach the Australian manufacturing sector. The major productivity gains in the last decade have been achieved through the purchase of modem machinery and improved agricultural practices. However, I believe that the productivity gains in these areas have reached the peak and the same levels of increases are going to be difficult to maintain in the future. The farmer already works from dawn till and dusk and, when needed, thereafter. The cane harvesting process has evolved from the days of cutting cane by hand to the mechanically driven machines operating today. To a certain extent, productivity gains in these areas have come as far as they are likely to in the near future. However, the Australian cane industry must not stop the search to improve its product. We must maintain the competitive edge that distinguishes the Australian product from the products of other countries. The way to achieve this competitive edge is through research and development. Much of this progress lies in genetic engineering. Improved plant varieties, better sugar content, resistance to disease, resistance to drought, and more efficient utilisation of water and soil nutrition, are research projects which will ultimately lead to further efficiency gains. Many such projects are being undertaken with the levies that have already been collected in the past. For example, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a couple of those projects which are already under way and I support the need for research. They are going to be invaluable in the future. I refer to one project that is being carried out by the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations. Its main objective is: To produce genetically transformed (transgenic) sugar cane plants expressing agriculturally important genes such as resistance to sugar cane mosaic virus and resistance to the herbicide glyphosate. That has the common name of Roundup. That is a terribly important objective and a terribly important project which is going to give the sugar industry much better plants and enable it to use fewer herbicides. It will not only improve the productivity of the cane farmers but also be of benefit to our environment if that project is successful. There is another project in the area of conservation and fallow management techniques for the cane industry. This is being carried out by the Department of Primary Industries in Queensland. Its objective is: To evaluate three ""best bet"" reduced tillage fallow management techniques for new plant cane on four different soil types in the Maryborough District. That might sound pretty dry sort of research, but it is terribly important. These are the sorts of projects that are going to lead to the productivity gains that we must have if we are to have a viable cane industry in the future. The efforts of such projects will serve ultimately to distinguish the Australian product and ensure a place for Australia amongst the most efficient farmers in the world. I am a strong supporter of grower levies collected for the benefit of promotion, research and development. I will briefly declare my interest as a wool grower and grain grower, and a payer of such levies. I am certainly very supportive of the sugar industry wishing to increase its contribution to research. It is great to see that people are out there trying to help themselves rather than always coming to governments for help. I know that the sugar industry and all agricultural industries appreciate the dollar for dollar contribution that comes from the Federal Government. While it is all very well to be the best and most efficient farmer or manufacturer in the world, Australia must have access to international markets. There is no point having a product that cannot get access to another market. Therefore,· the importance of the GATT round of trade negotiations is imperative. Whilst the current proposal is not all that we as a nation would have hoped for, it is a proposal and it is progress. I believe that the efforts from both sides of the House and all the member countries of the Uruguay Round which have stuck so strongly together will see some progress being made. It is absolutely vital for agriculture in Australia to see progress in this Uruguay Round. I would hope that it is not too long before we see a positive response from the Americans. Furthermore, sourcing new markets is also imperative to the Australian sugar industry. The potential demand for food and fibres from the newly formed Commonwealth of Independent States immediately comes to mind. I was recently in Russia on a project under the agriculture co-operation agreement. Whilst on that trip I took the opportunity to meet with officials in Moscow. They advised me that Russia plans to import 3.8 million tonnes of raw sugar this year alone. One of the problems that Russia is having, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) would know, is the payment of its existing debts. It appears that we have this stalemate. Russia is placing priority on food ahead of manufactured products and fibre. I believe that that reflects the need to feed that nation, and because of the acute shortages of food there are huge opportunities for us as a nation to get up there and negotiate the existing outstanding debt. Australian producers do not stand to benefit from this trade unless we can get some action. I hope the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is able to have some influence in this area, because I believe it is a very important subject. The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) should lead a delegation to Moscow as a matter of urgency in order to explore options for the repayment of this $250m debt to allow the quickest possible resumption of trade. I believe the Australian Government is sitting on its hands over this issue and that is really going to be at the expense of future trade. The opportunities are there now to be part of that reform and assist the Russians. I believe we should be up there negotiating. We should be sending the highest possible delegation; it should not be just bureaucrats. The way I see it, Government members and Ministers need to attend. The growth of the freedom within the Commonwealth of Independent States will create valuable trading opportunities that will provide a necessary boost to our rural sectors and a welcome injection of funds into regional communities. A very important factor at the moment is that Russia is paying debt according to a schedule. Those who are currently trading foodstuffs can expect to receive preferential treatment. Given this fact, it is imperative that an arrangement be nutted out in order to allow the resumption of trade, not only for the benefit of the Australian sugar industry, but for the benefit of industry across the board. If the Minister is not prepared to take such an initiative, Australia is likely to miss the opportunity of a century. We on this side of the House support the Bill. It is good to see the sugar industry wanting to increase its contribution to research. I hope the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will take up the issue of the Russian debt with the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. I believe it is very important that we send a mission of the highest possible level to Russia as soon as possible because it will be to the benefit of Australia's future trade relations and it will to the benefit of all Australians.",23
25,Mr NEWELL,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Richmond) (11.20 a.m.)The Australian sugar industry is going through a period of chang e. The Government's commitment to consultative industry reform is just one example of the changes afoot that should see the industry enter the twenty-first century stronger and more internationally competitive. That consultative approach has been complimented by previous speakers to this Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992, and I think their comments need to be reinforced. I also would like to reinforce the accolades that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Me Crean) has received from the dairy industry for his role in consulting with that industry and implementing the changes that it saw as being necessary to take the industry through to the twenty-first century. I know that we will see a similar consultative approach to the sugar industry, and the Minister has guaranteed that. I know that the industry is waiting with bated breath, in some sense, but I also know that, in terms of looking at previous results, the industry is certainly pleased to know that the results for the dairy industry have been constructive. I know that the sugar industry is expecting a similar constructive result from this Government. Sugar is of great importance to my electorate of Richmond in northern New South Wales. So it is with great pleasure that I speak today on the Bill. The honourable member for Maranoa (Me Bruce Scott) mentioned that the northern New South Wales region produces a smaller proJ?ortion of sugar in comparison with the major effort that is made by Queensland. He did get one score wrong, and that was his reference to the State of Origin result tonight. I think he has made a little mistake there. I am sure that the mistake is just as glaring as that which he and the National Party will find in Queensland and northern New South Wales in terms of their approach to the sugar industry in general. The Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill, which was originally initiated at the request be of the sugar industry itself, provides for an amendment to the maximum rate of levy which is currently set under section 7 of the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987. This Bill increases the maximum rate of levy from 10c per tonne to some 15c per tonne of sugar cane. The Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987 imposes on sugar cane produced in Australia and accepted for processing at a sugar mill a levy to fund the activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. This Bill is based, as I have said, on a recommendation by the raw sugar industry bodies. It will allow for future increases in the sugar cane levy rate above lOc per tonne. These levy rates are set by regulation following consultations between the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and, importantly, the sugar industry organisations. It is the raw sugar industry itself that has requested that the sugar cane levy be set at some 14c for 1992. The Sugar Research and Development Corporation oversees research and development for the industry. It is a mark of the maturity of this greatly valued Australian industry that it has taken the initiative to increase through this levy the funds available for research and development. That should be a source of concern to those National Party members opposite who think that they have some special 'in' with our primary industries sector. Only recently we had representatives from the dairy industry in the Caucus primary industries committee room speaking in glowing terms about the Government's commendable and consultative approach to the changes to that industry. My recent experience with New South Wales Canegrowers, following a meeting in Grafton with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, points to a similar mutually satisfactory outcome. The policy of this Labor Government has been to encourage increased contributions by primary industry for rural research. The Government made a commitment to continue matching expenditure of approved industry levies on a dollar for dollar basis. This was reaffirmed in the May 1989 Government statement entitled Research, Innovation and Competitiveness. These are three words which never would have cause to slip through the lips of the National Party members whom I see in my part of the country. Most likely one will hear words that amount to their saying one thing and doing exactly another. One reads things such as 'Nats call for sugar tariff rate freeze', and then one will hear the Liberal bosses saying, 'We will eliminate tariff protection by the year 2000'-'we' meaning the Opposition at present. Where is the credibility? Do the National Party mouthpieces in the bush think the politically astute primary producers never tune into the national media or read newspapers other than their local weeklies? Who are they trying to kid on this matter? It is generally recognised that research and development in the sugar industry is underfunded at present when compared with research and development efforts in other rural industries. Currently, about 0.17 of gross value of production has been matched in the sugar industry when compared with an estimated 0.5 per cent in the wool, wheat, meat and oilseed industries. The Commonwealth is committed to match the expenditure of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation dollar for dollar, up to a limit of some 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of leviable sugar cane. The current maximum levy represents some 0.29 per cent of the gross value of production in 1991-92. Certainly, the Commonwealth's estimated maximum contribution for 1992-93 at 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production would be some $3.15m, equivalent to a levy of 0.126c per tonne. The Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992 is part of this Government's commitment to listening to the needs of primary industries such as the sugar industry. The industry in my area, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, is a small or a modest industry on a national basis. However, it does contribute substantially to the economy of the north coast. It has seen crises before. In the late 19708 it went through a crisis in which the refining giant CSR withdrew from the New South Wales industry. The industry faced up to that crisis on a number of fronts. Through the cooperative, it was able to raise sufficient finance and, in cooperation with venture finance or a SO per cent. equity coming from Manildra Stockfeeds Group, it was able to establish its own refinery and go on from there. I might say that a substantial part of that finance that kept the north coast industry on its feet came from the State Labor Government, which continues the role that Labor governments have played in all our primary industries, not just the dairy industry and the sugar industry, in supporting those industries and keeping them viable. So much through history do we see that the real decisions, the real support, have come from Labor governments-both State and Federal. This is in stark contrast to the performance of some National Party members who toured through my electorate recently. I did say, rather tongue in cheek, that I was somewhat privileged to have them in my electorate per cent recently, and I will say that again. Mr Harry Woods-The Women - Weekly tour. Mr MCGauran-We did you like a dinner; we steamrolled you.",26
26,Mr NEWELL,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"That was the Women - ekly tour; and I think the steaIilroller ran over the toes of members of the Opposition. Brian MCDonald, the President of New South Wales Canegrowers, would not even meet with them. He had nothing to say to them. He knew that they had nothing to offer his industry, so he did not bother wasting his time with them. Mr Harry Woods-They are waking up, aren't they?",27
27,Mr NEWELL,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"They are certainly waking up. They are waking up also to the remarks that National Party members are making continually about the GST and its impact on primary producers. Many comments have been made already about the withdrawal of the so-called seven taxes and how it is going to be the be-all and end-all boost to the primary industries across Australia. Just as likely, though, the farmers are listening very clearly to the fact that a lot of those taxes do not impact upon the farms at present. As a matter of fact, as has already been pointed out, things such as the removal of the wholesale sales tax, as espoused and embraced by the coalition, is simply a policy which this Government is already As to payroll tax, unless the farmers pay themselves exorbitant wages, which we all know they do not, they are not going to be paying payroll tax. Mention has been made of the fuel levy. As the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), who is a cane farmer, quite rightly pointed out-indeed, I think the National Party members recognise this, even if they are not farmers-diesel fuel the fuel that is used to drive the primary industries of Australia, and paid on that by the farmers. Again, we have the mouthing off from those opposite grab bag of benefits that will come from the Fightback package when they are not there. Another thing I fear, which canefarmers particular have mentioned to me, is the removal of the training guarantee levy. It received a lot of publicity in other areas and many other sections of industry have comto mented on it. Even the canefarmers have benefited, are benefiting and will benefit the training guarantee charge. I compliment in very strong terms the canefarmers in electorate. I urge the House to take note this matter. The industry on the north coast to be commended for the fact that it is ning training courses for farmers in and proper use and handling of chemicals. At this stage some 300 farmers and farm workers have gone through that course to ensure that the handling of chemicals is done in a proper and safe manner. All those things are put at Order I threat by the removal of a training guarantee charge. The courses that the industry has been running are at the forefront of those offered by some of the primary industries in Australia. The people in the industry recognised that there was a need to lift their act in this area and they have responded in the appropriate and proper manner. I know that other industries are looking at the sorts of courses that have been offered around the north coast to take up this initiative. I compliment the New South Wales Canegrowers and the sugar industry for their role in leading the charge of ensuring that their work force is trained, capable and following .. working in safety. I guess it is all part of recognising that both safety and industrial relations are part of the rights of workers in the industry, on farms and within the sugar refineries and mills. The industrial relations proposal that comes from the GST package will put the stability and the progress of that industry at risk. I know that even the workers within industry-as I think the honourable member for Hinkler has menis tioned-are not happy with what is proposed in the industrial relations section of the there is no tax Fightback package. Mr MCGauran-I think we need a little bit of the of relevance to this Bill.",28
28,Mr NEWELL,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"It is very relevant to stability in the wages people will be getting in in the industry in my area, and no doubt throughout Australia. It is very relevant to has people's well-being, their income and the outlays they will have to face when they have pay a GST. How will the farmers themselves feel about sending off to the Australian from Taxation Office some $50,000 or $60,0001 Mr MCGauran- Mr Deputy Speaker, on my a point of order: you have long been an of admirer of my patience and tolerance, but is they have been exhausted this morning by the runhonourable member for Richmond. I ask him the safe to return to the subject matter. Mr Harry Woods-That's absolute rubbish.",28
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Mr Hollis)Mr MCGauran-It is a very narrow Bill, in my submission, dealing with a levy.",28
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I take the point that the honourable membet for Gippsland made. It is a very narrow Bill dealing with increase in the levy on sugar cane. Before honourable member came into the House today, other occupants of the chair had aland lowed a certain amount of wide-ranging debate. If honourable members on one side the House have ranged widely, it is always difficult for one taking over the chair during the debate to call to order another member who strays. I am sure the honourable member for Richmond will bring his remarks back to the rather narrow course of this Bill.",29
31,Mr NEWELL,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank a you for that direction and for your ruling. was responding to comments that had been made by previous speakers in the debate on the Bill. The Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992, as I mentioned before, is just one part of the Government's commitment to listening to and consulting people in the industry on their needs, recognising those needs and implementing them. It certainly is a contrast to the performance of honourable members in both parties opposite. I did mention that the President of the South Wales Canegrowers would not even meet with the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) when he came to my electorate to discuss the industry'S concerns. He realised he had nothing constructive to to say. He simply read what the Leader of the National Party had put out in his press releases and knew that that was not what the dustry. industry had been trying to say to him. Why would a busy fellow like Brian MCDonald bother meeting with a leader of the National Party? I do not think that a lot of the canegrowers I know in my electorate would bother meeting with a National Party leader if he called on them in each of their own homes. Mr Gayler interjecting",29
32,Mr NEWELL,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Exactly! Why would they bother when they know that the Nationals have been politically castrated by the Liberal Party with its negligible tariff protection mates? I feel privileged that members of the National Party came to my electorate. They has got a shock. Anyone who had lived in Richan mond while the Doug Anthonys and Charles the Blunts were the elected members would know what I mean. Not only did they not get out talk productively at all with the primary producers about the need for research and of development or other industry changes; it would seem they never talked to anyone at all. Constantly, as I move about my electorate talking to the constituents, I am told the same thing: 'We never saw those fellows up there in the electorate at all'. I would say-and my electorate would certainly agree-that enough is enough. It is a bit of an insult-or is it just tasteless joke?-that the National Party has I preselected a third generation of its absentee landlords to contest the seat of Richmond. The Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992 responds to a request We cannot respond to a request unless we are listening, and listening is not something many people have come to expect from the coalition. The only things the National Party seems to hear these days are the sweet nothings-and I mean nothings-offered by the Liberal Party. The Leader of the National Party has been running around my electorate, rare as that is, New saying that the Government intends to eliminate sugar tariffs by 1998. As the Minister for Primary Industries stated in this House on 27 May in response to a question I raised, there will be no further adjustments the rate of tariffs post 1 July, and the level alteady announced will remain until consultations have been carried out with the inThis Government has not been driven by the Industry Commission report. Representatives of the dairy industry came to the Caucus primary industries committee recently and were more than happy with the constructive consultations that took place there. Those in the sugar industry, including the New South Wales canegrowers, are getting a lot of satisfaction out of that dairy industry response. They know that this Government does listen. They have proof of it. They can speak to the dairy industry representatives. They do not need to be convinced by this Government. They have no reason to doubt this Government. They know, however, that they have a lot of reasons to doubt a coalition whose Leader says, 'We will eliminate tariff protection by the year 2000.' Some other aspects that were mentioned in this debate this morning went to the heart of some of the other reforms which might be needed, including the anti-dumping and cabotage provisions with regard to coastal transport. If those opposite look through their own proposals on anti-dumping, they will realise that they are nowhere near as good as those the Government already has in place. They are offering a second-rate change. The ongoing reform of the waterfront has been beneficial. The figures are there. Those opposite can see them, but for some reason or other with their blinkered response they seem to wish to ignore them. The industry itself made tremendous gains. I compliment Senator Bob Collins on his involvement in it when he was the Minister for Shipping and Aviation and on the changes that I know have been welcomed by the industries that are affected by coastal transport and by the people whose jobs depend on it. Another aspect is the real relevance to and benefits gained by primary producers across Australia by being primary producers. All that is wiped out with a package such as Fightback. They no longer get the recognition that the economy and governments give them for being primary producers. They have to compete on an equal footing with other industries. They do not get the protection deserve because of the unique position they occupy in producing things for this economy. Having to forward $50,000 or $60,000 to the Government every year before they actually pay themselves will be an impost that I do not think they will be able to afford and that I know they will not take on board. The farmers in my area know that they have a lot of reasons to doubt a coalition whose Leader has said that he will eliminate tariffs. They know that a vote for the National Party is simply a vote for the Liberal Party in Federal elections. There are no two-way communications there. (Time expired)",29
33,Mr MCGAURAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Today was the unveiling of the supposed new look, aggressive Government, exhorted by its Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to take the fight up to the Opposition, to stand toe to toe, to slug it out with us",30
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,Mr Hollis)Maybe the honourable member for Gippsland will take the fight up to the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992.,30
35,Mr MCGAURAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"CertainIy, I am very anxious to, and I want to make some detailed comments, unlike others who have contributed this morning on the legislation before the House, the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill. In commenting on the remarks made by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), if this is the best the Government can serve up to us, if this is the cutting edge, if this is the devastating firepower that the has Prime Minister has unleashed, then heavens above! We feel even safer and more confident about the next election than we did before the Prime Minister fired up his troops. If I can give some gratuitous advice, the honourable member for Richmond should not try to be something he is not. If he is a bovver boy like the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), then aggressive shouting into the microphones in this place might pay off. But the honourable member for Richmond is a much more low key contributor to debates, and I really do not think his attempts to ridicule and savage the Opposition have any effect at all, simply because they fall flat. Mind you, if I had they Larry Anthony breathing down my neck in the seat of Richmond I would be panicking too, and making very lame attempts to attack the Opposition.",30
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Order! During the speech of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland drew my attention to relevance. I ask him to come back to the Bill now, because he did express some concern about relevance when other people were speaking. The honourable member really has not got to the Bill yet. Could he please speak on the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992. Mr Harry Woods-Talk about the tariff policy. Why don't you talk about the tariff policy.",30
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,And the demonstrate honourable member for Page might control . himself. I think he is speaking later in the debate.,31
38,Mr MCGAURAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Certainly. It is just that the honourable member for Richmond mentioned the National Party's recent visit to the north coast of New South Wales, which I was part of. I visited the macadamia nut industry. Mr Harry Woods-Get to the point!",31
39,Mr MCGAURAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"When the honourable member for Richmond is no longer employed, plenty of pickers are needed in that industry. He will never be without a source of income. Returning now to the legislation before House, I welcome the opportunity to speak the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill. As is well-known by now by all members of the as House, the Bill increases the maximum of the levy for research and development from the sugar industry from 10c to 15c per tonne. The investment by the various commodities into research and development is critical to their long term future. That hardly needs to be stated. But despite the importance of innovation rural industries, I very much fear that there has been little systematic effort to forge genuine community of interest across the agricultural sector. Nor has there been sustained effort to coordinate the sector's various resources and capabilities to enhance its long term prospects. This, for instance, one of the reasons why the CSIRO has recently embarked upon a full scale review of its relationships with the rural research community. This, I should add, is a review which will prove significant in addressing a number of the concerns I will shortly touch upon. It is review process that the Parliament ought to endorse, as it not only reflects on CSIRO's seemingly limitless energy in trying to get various research priorities on track, but it represents an effort to ensure that the rural community gets everything it contributions to research and development and the existing rural research infrastructure. If nothing else, events continue to that the fate of the industry cannot be pinned on periodic surges in international price for raw product alone. The rural sector must work harder on the domestic front to hone its resources and develop its capacities. Australia's agricultural capacity, however, is more than just a measure of raw commodity production volumes; it is a reflection of the chain of influences which affect the efficiency and quality of production and determine the ability of the primary sector to expand its share of the global market. Importantly, such influences include: the resources which make for innovation in agriculture, particularly the educational base to the rural community; the levels of activity within the the organisational structure of the State and on Commonwealth rural research effort; the orientation of the major funding bodies such the rural research corporations; and the cost rate structures and other impediments to capitalising on the commercial returns from rural research and development projects. It is upon the effective coordination of these influences that the innovative capacity of the agricultural sector largely hinges. At the moment, there is little by way of a coorin dinated attack on each of these concerns. For example, the debate over the rural sector's a levels of educational achievement and access to educational resources has even wider a implications than first appears. The issue bears directly on the receptiveness of the next generation of farmers to the increasing opporis tunities provided by developments in technology and business management strategies. Until such time as innovation in agriculture is driven by community demand and is more widely appreciated for the long term advantages it yields, rural research and development resources will remain under-utilised or a poorly deployed. Importantly, changes of this order are critical to the approach of the rural research corporations to their research funding its strategies. This, in tum, has a profound also impact on the type and quality of research pursued in the longer term interest of the can out of its research sector. In the absence of the rural community's demand for longer term strategic research, the rural corporations are shunted into accountability practices that can only be tested against short term goals. That is to say, research grants are increasingly evaluated against their capacity to realise immediate returns. This is not a function of corporatisation conservative risk management strategies; it is a function of a body which largely reflects the interests and climate of opinion in the community that it serves. This process has inevitably distanced rural research corporations from the research agencies which undertake research and on whose expertise agriculture heavily depends. As a consequence there is little effective coordination between grants and research agencies, despite their interdependence. There is now only an emerging effort by commodity based rural research corporations to fund cooperatively research with widespread application. I know, for instance, that some efforts are being made by such rural research organisations as the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation to more effectively structure its programs. The Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation is undertaking to address national and regional research concerns. It is seeking to organise programs on a horizontal basis which allow for cooperation between a variety of related funding bodies and agencies. This is an especially important development as it heralds an awakening that some research activities are mUltipurpose and have implications for a number of commodity groups. Accordingly, they must be sustained by across the board funding mechanisms rather than having their fate tied to one commodity corporation alone. I think some of the difficulties we have had keeping up CSIRO's screw-worm fly biological control countermeasures could have been overcome if we adopted this approach more so. While the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation might have achieved much by way of innovative restructuring of programs, others have not been as successful or as enthusiastic. I believe it is critical that the rural research organisations embark upon careful planning exercises with CSIRO, not just to ensure that the organisation's own research base is stabilised and the correct balance of programs is maintained, but that the various commodity groups are able to exploit more effectively and CSIRO's expertise over time. There are no universally accepted guidelines as to the balance between longer and shorter term grants that the corporations feel obliged to undertake, despite the importance of such a balance to their continuing access to high quality research. Moreover, research agencies and particular research program managers are not regularly taken into the confidence of the corporations as to their business plans and are unable to structure their research programs with regard to projected demand. What degree of consultation and planning, for instance, has been undertaken in respect of present and pending falls in research funding flowing from the decline in commodity prices? External funding for grains, meat and wool research has all been wound back but no attention has been given to its effect on core research capabilities. In circumstances such as these, it is imperative that funding and research agencies jointly formulate priorities and work pro-actively to shield vital resources which have been built up over many years. But the challenges are even greater than this. I still believe that there is vast room for improvement in the relations between research agencies at the State and Federal levels and the corporations. In particular, the brittle nature of the State-based research capabilities requires dramatic action by way of added coordination. While aggregate Federal funding has at least reached some stability, Statebased support for research is threatened. As the key sources of funding, State governments' cuts to research and research infrastructure threaten the nation's agricultural capacity more directly than any other concerns. Yet here, too, there is a vacuum in respect of initiatives to ensure that core regional and national rural research needs are maintained. Cuts might be unavoidable and reorganisation and redeployment of human and physical resources might be necessary, but they must be managed and coordinated in the longer term interests of the rural sector. To be sure, such a blueprint might well risk some States free-riding on others or the Commonwealth, but it is necessary to hQpe that some maturity of understanding will prevail when the longer term interest of a key industry sector is at stake. Rural research needs to be pursued on more regional lines. It needs to be structured so the various commodity groups are able to pursue programs in their common interests. It needs to be pursued with a closer eye to keeping alive the research resources which have taken many decades to build up. This last point is no idle or passing comment. Australia is a small nation with regard to the spread of specialised research expertise. Once we lose a body of expertise it is gone for good, or it will be mightily difficult either to resurrect or to re-establish it at some unspecified time in the future. In view of these difficulties, and there are others, it is difficult to contend that Australia's agricultural industries are at all well-placed to build their competitiveness beyond keeping their fingers crossed for sustained falls in exchange, interest and inflation rates. Governments, nevertheless, can help in filling the policy vacuum and driving change. In this respect, I would recommend to the House the CSIRO's recent horticultural review report entitled Horticulture in Focus. There, as elsewhere in the CSIRO, there is evidence that there is not as yet any substantive organisational framework in place in respect of the relationships between funding bodies, research agencies and user groups which will ensure that commodity groups are able to capture the optimal returns possible from research activities. Consider the following quote from the CSIRO report: Declining State government allocations towards research for rural industries, the need for close cooperation between scientists working at the strategic end of the research spectrum with those adapting the new technology for industry use and the need for industry involvement at the planning stage emphasise the need for a collaborative approach towards the planning and implementation of research on a national basis. The matter of the coordination of the rural research effort ought rightly to take precedence at the forthcoming Premiers Conference and should be subject to closer analysis by the Prime Minister's Science and Technology Council. While the Premiers Conference might lay down some working principles for cooperation, the Science and Technology Council alone provides the forum for building constructive relationships across the rural research effort. If the existing science and technology administrative machinery is to prove its mettle, here is its chance. This is a matter which was raised in the editorial of Search, the journal of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science-ANZAAS-in last December's issue; I commend it to the House. It is necessary to appreciate that the issue it of the national benefits of rural research is not one of measuring the outcomes in a technical manner of particular R&D activities. Having a lot of good agricultural science around might make us feel good but it is not going to affect the important economic and commercial issues facing the nation or the rural industry. The various R&D programs must be geared to marketing, they must be geared to controlling quality, and they must be driven from planting to the end market by the expectations of consumers. This is the only way in which the rural research sector can derive solid, long term benefits from its very significant contributions to its own R&D capabilities. This means that everyone in the industry has to work together and establish an even more unified chain of activity from production through to final distribution. Every player or stakeholder must have an acute appreciation of the needs of the wider process which he or she is part of. This is what I mean about closer coordination. The rural research sector is full of bit players concerned with their own immediate interests. We need a culture of rural research which is in tune with the long term development of the relevant markets. It is vital that I add that this perspective must be underpinned by greater efforts by government to strip away the price and costs and other structural impediments which stand in the way of further processing of rural commodities. Australia has not failed to develop value added processing based industries because it is dumb and needs to become clever; it has failed to do so because there has been no economic incentive to deploy resources into this undeveloped sector. We have not seized opportunities in advanced commodity processing because the commercial impediments and structural disincentives have been so powerful that no-one has dared to go into this end of the market. Have a look at every choke point on the processing chain, from transportation to indirect taxes to wage costs and other input fees and charges. At every point we are internationally uncompetitive. If the Government is serious about trying to build up a more progressive and export oriented rural sector, it might get down to creating the economic environment which fires these processes. It does no good blaming the industry for its myopia or blindness. It does no good trying to bribe industry groups to commit resources to processing activities of specific types; we have to create the overall commercial climate which drives the whole industry towards advanced processing and manufacturing of commodities. Importantly, it is also necessary to realise that commercial climate feeds back into the research and development base. It brings new life to it; it attracts new resources and infrastructure; and it builds on all those relationships I mentioned earlier because it demonstrates that the market, when it can work, places value on intellectual inputs and knowledge and planning. In this regard, it is also worth noting that stronger emphasis must be placed on rural research skills and education. The key function of government is to provide for skills development and research training opportunities. This should be pursued on the basis of providing even more extensive opportunities for industry involvement. Currently, the agricultural sector lacks a beacon for training and research. It lack institutional vehicles for expressing its capabilities and communicating its future, especially in the secondary school network. There are improvements in the post-secondary school and TAFE systems, but we have a long way to go yet. In an important way, the agriculture sector is still to take its own future in its hands. Creative administrative solutions to the problems as outlined might yield some returns, but substantive change will not grip until there is a community of views across the agricultural sector as to the role of innovation and change. Though it shoulders unfair burdens relative to other industries in the economy, the agricultural sector cannot afford to fall into despair or neglect the struggle to consolidate its future. That is a struggle which will be won or lost not by bureaucrats or administrators but by those who are now at work within Australia's primary industries. It is a struggle which must be complemented in practical ways by the government of the day, and critically so with regard to freeing up economic and investment resources across the sector, especially by breaking through the cost and structural barriers which stand in the way of rural industries' capacities to add further still to the national benefit.",31
40,Mr GAYLER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I indicate at the outset that I appreciate the opportunity of joining in this debate with my this colleagues the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), all of whom have a very keen interest in the industry and the future of the industry-not just in their electorates, but in northern New South Wales and the eastern coastline of Queensland. I will be restricting a my comments specifically to research within the sugar industry, which is what the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill is all about. I listened with some degree of interest to the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), in relation to research in a general sense. I think a lot of what he said was correct and quite interesting. Research is something that can be better put forward by more cooperation between governments at all levels and the rural sector. When we talk about cooperation between governments at all levels and the rural sector, and when we talk about the sugar industry, we get back to the situation that has existed for almost 80 years now, where the sugar industry was regarded as almost a closed industry. I travelled through my area, particularly those parts related to the sugar industry, with the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who contributed so much to the industry, and I listened to him advise-not cajole, but advise-the sugar industry ad nauseam to look at a broader approach to research within the industry. At that time it did not even contribute to, or seek Federal funding for, research within the industry. Research was done solely through-and I emphasise the words 'solely through'industry contribution. Whilst that was not an insignificant contribution to research in the sugar industry, it took almost five years for the Federal Government to convince those at an executive level in the sugar industry in Queensland to get involved at a Federal level and seek Federal support for research. That is borne out by the fact that the principal Act was only introduced in 1987. That was another initiative of this Government, in cooperation with the sugar industry, by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). One could say that we are now looking at an upgrading or an increase in research from the original Act some five years ago. I suppose I am fortunate that I am able to speak on this Bill, having had some hands-on experience within the sugar industry. It is trite to say that for two years I was Chairman of the Mossman Local Sugar Cane Prices Board. I have appeared as an advocate before the Central Sugar Cane Prices Board. My experience within the industry-whilst certainly not at the grower level, but more legislative or regulatory level-is such that I believe I have a very good knowledge of this industry.. If we look at the more recent history of industry-I do not intend to go back over the 80 years I have already referred to-we see that it has had its ups and downs, as do most rural or primary industries. If we look at the cyclical nature of the industry, we can understand the difficulty this industry faces. When I came to this Parliament, it was the most predominant and major industry in my electorate. It has been well overtaken by tourism, but it is no less significant. I follow the fortunes of the industry with a great deal of interest. Research into the sugar industry will be boosted by the timely increase in the levy, which was sought by the industry itself. I hope that the industry places a higher emphasis on research within the very wet areas of sugar cane production in Queensland; an area that I believe has been overlooked in the past, and an area that will become more important as rural land on the eastern seaboard becomes even more scarce through urban and other forms of development. I support this Bill. It is another initiative of this Government to support an industry which is extremely important to this nation. It is a continuation of our support for the industry over the years. If we comb very carefully through the record of this industry, we will find that, over the years, the only government that has given substantial direct support to the Australian sugar industry has been the Labor Government. It puts into place the myth that exists in some areas of this country-a myth which is quickly disappearing-that the National Party is the saviour of those in the rural sector. If we ask the people who have been involved in the sugar industry for many years where their support has come from in the last decade, we will get only one answer: not the government of the day has been the only government at a Federal level to support the industry. I conclude my remarks by saying that I am extremely pleased that the Federal Government is cooperating comprehensively at the with the State Government in the future adjustment of the sugar industry. The relationship between the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Casey, and the the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is extremely good, and that can only be for the bettennent of the industry, not just in the short tenn, but in the long tenn as well. The sugar industry is critical, not just to north Queensland, but to the nation as a whole as a major export earner. We have had some comments made by those opposite about the lack of interest of this Government in the sugar industry. I have already outlined that that is not the case. The more recent debate on the reduction of tariffs within the industry is a glowing example-a patently clear example-of where the best interests of the sugar farmers of this nation lie in the future. Not only did we have the two National Party senators running out of control around Queensland-knowing little or nothing of the sugar industry, and clearly showing that through their ignorance and totally irresponsible and irrelevant statements-but we now have members of the major party in the coalition, the Liberal Party, also indicating in sugar growing areas in far north Queensland that the reduction of tariff by this Government is too severe and too fast. However, when one compares that with what we are going to see if, in the unlikely event, those opposite take the treasury bench, it will not be just a reduction in the tariff level, but a complete eradication of it. As I said at the outset, I am very pleased to contribute to today's debate on this legislation. It is a substantiation of the original which was introduced by this Government in 1987. I support the current legislation and the future increase in levies and Commonwealth contribution for research into what is, as I have said over and again, a very important industry for this nation.",34
41,Mr TUCKEY,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (12.11 p.m.)As previous speakers have infonned the House, this legislation is associated with increasing the research and development levy for the sugar industry from lOc to 15c a tonne. That, we are advised, is a matter that has the support of the industry. When we look at some of· the information which, for instance, points out that presently the sugar industry is spending about 0.17 per cent of gross value of production as compared with the wool, meat, wheat and oilseed industries which spend 0.5 per cent of gross value of production, and when the Government is prepared to agree to a dollar for dollar subsidy to a value of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production, there is obviously a need for the industry to put more into the area of research. I do not think there is any dispute in this Parliament that research and development expenditure is a necessity and is something which, provided it is properly managed, should be encouraged at all times. This is the age of technology; this is the age of refonn. Sugar growers, wheat growers and meat producers should be finding ways of investing in the improvement of their industry. I want to underline the words 'development' and 'improvement' because frequently when we talk about research we immediately turn our minds to science. There is no reason to ignore the efforts of our scientists today and, in particular, the wonderful organisation we call CSIRO. On so many occasions their efforts benefit many Australians. We read recently that the American Government has made a decision to open up consumer goods created through genetic engineering and make them available to the general public. I was interested to hear that one of the products that will be sold shortly is that of a plant or vegetable that has had inserted into it a gene of the flounder-the Bill fish. Apparently the gene has been inserted into the plant so it can better resist climatic conditions such as coldness, et cetera. It seems to me that plants are about to get a dose of cod liver oil. It is interesting to see that science is going down this road and being successful. No doubt at this point and previous to the conclusion of my speech most members of parliament, most sugar cane growers and others would be presuming that the welfare of their industry was best served by spending this money in the scientific arena. Whilst I would say it would always be appropriate to spend some of the money in that arena, I thought today I might put the case as to why some of these funds might be directed to other areas. The welfare of an industry is well recognised today in its capacity to not only increase productivity-for instance, of a sugar cane plant-but also improve the handling of the material and the harvesting. In my living memory, in Summer of the Seventeenth Doll sugar cane was harvested by hand. One wonders how competitive we would be today if we had to revert to that process. Research and development have created machines that do that work and do it very successfully. Notwithstanding that we do not cut cane with a machete and the brawn and muscle of individuals any more, the role of individual workers is still a very significant aspect of the efficiency of the sugar industry. Similarly, the role of government is very significant to the competitiveness of the sugar industry. I will not be the first speaker in this debate to mention some of the coalition's policies as recorded in its Fightback document. Whereas others have tried to insert this as an opportunity to get at us, I want to point out under the heading of research and development why there is good reason for these industries to ask themselves-and to spend some of this money-where they would benefit and be made more competitive. Some 90-plus per cent of the sugar we grow is exported. I often remind people that in the export market only three questions are ever asked: How good? How soon? How much? It is a fact of life that foreign importers are not too worried about how things are going back here in Australia. They are not too worried about how our industrial relations system works or how we tax our producers. They just want to know how good, how soon and how much. Unfortunately, Australians quite frequently have great difficulty answering those questions in the proper fashion. I think it is time that industries such as sugar industry said to themselves, 'Notwithstanding the commitment we have to research and development in the scientific arena, what else is needed to make our industry more competitive and, therefore, to expand and to make sure that in tough times there is a better return to the individual at end of the chain, the one we all talk about but frequently help very little-the person who grows the product?'. Whilst I do not have the job of representing anybody who grows sugar, I certainly represent the largest group of farmers to be found in any electorate in Australia. Those people face similar problems to those in the sugar industry in that they have to export onto these markets. What are the problems that are being confronted by the sugar industry in the way this country is run today? We have a process, entrenched in the laws of this Parliament, called centralised wage fixing. The issue of wages is very sensitive. Most politicians, myself included, are anxious to see the welfare of the wage earner improved; but I for one, unlike some others, know that we improve the welfare of a worker only when we give him a wage increase in real termsin other words, a little above what inflation is taking away. I might add: a little above what inflation and the tax system-bracket creep, the result of inflation-take away. That is when a worker benefits. We hear remarks about a minimum wage of about $3 an hour in America. We are not reminded that people can buy a pair of good quality jeans for $US3S. So what is a fair wage? A fair wage is something that allows somebody to keep a family at local cost of living in a reasonable circumstance. It has nothing to do with how much money one gets. Frequently we find in Australia that the more money one gets the more in percentage terms the tax man gets and the less one has to keep one's family. Having had the New Zealand situation poked down my throat in this Parliament for the past six months, the current silence of the Government on New Zealand is very noticeable, and we know why. New Zealand, which has undertaken many of the reforms the that are proposed in the Fightback document, has just achieved an $80m current account surplus-not trade, not export of manufactured goods. It is the first current account surplus for New Zealand in 20 years; It seems that something over there is working. But it is better than that. In regard to the welfare of the employees, I got the High Commission to fax me an extract from its statistical return which advises us that for the last quarter, under these apparently draconian measures-as the Government and the trade union movement would have us believe-real wages in New Zealand have gone up by 1.3 per cent. That compares with a figure in Australia for the 12 months to December 1991 of plus 0.5 per cent-less than half; and for the nine months to December 1991, minus one per cent. We have not really delivered much for the workers. There might be something for the workers in what the New Zealanders are on about. There is another aspect of this relating to the workers in the sugar industry. Notwithstanding that a farmer has to pay something like $300,000 for a piece of machinery simply to harvest the crop, he then has to put it into a little train or a truck and send it off to a sugar mill. This massive sugar mill represents a huge capital investment and ideally should operate 24 hours a day. Some might do so; others do not, as with the canning factories and all the other consumers of sugar. They do not operate because our centralised wage fixing system demands that an employee working the first hour on the second shift of the day has to be paid 11/2 times the wages of the person who worked the previous shift. We call it shift penalty. The union movement will tell us that it has achieved that benefit for the workers. But driving around Australia through industrial areas, past sugar mills and all sorts of places, in most cases we find that they are closed during those working hours. When the employers sit down and estimate the cost of that capital sitting idle against this imposition of higher wages, they come down on the side of locking the gate. That is a great victory for the workers. Those who should be working on the second shift and the third shift are not working at all. They are not missing out on half the wages of their colleagues as a penalty rate, they are missing out on the grand total. They get nothing. The sugar industry needs its mills and those people who consume its. product in turning fruit and other items into canned products which can be marketed in many Asian areas in particular to operate around the clock. It needs the Bundaberg distillery to operate around the clock and to be highly efficient for every one of those hours. It is interesting that sugar is invariably associated with heat. The sugar is extracted from the juices using a large amount of heat and more heat is used in cooking up the brew to make the rum. All these heating processes are in relatively isolated areas, and in most cases natural gas cannot be used because a pipe does not go there. So what do they use? Automotive distillate. What does this Government do to automotive distillate? It puts 26c a litre tax on it. If the researchers who will spend the money this Parliament is proposing to vote to them today were to do some research, it would take them very little time to find that our industry would be much more efficient and would be able to expand and create jobs at every level if we just got that tax monkey off its back. Fightback proposes just that. As a consequence, the cost of this tax involved in the workers driving out to the sugar cane fanns to drive the tractors will be reduced. The costs of the fanner will be reduced in the same way because, notwithstanding that the diesel he puts into the sugar cane harvester is free of that tax, the fuel on the train that takes his cane away, or the fuel in his car that he drives into town to negotiate his next loan with the bank, is not tax free. It is not free on any of those things. He can buy a four-wheel drive that is free of tax. But they are hugely expensive and he probably does not need a four-wheel drive. Under Fightback he can buy a simple little ute, a motor bike or a sedan, provided that it is for the use of his business, and he will pay no sales tax and no GST. What is more, when the sugar mill sends him the cheque for his grain crop, it will send him an amount plus 15 per cent. In his cheque he will receive an extra 15 per cent for his sugar cane. He will bank it-and the bank manager will be pleased about that. He will sit on it for at least a couple of months, at which point he will be able to deduct from that amount of money any tax that he has paid-any GST tax that he has paid-on the inputs to his business, be it that new ute or tractor, fuel, fertiliser and so on. He could deduct all of that and send the tax man only what was left over. Of course, that will improve his efficiency, because it avoids a thing called 'cascading'. This is what I want the researchers to spend some of this money on. I want them to go into the cascading effect on an industry such as sugar. There is a thing called payroll tax. We have heard-I think it was the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) who told usthat sugar cane growers do not pay payroll tax. Not much! The cascade effect guarantees that because they pay tax on everything that they buy. What do they think the fertiliser manufacturer pays? He pays payroll tax. What does the honourable member for Hinkler think the transport companies pay? What does he think the sugar mills pay? What do those opposite think all of these other firms that they rely on for services and goods do? They all pay payroll tax and they build it into their prices, and it flows down to the next one and they pay it. The generous body called the Industrial Relations Commission then gives its workers another $10, of which the tax man immediately takes $5. But the payroll tax goes up on the $10. It is driving people into the ground; it is $6,000m. The backs of sugar growers carrying these cascade burdens. are probably more bent than those blokes who used to cut the cane. Trucks carry fuel that is burnt at Bundaberg Rum or at the various crushing mills. That fuel is being transported by road in a truck and is taxed. The sales tax on the prime mover is costing the ownerdriver $900 a month in lease payments and the tax on the fuel he consumes to deliver the fuel is costing him another $2,500 a month. Do those opposite think he says, 'Well, I know life is tough for the sugar growers. I'll absorb those taxes. I won't pass them on'. Of course he passes them on. But the misfortune of the sugar grower as an exporter is that he does not write it on the bottom of the docket. He does not say, 'To my labour and to my profit and to taxes'which are about 30 per cent of his operating revenue. So how does the sugar company get that tax back? It cannot. It is time that these researchers put some of this money into establishing that. They will have to find a pretty interesting gene to put into sugar cane to make it produce enough sugar to match what the Fightback policy will give to the workers, to match the growth that the Fightback policy will give to the industry. As much as I am in favour of scientific research, there is a real need for the researchers to say, 'Well, just hang off for a minute. Let's go and see which is the quickest way to get an immediate benefit for the sugar industry to make it more competitive out there in the world, to double the size of it'. Do honourable members know the answer that these researchers-these men of exact mind; these scientists-will come up with? Two words: 'Vote Liberal'; 'Vote National'. That is all that they have to recommend; the rest will happen. It is a very interesting area of research to benefit workers and industry but, most importantly, to benefit Australia. There is no doubt that this Government has generated growth in this country-and it has borrowed every penny of it. Now, of course, we are paying 25 per cent of the value of all exports, sugar included, to service those debts. That has happened only twice in the history of this country: during the 1930s Depression and during the 1890s depression. And others say that we have not had a depression! I hope that those researchers will read my speech. There is a huge opportunity, with very little effort, to spend a bit of this money to find a simple way to get the sugar industry up and growing. I challenge those on the other side to get out and represent the interests of their constituents in this fashion.",36
42,Mr HARRY WOODS,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"It is certainly noticeable that the four members from this side of the House who have spoken have a vital interest in the sugar industry; they all represent seats where the sugar industry is very important. It is also noticeable that of those speakers from the other side only one was from a seat representing the sugar industry. The reluctance also of the speakers from the Opposition to get into the real issues facing the sugar industry has been noted in this debate. Later I will cover just there. It is that a bit further. The aim of the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992 is to increase the maximum rate of the levy on sugar to 15c a tonne. The levy is paid on sugar which is produced in Australia and which is accepted for processing at sugar mills. At present the maximum rate that the levy can be raised to is lOc a tonne. Regulations to raise the levy from 6c a tonne to lOc a tonne were passed recently as an interim measure pending the passing of this legislation. This Bill is the result of recommendations from the Australian raw sugar industry. The request has come from the Australian Cane Growers Council, the Australian Cane Farmers Association and the Australian Sugar Milling Council. The industry levy provides funds for the activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The request for this increase demonstrates the industry'S commitment to research and its desire to enhance the competitiveness of the sugar industry, both through exports and on the domestic market through this Conimonwealth scheme. The Government is committed to matching the Sugar Research and Development Corporation on a dollar for dollar basis, up to limit of half a per cent of the gross value of production of sugar which has had that levy paid. The increased rate of levy is in accord with the Federal Government's policy for rural research and development. This policy encourages increased contributions by primary industry. In addition, it is generally recognised that the research and development in the sugar industry at present is inadequately funded compared with research and development programs in other rural industries. At present, about 0.17 per cent of GYP is matched in the sugar industry, compared with about half a per cent in wool, wheat, meat and oil seed industries, or about one-third of the amount in'those industries. The sugar industry is one of Australia's very important agricultural industries. It as Australia's third most valuable export crop, coming behind wheat and cotton. Over three-quarters of the production is exported. More than 90 per cent of total Australian production of sugar comes from Queensland, with the remainder coming from the Northern Rivers of New South Wales. Although, in an Australian context, New South Wales is the smaller producer, the sugar industry is nonetheless a very important industry in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales and in my electorate of Page. In New South Wales sugar cane is grown by about 550 growers in the three river valleys of the Tweed, Richmond and Clarence. Cane production is not irrigated any differently to many areas of Queensland, and flood mitigation and drainage are significant production costs. In New South Wales cane is harvested from about 18 months to two years of growth; in Queensland it is harvested after about 15 months of growth. In 1991 approximately 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, from 1.45 million tonnes of sugar cane, was produced in New South Wales. This equates to about 7 per cent of Australia's raw sugar production. The New South Wales Sugar Milling Cooperative, to which all New South Wales growers belong, owns and operates the three mills at Condong, Broadwater and Harwood. A refinery with a capacity to produce 250,000 the tonnes of refined sugar is located at Harwood. Raw sugar from the three mills is sold to the Harwood refinery, and currently all refined sugar is sold on the domestic market. It is worth noting that all domestic sugar from New South Wales is sold on the domestic market. The New South Wales industry is encouraging growers to expand cane production over the next 10 years by about 40 per cent in. order to utilise that excess of refined sugar capacity. In 1991 about 40,000 tonnes of raw sugar was purchased for refining at Harwood from the Queensland Sugar Corporation to fulfil contracts that the New South Wales industry had. The situation is that growing conditions have been good for the current season, and sugar production is expected to reach 190,000 ranks tonnes in 1992. That is due to seasonal conditions, good rainfall and generally advantageous conditions for the sugar industry on the north coast of New South Wales. The international outlook for sugar is that sugar prices are expected to fall to US8c a pound in 1991-92, which is down from the average price of US9.3c last year and US13.9c a pound the previous year. Medium tenn prices should continue to be cyclical. The price cycle of the early 1990s is likely, however, to be shorter and shallower than cycles of the 1980s. Prices are expected low over the next two to three years, followed by the cyclical increase to maybe 12c a pound in the middle of the decade. World production is projected to increase a slower rate than the growth in world condustry sumption. By the middle of the decade, production is likely to rise as world prices rise. Consumption is currently low in Asia, about 12 kilograms per person, and that is expected to· be the main region of conalso sumption growth through the 1990s, but it will be offset by a probable decline in conthe sumption in eastern Europe. Import demand is expected to show little increase over the medium tenn. In Australia, cane production in 1991-92 is estimated to have declined 15 per cent from the 1990 season, mainly because of drought. The level will be 21.3 million tonnes, resulting million tonnes of sugar-a reduction of 0.4 million tonnes. Export returns are forecast to be down raw $639m in 1991-92, down by a level of end $233m, which is a reflection of both production and the low prices. Returns to cane production are forecast to fall by 23 per cent in 1991-92 to $585m. Sugar production is forecast by ABARE at 3.4 million tonnes for 1992-93. Over the medium in sugar plantings are forecast to result in sugar production rising to around 4.5 million tonnes in 1996-97. Looking at those figures, we see that there is no doubt that the sugar industry tough time in the last few years and will continue to have a tough time in the short with tenn, mainly because of crook weather, low confirmed prices, corrupt markets-all of which make government life difficult for sugar producers. These for difficulties, which are reflected by those tariffs ABARE forecasts, mean that the needs to be able to consider industry needs for future policy. There needs to be cooperation between the Government and industry in fonnulating responses, especially to the Industry Commission's report. industry needs to respond to the Industry Commission's report in a way which sets out its plans for progression-progressing towards the greater efficiency, productivity, comto be petitiveness and growth. The industry can take hope from the comments of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that he and the at Government will not be driven by the InCommission report. The report will not be used by the Government as a benchmark or a blueprint. It is a document that needs to at be considered. But, along with it and the consideration of it, responses of the industry need to be taken into account. The just arguments that the industry puts forward on Industry Commission report will be given the weight that they deserve by the Government. This is something that the Government will do, but the Opposition cannot and will not do. Mr Harry Bonanno, the Chainnan of the Canegrowers Association, is quoted in the in 3 Northern Farmer on 24 April as saying: In the final outcome, if any party policy statement is so inflexible as to not accommodate the rightful needs of an industry as important as the sugar industry, then either that statement will up being changed or those who support the the low statement should be changed. In the light of that statement, it is worth considering who that statement is directed at. Bearing it in mind, it is worth considering again whether it is directed at the Leader of tenn, increases the Opposition. In the Australian Canegrower on 18 May Ian Ballantyne, General Manager of the Canegrowers Association, is reported in these terms, after a 45-minute meeting with the has had a Leader of the Opposition: Mr Ballantyne said that a 45 minute meeting the Opposition Leader, John Hewson had the Coalition's position that if elected to there would be no special arrangements the sugar industry, or for any industry, and the would continue to be progressively reduced Government towards zero from 1993. That is pretty unambiguous. It is worth noting here that the draft report of the Industry the Commission on the sugar industry was brought down well before the Fightback! The document was finalised. There is no qualification of the Industry Commission report on the sugar industry in Fightback. If we put that together with the result of Mr Ballantyne's meeting with the Leader of the Opposition, it surely demonstrates the Opposition's support for that document, which proposes zero tariffs by 1998. That is not the position of the Government. Our position in responding to the Industry Commission's report has been clearly stated by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy-the position of negotiation and cooperation with the industry. Mr Bruce Scott-What is your position?",39
43,Mr HARRY WOODS,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"One can look to the Government's initiatives in responding to the Industry Commission's report on the dairy industry to see the sincerity of our position. The results of the negotiations and cooperation between that industry and the Government demonstrated that a result can be achieved which is widely recognised by the dairy industry and all connected with it. There is no reason why a similar outcome cannot be found for the sugar industry. This process that the Government has undertaken is the way forward. It is a long way from the inflexibility of the Opposition. The sugar industry is undoubtedly scared by the Industry Commission report, and by the support of the Opposition for zero tariffs by 1998, as the dairy industry was previously.  Queensland shadow Minister for primary industry, had this to say: I believe there is no doubt that the coalition will lose seats in Queensland in the sugar belt, and we only have two seats in the sugar belt left. Further, the Leader of the National Party in Queensland, Mr Borbidge, said that, if he cannot convince the coalition to rethink the issue on tariffs, the Queensland Nationals may have to reconsider their support for Fightback. The real position on this important issue of tariffs is that, when the Opposition talks about negligible protection, it is not talking about negligible tariffs; it is talking about protection by way of the exchange rate. I quote from a report from Statewide on ABC between Peter Gooch and the Leader of the National Party lastMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! I realise that there are some issues raised in this debate which would not immediately leap to mind when one sees the second reading speech. However, the honourable member for O'Connor did take care to make what he was saying relevant. I think the honourable member for Page ought to indicate that what he is saying is relevant to the Bill.",42
44,Mr HARRY WOODS,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I think tariffs and sugar and the current issues of the sugar industry are very relevant to this Bill. In fact, Opposition speakers have spoken about tariffs. Not only that, but the honourable member for O'Connor ranged far and wide to New Zealand and industry policyMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member for O'Connor indicated fairly clearly the grounds on which he was claiming relevance of what he was saying. I am suggesting to the honourable member for Page that, if he wants to raise the issue of tariffs, he has to say why it is relevant to the subject of this Bill.",42

55,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The schoolboy stuff that we get from over there! I am happy to say that I proposed to the committee of the Caucus of the Government today and it accepted, as the Cabinet subsequently accepted and then presented to Caucus, a revolutionary new policy for pay television in Australia. The basis of that policy is that the Government will seek to establish a new operator in the Australian media that is not owned or partly owned by either any of the existing operators, that is the existing free to air television companies, telecommunications carriers or large newspaper groups. In other words, Australia will have a new media entrant which has no shares in and owns no part of the old media areas of print, television or telecommunications. That will mean in the development of satellite pay television that the first four transponders on the satellite, which will be issued upon bidding, will find that there will be a pay TV operator in drama, film, sport, et cetera, which will be virtually a new entrant to the Australian media. As part of the policy, on transponders five and six there will be no equity restrictions. These will be available to the free to air television operators, the telecommunications companies, Telecom and Optus, any of the large newspaper groups and any other interested party, be it a supplier of drama or television or film product. This presents a new and revolutionary competitive model in pay television; in the first instance, a new operator, independent of the existing multimedia arrangements and combinations in. Australia, to provide to Australia and the Australian people four - hannels of pay television from the satellite which is available now and can be available to access 94 per cent of the population with existing technology and which will not be compromised by interests of the television networks or the telecommunications operators. On the other hand, on transponders 5 and 6 there will be an opportunity for the people who want to advance the new technologiescable, fibre optics, MDS and any of the other technologies-combined with the abilities and capital of the networks, the telecommunications companies or the film and television product suppliers. It seems that the Government will be able to offer Australians the best of both worlds: a new entrant to supply entertainment and sport on pay television while at the same time leaving open the technological opportunities and technological innovation of cable, MOS, fibre optics, and the rest. Mr Downer-Why does this differ from Sunday?",43

As I said in the House a day or so ago, the changes in the micro-economy have come from Labor, Labor, Labor; it has always been Labor.

58,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The revolutionary change of putting Qantas and Australian Airlines together, offering the combined airline for sale, and developing a second carrier in this country will revolutionise air services, in same way as this initiative will revolutionise pay television and the media. You may have your embarrassed, giggly laugh, but that is truth. I make the point again that only the Government will make the big macroeconomic changes. In this case, the only restrictions which will apply across this new medium of pay and cable television is a restriction on foreign ownership of 35 per cent in the aggregate and a 20 per cent limit on any individual. Need I say, the Government has also remained committed to a 10 per cent level of local content across medium to support our own film and television industry. I can also say that the Government will be supporting the ABC with capital funding in the event of its bidding for any places on transponders Nos. 5 and 6, as it will be prohibited from bidding for transponders Nos. 1 to 4. I believe the Government can truthfully and faithfully say that that does usher revolution in television services in this country. Let me repeat: the creativity is on this side of the House; the innovation is on this side of the House; and the courage is on this side of the House. Aviation: Merger of Airlines",44
59,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister for Finance. Can the Minister inform the House of the benefits for Australia of the proposed merger of Qantas and Australian Airlines and the following sale?,44
60,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There will be substantial benefits all round to the airlines concerned their passengers, to the nation through the greater capacity of our airlines to compete, and to the Government in regard to its Budget. The merger is a better outcome for the Government, as a seller, and for the airlines. That is because of the synergies or efficiencies that the merger will enable us to achieve. They have been put by the airlines and our advisers at well over $100m per annum. When capitalised, that adds several hundred million dollars to the value of the airlines. The combined airline will be much more efficient than each of the two on a the stand-alone basis. Therefore, it is much more able to be competitive, much more able to provide competitive fares to its customers the and is also worth more to the Government ithe sale process. In regard to the proposal to sell 100 per cet,tt, rather than 49 per cent, of Qantas, I pomt out that 49 per cent would not have brought much return to the Budget because the recapitalisation requirement of the two airlines combined is in the order of $1.5 billion. Most of the revenue from a 49 per cent sale would have been needed to meet the Government's share of recapitalisation. The the sale of 100 percent avoids the need for the Government to fund any of that recapitalisation, so it provides us with a much better Budget outcome-well over $1 billion. Quite clearly, there are benefits all round, as I have said. What has the Opposition said about it? In the face of those facts, we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that we are in a selling off the family silver. We have the Leader of the Opposition saying that we are desperate for a dollar. Why are they saying that? They are saying that because we are selling 100 per cent of Qantas-which is their policy. They say, 'If we propose the sale of 100 per cent of Qantas this is very sound policy and everyone should applaud us for it'. But if the Government does it, they say, 'You are desperate for a dollar; you're selling the family silver'. You are trying to have it every which way. It is just sour grapes.

62,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But the Leader of the Opposition was even more outrageous than that. He claimed that our policy was not promoting competition. He said we were establishing a '2-domestic/international airlines system'. In his press statement yesterday, he said: Rather than a ""new aviation Nirvana"", as the Prime Minis-er has suggested, he has simply generalised his widely criticised ""2-domestic airlines system"" to a ""2-domestic/international airlines system"". All the talk of competition has gone, and with it has the possibility of significantly lower domestic airfares. What an unbelievable comment that is! It is breathtaking in its cynicism and gross inaccuracy. He talks about 'his' - meaning the Prime Minister's- 'widely criticised ""2-domestic airlines system""'. Honourable members know the history of that; but I remind anyone who has forgotten that this system is not our system: the two domestic airlines system was your system. The Liberal and National parties put it in place in 1952. They kept it going through all of the years that they were in government and they stitched it up for at least eight years from 1981. Dr Hewson interjecting",44
63,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition just said, 'You've been in office all of these years; what did you do about it?'. He does not even know that the previous Government-the Fraser Governmentstitched it up for eight years, so it was not possible for us to deregulate the domestic system until around the time that we did it in November 1990. Of course, since that time we have had a deregulated domestic market. It is an open, contestable market. We have had a new entrant who, certainly, has failed; but another entrant is limbering up and is hoping to start shortly. In One Nation, we opened the market further to Air New Zealand by proposing a single Australasian aviation market, thus bringing more competition. We did the same thing with the international aviation market. We have greatly expanded competition against Qantas from airlines of other countries. In One Nation, we scrapped the single designation policy-which was the policy that you pursued all the time that you were in government-and brought u. the possibility of other aviation operators from Australia. We have a Bill coming into the Parliament this week to provide for a tribunal to allocate route rights for new operators, as well as Qantas. In One Nation, we also announced our intention to develop a multiple designation regime for Australasian carriers in the international market. That means that Air New Zealand will be able to operate out of Australia in the international market as an Australian operator. In the face of all of that, the Leader of the Opposition says that we are not about competition. Who is this bloke trying to have on? Of course, other people are not so stupid or so prepared to try to play politics; they_ are prepared to address the real issues. Let us look at what the Tasmanian tourism Minister, Peter Hodgman, had to say today on ABC radio in Hobart. He was asked about this matter and he said: I think it's tremendous news. It really is great news, when I heard the Prime Minister announce it yesterday. I mean it's got everything right about Tasmania. The honourable member for Franklin should take note. He continued: The fact that we have now got the proposed combining of Australian Airlines and Qantas gives us a direct international penetration into all international markets. I mean it's great news. And I think the prices should come down. . . The Leader of the Opposition says there will be no competition and no benefits for the customers. But Peter Hodgman said: I think the prices should come down. . . you'll pay international rates from Hobart in a one-stop shop ticket. And I mean it's very exciting prospects. That is a realistic appraisal from a Liberal Minister who is looking at the facts and not trying to score cheap political points. In this issue, as with APPM, those opposite have an awful lot to learn from the Tasmanian Government. Superannuation",45
64,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER Mr Snowdon interjecting,45
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory will cease interjecting.,46
66,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I ask whether he recalls his answer in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition on 6 May on the impact of the superannuation guarantee levy when he said: . . . . it would not be an addition but, rather, a substitution for wages and salaries which would otherwise be paid as cash. Will the Prime Minister confirm that a deal has been done with the ACTU under which the super levy will not count towards the next wage case and that his Government will support the full ACTU claim for a national wage rise later this year? Why did he mislead the House on 6 May?",46
67,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do not be absurd. Mr Speaker, there is a simple notion about. The assumption that if the superannuation guarantee levy is not paid there will be no cost whatsoever to employers is a false one because it would be paid otherwise as wages. That is not to say-and it will not be the case-that it will be paid to the exclusion of increases in wages, because both can be paid. As I indicated, we will need only to devote a third of the productivity available in the next few years to pay this increase in the course of the 1990s. I met the ACTU last week and drew attention to the One Nation commitment to support for a continuing role for national wage cases. The Government will determine its attitude to the size and timing of national wage increases in the li-ht of the objective of keeping Australia's inflation rate comparable with those of our trading partners. May I add that in the One Nation statement we have the commitment from the ACTU for the first time for organised labour in this country ever to commit itself to a wages policy that will guarantee an inflation rate comparable with that of our trading partners. I said that, given the present information we had about inflation, earhings growth and output growth, there would appear to be room for a national wage increase and the SGCthe superannuation guarantee levy-in the course of 1992-93, consistent with our inflation target. However, I gave no commitment on the timing of the increase or the quantum of the increase. In fact, the ACTU has not yet formulated a claim and there have been no discussions with the Government on quantum or timing. I also mentioned Treasury evidence to the Senate which showed that, on even a modest forecast of productivity growth, the guarantee levy's implementation over the decade will equal, as I said a minute ago, only one-third of expected productivity gains. For a sensible development of superannuation, a sensible development of a retirement incomes policy for higher standards of living for the retired aged, particularly those who will join the retired aged population around 2010 and 2015, the baby boomers from beyond the Second World War, demographically doubling the number of retired aged persons in the community compared with today, there will need to be in place a retirement incomes system to meet it-not only to provide some relief from the burden on the Commonwealth Budget but also to provide a better standard of living; and, in so doing, provide a necessary and advantageous pool of national savings in the meantime. I should have thought that any opposition would have regarded the development of such a policy as an unambiguously good thing for Australia. Superannuation having been left as the preserve of basically the wealthy, or those in the public sector, denying ordinary Australians a chance to have any access to these superannuation provisions, the Government changed the tax treatment of superannuation in the early to mid-1980s to let",46

170,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have often told the House that the Government has been acutely aware of education and training in this country. From 1983 to 1992 we have seen, in the primary instance, in the compulsory education system, the retention of young people in school rise from 30 per cent to nearly 80 per cent. This higher retention rate in schools has been met by a growth in places in tertiary institutions. We have added 50 per cent of the places to tertiary institutions, where creating the equivalent of 120,000 extra places in universities-the equivalent of 12 campuses-in the period from 1987 to 1992. It is that revolutionary change, again in education participation and in tertiary education, which the Government presided over in the 1980s that has given Australia a chance to climb back up .the ladder as a technological country, as a country with technological abilities, to be able to play its role in Australia. In the One Nation statement the Government also announced that it would be looking for a reformation of the TAFE system to better support vocational education so it can play its role with that other tier of education in Australia-the tertiary institutions. As a result of that we see that vocational education training is a very important part of our education system. We need a truly national system-a system of high quality and high status. That is why there is a commitment in One Nation to vastly improve the TAFE system. That is why the Commonwealth is offering to assume full responsibility for the funding and the administration of TAFE. The reforms are not options but imperatives. We are prepared to take every step that is necessary to achieve them. We are also determined to accelerate the implementation of the reform of entry level training proposed in the Carmichael report. We are looking at new ways to help unemployed young people. Of course there are no simple aIiSwers-no dead-end jobs to be conjured from the past. From some initial discussions we know that it is not just a proper concern in the community; the will to find imaginative solutions is certainly there. Business and industry are already doing things to help. I believe there are the beginnings of a national effort. As I said yesterday, the Government will be doing all it can to encourage such a response. Dr Kemp interjecting",52
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! the honourable member for Goldstein!,53
172,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the near future, I will be holding a meeting with business. people and others who are taking a lead in this area with a view to promoting and consolidating the ideas, the energy and the goodwill of Australians. We are determined to help and not to punish the unemployed, as the Opposition seeks to do by tipping them off unemployment benefit after nine months. We are not abolishing CES offices",53
173,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is wrong!,53
174,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will cease interjecting.,53
175,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and youth access centres which help young people to get jobs and training. We are not proposing dead-end jobs. We are not wafting around in a cloud of nostalgia like the honourable member for Bennelong. We are doing something about young Australians now and in the future-and there is a lot to do. But there are things that can be done. Vocational training and education are at the centre of them. The social safety net must be maintained. Of course the recovery, which we noticed yesterday in the national accounts and articulated by the Treasurer, has to be promoted so that as GOP picks up so too does employment. So in this area of education and training the Government will see that we build in the TAFE system a place in vocational education commensurate with what we have done in universities. I might also say that in One Nation we introduced a $loom program to boost new employment and training opportunities, save existing jobs and strengthen the economy. That will provide assistance for nearly 40,000 young people as well. So, again, the Government, particularly through the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, will be untiring in pulling together a better system of vocational education in TAFE. The negotiations that we are having with the States now are ensuing. Again, it is only as a result of this Government's breaking through with another micro-economic reform of substance that Australian children, students who leave secondary education, who leave the education system, can find themselves in a vocational education system of substance and of status. Earth Summit",53
176,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister would be aware that 100 world leaders, including President Bush of the USA, Mr Major of Britain and Chancellor Kohl of Germany, are travelling to Rio to take part in the Earth Sum,nit. I ask the Prime Minister why he is not attending the Summit when he could leave, say, after the House gets up tomorrow. Is it because he has complete confidence in the competence and ability of our delegation leader, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, or is it because his Government, his faction and his dismal electoral position make it impossible for him to leave the country?",53
177,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There has been more change on the Government side in policy this week than there was under a coalition government in a decade-in a decade. In two days there has been a total reformation of the air transport system. Dr Bob Woods interjecting,54
178,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Lowe!,54
179,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In two days there has been a total reformation of the air transport system of Australia and pay television, as well as the continuing change which we have under way in technical and further education-just in the course of a week. In the 20-odd years I have been here I remember years going by when there were no changes from the then conservative governments-certainly in the microeconomyMrRuddock-It was called stability.",54
180,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Stability; that is right.,54
181,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,54
182,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. The honourable member for Dundas will cease interjecting.,54
183,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Dundas calls it stability. In those days they called it quietly governing'. Of course, the emphasis was on the 'quietly'-very quietly! Provided the white cars were there and the bureaucrats told them what to do, they were happy little mites over therehappy little vegemites, they were, getting into their Commonwealth cars. That is the climate in which the Government is working-a climate of policy change, of feverish policy change. I might say that that is the climate within which the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories departed Australia to attend this conference. Need I say that Australia has been amongst the leading nations in terms of global climate change and ecologically sustainable development, including in Antarctica which, I am happy to say, I first proposed to Prime Minister Rocard in 1988: that is, that Antarctica be turned into a wilderness park, which we finally succeeded in doing. The fact is that there is a protocol to be agreed. at the conference. It is not a protocol the elements of which Australia would have ambitiously supported in its own ambition for greater change in this area; but it is a protocol, nevertheless. The protocol, being one of substance subordinate to our own position, is nevertheless a protocol of substance. Given my duties and obligations to this Parliament, to the policy structure of this Government and to the Australian people, I do not believe it would be an adequate use of Commonwealth resources or my time for me to fly to Rio de Janeiro for a six-minute speech about a protocol which has already been determined. The honourable member for Kooyong would have been there like a shot if he had had an opportunity. He was always well known on the cocktail circuit of the international diplomatic scene, particularly the east coast of the United States. I have nothing against that. He has developed a few friends who have stuck to him over the years. I believe that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories and her colleagues who will join her, including the Minister for Tourism and the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, will stand Australia's interests in great stead and acquit Australia as one of the primary countries with world environmental concerns. May I say, it might even provide leadership to the honourable member for Pearce in his search for the golden thread. While we are disappointed that some of the policy positions that Australia has advocated will not be adopted in the protocol, it is substantial, it is progress; but it does not require a trip across the Pacific by me to make a six-minute speech for a protocol which has already been agreed.

184,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! If the honourable member for O'Connor interjects again I will name him. Superannuation,55
185,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to sing the Treasurer and relates to the issue of superannuation. Has the Treasurer seen nation; reports that the superannuation guarantee needed charge will cost 180,000 jobs? Will the very Treasurer advise the House of the implications for employment, wages, savings and Government's Budget of the SGC and alterYet native proposals for changes to superanpolicy-indeed, nuation arrangements?",55
186,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question which is, as he said, on the issue of superannuation, a matter which the Leader of the Opposition referred to earlier in a question to the Prime proposal. Minister. It should first be pointed out that we have a most appalling scene in the Senate, where the Opposition is trying to lead a charge against a very important reform, a very important measure, which will bestow benefits on hundreds of thousands of Australian working men and women. The Opposition is ganisation, trying to frustrate this initiative in the of any workable policy of its own. It is interested only in trying to destroy a measure which has been put forward by the Government. I refer to the remarks by Mr Ian Salmon, the Managing Director of the AMP Society, in a speech he made yesterday on this topic, when he lamented the fact that the issue has become a political football here in Canberra and quoted with approval the observation the Prime Minister, made a couple of days ago in relation to the position of the Opposition, about the 'mindless obstructionism and vandalism of the Leader of the Opassessment position and his Party in this regard'. Salmon went on to make this observation: For weeks, Federal Parliament and the media have been ablaze with the controversy over Senator Graham Richardson. Did any of this benefit Australia in any way? I doubt it. Did it do anything to help our economic problems? No. Yet day after day and question after question, we have seen the Opposition, led by this bankrupt-and I use the term metaphorically-Leader of the Opposition, trying to distract the attention of the Parliament away from these real issues. Mr Salmon went on to say: But what does not bear any argument is the presneed for a universal system of superannuation: to provide an umbrella of protection over the to provide much of the long term savings to develop the businesSes of Australia . . . Such is the priority of this issue that you could reasonably expect our political partieS to themselves reach some form of consensus on how the to prepare for the nation's future. in the absence of any workable alternative the policy is so flawed that it has been sent off to an adviser who has already told the Opposition that it needs compulsion to make a superannuation scheme work-those opposite are simply trying to wreck, frustrate and delay the Government's Of course, they are not entirely alone in this endeavour; they have the Confederation of Australian Industry doing some of their dirty work. It has become an entirely grubby little organisation in the way in which it has portrayed itself in recent times. This orI think, used to be worth listening absence to; it is no longer worth listening to. Mr Tim Fischer-Because it disagrees with you.",55
187,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. In fact, it disagrees with itself-as I will show the honourable member in a moment. The· CAl, in conjunction with Westpac-and I really do wonder how long Westpac can continue to be a co-signatory to some of the surveys which of are undertaken-put out a press release in March this year. In that press release it said, 'Manufacturing at the bottom but no recovery yet'. Yet this press statement containing that was over the top of a survey result Mr which said that the outlook for general business conditions for the six months ahead had reached its highest level since the September quarter of 1988. Rather than portraying the reality of the survey· results, the CAl will go to any lengths to try to distort these matters, apparently for its own particular purposes and also in order to assist its comrades in arms over there. In December last year it said, 'Disappointing results as recovery hopes stall'. Yet this press statement was on top of a survey result which actually showed that a significantly larger net balance of respondents expected output to increase over the next six months. And the list goes on and on. But the wonder of them all is the· most recent effort by the CAl in relation to the SGC. It put out a statement which said that 180,000 jobs would be lost as a result of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy. It talked about the additional costs which would be imposed upon industry, when, in fact, its own survey revealed that 90 per cent of the work force covered by this survey already had superannuation of 3 per cent or more. It also said that, overwhelmingly, these respondents were small businesses, which, in any event, for the next year under the SGC would have to comply. only with their current obligations as regards the 3 per cent payment. How this could have imposed such an additional expense on business that it would be required to layoff 180,000 people is not clear, until one realises the basis of this particular calculation. The survey found one respondent, with 1,200 employees, who said that even though 90 per cent of his current employees had 3 per cent or more superannuation cover, he was going to have to put off something lil<:e 35 employees as a result of the introduction of the SGC. In other words, this one employer with 1,200 employees, 90 per cent of whom are covered by the requirements of the levy in any event, then said that he would have to put off 35 employees. So what does the CAl do with this? It says, 'Oh well, 35 per cent equals 2.9 per cent of the work force, and if you translated this over the entire economy, it adds up to 180,000 people losing their jobs'. This is a survey of one firm which the CAl is broadcasting around as a reason for supporting this case that there would be 180,000 people losing their jobs as a result of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy. I would have thought that any self respecting business, unless it were a total political zealot, would think twice about paying its subscriptions to the CAl ever again. As far as we are concerned, we look forward to our association with business organisations, particularly those who represent industry sectorsMr Costello interjecting",55

189,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"with whom we have entirely convivial relations, but I do not see why we or anyone else should have to put up with this rubbish that comes out of the CAl, trying to support this bereft Opposition with its non-existent or unworkable superannuation policy, when in fact in doing so it is trying to deny reasonable and legitimate benefits to the overwhelming majority of the work force as they make their own efforts through their employers to prepare for a more comfortable retirement. . Education Institutions: Export Market Development Grants ",56
190,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,56
191,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The House will come to order.  think I will go to the Acting Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. I refer the Acting Minister to the question I asked yesterday: I ask: how many. other education institutions, indebted to the Commonwealth with respect to overseas students unable to obtain visas to Australia, have received export market development grants since the Government became aware of the problem in early 19901 Is it a fact that the Government is seeking to recover some $60m from those institutions and that it has already lodged five actions under the Trade Practices Act to recover $25m? Are those institutions still, notwithstanding those actions by the Government, entitled to receive EMDG payments under the guidelines? Why has the Government failed to develop a coordinated trade strategy, and what efforts will the Government make to ensure that businesses indebted to the Commonwealth are not able to receive funds under the EMDG scheme?",56
192,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not able offhand to answer those specific questions about the debt recovery processes of the Commonwealth, which are not directly related to the portfolio for which I am responsible. I can really only add most of the things that have been repeated to the honourable member before about this scheme. First of all, let me say that, unlike the suggestions the honourable member is making, in the business community in this country that export development scheme is very much valued and has on the whole been an extraordinarily successful scheme. Mr Costello interjecting",57
193,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If the honourable member for Higgins interjects again, I will name him.",57
194,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, it has been a scheme which has been actively supported both by the Opposition parties and by the Government. I want to make that point clear first of all. The second point I want to make is that, as far as we know-and these questions have been asked-the business migration schemes which have been raised have not been supported by EMDG grantS. That has not occurred. No EMDG grants, I have been informed, have been made which have any relation to those technology parks and educational schemes in the Marshall Islands, which was the concern of the Opposition. There has not been external influence in any of the grants that we have talked about, political or otherwise, because the scheme is in fact insulated from that. Ministers are not involved in this scheme. It is a scheme run without ministerial involvement in any way because it is a scheme in which no discretion exists. Eligibility criteria are laid down, and these criteria are either met or not met. I finish by saying that all sides in this Parliament and the business community in general, particularly the small business community which the Opposition says it is so concerned about, have been very strong supporters of this particular scheme. I will take on board the points in relation to Commonwealth pursuit of debts in respect of education schemes and bring back an answer. Waterfront Reform",57
195,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training representing the Minister for Transport and Communications. I ask it, of course, as the representative of Australia's largest coal export port. Can the Minister advise the House on the progress of the Government's waterfront reform package? Is there evidence of better and more efficient port practices and improved port performances?",57
196,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, a day or two ago we had from the Opposition spokesman on shipping his usual rather churlish outburst that comes every couple of months on what is supposedly a fundamental failure in terms of the Government's program for waterfront reform. Unfortunately for him, the statistics do not bear him out; fortunately for the nation, they bear out the claims that we have been making as to the likely outcome of the waterfront reform process that has been put in place. According to the waterfront authority, on stevedoring performance indicators as at March this year, these things are worth talking about. Firstly, the work force has gone down by 42 per cent since the beginning of the reform.program in late 1989. It has gone from 8,900 to 5,100 employees and, when the program is completed at the. end of this year, the work force will have been halved. Meanwhile, productivity has soared. In container terminals, productivity per employee, measured by the average number of standard containers handled per manned shift, increased by 100 per cent between 1989 and the end of 1991. Average crane handling rates rose by almost 60 per cent, from 12 containers per hour in 1989 to 18 or 19 by March this year. This is equal to or better than rates achieved at major overseas terminals such as Osaka in Japan, with an average rate of 17; Pusan in Korea, with an average rate of 19; and Tilbury in England, with an average rate of 18. In this report it is interesting to examine performance rate in New Zealand, because New Zealand is touted by the Opposition from time to time as the measure by which it wishes every economic performance in this country to be judged. The proposition is that it will introduce in Australia a similar system, an excellent one from its point of view. However, the report gives the average container rate achieved in Auckland in New Zealand as 18 containers per hour, which is equal to the Australia-wide average and well behind some of our major ports. For example, the rate in Sydney and Adelaide is 19, and in Fremantle it is 21. Mr Sharp interjecting",57

202,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members opposite do themselves no credit to continue to peddle the gloom and doom that they do as far as waterfront reform is concerned. This is a product of what happens when you sit down and seriously and sensibly talk through an issue with the Australian work force, respecting them as your fellow Australians and not as some alien beings who have descended upon this country and can only be dealt with by the means by which other alien beings with hostile intentions descend upon this country-that is, by the use of the military. The fact of the matter is that when we are dealing with decent, honourable Australians who are in a situation where there is a requirement for an improvement in productivity, if we talk to them we get a change. If we the attempt to bully them, if we attempt to wave the bayonet under their noses, we get the reaction that any decent Australian will show when faced with that provocation-that is, they will resist. This is the process which we in this place will go through. What it offers, and the approach of the Government to our people, is an approach which guarantees them their security. It is not an attempt on our part to destabilise the nature of Australian society, to turn Australian against Australian, as is the essential element of the Fightback package in its approach to all areas of micro-economic reform, including this one.",58

I also refer you to one part of the article, which states: The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr MCLeay, who has had great difficulty controlling the proceedings of the House . . . was at yesterday's Caucus meeting but did not respond to Mr Keating's call for a bit of disruption from the Government side. I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether this report by Mr Geoff Kitney is correct. Is it therefore true that, as the article suggests, you were party to a decision to disrupt the Parliament? Or did you as the Speaker of this House, with all the responsibility that that job implies, rise in your place and urge that the strategy proposed by the Prime Minister was entirely inappropriate?",58

213,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"On Thursday of last week, the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) claimed that I misrepresented her as having attacked the Endeavour Foundation. In her personal explanation she said: I have never attacked the work, or any other aspect, of the excellent volunteers from Endeavour Foundation in Queensland, although I certainly have praised them. A perusal of Hansard or any outside transcript of statements I have made anywhere will confirm these points. I suggest that she look at the Hansard record of the grievance debate of 6 April 1989 recording her attack on the Endeavour Foundation, which led to an unnecessary and expensive review by the Department into the Foundation. NA Unemp-oyment",59
214,Mr SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The underlying weakness of the Australian economy as evidenced by yesterday's national accounts and the continuing high levels of unemployment. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",60
215,Mr REITH,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yesterday the national accounts were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We have brought on this matter of public importance to look more closely at and to analyse some of the results which came out of them. As is virtually always the case in these debates, I have absolutely no doubt that, as we look at some of the problems and, sure, recognise some of the good things in the Australian economy, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) will get up and personally bag me on the basis that we are talking doom and gloom. That is always the Government's line. It is never prepared to look at the fundamentals and at what needs to be done to turn this country around. One thing that is absolutely certain about the future economic path that this country is going to take is that we cannot have more of the same. This country cannot go on the way it has been going. When the Treasurer stands and runs his usual sort of personal abuse, I would like him to cast his mind back to a recent article in the Melbourne Age on Thursday, 28 May 1992, which is headed 'The Beaten Generation'. It states: Each day, 500 children join the 680,000 who have neither parent working. I thought it was a very graphic description of the magnitude of the problem. The Age mentions the fact that, in an average classroom of 30 students, five have parents who are either unemployed or outside the work force. This country is facing a national crisis. We have nearly one million people unemployed. When the figures came out yesterday, what did we get from the Government? We had its members oozing deception about the state of the Australian economy, and there was a smell of smugness and a sense of arrogance from them about their current economic policy. The Government's policy has failed and it is hurting literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians. My concern is that, every day the Government says, 'Look, things are fine; things are on track', it is putting off and deferr!ng the inevitable changes that this country must make. Basically our view is: why let our country drift on for another three or five years and why do all the considerable damage that we will do to ourselves, rather than take the bull by the horns now and go for some fundamental reforms that we know will make the difference? Basically, the Government's line-and we will hear it all again in a moment from the Treasurer-is that things are working. We hear that every year from members opposite. If one goes back to the Budget in 1987, five years ago, one will see that the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), said, 'Tonight I can report that Australia is winning'. Then a month later he said, 'This is the golden age of economic change'. In 1988 he said, 'This is the one that brings home the bacon'. In 1990, when he was asked whether there was going to be a recession, he said, 'I will not let there be a recession'. When he was elected Prime Minister, he said, 'I am not going to tell lies any more'. Yesterday we had soothing words from the Treasurer, that we are on the growth plan for a sustainable, widely spread recovery. 1 honestly would like to believe that that were true. It would be great if we had come to grips with the basic problems facing this economy and if one could say honestly to people, 'Yes, things are fixed; things are going to be better'. But the truth is that that is simply not there on the evidence. It is not just the Opposition saying this. The Government cannot get up and say, 'You guys are running this line for your own political benefit'. We only have to pick up the papers. The editorial writers are not exactly card-carrying members of the Liberal Party. For example this article, headed 'Now pray there is no relapse', appeared in the Age: If this is an economic recovery, we had better pray there is no relapse. The anaemic, unsteady and uneven growth revealed in yesterday's national accounts figures flatly contradicted the claim by Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, that the economy is ""on the path to widespread and sustained economic growth"". 1 think it put it very nicely when it said: Either he was trying to boost the Government's flagging political stocks or he just does not understand the numbers. Which one is it? Either he does not understand, according to the Age, or he is just pushing a political line for his bwn benefit. The only jobs Government members are interested in are their own. An article in the Australian noted: Corporate investment has slumped for 11 consecutive quarters and the outlook for rebuilding the nation's productive base continues to be gloomy... a generally anaemic economy, with an alarming taste for imports, means unemployment will remain high for quite some time. Kenneth Davidson, no great fan of the Liberal Party, says: The March quarter national accounts show why the Keating Government is on the nose with voters. Alan Wood, perhaps at a different end of the spectrum, says: ... when we come to look at the sources of future growth and their prospects the outlook becomes more uncertain. George Megalogenis says in the Australian: . . . the pace of the recovery is more than three times slower than the corresponding pick-up after the last recession and is not yet strong enough to put a cap on the unemployment rate. He goes on to note the disturbing sign in respect of exports. When we look at the underlying fundamentals of the .Australian economy, we see that we have a long way to go. The Government cannot stand up here and say, 'We have fixed it. We are going to have more of the same, because it is working, and Australia is going on to a bigger and brighter future', when the reality is that some of the figures are adverse to our future prospects. Today 1 particularly want to focus on the investment figures. Our investment performance is absolutely appalling. Until we get a sustained growth in investment, we are not going to have a sustained pick-up in jobs. It is as simple as that. Until people have a sense the of confidence in the future of this country and are prepared to stake their money in the future of this country by investing, we can basically kiss away any sustained pick-up in growth. In total private investment we have had 11 consecutive quarterly falls. It has been dropping month in, month out for nearly three years. The Treasurer has a great graph on which the line that was coming down is now on the way up. 1I have a graph showing private investment. I am told that investment as a percentage of GOP-as a percentage of the total national cake-is at an all-time record low. Let us look at the history of it in the last two or three years. For those honourable members who cannot see the graph, it shows investment starting up high and dropping like a stone. There is an absolutely remorseless fall off in investment, which means that it is very difficult to see a pick-up in investment. The Treasurer is going to say, 'This is in an economic cycle. Things are crook for a while, but when things pick up, after a while investment will pick up'. We have heard it all before. 1I have had this job for nearly two years now. 1 can refer honourable members to Hansard in the last two years-in Mayor August 1990-in which Government members were saying exactly the same thing. They were saying, 'By March of next year' - that is, last March-'we will be bounding along in a growing, strong economy'. Why should anyone believe Government members when they have been so wrong month in, month out? I know they are going to say, 'It is the lagged effect'. It is all predicated on their claim that this is just like any other garden variety recession: things are bad for a while, they pick up, you get a job, and everybody loses his job. Frankly, that is not right. All the evidence shows that not only is this the worse recession since the Depression, but also it is a very different of recession from those which we had in 1982-83 or 1974. Unfortunately, as we look to some pick-up in the Australian economy, the thing which is going to impede investment is that we still have very high real interest rates. One of the reasons for that is that we have a massive debt to the rest of the world, propping up high real interest rates when we take inflation into account. The other thing that is different from some other recessions is that a lot of investment is in the commercial building sector. Everybody knows we have a massive glut in the commercialbuilding sector. We are not going to get a pick-up in investment there. The reality is that we have got a lot of empty office space through all the major CBDs. This is not going to be a source of pick-up in the investment figures. I mentioned the total private investment figures, but it is also worth noting the ment investment figures. The figure actually dropped back another 4.3 per cent in the March quarter. It was 4.6 per cent in the December quarter, but it was 1.8 per cent and 3.5 per cent in the two preceding quarters. In other words, there is no sense of a pick-up there at all. In fact, March was just about as bad as December. The Government is saying that things are on the up, but the latest March quarter figure was 0.6 per cc;:nt; it was better in the December quarter, when it was 0.7 per cent. Where is the pick-up in that, Minister? The truth is it was a very flat perfonnance in the March quarter. A second area of concern from the Opposition's point of view is what is happening on the export side in respect of the balance of payments. Yesterday, not only did we have the national accounts, which tell us about investment, consumption, spending and such things; we also had the latest estimate of this country's debt. It is a salutary reminder to us all of the magnitude of our problems, because net debt was up again, from $144 billion to $148 billion. That is nearly $8,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. Do not blame it on the last Government, because when this Government came in this country's sort debt was about $23 billion. Today it is $148 billion-and we saw evidence yesterday that it is still climbing. What is happening with the balance of payments is of concern, because March was not a good quarter. The Australian Bureau of Statistics review of the balance of payments for the March quarter said: In volume tenns, exports of goods and services fell $279m, while imports of goods and services rose $91m. The resulting decrease of $37Om in the surplus on goods and services will make a negative contribution of 0.5 percentage points to the March quarter 1992. Basically, volumes were down. It did not look as bad as it might have, because prices were up a bit. But the underlying problem is that exports were falling and imports were growing. That is the wrong way around for this country. We have to export more and import less. To import less, we have to produce more in Australia; we have to remove equip- many of the taxes on our business community, so that they can then afford to employ more people and produce at cheaper costs. We can then compete against imports and start to fix the two big problemsunemployment and our massive and growing debt to the rest of the world. We have a problem with investment; the problem with the balance of' payments is staring us in the face; and the other problem is the imports to sales ratio. It is a measure of the extent of imports as a percentage of the total sales in the economy. There is nothing wrong with imports per se, provided we can afford them. Our problem is that the latest set of figures show a growing number of imports coming in. We have the third highest figure of sales to imports ratio on record. It suggests that we just do not have the capacity in the Australian economy to produce more. A recent figure given by Access Economics was very revealing. It showed that we actually went backwards on capital stock in the December quarter. That ought to have set alarm bells ringing in the heads of the Treasurer and his advisers. They have been diminishing the capital stock of the productive capacity of the Australian economy. So much for the chances of some booming recovery. The reality is that, when we look at the figures and the fine print, we see, unfortunately, that the situation is pretty crook. When one looks at the consequences for jobs one sees that, again, it is not a happy picture. The projection on unemployment for 1992-93 by Access Economics is a rate of 10.7 per cent. So we are a long way off fixing the problem. I say to the Minister: put your politics aside for a moment and ask yourself what you are going to do for this beaten generation-:those 680,000 kids in a home where neither parent has a job. He is a long way from the big reforms which this country needs. He ought to abolish payroll tax, reduce income tax, double the family allowance, take tax off the business community, and give this country the fundamental reforms that it so desperately needs. Do not stand up and g\ve us your smug, arrogant 'She's all right; more of the same is what this country needs' attitude. We need fundamental reform. (TIme expired)",60
216,Mr DAWKINS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The speech by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) would have been half as long if he had not spent time trying to anticipate what I was going to say. He could have saved all of those opposite, who were given the task of sitting through his dreary exposition, 7 112 minutes. Instead, they had to listen to him for 15 minutes. I am always happy to debate sensibly these issues which are brought forward, but I do wish the Opposition, and particularly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, would approach these things in a rather more candid way than the way he does repeatedly. This is a debate about the fact that Australia is now recording an annual growth rate of something probably over 2 per cent at least. Far from the Opposition saying, 'This is a good sign but there are a few areas which deserve attention' , the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says, 'This is all shocking; the Government is trying to gild the lily; the Minister is trying to exaggerate the circumstances and really things could not be worse'. I listened in my room to a speech by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) in which he made a number of the points that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I think, inexpertly made. He particularly made the point about unemployment and about that continuing to be a serious problem, particUlarly in Victoria but in other parts of the country as well. I want to return to the question of unemployment because I think the current unemployment situation is undeniably terrible and we have to see an improvement in it. But we will not begin to see an improvement in unemployment unless we see the economy growing again. That was the thing which I was heralding yesterday-the fact that we have now had two quarters of growth of around 0.7 and 0.6 per cent respectively, which is something to be pleased about. It is not something to lament. Yet the Opposition comes in here not even being prepared to say, 'Well, thank goodness; at least the country is growing again. What can we do? What should the Government be doing to try to make this a more widespread and sustainable period of growth ahead of it?'. No, we just have the usual tirade to attempt, unsuccessfully, to predict what I am going to say and attempt to score some cheap political points about the failure of the Government in terms of making predictions in the past. There is no-one more culpable than the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in terms of appalling record on what is likely to occur at any stage in the future as far as the economy is concerned. Time after time the Leader of the Opposition, in the context of any particular economic statistic, has said, 'Things are getting worse; things are not getting better; Australia is hopeless; Australia is uncompetitive; we are in for a decade of struggle and travail as we try to get this economy moving again'. If anything is clear from yesterday's figures it is that the Leader of the Opposition is an appalling judge of economic developments. Whether or not people think that the economy is strong enough-I do not think that it is yet, and I have made that point-the fact that it is growing once more is something which is unambiguously good news for Australia. n is very instructive to make just an examination of this level of growth, this 0.6 per cent growth in a quarter-an appalling performance, to be disregarded, to be totally discounted, by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition! Let me just make a comparison. I am not going to spend my time trying to blame our predecessors for all of what has happenedMr MCGauran-After nine years, how can , you?",63
217,Mr DAWKINS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Of course, there is plenty I can do. If the honourable member for Gippsland continues to interject, I will target his Party particularly as being the ones who were most obstructive in terms of getting some sensible change into the economy. I will talk about the way in which we have had to correct the negative effects of MCEwenism as quickly as we could in the course of the last eight or nine y-as. Let us just look at what happened to the Australian economy during the years from 1976 to 1983. I ask the honourable member for Gippsland to listen to this for a moment: the average rate of quarterly growth from March 1976 to March 1983 was 0.56 per cent. The average rate for the whole of that period of government-.",64
218,Mr M,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,GauranWhat about the debt?,64
219,Mr DAWKINS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let us not get into the debt for a moment. I will deal with the debt; but this MPI is about growth-about the underlying weaknesses as revealed by the growth statistics yesterday. What did they reveal? They revealed in the last two quarters a growth rate which was superior to the average rate recorded through all of those long, barren, Liberal-Country Party years from 1976 to 1983. Of course, that is the context in which the Deputy Leader's comments should be taken. He tried-struggled-to find some disparaging statistics, grasping at anything. I grant the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the employment situation is a legitimate target for him to focus on and, as I have said, I will come to that. But he wants to pick, as he does in his graph, the question of private investment. He anticipates what I am going to say-which I will say-which is that private investment has always been pro-cyclical. In every recovery private investment has picked up after the recovery has begun. Even taking that point on board, let us just examine what is the real private gross fixed capital expenditure now compared with what it was in 1982-93. In 1990-91, a year which those opposite have targeted as being an appalling level for investment, it was $42.5 billion. In 1982-83, their last year, in the same dollars it was $30.8 billion. So there was $30.8 billion worth of investment in the last year of the coalition Government, yet there was $42.5 billion in our last year-and a weak year as far as we are concerned, and a year that we considered to be too weak. Of course we want to see investment improving. That is why in the One Nation statement we decided to restructure the depreciation allowances. That is why we decided to bring in the pooled development funds. That is why we decided to bring in the infrastructure bonds. That is why we decided to bring in the development allowance. All these are designed to focus on the inadequacy of investment and to provide some incentives through the taxation system. What do those opposite do in relation to these tax incentives to boost investment? They come in here and try to vote them down. They vote against the very measures which are designed to give Australia a more competitive capital regime as far as the taxation system is concerned. Struggle as I might through all of those long, boring 600 or 800 pages of Fightback, where do I find a suggestion of how depreciation might be changed? Only in the last few weeks, in response to One Nation, have those opposite decided that they had better have a look at business taxation in the depreciation area. So what has happened is that, in the wake of One Nation, a few people in business have said to those opposite, 'My God, this has been a great deficiency in your proposal and you had better do something about it'. We are concerned to provide in Australia a competitive taxation regime in order to provide some stimulus to investment which, I concur absolutely with the Deputy Leader, must improve-and, I predict, will improve as the recovery takes hold. Let us just concentrate for a moment on this issue of unemployment. I am not trying to duck it. During the last six months, we have seen unemployment basically stuck at around 10.4 or 10.5 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms. It is worthwhile if we are to have a sensible debate about this for the Opposition at least to acknowledge that there are two factors at work here. One is obviously the recession, the economic cycle which has had its own effect on the employment rate, on the labour market. But, as well as that, there is the question of restructuring. Given the restructuring that has taken in the Australian economy, whether it is in response to changes in protection policy, reduction in tariffs and subsidies or whether it is .in reform of government business enterprises, whether at the Commonwealth or State level, one would have thought that those opposite, given all their bravado and heroism that they have gone on with in Fightback about the need for more of this-in fact, I would have said lunatic amounts of restructuring in relation to some of our manufacturing industries-one would have thought that at least they would acknowledge that part of the job losses can be dealt with by restrucso turing and making our economy more efficient. Lamenting as he does the fact that we ought to be doing better on the export front, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to acknowledge that where we have been weak on the export front in the ""last couple of months has been in the agricultural sector, and to a small extent in the resource sector. But where have we been doing well over the last 10 years, and where are we continuing to do well? It is in the manufacturing sector and in the services sector. In both those areas we are recording record levels of export growth which are not just recession induced. We are getting some of the fundamental changes and redirecting Australian industry away from our tiny little, relatively speaking, domestic market towards the world market. The. Opposition berates us about the pace of change, about the need for tariffs to be reduced to zero as quickly as possible and the need for public business enterprises to be sold. To be sold for what purpose? To be sold so that someone else can restructure them. What does restructuring mean to those opposite? It is a code for throwing lots of people out of work so that these enterprises become 'more efficient'. Of course that is something which is already happening. But, frankly, I do object to the duplicity of the Deputy Leader when he does not even acknowledge that part of our slackness in the labour market, part of the unacceptably high unemployment rate, is due to just the kind of restructuring that he has been urging upon us, which he says place should be faster and which he says under those opposite would b- faster, would go further and would go into more areas than we have already been into. Everyone knows-even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, if he had a moment of candour in his life, would recognise and acknowledge this-that at least the initial consequences, whatever might be the eventual consequences, of Fightback would be more unemployment, not less. That is what is designed into the approach of those opposite. One of the reasons why they are going to be hard, heartless and cruel to the unemployed is that they know that there will be more of them and they want to spend less money on them. That is the""reason for their approach. Mr Reith-So much for your call for candour.",64
220,Mr DAWKINS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, that is the fact. Those opposite want to save money on the unemployed when they must know that the initial consequences of their policy will be to have more of them. In relation to unemployment, there are two crucial areas that have to be examined further. One is the question of youth. That is why we are trying to persuade the States to take a better attitude to vocational education and training. That is why we are offering hundreds of millions of dollars to expand that sector to provide better opportunities for our young people. That is why we have had Laurie Carmichael and his council's report on reforming the wage structure for young people so that the wage rate more accurately equates with the skill level of those young people. In the dying moments I have left, I want to refer to adult males who have been affected by the restructuring of some of our manufacturing industries, particularly those in Melbourne. That is an area which has.to be taken seriously. It is an area which does command a great deal of my time as we consider what better policy responses we can have for those people and their families who are afflicted not just by the consequences of the recession, but also by the necessary restructuring which manufacturing is going through. (TIme expired)",66
221,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I point out that he is the fourth Treasurer we have had in the last 12 months-and other Ministers in Question Time, one would think that things were going well in Australia today. I do not know whether these people have ever had time to get out into the streets or into the supermarkets to talk to the average man and woman who is hurting around this country. All they seem to talk about is how well this country is going at the moment and how we were all starving back in the 1950s, the 1960s and the late 1970s when we were in government. I remind the Treasurer that the standard of living we enjoyed back in those days was amongst the highest in the world. Unemployment was 2 per cent. I remember when Billy MCMahon went to an election in 1972 and lost it. One of the major reasons he lost it was that unemployment had risen to 90,000. Today it is well over 900,000. At least back in those days we had hope. Business had hope. Young couples could buy a house, start up, kick off, and get ahead. People had jobs. Today we have the total opposite in Australia. If people read the media, they would realise that the shape of the economy is Australia's best kept secret. If we were in government and the economy was in the shape that it is in today, we would be absolutely crucified in the media. Mr Reith-They would call it a depression.",66
222,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They would call it a depression, and rightly so. Honourable members need to look only at the mess we are in. We have record bankruptcies. A drive through any country town would show the shops that have been closed. The shops do not even have 'To Let' signs up now; they just have white sheeting in their front windows. The central business districts in the cities have vacant spaces like they have never seen before. We have one million people unemployed, and another half a million people partially unemployed. In the last two years the dole payments in the Budgets have gone up 40 per cent. We are now paying out in excess of $7,OOOm in unemployment benefits. It is quite incredible. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Me Reith), said that the figures that came out yesterday show a lift in the overseas debt yet again-it has gone up 2.4 per cent to $148,000m. If that increase is annualised, that is an increase of 9.6 per cent per year. What hope do we have if this keeps up? Sure, inflation is down, but it is only flat because of the severe recession, or depression, that we have at the moment. I would venture to say that inflation is probably near the bottom of what it is going to be. If we do get any upturn, we will get a surge in imports and there will be an immediate deterioration in the balance of payments that will exacerbate the foreign debt and lead to higher inflation. So there is no joy there at all. If we look at the factor of interest rates, we see that not only this Treasurer but the others before him kept them far too high for far too long. Even now they are still at near record levels in real tenns. The likelihood is that in the medium to long term they will rise again. When we throw in the flat world economy, particularly in countries such as Japan, the picture ahead is not too good at all. We have had very weak growth coming out of this recession, or depression. We have had three-quarters of positive growth: 0.2 per cent, 0.7 per cent and 0.6 per cent, coming off one of the lowest bases in the history of this country. I put it to honourable members that while the present Treasurer brags about this, it is very modest growth indeed. Mr Anderson-Where is the 4.75 per cent?",66
223,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, where is the 4.75 per cent. At the moment the growth is so modest that if a girl made a bikini out of it and stepped onto Bondi Beach, she would be asked to leave-in this enlightened agel We do need that 4.75 per cent growth to generate jobs. While we do not have it-we are not within cooee of it at the moment-the unemployment figure, which is outrageously high, will tend to remain stagnant. The Government has no answers as to where it will come from, and the March quarterly growth figures that the Treasurer has just spoken about give no joy whatsoever. Most of the growth, minuscule as it is, comes from consumption, housing and stocks. It did not come from investment; it did not come from exports. There is no investment at all for the simple reason that there is no money or confidence around. Let us look at the last quarterly figure for investment. As the shadow Treasurer said, we have just had the lowest level of equipment investment relative to GDP in Australia's history. That is absolutely unbelievable. Investment fell 4.3 per cent for the quarter, which brought it to 13.5 per cent for the year. These are horrific figures by anybody's standards. Exports were down too; in fact, export volumes fell by 1.9 per cent in the quarter, the first time in 10 quarters that export volumes were down. If anything, the job is getting worse for exports. Mr Bruce Scott-And voluntary constraints on beef to the USA coming up.",67
224,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Indeed. We have this mix of exports falling and imports rising. I put it to the Treasurer that this country cannot sustain the mixture of rising consumption and falling investment for very long. It is a totally unsustainable position, particularly when, in addition to that, productivity is also falling, in the sense that the ratio of GDP to hours worked has plunged yet again. I say to the Government that the One Nation statement that it trumpeted so loudly earlier this year cannot be delivered. The One Nation statement has become a 'No Nation' statement. When we look at yesterday's figures, we see that there has been a fall in private sector investment. It is down by 0.9 per cent for the quarter and 7.9 per cent for the year, for heaven's sake-the seventh consecutive quarterly fall. In fact, it has fallen in 11 of the last 12 quarters. There is absolutely no indicator that it will be heading northwards at any time in the future. In summary, I put it to the Government that the economy is in a very fragile position; in fact, it could deteriorate, and, at the very best, will remain flat. There is no solid basis for any real hope. The Government is totally out of ideas, it seems. It has become sterile in the policy area, bereft of ideas. What has it done since it has been in government? It has introduced a whole raft of new taxes: a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax and has tripled the wholesale sales tax collections and quadrupled the fuel excise. Now that it has done all that, there is this ad hoc tinkering around the edges when we need some drastic action. In fact, the Government is still making the wrong decisions. We need to look only at the superannuation guarantee levy, which even the Treasury says will destroy 100,000 jobs. I would like to read a note from the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, A.J. Preston, dated 5 January 1992. The following question was asked: How many full-time and part-time jobs will be lost or not otherwise created as a result of the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee legislation?  Treasury modelling suggested that, on the specified assumption that the SOL is fully absorbed in increased real unit labour costs, employment resulting from the first year implementation of SGL would be up to 45,000 in the first two years. This would rise to about 100,000 after five years. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today in Question Time that it was not going to be a trade-off against wages; yet it is. He is having it both ways with his loaves and fishes answer. As I interjected then, if he runs his new piggery that way it could indeed prove to be an astute investment. Instead of bringing in a GST Fightback package as we have proposed, the Government is obsessed with knocking it. I think during Question Time five out of six of the dorothy dix questions were concerned with the GST. Those opposite talk about none of their own policies. All they do is talk about our polices and how they have found yet another hole in them. Mr Anderson-They are never truthful.",67
225,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. If one added it up, the sum total of all those holes would be more money than exists in all of Australia. We will lift $20,000m off the back of business to make it more profitable and create real jobs-not government created jobs, but business created jobs. This will get Australia going in the right direction. (TIme expired)",68
226,Dr CHARLESWORTH,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) has absolutely no shame. In his concluding remarks he referred to the panacea-the solution-for Australia. I hoped that he would not bring it up; but he did. He wanted to introduce the consumption tax into the debate. He said that the answer for Australia-the answer to all of the hardships that Australians are experiencing-is to lift $20 billion in taxation imposts off business and put it onto the general community: onto ordinary people. Those opposite will bring about this economic renaissance in Australia by taxing bread, milk, cheese, fruit, meat, clothing, housing inputs and all of those things which are presently untaxed. The honourable member knows that it will not work, but he has the gall to get up and say it. He has the gall to. come in here and speak to this matter of public importance, which relates to unemployment, about his losses concern about unemployment whilst, at the the same time, he says, 'We are going to lift all of these imposts which are presently on business and we are going to put them on the general population and that is going to solve Australia's problems and make people feel better'. I am sure that Australians do not believe him. The honourable member raised the bogey of Australia's foreign debt. It is often raised in this House, and it is a cause for concern for us all. But it needs to be put in proportion. We need to understand that our foreign debt-$140 billion or whatever the net figure is-represents, for somebody who has an income of about $30,000 in a country like Australia, which has an income of hundreds of billions of dollars, a mortgage of $10,000 on his or her home. Anybody living in any capital city in this country who understands anything about financing his or her own home understands that that sort of mortgage repayment is eminently manageable. We need to understand that that is the order of magnitude we are talking about. Australia has an income of $450 billion to $500 billion. We need to understand that and put it in context. I think it is also important for us to consider the Opposition's suggestion-and, indeed, the honourable member for Parkes has introduced some new measure of productivity-that productivity has declined. Of course, the productivity figure that has been evidenced in recent times is very encouraging at 2 per cent. We need to look very closely at some of the things that the honourable member said. This matter of public importance is about the evidenced weakness in the Australian economy. But let us look at some of the fundamentals of that economy. For instance, we are given the opportunity to measure the performance of this Government. As we climb out of a downturn and a recession, we have quarterly growth at 0.6 per cent. It is interesting to note, as was pointed out by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), that that represents an improvement on the figure that was obtained by the Opposition in the average of all of the quarters when it was in government. If this is a terrible figure, those opposite are saying that their performance during those halcyon days of 1976 to 1983 was indeed abominable. If one looks at the fundamentals of Australia's economy now, one can see that we are concerned about the level of unemployment. Nobody in this place should suggest that that is not the case. But the fundamentals through which we can rebound from these circumstances are universally acceptable and universally good. We have an inflation rate which, measured by the CPI or the implicit price deflator-whichever measure one wants to take-is about 2 or 2112 per cent. Indeed, those sorts of figures are very encouraging for somebody who wishes to invest in this country. The expectations for inflation are also very encouraging. The profit share for business is measured, on the current figure, at about 16 per cent. The profit share at the nadir of the Opposition's recession was measured at about 12 per cent. We are in:deed in an improved. circumstance in respect of that measure. Average earnings have increased by about 3 per cent over the last year and the cost of labour has declined. So, for investment purposes, those fundamentals are very encouraging. The current account deficit has almost reached stabilisation point, and that is a very encouraging development. If one looks structurally at the Budget and at the concern about the level of Budget deficit, one can compare our figure of about 2112 per cent of GOP with the figure that we inherited in 1983, when it represented nearly 5 per cent of GOP. The level of interest rates in this country is historically low, especially in the last 20 or 30 years. If one looks at all these things, one find that we have an environment in which investment is encouraged and we have a group of fundamentals which will allow us to rebound from the circumstance that we are in at present. We do not deny t-at we are seeing the beginnings of a steady recovery. We believe this recovery will occur over a number of years. We believe that next year we will see the sorts of growth figures that are predicted in the One Nation statement and we understand that this will be underpinned by sound fundamentals. Those who want to invest in business in this country-those who want to put their money where their mouth is-want to know that the fundamentals are sound and that the C future projections of those fundamentals are consistent and believable. In all of those areas-inflation, profit share, wages, the deficit, and interest rates-we have a group of fundamentals upon which we can rely and upon which those who wish to invest can have faith. It is the case that unemployment, as has been indicated by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), is of great concern to us. But all Australians should be wary of the solutions outlined by the Opposition. One of the solutions is to have a consumption tax. We are very much aware of what the implications of that will be for some of those fundamentals, such as inflation and interest rates. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) put forward the proposal that we should be creating dead-end jobs for people. It needs to be understood in this country that we have unacceptable unemployment rates. They are the result of a coincidence of factors. One of those factors is, of course, the cyclical nature of our economy. Indeed, if people wanted, to, they could point the finger at monetary policy; and I think they would be correct. But we have to look at other important factors. The restructuring that is occurring in our economy, the downturn in the rural sector, and the downturn in international circumstances are critical to that level of unemployment. If we are going to do something about this will problem, we have to look at all of those factors. We have to say, 'Do we believe it is worth the cost?'. We believe it is worth the cost because we are about changing the face of this country and developing a more competitive and internationally oriented economy. Those opposite might not believe in doing that; they might want to close the door on the rest of the world. But that is not what we see as the long term prescription for Australia. While Opposition members continue to come into this place day after day and respond to the real policy issues that this community is facing by asking questions about relatives of former Ministers, about whether somebody has put his or her tax return in on time, and by producing pamphlets about old ladies being unsafe in their houses, they will be seen as irrelevant. That is, what Opposition members are doing and Beddall), I move: people are. seeing them as irrelevant. If those opposite think that the prescription we need in Australia is the one we have seen in United States or the United Kingdom they wrong. We have created an environment for investment. We have the fundamentals in place . in transport and communications, on the waterfront, in interest rates, in real wages, the profit share and in inflation. On top that, in the One Nation statement, we given the economy a kick along with a originally significant injection of resources. We have given increased depreciation allowances businesses, development allowances, and the sorts of things that will target the investment where it needs to be. That will be directly responsible for a change in Australia's culture and will develop the sort of investment pattern we want to develop in this countryhonourable one that is realistic and sustainable. the way in which we are approaching these difficult problems. We understand there is journed. some pain, but we believe at the end there will be very significant gain. Those opposite are suggesting more and more pain for Australia for very little gain.

The tariff proposal which I have just tabled the contains an alteration to schedule 4 to the are Customs Tariff Act 1987, and will operate from 1 July 1992. The anomaly has arisen because of the restructuring of heading 8704 in schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Paragraph (a) in item 41B of schedule 4, in which allows concessional entry to certain of vehicles of 30 years or more in age, now have covers a wider range of goods than was intended. This proposal will correct that situation and allow only utilities and for pick-ups having a gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3.5 tonnes classified under certain subheadings in chapter 87 to obtain the concession. A summary of the alteration contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of members. I commend the proposal That is to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adNA Public Works Committee: Badgerys Creek Airport Development, Stage 1",70
229,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEE REFERENCE,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education: and Training) (4.13 p.m.)-On behalf of the Minister for Small SENATE Business, Construction and Customs (Mr from the Beddall), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Cummittee on Public Works for consideration and report: Badgerys Creek Airport development, Stage 1. Badgerys Creek is located in the Liverpool local government area, some 46 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district. The site is 20 kilometres west of Liverpool, 20 kilometres south-east of Penrith and 23 kilometres north-west of Campbelltown. Over a period of 40 years several studies have been carried out in relation to a site for a proposed second Sydney airport. In February 1986, the Government announced that Badgerys Creek had been selected as the site. Acquisition commenced in that year and has now been completed. Following evaluation of the airport the Sydney basin, the Government announced, in March 1989, a comprehensive and integrated strategy which included the commencement at Badgerys Creek of a staged development of a second major Sydney airport. The initial development provided only for general aviation. The airport will be operated by the Federal Airports Corporation under a lO-year lease agreement with two options which could extend the lease for a further 15 years. This stage 1 of the development will provide a general aviation airport which will be designed within the constraint of being easily expanded into stage 2-domestic and international development. The facilities to be provided will include a sealed runway, parallel taxiway, aircraft parking, runway and taxiway lighting, an access road and parking, together with a terminal building of about 100 square metres. Also involved will be cut-tofill earthworks; site services, including water supply; drainage and sewerage, including onsite sewage treatment. The scope of the work has been estimated at an indicative cost not to exceed $56.1m at December 1990 prices. The overall duration of stage 1 is 27 months from commencement of the detailed design process with the new airport operational before the end of 1994. At this point, I would acknowledge the presence in the House of the honourable member for Fowler (Me Grace), who has been assiduous in striving and fighting very long and hard to bring this proposition to fruition. I would. also acknowledge your presence, Me Deputy Speaker, as the Chairman of the Public Works Committee. I am sure you will expedite this process. Mr Downer-What about us?",70
230,Mr SNOWDON,COMMITTEE REFERENCE,"I might point out to the honourable member for Mayo that a component of the Public Works Committee comprised Opposition members. I have always found that they treat these things reasonably-I am sure they will in this caseand that this Badgerys Creek airport will come to fruition earlier rather than later. I table selected drawings of the proposed Badgerys Creek airport development stage 1 needs in and commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

231,Mr HARRY WOODS,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"page) (4.17 p.m.)In continuing the debate on the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992, I would just like to make a few closing comments in the short time left to me. The Bill demonstrates the industry's commitment to research and development. It has demonstrated that it wishes the levy to be increased in order to undertake further research and development. The Bill also demonstrates, of course, the commitment by the Government in matching that levy. Research and development will help the industry to find the way forward .to more efficiency and greater competitiveness and show the way to the future for the sugar industry in Australia. The Government's position on the industry in general terms, of course, is just that: to assist the industry and to negotiate and cooperate with the sugar industry. That is also shown in one of the big issues facing the sugar industry at the present time-that is, the response to the Industry Commission report. The sugar industry finds the Industry Commission report most unpalatable and it needs to respond in such a way that the Government can take notice of it. The Government's Strait position is that it will not be driven by the Industry Commission report, but it will give due weight to the just arguments of the industry as to how they see themselves progressing. The genuineness of that position is proved by the way in which the Government handled a very similar issue with regard to the dairy industry. In recent days, the dairy industry welcomed the Government's response to it through legislation that was passed recently. On the other hand, the Opposition is completely averse to tariff protection for the sugar industry. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) categorically stated: We will eliminate tariff protection by the year 2000. The Opposition has also endorsed the draft report of the Industry Commission which came out before the Fightback! document and which recommended zero tariffs by 1998. I repeat the statement by Harry Bonanno, the Chairman of the Cane Growers Association, in which he said: . . . if any party policy statement is so inflexible to not accommodate the rightful needs of an industry as important as the . . . sugar industry, then either the statement will end up being changed or those who support the statement should be changed ... That was obviously directed at the leadership of the coalition, who cannot and will not negotiate with the sugar industry in any way. Mr Ballantyne, the General Manager of the Cane Growers Association said, after a 45minute meeting with the Opposition Leader, that Dr Hewson had confirmed the coalition's position that, if elected to government, there would be no special arrangements for the sugar industry, or for any industry, and that tariffs would continue to be progressively reduced towards zero from 1993. This shows a real problem for the Opposition parties. The country areas of New South WalesMr Downer-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is all very interesting, although a lot of it is not correct. But this Bill deals with an amendment to the Sugar Cane Levy Act. It is not just about sugar; it is about increasing the maximum rate of levy from lOc per tonne to 15c per tonne. I put it to you that the honourable member is talking about issues which, in the light of what I have just said about the sugar cane levy, are unrelated to the legislation.",72
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"If the honourable member for Mayo had heard as much of this debate as I have heard, he would know that it has been quite a wide ranging debate. There is no point of order, but I know that the honourable member will relate his comments to the Bill.",73
233,Mr HARRY WOODS,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"It has been noted in this debate that the Opposition parties have continually been reluctant to address the real issues of the sugar industry, such as tariffs, because they areMrBruce Scott-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: prior to the luncheon break the honourable member was brought to order by Madam Deputy Speaker and her ruling was that the Bill deals with amendments to the Sugar Cane Levy Act and has nothing to do with tariffs. The honourable member really as is straying from the Bill before the House .",73
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I think we are getting a little bit carried away with some of these points of order. The honourable member was talking about sugar, and it has been a wide ranging debate.",73
235,Mr HARRY WOODS,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"As I said, this debate has been marked by the reluctance of the Opposition parties to see the real issues. of the sugar industry. They have great difficulty in handling the two policies: when they go into the bush they have one policy and when they come in here they have another policy. People in country areas are quickly becoming aware that a vote for the National Party is nothing more than a vote for the Liberal leadership.",73
236,Mr WEBSTER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I think it is probably about time that we introduced an element of sweetness into this debate. I know a few puns have been made along those lines already. People might be wondering why somebody with an electorate that does not have any sugar cane growing in it might want to speak on a Bill that has to do with the sugar cane industry, the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill. Honourable members know that I represent one of the most magnificent electorates in the world, an electorate even more beautiful than the electorates of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) and the honourable member for - age (Mr Harry Woods), both of whom spoke earlier. The interesting thing is that I have the essence of sweetness running in my veins due to the fact that I come from a long line of sugar cane producers and people who have always been interested in research. That is why it is relevant that I address this levy legislation. Going way back to the last century, those people would have all been in favour of research and development. My great-grandfather had large cane holdings on the Clarence River. My mother was born in a house on one of the cane farms on Chatsworth Island. My great-grandfather, at the end of last century and at the beginning of this century, had one of the 102 sugar mills in New South Wales. Interestingly enough, my father, who migrated from Scotland, was engaged in research in 1921 at the Mossman mill just out of Cairns. Wonder of wonders, my wife, who is a New Zealander, had a great-grandfather who was the first manager of the mill at Broadwater on the Richmond River. I mention these matters as qualifications for my obvious interest in supporting the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bi111992. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the maximum rate of levy on sugar cane to 15c per tonne as provided in section 10 of the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987. Quite a bit has been said about the sugar industry and I would like to repeat a few things so that these details can be recorded in Hansard. Sugar is one of Australia's most important agricultural industries, as has been mentioned by a number of people. Therefore, it is critical that attention be paid to maximising research and development for such an important industry-hence this levy. Sug(U' is Australia - s third most valuable export crop after wheat and cotton, and 75 to 80 per cent of raw sugar production is exported, so it is a major export. As a result, valuable dollars are imported into the coffers of the country. In 1991-92, production of raw sugar was 3.2 million tonnes from a drought affected crop of 21.3 million tonnes of sugar cane, with a gross value of production estimated at $585m. This is· well below the record of 3.8 million tonnes of sugar produced in 1989-90, but production is expected to rise again with increases in the area of land under cane. All the research available, and the increased research that will come as a result of this increased levy, will be extremely helpful. The importance of sugar in one's diet is something that has been debated over and over again. Sugar is referred to as nature's sweetener. A lot of people make up stories about sugar that has been refined, saying that the refined product is virtually useless as a food, and so on. I would like to mention the fact that it is a pure food. We are all born with an innate taste for sugar, and the newborn infant shows a preference for sweetness. So we have an inclination towards the consumption of sugar from a very early period in our lives. One of the questions that I raised a moment ago with regard to the value of sugar is worth mentioning. A lot of research has been carried out on its value as a result of the levy that has existed up to the present time. Some of the research information available tells us that there are no significant nutritional differences between white sugar, raw sugar, brown sugar and honey. A lot of people go to a lot of trouble to say that they are vastly different in terms of their value as foodstuffs, but research and development undertaken by CSIRO and many other organisations show that there is no significant nutritional difference between any of those foods. That ought to put to rest a lot of what is being said today about white sugar being very harmful for us and that we ought to stick to some of the other sugars. Of course, sugars are used differently in foods because of their distinctive flavours and colours. But, as I said, nutritionally there is not much difference between them. Some of the research already undertaken as a result of the levy that has been in place has been conducted by the CSIRO. We often read on some of the products that we get from supermarket that there is no added sugar. I would like to mention a couple of things that have been put forward by researchers into that kind of advertising and put to rest some of the myths associated with that particular claim. It is not an impressive claim by any means. An article I have before me states: There are no real nutritional benefits, as 'no added sugar' often means sweetened with juice. These juices (used in many products) are actually concentrated syrups made up of a mi-ture of sugarssucrose, fructose and dextrose and will be very similar in kilojoule and nutrient content to one using sugar. Thus the consumer who has bought the product to reduce kilojoules (calories) has been misled. Also, the value of sugar as a preservative long acknowledged is now beginning to be appreciated. Researchers at the CSIRO Food Processing Division in Sydney, who have been some of the beneficiaries of levies in the past, are dealing with increased requests from the food industry and consumers to identify moulds that are being found on new products with decreased sugar or salt content. One of the comments made by scientists is this: Removing the sugar and salt causes problems because these bind moisture and hold it food is protected from mould. These products have a shorter shelf life, so mould growth is being noticed two days after opening e.g. in jams. The health risks of eating food contammated by fungi is not known but, as many moulds can produce toxins, the CSIRO advises people not to consume them. There are all kinds of research being undertaken in a great variety of ways by the sugar industry into the various claims that are being made not only with regard to sugar being unsafe but also with regard to the benefits to health of sugar. I want to quote from an article which deals with the safety of sugar. It follows some of the research that has been undertaken in other parts of the world, and is an indication of the kind of research that will be undertaken and able to be increased with the added levy that we are debating at the moment. Right from the outset, as a result of a great amount of research that has been done in the United States,for example, the following statement is made: Sugar is safe. It has been found to be so, over over again. This is the result of research into the use of the product. I want to quote from the three most recent reports because they cover the kinds of activities which we will be engaged in and extended by our own research people in this country. The United States Food and Drug Administration task force reported on the evaluation of health aspects of sugars contained in carbohydrate sweeteners as follows: Other than the contribution to dental caries, there is no conclusive evidence on sugars that demonstrates a hazard to the general public when sugars are consumed at the levels that are now current and in the manner now practised. That is a definitive statement from a very well recognised research organisation that has benefited from levies that are being paid in other countries for this kind of research. The British Nutrition Foundation's task force report on sugars and syrups in 1987 reported: There was no evidence of a direct association between sugar consumption and heart disease cancer, gallstones or diabetes.· ' That is another very significant and important comment to have come forward as a result of so that the this research. The United Kingdom Department of Health committee on medical aspects of food policy conducted an inquiry and report on dietary sugars and human disease in 1989. This is the finding it arrived at: Sugar does not contribute to heart disease, diabetes cancer, high blood pressure, gallstones or othe; major diseases; although,' as is the case in many areas of nutrition, more research is needed. They are the kinds of things that have taken place in other countries. A great deal has taken place in this country as a result of research into this wonderful food, as I describe it. I am very happy that we are debating this Bill to increase the availability of research funding to the sugar industry. I do this as one who has had this sweetness, as I said, running through my veins from a long way back. I know that the research which will result will be of a great benefit to the industry. .",73
237,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for and Primary Industries and Energy) (4.36 p.m.)There does not seem to be much opposition to the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill, and what became a pretty wide ranging debate earlier in the day I think has raised a number of issues that require some response. I say at the outset that I believe there is a very strong future for the sugar industry in this country. This piece of legislation will help underpin it because it provides the basis for increasing the amount of money that is spent on research and development within the industry. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) took issue on the question as to whether there was adequate funding. I think he confused what we were talking about in this legislation associated with Commonwealth contributions with what is paid in addition by way of State contributions to R&D. But the fact of the matter is that this piece of legislation will increase the proportion that goes into R&D, and it comes to us at the request of the industry. I join with of those who have congratulated the industry in having the foresight to support this decision, which is the reason we are in the House today. The fact of the matter, though, is that strong future needs more than just an underpinning by commitment to research and development. It needs a process by which we bring together all of the respective elements in the industry-not just the canegrowers, the millers, the refiners or the manufacturers, but all of those together. Such a structure does not exist in this industry at the moment. It for that reason that I established the committee that is to be chaired by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). The honourable member for Dawson took issue on this, saying that that was fobbing the matter off for consideration by a committee chaired by a backbencher. The honourable member for Dawson misunderstands the purpose of this committee, which is to bring together the different elements, the different stages, in the process of production to manufacture. We do not, as I said before, have such a structure in the industry. We did have it in the dairy industry, and I think it was very useful in helping us arrive at an outcome. The Australian Dairy Industry Council is a very representative organisation of both producers and manufacturers, but there is no such similar organisation in relation to the sugar industry-and that is the purpose of the committee. It is not my intention to abrogate my responsibility or, indeed, not to pursue the same approach as I did with the dairy industry. I make the commitment in this House, as I have indeed to members of the sugar industry-and the canegrowers in particular, with whom I have met at length over the last few weeks-that I am prepared to deal with them directly. I believe we need a mechanism by which these linkages between the various stages of operation can be achieved. I think, and the industry recognises, that it needs to get more effectively into the value adding activity, it needs to improve the technology, and it needs to promote economies of scale. I do not think there is disagreement with that all view. The question is: how do we do it? What I have done is to propose a means by which we can address it. That is the reason for the Courtice committee, if you like, but again I think that my that preparedness to demonstrate, by way of practical outcome in dairy, has given a very important signal to the canegrowers in this nation. They have had the opportunity of speaking with the dairy industry to understand how that process worked, and I think that they are well satisfied with that. We have the runs on the board and I think that, our having is achieved a very successful outcome in dairy, the sugar industry now wants to get on with the task of developing a similar response for it. I am committed to ensuring that we have a strong sugar industry, one that does more with the product that is produced-and, indeed, produces more product, for that matter-and one that converts it in a more effective and efficient way than in the past. The timing of the committee's report on these elements is really something that the committee needs to address in the early stages of its activities. I do not see it as being one, as someone suggested by way interjection, that is simply helping us get over problems associated with elections in the future. I think we can work constructively with the industry to bring forward a growth strategy for the industry, and I would prefer to do that sooner than later. But I will not rush the participants in relation to that. I think there are some important issues that they need to address. It will be an industry driven approach and the timing will be as a consequence of consultations that I have with them. Let me go to another issue that was raised predominantly in the speech by the honourable member for· Dawson. He took a lot of time and effort in dissecting, criticising and analysing the recommendations in the Industry Commission's report. And well he might, because that is really the problem that the coalition parties face in relation to the sugar industry. It is all very well for him to assert in this place that coalition policy, and indeed Fightback, is for negligible levels of tariff rather than zero. But I simply remind the honourable member for Dawson-and I am pleased to see that he is in the House now-of table 4.1 on page 34 of the executive summary of Fightback!, which is a table of reforms that would be introduced by a coalition government under Fightback. Under the heading 'Reform' is 'Rural and manufacturing assistance'. It makes no distinction between manufacturing and rural assistance. It lumps them all in together. the words 'Rural and manufacturing assistance' it has '(IC)'; in other words, if one reads the rest of .the document, one sees that the Industry Commission, the IC, has identified a number of savings that will produce efficiencies in the industry. It would adopt the Industry Commission's report. That is there in Fightback!. Then, under the heading 'Measures involved', it clearly states, in relation to rural releases. and manufacturing assistance, 'Elimination of tariff, quota and bounty assistance'. That is in Fightback!, and the canegrowers of this country know that is in Fightback!. That is why they refused to meet the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) when he went to the electorate of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) the other day. I simply pose this question to the House: if Fightback! says 'negligible tariff' and does not adopt the IC report, why did the honourable member for Dawson have to resign? If he could live with Fightback because he says that Fightback represents negligible tariffs; why is he now sitting on back bench? He was forced to resign because Fightback really does not say 'negligible tariffs'. There has been some momentum of recent times to try to reinterpret the position. Mr Downer-It is your Bill reducing tariffs. .",75
238,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,I will come to that in a minute.,77
239,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,Mr Hollis)The honourable member fur Mayo should not interject.,77
240,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The point I am making is this: if Fightback is good news for the canegrowers, why did the honourable member for Dawson resign? Fightback categorically says that the Opposition will eliminate all tariffs. There is plenty on the recordincluding the meeting that the canegrowers had with the Leader of the Opposition and Liberal Party in this House (Dr Hewson)-to suggest that its intention is to eliminate tariffs. So the canegrowers of this country know that, if the coalition were to win, they would be After faced with the adoption of the Industry Commission's report and zero tariff in accordance with that report either by the date proposed, which I think was 1998, or within the shorter time scale, depending upon the compensation payments contained in it. Mr Downer-The year 2000.",77
241,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,No. The Opposition has tried to say the year 2000 in subsequent press Mr Downer-That is what you said.,77
242,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"No, what I have saidMr Downer-You have just been telling us that.",77
243,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"No. Fightback says 'adoption of Industry Commission's report', and the Industry Commission's reportMr Downer-It does not say that.",77
244,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"It does say that. It makes no distinction between rural activities and manufacturing activities. It makes no distinction, uIilike our March economic statement of last year in relation to dairy, sugar and tobacco. We said 18 months ago that these the three rural industries needed to be looked at separately. But what does Fightback do? It lumps them all in together. It made no specific distinction for sugar; it made none for dairy. As I said on another occasion, the dairy package could not have been delivered by a coalition government. It could not have been delivered, because it would have been inconsistent with what is in the report. It is an ideological commitment to adopt everything that the Industry Commission says and to not have consultation with the industry. The reason that is the case is the reason canegrowers of this country are shunning the coalition. They know what Fightback stands for and they know what the zero tariff policy of the Opposition stands for. As I have said before, I have met on a number of occasions with the canegrowers of this country and they understand now very clearly what the Government's position is. They understand that there will be no change to the commitment that we have previously made and announced concerning the level of tariff, and that there will be no further change to that level of tariff until such time as we have had consultations with the industry. They know that, in adopting our response, we will not be driven by the Industry Commission's report, as would the coalition.. We will not be driven by it, but we will have discussions with the industry, in the way in which I have outlined, and we will develop a position with it. If anyone has any doubts about that mechanism, he should speak to the dairy farmers, because that is what we did. With an industry that was faced with a similar position, a very hostile Industry Commission's report, a response from the dairy industry that said it could not liveMr Downer-You said it would be reduced by 5 per cent.",77
245,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"No, the honourable member does not understand it. Mr Downer-Yes, you did. You said that. They were your words.",78
246,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,The honourable member does not understand what the Industry Commission report was about.,78
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member for Mayo should stop interjecting. He has been interjecting all through the Minister's speech. He must stop interjecting. Mr Downer-It is irrelevant to the Bill.,78
248,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"I am told it is irrelevant when I say it, but it is not irrelevant when colleague the honourable member for Dawson raises these issues in his speech. But the honourable member for Mayo would not know; he was not in the chamber to listen to the him-just as, apart from the honourable member for Dawson, there are no members of the coalition except my shadowMr Downer-And me.",78
249,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"And the honourable member for Mayo, because he has to be here. Mr Downer-And who is here from your Party?",78
250,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"lam making the point that we see these crocodile tears of concern. We are not the ones in difficulty with the canegrowers of this country about where we go in future; the coalition is. And its members are not in here to understand the appropriate direction that needs to be pursued. If there are any doubts about the success of the mechanism, I urge honourable members on the other side, as few of them as there are, to sit down with the dairy industry of this country and see how this process has been successfully developed. One can identify the circumstances for dairy that are similar now to sugar-that is, a hostile Industry Commission's report, a report which, the industry said, if implemented would wipe it out. But the industry was able to sit down with us, develop a strategy consistent with what we had outlined generally for tariffs and get an agreement that has been not only welcomed but applauded. That is the difference between this side of the House and the coalition: we will have regard to these economic analyses that are made from time to time and we will use the disciplines and the information that might come from the Industry Commission, but we will not be driven by it. An industry policy essentially means working with industry-not govemments or committees determining it and having it rubber-stamped-on the starting position of identifying what the potential is for that industry, then recognising the impediments to achieving that potential, and working with government to see whether his those impediments and difficulties can be removed. That is the approach that we would adopt, standing in stark contrast to what the Opposition would have the industry face up to if ever it were elected. Earlier in the debate the honourable member for Dawson spent some time attacking the Industry Commission report and then trying to promise a great benefit to the farmers of this country as a result of Fightback. He made some comments about how this Government had done nothing but increase costs and had done nothing in the way of micro-economic reform. I found it rather. odd that he spoke about how little had happened on the waterfront and then went on to say how our terminals in the sugar industry were amongst the most efficient in the world. How would we achieve that unless we had the cooperation of those operating the waterfront and the terminals? He admitted in his speech that the last occasion on which he had had an opportunity to speak to the Queensland sugar industry was four years ago. That would be a great font of information as to. the present circumstances! This is a very interesting table. I used it when I spoke to the National Farmers Federation a couple of weeks ago. The index of competitiveness is very important in terms of understanding how export industries are going to grow. This table demonstrates the measure of competitiveness in the period 1976-83-call it the Fraser years or call it the pre-accord years-and then the period 198391, which is when the accord has operated and when this Government has been in operation. As much as honourable members on the other side of the House might like to criticise and denigrate the prices and incomes accord, that is the measure of competitiveness in those two periods, and there has been a significant improvement in competitiveness under the accord. Those opposite not only want to turn a blind eye to it, because they do not understandMr Downer-Have a look at it.",78
251,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The honourable member can have the whole speech when I have finished, if he likes. It also jolted the National Farmers Federation when it was put to it. In terms of real unit labour costs-getting the cost structure down for the industry-again, that is the measure: pre-accord, post-accordMr Downer-It seems to be going up now. Why is that?",79
252,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"It went up in 1988-90, in the same way as it did in 1980-83, because of the recession and the counter-cyclical nature of the productivity and the capital investment being run down. Mr Downer-Why is it going up?",79
253,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"If the honourable member reads the speech, he will be able to understand it. There is significant improvement, despite what is said on the other side of the House. The other issue that has been addressed by honourable members on the other side of the House is the assertion that, on the basis of Treasury documentation, farmers will be $8,100 better off. These are the assertions-the mistruths-that are told to country people about what will come to them by way of Fightback. Mr MCLachlan-You are wrong.",79
254,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Barker is wrong. The assertion is that $8,100 is the benefit, but those opposite lump in the aggregate-not just agriculture but also forestry, hunting and fisheries. The figure for agriculture is not $1 billion in terms of the so called saving; it is closer to $700m. In other words, the amount they divide into is significantly deflated. The second point is that those opposite understate the number of farms that will benefit. They rely on a survey that excludes all of those farms which have less than $20,000 in the cash value of outputMr Downer-Hobby farmers.",79
255,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,They are not hobby farmers. These are farmers who have been left out in circumstances in which the recession has produced incomes and outputsMr Downer interjecting,79
256,Mr CREAN,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The honourable member wants to pose the question and then ignore the point. Farmers will not be better off to the tune that is proposed. Every one per cent increase in inflation in this country will add $1,200 to the costs of farmers. The Fightback package will increase the inflation rate by between 4 and 6 per cent-4 per cent on the Opposition's figures and 6 per cent on ours. That is the increased cost that will be delivered as a result of the Fightback package. The benefits will be non-existent and the costs will be forced up. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon) read a third time. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT· Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Debate resumed from 1 June, on the following papers presented by Mr Tickner: Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody-response by governments Aboriginal Deaths in Custody-Ministerial Statement, 31 March 1992 and on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the papers.",79
257,Mr NEWELL,SUGAR CANE LEVY AMENDMENT,"-,Australians speak of their multicultural society with some pride. That has not always been the case. In the unenlightened Menzies years and earlier, Australians were taught to fear reds under the bed and the threat of the yellow peril. The Whitlam Labor Government did much to educate the Australian community in terms of accepting and understanding its diverse multicultural make-up. The notion of a perpetually cosy Anglo-Saxon society stuck down in the antipodes was questioned. The work of the Whitlam Government on this score will be acknowledged by history. It was a period that saw significant societal change. Australian people began to think differently about their country and the people who made it what it was. It was no longer a case of thinking we lived in a WASP-ish colonial backwater. Australians were made to consider the true make-up of their society. That is in stark contrast to the coalition governments immediately before and after the Whitlam Government, when there was no progress, no change, just blame. Given the chance to have an honest look at Australia:n society in its complexity, I would venture to say that most Australians very much liked what they saw. I believe that this Government's response to the finding of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is of far greater historical importance than - t1am 's efforts to open the eyes of all Australians to the complex nature of our society. Our indigenous population is the very cornerstone of a rich multicultural society. But Australia has been a fractured society, tom apart by the absurd and arrogant notion of terra nullius. Our Aboriginal people have been treated with a mixture of ignorance and contempt by the non-Aboriginal community, and our society has suffered as a result. We have failed to adequately acknowledge the important contributions made to Australian life by our Aboriginal people. We have found ourselves living in a divided society, with benefits to all Australians diminished as a result. This response to the in-depth, intelligent and commendable report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody sets about addressing the causes of this division as well as the gross inadequacies that led to the deaths of these 99 young Australians, who represent only a proportion of those Aboriginal people who have died in custody through white Australian history. Central to this is the recognition of the need to achieve reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the wider Australian community. Without this reconciliation, any action taken by governments will be of the bandaid variety. This response acknowledges that we can no longer take that sort of approach and that we are faced with a long, hard road. It acknowledges the work to be done by everyone in the community. The report points out that because of the historical experience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their continuing disadvantage, relationships with nonAboriginal people are often characterised by - distrust, enmity and disputation'. In supporting the process of reconciliation, the report says that to succeed it must be accompanied by a renewed commitment to addressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social and economic disadvantage; that it must have strong and bipartisan support; and that the focus should be on the process of reconciliation and not on any instrument which may be an outcome of that process. The Commonwealth Government has already established the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation with 25 council members, both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginals, from a wide cross-section of the community. The Federal Parliament has unanimously given its support. Three fundamental principles underpin the process of reconciliation and the work of the Council. First, there is a decade-long commitment to promoting a deeper understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and of the need to redress that disadvantage. There could be no better way to celebrate the history of our Federation in 2001 than by witnessing significant change in our respect for and understanding of non-Aboriginal Australians. The Minjunbal Aboriginal Museum in my electorate of Richmond is an example of the early stages of this educative process. The popularity of the museum with local school groups, and other groups, points to a new generation of Australians-better educated, better informed and better equipped to really tackle the hard task of reconciliation than generations brought up with the contemptible notion of terra nullius. The Royal Commission has argued that considerable advances can be achieved by increasing the amount of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies in teacher training and schools. The Commonwealth will encourage the development and implementation of Aboriginal studies curricula through its national reconciliation and schooling strategy. The strategy involves a number of commitments which will make a substantial contribution to the way Australian society views its indigenous population. Aboriginal studies curricula are to be developed for all schools across Australia from kindergarten to year 12. There will be teacher education courses aimed at promoting greater sensitivity towards Aboriginal issues and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. There is· also a commitment to establish a sister school system between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal schools. And, as is already happening to an extent in my electorate, this Government's response includes the promotion of greater understannon- ding by students of their local Aboriginal community and its history. There is also a commitment to increase the school community'S capacity to research local Aboriginal history and to involve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in classroom activities. The second major principle underpinning the process of reconciliation is the commitment to social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and an ongoing national commitment to cooperation to address disadvantage. One cannot help wondering. where the reconciliation process could possibly go under a coalition government with its commitment to reducing the budget for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs by $80m per year. Thirdly, this Government's response to the report includes a commitment to extensive consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the wider. community to determine whether all Australians want a more formal document of reconciliation. The Royal Commission report says: the Commissioner Dodson speaks of the need for a maturing of the relationship between Aboriginal and non Aboriginal people; a deeper understanding of how each sees the other and why; a bringing out of the common ground between us. The Royal Commission found that relationships between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the non-Aboriginal society were at the heart of the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody. Relationships must be very bad indeed when we consider that the·report found that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were being imprisoned at a rate 29 times higher than that for non-Aboriginal Australians. In earlier remarks on this statement, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) quite correctly made reference to the referendum figures. Interestingly, he pointed out that, despite its high acceptance· across Australia, there was great disparity between urban and country areas in terms of voting for the referendum. He said that in urban areas the non-acceptance of the referendum was down to 4 per cent; whereas in country areas it was as high as 20 per cent. It is a little difficult reconcile the discrepancy between those figures. But, in an attempt to do so, I would say that the issue that non-Aboriginal Australians have not been prepared to face up to also goes to the heart of what reconciliation is all about: the attitudes of nonAboriginal Australians; the educative process, which has produced a culture within us; employment; and academic credentials. That was certainly the case in earlier days, but it is becoming less so now. Non-Aboriginals were very unaccepting of a society and a culture which did not embrace the particular attributes of employment, or some academic credentials. As we move to attaining more of a multicultural society, all that will hopefully pass. Reconciliation cannot be advanced without evidence of positive measures to address the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths iri Custody. Aborig-al and Torres Strait Islander people, and indeed all Australians, need to see evidence that the inequalities-economic, social and physicalto which they have been subjected are being readily addressed. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has been made aware by ATSIC of a number of concerns relating to reconciliation that serve to highlight the complex nature of the reconciliation process. Participants at several meetings raised important issues when they called for consultations with the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to be done on a community basis, led by traditional leaders in their own language. These groups have also highlighted the fact that reconciliation, as presented by the Government, is not properly understood by Aboriginal people, particularly those who need to relate it in the context of Aboriginal law. Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are sceptical about reconciliation. One speaker at a meeting held in Canberra expressed this perfeCtly. He said, 'How can you be reconciled when you've never been married?'. If Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians have been married, it has been an ugly shotgun wedding, marred by violence, substance abuse, the breakdown of the family to unit, and worse. But I believe it is an alliance all the same that has not irretrievably broken down. This Government's response should ensure that the alliance is improved upon to the point where we are equal, if different, partners. I believe the process of social reconciliation has already begun in a broad sense. It was encouraging to note the media attention given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues in the days leading up to, and immediately following, the announcement of this Government's response. The treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by segments of the Australian population was heartily condemned. The tone of news reports was one of outrage. How could Australians be subjecting fellow Australians to such grossly unfair treatment? The issue of non-Aboriginal Australians' treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders was placed firmly on the public agenda. This response aims to ensure that it stays on the agenda; that it is an issue that will only be resolved by being at the fore of Australia's national conscience in the most constructive way possible. The Royal Commission recognised the impact, both positive and negative, that the media has on perceptions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) also mentioned this impact in his address yesterday. The report emphasised the importance of Aboriginal and Islander media in giving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a public voice and raising their self image. The Koori Mail, Australia's first national newspaper reflecting the views and concerns of Aboriginal Australians, operates from an office in south Lismore-an area adjacent to my electorate of Richmond on the north coast of New South Wales. This is a newspaper of a high standard that has been instrumental in putting many issues of concern to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders on the national agenda. The report makes a number of recompolicy mendations aimed at ensuring the viability the media, such as the Koori Mail. The Commonwealth is reviewing its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander broadcasting policy in the light of the recommenempowerment dations made by the report. The Koori Mail Non-Aboriginal is showing the important role Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander media can play in the to essential reconciliation process. The same true of both CAAMA, the Central Australian nature Aboriginal Media Association, and· TAMA, examined the Townsville Aboriginal Media Association. The Royal Commission's recommendations sion are also aimed at bringing about changes in media practices. and policies in reporting nalism, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. The Commonwealth accepts a responsibility to day basis. to encourage the media industry to adopt strategies which will give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people better opporlevel tunities for training and employment in commercial media organisations. It will also encourage the development of journalist training courses, codes and practices on the presentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues and promote the establishment of awards for excellence in Aboriginal affairs reporting. The role that the media play in this instance is one· of empowerment. This matter was Australia addressed by the report and is summed the comment, 'There is no other way. Only the Aboriginal people can, in the final annual analysis, assure their own future'. The esrights tablishment by this Government of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander' Commisexpired). sion, ATSIC, has gone some of the way towards addressing the question of Aboriginal empowerment. The main emphasis of the recommendations made by the Royal Commission is the elimination of disadvantage and the growth of empowerment and the self determination of Aboriginal society. The Commission expressed strongly the need for Aboriginal and Islander groups to be involved in implementing its 339 recommensupporting dations. The Government's response to the recommendations in the report provides the opportunity to further incorporate the concepts of empowerment and self-determination into making and program development. In of his overview to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Commissioner Elliott Johnston, QC, said that the whole thrust of the report was directed towards the of Aboriginal society. He said: Australia must face the fact that for a very long time we have proceeded on the basis that Aboriginal people were inferior, were unable make decisions affecting themselves, that we is knew what was best for them; it became second for us to have that attitude. . . But until I the files of the people who died and the other material that has come before the Commisand listened to Aboriginal people speaking, I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter pateropen contempt and total indifference which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day The depth of understanding achieved by the commissioner as described here is the same of understanding we should be aiming for in the Australian community at large. Australia stands to be judged internationally by this response. In fact, this response of the Royal Commission into Aborigirial Deaths in Custody should mark the start of a new era for Australians. It will be an era during which we are no longer condemned by other nations for our treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, but' applauded. should aim to lead the world in this up by area and be a country admired and not criticised. To be commended is the proposed state of the nation report on the human of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. This independent agency-(Time . Question resolved in the affirmative. NA One Nation Debate resumed from 26 March, on motion by Mr Keating: That the House take note of the papers.",80
258,Ms CRAWFORD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"In the One Nation statement, I bring to the attention of the House some of the things that have occurred which were signalled by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he made his One Nation statement on 26 February. The Prime Minister told us he had a vision for Australia which would take Australia into the twenty-first century, which would be built on cooperation and a competitive and more highly skilled and trained Australia. This was not simply some kind of vision that was plucked out of the air to make people feel good; this was a vision which was practical, constructive and on the ground. I am delighted to report to the House that I know of two things cited in the One Nation package which are happening and which will continue to happen. On Friday, along with the Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland, I will be inspecting the progress that has already been made on the Gold Coast rail link-that is, the extension of the rail link from Brisbane to the Gold Coast, from Beenleigh to Robina. What we have seen is action. This rail link is already in the process of construction. People have jobs out of it. It will provide development for the area and, in the long run, an opportunity for residents of Logan City to access the jobs which flow from the tourism and hospitality industry sited on Australia's Gold Coast. So there is one very clear example of action which has come out of the One Nation statement. Another major action to take place has been in the aviation industry. Many honourable members would recognise that a decision has already been taken to merge Qantas and Australian Airlines. The planning process is under way and Australians can take heart from the fact that no longer will there be huge Qantas jets flying empty from Perth, Melbourne and other places. Instead, the airline will be inextricably linked to the domestic market. As we heard today from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), people who live in Hobart are delighted that they will be able to access international airlines from anywhere in Australia. This is revolutionary change. It is change which can come about only through cooperation and vision and by putting in place real, constructive government policy. Another major area mentioned in the One Nation statement concerns the development of the tourism industry. I was·delighted to see at the Gold Coast a program being developed to attract people from other parts of Australia to the Gold Coast strip. Indeed, a whole range of prizes and excitement was being offered to lure people who live in the south, and whose winters are perhaps a little colder, to visit the delightful Gold Coast. Already it is being predicted-and it is happening this year-that there will be enormous growth in the tourism industry. In that area tourism is up by 30 per cent this year. So one has to say that this is economic recovery on a great scale. What does tourism bring to Australia? It brings opportunities for us to provide services and for the commercial sector to develop buildings. Australians benefit as economies are generated from the money that is spent within Australia. The tourism industry itself recognises that the number of visitors will go up from 2.4 million to 6.5 million by the end of this decade. I congratulate this Government on being the first government to have a Minister for Tourism. The Minister is a member of Cabinet and has a national tourism strategy. I was delighted that the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) was able to visit Brisbane and meet with a group of people who are heavily involved in the tourism industry. The Minister was able to hear what those people wanted to say and to discuss it with them. All those people, who were from a wide political spectrum, congratulated the Minister and the Prime Minister on the action they have taken to develop the tourism industry and on ensuring that it continues to become one of our major export earners. Indeed, it provides a whole range of jobs for our young people which are portable throughout Australia and the world. I might say that this is in great contrast to the proposal by honourable members opposite who seek to impose a 15 per cent goods and services tax on that aspect of tourism, which will certainly hurt the industry. However, as in all things in relation to the Fightback package, there are some special benefits for those who are rich. If people travel to Hawaii or some other international exotic place, they will be exempt from the GST. The rich and those who go overseas on wonderful holidays could not possibly be charged a goods and services tax. But, never fear, our local hard-working, battling Australians who want to go down the coast and stay a few nights in a caravan or cheap motel must be hit. Once again, they will be hit with a good old goods and services tax. The tourism industry understands this. The south-eastern Queensland industry knows that almost 80 per cent of those who holiday on the Gold Coast are Australians: it is a domestic market. Many of them are local south-eastern Queenslanders. For them, the impact of a goods and services tax is quite horrifying. r also mention those who run some of the most interesting amusement areas on the Gold Coast which lure people there all the time-Movie World, Sea World, Dreamworld and so on. Families like to go to these places to enjoy themselves. At present the admission fee is about $30 or $40 for an adult and half of that for a child. It is quite extraordinary want to put a 15 per cent tax on such a fee. The operators understand that people will not have any more money under a goods and services tax-not to mention the fact that their accountants and office administrators will be enormously busy. r am just simply drawing attention to the kinds of differences that exist between the Government and the Opposition. Here we have a One Nation package. We have already seen in place the development of the national tourism strategy. We have seen a tremendous growth in the tourism industry this year. We have also seen the change, the dramatic revolution, which is occurring in the aviation industry and which will bring national travel into the realm of feasibility for many more Australians. So we see under this Government an industry being recognised for what it is-a major export earner and also a major generator of jobs and employment for many of our young Australians. The other major area that One Nation addresses, and in a very dramatic way, is the area of training. Indeed, we have already seen action on this. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) is already negotiating with the States in relation to the technical and further education sector. Many of us who have been involved in education recognise that that sector has been marked by a decline over the past decade. Whereas we have had a doubling of students staying on at secondary school-from 40 per cent to 75 or 80 per cent of our students staying on at school to year 12-and a doubling of students going to university, the TAPE sector has declined. We have to ask ourselves why. Why have the State governments found themselves unwilling or unable to put money into what is becoming a vitally important and crucial sector of education if we are to have a trained and skilled work force into the twenty-first century. The money, the impetus and the drive for us to expand our TAPE section, to ensure that industry is part of TAPE, that we comply with industrial standards, that we move to the national accreditation of very many of our to apprenticeships and change the nature of the way in which apprentices operate-all of those things are important and are at the heart of changing that training sector. Along with that is the notion of entry level wages and the youth training wage. Indeed, those were addressed yesterday by the Prime Minister at the youth unemployment summit. He has acted on what he was asked for there yesterday and is going to hold a summit with business people to do something constructive and real to develop better employment strategies for our youth. The Jobskills program is one of the very important programs that were signalled in the One Nation statement. r cite my own experience: only the week before last 116 unemployed people in my electorate of Forde were found positions under the Jobskills program. Indeed, we will be looking to place another 100 or 150 in the next couple of weeks. So those programs are providing real hope and real jobs for people on the ground. This is not some sort of vision dreamed up on a computer in the middle of the night. These are tangible projects that are happening. People understand that they are happening; they understand that they are very definitely part of the One Nation package. r tum to the way we treat industry and the question of the wholesale sales tax reforms which will bring about a change in the way very many of our small companies operate. People may be interested to know that there are 800,000 small businesses in Australia, all of which would have to pay a goods and services tax if the coalition were in government. Currently, only 70,000 of them pay wholesale sales tax, and under the new regime only 16,000 of the 800,000 will be subject to the wholesale sales tax regime. Those opposite talk about everything and everybody paying wholesale sales tax and say that people already have to accommodate it. Let me tell honourable members that there are over 700,000 small businesses in Australia that have nothing to do with the wholesale sales tax regime in this country-nothing to do with it. But, my goodness, would they have something to do with the goods and services tax. They would be up all night every night doing work for the Opposition. But we do not have to worry about that and people do not have to worry about that because Australians just will not buy another tax. One of the most pleasing aspects of the One Nation statement for very many families in my electorate and across Australia was the one-off payment of the family allowance. We have heard some very deprecating remarks, in particular from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and others, about this one-off payment. But I can tell them that people who were putting children into school found the money very useful for school bags and school shoes, and in some parts of Australia found an ability to buy winter clothing for their children. They welcomed it and they understood that this Government is about families; it is about providing support for families and for working families. The fact that the money will continue by $3 per week per child is welcomed by all those families in Australia. They understand very clearly what One Nation is about. It is about cooperation, about working together and about creating a great and wonderful country. I have to say that this is in diametric contrast to the situation, which can only be called the tragedy of Burnie, where we see the Opposition's industrial relations policy the workplace clearly outlined for the whole of Australia. It involves conflict, division, setting family against family, worker against worker and, of course as always, boss against worker. We understand that and we know that very clearly. That kind of fear, mistrust, and of course ultimately lack of profitability, lack of productivity and lack of any sort of reasonable, meaningful process in the workplace, contrasts with the kind of enterprise bargains that have been negotiated under our regime. Indeed, only yesterday, one of our big unions in Australia negotiated an enterprise agreement right across Australia for about half a million workers. That is Labor Party policy. That is what One Nation is about. It is about working together to ensure that infrastructure is put in place, that things actually happen, that families are catered for and that in the big picture, when we are building roads, railways, national electricity grids, TAPE colleges and all those sorts of things for the community as a whole, we do not forget the individuals and individual families and that we continue to support them. We know very clearly that we operate as a community and that we care as a community. It is this kind or cooperative effort and cooperative spirit that dominates One Nation and that the Australian people feel and understand very clearly. It is that kind of society that they want to take into the twentyfirst century. (TIme expired)",83
259,Mr FORD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The resurrection of the debate in this chamber on the absurdly titled One Nation statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) comes at a time when prospects for a return to prosperity are even more precarious than they were earlier this year. . One can look at unemployment levels. One can look at the lack of productivity. One can look at the investment figures-II consecutive quarters as a percentage of GDP at a record low level. Indeed, as the nation slides further into the black hole of debt, of uncontrolled debt, and becomes an increasingly uncompetitive player in the world marketplace, the Prime Minister's pathetic in pork-barrelling promises are revealed as the sham that most Australians already know them to be. Is it not good that the Prime Minister is now a pork producer? He is porkbarrelling. It is rather ironic. I wonder whether he will continue to tell porkies at Question Time. Those opposite should realise that the Prime Minister is just in a blind panic. It is not policy by evaluation or consideration, but panic. When this Government came to office in 1983, the foreign debt was about $23 billion. Since then the indebtedness has continued to climb relentlessly. It is now over $140 billion. But there is no evidence that any of the policies of this Government, particularly those outlined in the One Nation statement, will in any way reduce this horrendous sum by even $1. It may come as a surprise to honourable members opposite to know that one of the founding principles of the Australian Labor Party was the control of public debt. Those genuine representatives of the working class in whose interests the ALP was initially formed would be dismayed to see the extent to which their ideals have been corrupted a century later. The Labor Party, which in the last 20 years has been so comprehensively hijacked by the beard-stroking trendoids from the campuses of the 1960s and the self-interested thugs from the Swanston Street Soviet, would be disinherited by such worthy forebears as Andrew Fisher, Joe Scullin, John Curtin, Ben Chifley and Arthur Calwell, to name a few. Nowhere is the betrayal of the great quest of the 1890s more evident than in the words and actions of the present Prime Minister. Which of the great Laborites of the last hundred years would pour scorn on his fellow Australians by referring to them as scrubbers from the west? No-one. I believe all would regard the interests of Australia as being of much greater importance than their own selfpursuit for power. No previous leader was so lacking in understanding of his own society that he would so callously have engineered a depression and thrown a million people onto the unemployment scrap heap. The current Prime Minister openly boasts about these good figures. During Question Time he claims that we are heartless. Who can imagine John Curtin so blatantly coveting the trappings of middle-class respectability that he would pour scorn on those Australians in the electorate with whom he grew up? A person of Curtin's stature and integrity would be sickened and disgusted by the hollow promises and egotistical tone of the One Nation statement. Of course, in reality, One Nation has nothing whatsoever to do with securing a prosperous future for this nation and its people; it has nothing to do with reducing our foreign indebtedness, making us more competitive, restoring employment opportunities or dealing with the chronic structural problems that so impede economic progress. It is a statement about one thing, and one thing only: the retention of the Prime Minister's job. When the inevitable historical comparisons are drawn, this pretender to the highest office in this land will be judged and will be found wanting. History will detail that in 16 economic statements he never got it right. History will detail how he destroyed the prospects of over a quarter of a million families in Australia. In my electorate of Dunkley the Prime Minister will be found wanting by the 7,272 registered unemployed, 200 of whom have joined this unhappy army since the release of the One Nation statement. No doubt the young people trapped in the educational institutions know that when the inevitable day of reckoning arrives, there will be no jobs anyway. They have been gratified by the Prime Minister's concern for their future, I don't think! Having ensured their effective exclusion from the labour market by the rent-seeking thuggery of the Swanston Street Soviet, this Government is condemning a generation to the humiliation and despair of a world of welfare and dependence. For them, this will be a world in which they do not have the freedom to exchange their labour for a fair price or to take charge of their own lives. Clyde Cameron, a former Labor Minister, has repeatedly stated that he regrets having allowed youth wages to increase to the point where many have been excluded from the work force. It will be a world where increasingly their every change of status, educational records, deposits in bank accounts, medical history, taxation records, and other private and sensitive information, will be available to nosy bureaucrats, obsessed with the interminable form filling and everexpanding data bases. In contrast to the demented rhetoric of the One Nation statement, we have seen that Senator Walsh-whose comments ought to be compulsory reading in universities, especially those of the Dawkins variety-has exposed the real agenda of the education mafia. In discussing the question of the so-called unmet demand for tertiary places, Senator Walsh rightly raises some very fundamental questions about the purpose of tertiary education and the number of people who have the intellectual ability to complete such courses. In reflecting on these crucial matters in yesterday's Australian Financial Review, he states: The demand for university places is being fed by poor youth employment prospects, aggravated by the recession, and the much larger proportion which now completes high school is also probably related to poor employment prospects. Over the past 10 years high school 'retention rates' (ie, those completing high school) have doubled to almost 70 per cent. One consequence of this huge increase in retention rates is that today's average high school graduate has less ability to complete a university course. They are, however, encouraged to try. The current system makes no attempt to maintain an ongoing objective minimum university entry standard. Many academics and university administrators know that. A few even have the moral courage to say so. At the very least politicians should support them when they do. So much for the Government's education policy! The Dawkins legacy will live for decades. So much for its concern for young people! So much for its commitment to excellence and the clever country! On page 57 of the One Nation statement we are told that in 1992-93 the taxpayer will be providing $49m for 10,000 prevocational training places in TAFE colleges. To quote from One Nation: These courses ·will provide training opportunities . . . for young people who have been unable to obtain jobs and who are at risk of entering long term unemployment. What an admission of CUlpability. Who seriously believes that such measures will do anything for the hapless recipient of more training courses? Training for what, one might ask. In case the Prime Minister is not aware, youth have been deliberately priced out of the labour market, and no amount of so-called training will get them back into it. In my electorate of Dunkley youth unemployment is at least 60 per cent and in some areas it is more like 70 per cent. Precisely what kind of jobs does the Prime Minister and the bureaucracy believe these young people will actually get? The sad reality is that there are virtually no jobs for young people. Even university graduates are finding it hard to get work. For end-of-year apprentices the outlook is just as gloomy. Having presided over the de-industrialisation of Australia, does the Prime Minister seriously believe there will be employment opportunities for skilled tradesmen in the future? The greenies and the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) are doing their best to destroy our great mining industry, while their overt hostility to industrial development of any kind has halted most major projects in recent times. Honourable members should look at the pitiful number of major projects proceeding in the country at the moment. The One Nation statement has been widely condemned-and rightly so. It is little more than an unfunded way of pouring millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds into already featherbedded industries. It is all borrowed money. Surely it is about time that Australia tried to pay its way and stand on its own financial feet, so that we become an nation independent of international financiers. The Prime Minister comes into this House every sitting day claiming the credit for whatever is right in the economy and blaming everyone else for the failures of the past nine year. However, despite what he says, the situation is slowly deteriorating. Honourable members should look at my home State of Victoria. Official statistics reveal an unemployment rate of over 11 per cent. Most commentators believe it is probably more like 18 per cent. In the electorate of Dunkley it is at least 25 per cent. The effects of the Nissan collapse and the continued failure of so many businesses are yet to be felt. Let us look at the record of the Prime Minister himself. It is worse than that of any senior Minister in the nation's history. Let us look at his promises and remember his forecasts. Eight years ago he said: Tonight I am proud to be able to tell the Australian people that we now have strong economic growth, many more jobs, a substantial fall in inflation and declining interest rates. In his 1987 Budget Speech, he claimed: Our economic strategy is now bearing fruit. Two years later foreign debt passed $100 billion and the news from Canperra was still phoney: Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving. Less than two years ago the Prime Minister was still full of optimism and inflated forecasts for the future when he said: The current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up . . . all delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession.  Wellington once said, 'If you believe that, you will believe anything'. But if the Prime Minister does not believe me, he should come and see for himself. He should come to Dunkley and see the people whose lives he has wrecked by the recession we had to have, and the depression we did not want. He should come down to Dunkley and see the unemployed youth, with resentment and defeat stamped all over them. He should come down to Dunkley and see the empty shops and idle factories. He should come down to Dunkley and spend a day with the Brotherhood of St Laurence or behind the counter at the Department of Social Security. He should come and see the depression of the 1990s at first hand. From 1983 through to this One Nation statement, the Prime Minister has got it wrong-so wrong it would be laughable if it were not so tragic. It is quite obvious that he has not learnt from his mistakes. Maybe he cannot learn; maybe he can only abuse and bully. That could explain much of his behaviour. Maybe he is just one of T.S. Eliot's 'hollow men'-an appearance of substance on the outside but, on closer examination, just nothing at all. As John Stone reflected in his 1984 Shann Memorial Lecture entitled '1929 and All That', the experiences of history can be most illuminating, especially with respect to economic catastrophes like depressions. Now that the Prime Minister has suddenly discovered history-or is it that he has discovered a speech writer with a PhD in history-he might consider studying a previous depression. If that proves too difficult, he might care to refer to Mr Stone's address published in the October 1984 issue of Quadrant. Better still, perhaps his advisers might care to reflect on some of the more salient features of the last depression. In particular, they might care to consider the words of the arbitration court of 62 years ago. It said: The difficultyin the hearing before the courtwas to get union advocates not to live in the past but to face the present situation and future prospects. Incredibly, the court went on to say: Great and increasing unemployment is strongly symptomatic of a wage level too high for our present capacity. It is a pity that, rather like the emperor, the Prime Minister is more interested in his clothes than in history. The current wage levels are not the problem. It is poor productivity, poor work practices and high government taxes on labour costs which are impoverishing this nation. This Prime Minister has been responsible for turning this great nation into an economic basket case. Yet, even now, he has-to use his own expression-the absolute gall to claim that the country is in great shape. (Time expired)",86
260,Mr JOHNS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services) (5.43 p.m.)-Let me warm to this theme. The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) raised the question of youth employment and youth training. He and I both know that one of the most important reasons-perhaps the most important reason-why there are simply not enough jobs for young people in Australia today is that we do not have the same sort of manufacturing, production-line approach to jobs that there once was. We simply do not have those jobs which we once had in the railways or on the factory floor, as storemen and packers, street sweepers and so on. We do not have, and we will never have again, the situation of days gone by when it was possible for a 14-year-old or a 15-yearold to get a job without undergoing training. The only solution to the problem of jobs for youth is through training. In fact, the best signal of a healthy economy is a well trained group of young people. The honourable member should not misrepresent the case of youth unemployment; rather, he should analyse what it is in the economy which needs to be fixed or better understood. I am talking about the sort of money that One Nation has promised, and delivered, in terms of training for youth. I will refer to some of the remarks that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made yesterday in a speech at the opening of a forum for youth training and employment. I also want to look at an idea raised by the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, Peter Hollingworth, who I think has responded in the wrong way to the problem of youth employment, as has the honourable member for Dunkley. The Prime Minister said yesterday that we have to pour a great deal of money into the technical and further education system. We will do that, either in conjunction with the State systems-which fund 90 per cent of TAFEs-or against them. I do not care that much, to tell you the truth; but we must pour more money into that sector of training. The One Nation statement has already started that process. The honourable member for Bennelong (Me Howard) has a yearning to the effect that if we cannot do anything else then why do we not just produce dead-end jobs? Do honourable members remember that? The honourable member for Bennelong said, 'Look, why don't we recreate the jobs whereby you go and sweep the streets .and clean the factory floors?'. It is no backwards. The sorts of jobs that will be, and are being, produced every day in Australia are jobs which require great skills. There is no use suggesting that there is an alternative, that we can all go out there and, as Archbishop Hollingworth said, have a community service program for youth whereby all young people of a particular age should go out-and he does not say it should be compulsory, but he does imply this-and work for a year as volunteers in order to receive the dole. Neither treating youth as a subclass or an underclass of the total number of people seeking jobs, nor going back and trying to recreate the jobs that will never reappear in the Australian economy are solutions. Archbishop Peter Hollingworth-decent person; wrong idea in this case-and the honourable member for Bennelong both fail to understand that we have to lift our performance in terms of training, and One Nation is directed at that particular point of view. Ross Gittins made the point-and this was quoted by the Prime Minister yesterday-that if we cannot do better than the creation of dead-end jobs there will not be much hope for the rest of us. He said: An economy in which there is a great demand for unskilled workers is an economy at the bottom of the pile in the international division of labour; one with a low standard of living, producing low value, labour-intensive goods and watching the nations with cleverer; better-equipped workers pass it by. He is right. I know and the honourable member knows that we have failed to produce significant numbers of those sorts of jobs. But at least we ought to get the analysis right and then follow it up. The money needs to go towards training for skills. It is no use suggesting that the problem is other than that. The November economic statement of last year also addressed'this very question. What sort of progress has this Government made in that direction? I will cite some of the figures. The Prime Minister, in his speech yesterday, said: There has never been a group of school leavers in Australia with higher levels of formal education than the group now entering the labour market. In the last decade the proportion of young people completing secondary schooling has doubled-from use looking 35% in 1981 to 70% in 1991. Mr MCLachlan-That's brilliant.",89
261,Mr JOHNS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"It is brilliant. He continued: Our higher education system compares well with the OECD average. In 1992 around '500,000 Australians are participating in higher education, increase of over 120,000 students since 1987-or the equivalent of 12 new universities. By 1994, we will have increased the total number of Commonwealth-funded university places by 50% since 1983. Over the 1992-1994 triennium, the Government plans to spend a total of $13 billion on higher education. We can see these changes reflected in the education and labour market profile of young people. In the mid 1960s nearly six in ten 15-19 year olds had a full-time job; by the early 19908, this stood than one in three. Less than one in three were time students in the mid 1960s; now six in ten are. In April 1992, 117,000 of our 1.3 niillion teenagers were seeking full-time jobs. One in ten young people is unemployed-which is actually 32,000 less than the number seeking jobs in April 1983 in the last recession. Our goal is not simply to keep young people busy and off the streets, but to make sure that they are sufficiently trained to take advantage of the jobs that are appearing which require skilled labour. It is not good enough to say, 'Well, we have not got the jobs'. We know that. We know there are insufficient numbers of jobs. But we do not stop the effort in training. Those opposite have already stated in .their Fightback package that they would cut back on the level of training; that they do not regard it as a priority. Let me take up the question of Peter Hollingworth, who has a very high profile and is held in very high regard in the welfare sector. I am afraid his statements were very misplaced yesterday when he said he wanted to establish what he called a community service program for youth. I want to read the response by Margaret Bell-an Australian who is the World President of the International Association for Volunteer Effortwho today strongly criticised Archbishop Hollingworth's proposal, which she described as: ... exclusive, dangerous and potentially linked to receipt of benefit. His idea was that a young unemployed person could gain personal development and training through a year's community service in environment, sport, recreation, culture, youth welfare and local organisations. This apparently full time community work, whilst not an explicitly a condition of the receipt of unemployment benefits, at least would carry with it that sense of work for the dole. I caution Archbishop Hollingworth that he should not go down that track. To establish a special scheme for youth is to set them apart. He describes youth unemployed as an underclass. There is nothing better designed to maintain the notion of unemployed youth as an under class than a special scheme for that at less youth under class, whereby young people full- volunteer to work for a year in return for the dole. Whilst a number of people in the community have approached me from time to time with this sort of concept, in the end all it does is put a label on a particular class of individual in the community, and it does not train them in the skills. that are absolutely essential. So I canvass those in the welfare sector who from time to time think that is a great response to youth unemployment. It is not. I certainly counsel the honourable member for Bennelong, who says that producing dead-end jobs-that is, returning to the 1950s and 1960s-is some sort of solution to youth unemployment. It is not. Let us see essentially one of the Opposition's responses to youth. Not only are those opposite not all that interested in training youth, but also they want to tax the food out of their mouths. Let me raise the question of the GST, the consumption tax. Mr MCLachlan-Cheaper food, you mean.",91
262,Mr JOHNS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"No, it is not. I will give the honourable member some examples whereby a number of countries which have introduced a value added or a goods and services tax have at least had the decency either to exempt food from that tax or to have a lower rate of value adcied tax or GST on food. But in this caseMr MCLachlan-The Prime Minister said you shouldn't do that.",91
263,Mr JOHNS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"No, we have a differential. Mr MCLachlan-He said that in 1985.",91
264,Mr JOHNS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Oh, 1985. Struth! I think I was on the planet then. A number of countries have chosen to have a GST, but even in Margaret Thatcher's England she had the decency to have a GST which was not applied to food at the punitive rate at which it was applied to other goods. If we run through a number of examples, we see that Austria has a standard rate of VAT of 20 per cent but the rate on food is only 10 per cent; Belgium has a standard rate of VAT at 19 per cent, but on food only 6 per cent; Canada has a Federal GST-it has a State one as well-at 7 per cent but a zero rate for basic groceries. But a n-mber of countries, such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and our dear friends in New Zealand rate food exactly the same as any commodity for VAT. In Denmark there is a 22 per cent standard rate for VAT, and 22 per cent on food also. That is disgraceful! France has an 18.6 per cent standard rate of VAT but, thank goodness, on food it is only 5.5 per cent; Germany, 14 per cent standard rate, 7 per cent on food; Greece, 16 per cent standard rate, 6 per cent on food; Hungary, 25 per centMr MCLachlan-Four times the price.",92
265,Mr JOHNS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Yes, but those opposite do not differentiate; that is the problem. Hungary-this is aptly named-has a 25 per cent standard rate and a zero rate for food. That is an acknowledgment of the ability to fiddle the system, that is, pick and choose between the goods and services that perhaps ought to be more generously treated by tax-which is what we do under our present system. Those opposite want to turn that around and make sure that they make jewellery and fast - as cheaper but make food more expens1ve.. Essentially, a VAT is nothing more than a flat rate of income tax. That is what the Opposition wants to do. It wants to take the progressive nature of taxation out of the system, to the extent that it c-n. I! will substitute one tax for another, but m domg so it will be sending out signals that certain goods will be cheaper and certain other goods will be dearer. There are some beautiful examples as we run through these other countries, which have said; 'Hey, that's not the right thing to do; that's immoral. If we going to impose a VAT, at least we will tax at a much lower rate basic food items'. In Ireland, which has a 25 per cent VAT, there is a zero VAT on food; Italy has an 18 per cent standard VAT, 4 per cent on food; Japan has only a 3 per cent VAT, but food is exempt; Luxembourg has a 12 per cent VAT, but the rate on food is only 6 per cent; and our dear friends in New Zealand-the purists, with the pure model that the Opposition wants to introduce-have 121h per cent right across the board. The Netherlands, more sensible I guess, if one of these ridiculous taxes has to be used, has an 18 1h per cent standard VAT, but only 6 per cent o- f?od. In Norway, !hat high taxing country, 1t 1S 20 per cent nght across the board, including food; Portugal has 17 per cent as a standard rate, zero on food; Spain, a 12 per cent standard rate, 6 per cent for basic foodstuffs; and Sweden, another high taxing country, a 23.46 per cent VAT right across the board, food included-and what an awful place to live in Sweden must be these days. Switzerland has no VAT-it knocked it off in a referendum in 1977. It is good to see that referenda d.o not get up in other places as well. Turkey 1S very sens1ble: whilst it has a VAT at 10 per cent, the rate for basic foodstuffs is only 3 per cent. The United Kingdom, which has a 171h per cent VAT, has a zero rate for food. All I am saying is that if those opposite want to have a flat rate tax, which is what VATs and GSTs are all about, they should note that a number of nations that have introduced them have at least held on to one principle: they make sure they do not tax basic food items, which account for a very high percentage of the income of poorer people, at the same rate as they tax other goods. Our tax regime presently has that amount of sensitivity in it whereby the people wealthy enough to buy expensive products are taxed more highly. (1ime expired)",92
266,Mr MCARTHUR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The Parliamentary Secretary to t-e Minister for Health, Housing and Commuruty Services (Mr Johns) is starting to believe his own rhetoric in relation to the Fightback package. I well recall his own leader adare vocating a similar option in 1985. I draw to his attention the key element that he is arguing here-that the goods and services tax be applied selectively. He is drawing it attention that some countries do this. I make the point that one of the key elements of the Fightback package is that we do not exempt any items. One of the difficulties that those other countries have is making the distinction between those items. That has been one of the failures in those countries that the honourable member has mentioned in terms of the application of the GST at various rates. The increase in paperwork and definition of the particular items makes the system almost unworkable. His whole case falls down as a result of the evidence in the other countries. I reiterate that the former Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), stamped the country and advocated a similar proposition to that which the Opposition is now advocating with clarity and with an understanding of what advantages it will give to Australia. I think the Parliamentary Secretary's observations are without foundation. The wholesale sales tax is a ramshackle tax, as everyone knows, and almost impossible to administer. In fact, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have now introduced yet another set of wholesale sales tax arrangements that nobody can understand, and nobody will understand them until October 1994 when we get rid of the whole lot. The One Nation statement is an ageing document. It does not come to the challenges of the 1990s, with the nation facing a debt of $150 billion. I notice that other speakers have drawn to the attention of the House today the fact that our national debt continues to escalate. Unemployment is at record levels. This draws my attention to the great Jack Lang, who was the mentor of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). During his time in the Parliament, the numbers of unemployed were as great as they are now under his protege, the present Prime Minister. The One Nation statement is trying to regain political momentum. The original estimate of the blow-out was $4.7 billion. We know today that it is nearly $9.3 billion. That is the estimated figure; all of us on this side of the House will be interested to see what to our the final blow-out figure of the Budget prepared last August will be. The One Nation statement portrays a remarkable growth rate of 4.75 per centnearly 5 per cent-in the next 12 months. That is remarkable when one thinks that this dramatic increase in growth is going to start on 1 July. In the next 12 months that will be the order of things in Australia; the economy will have this sort of upturn and there will be a turnaround in economic activity, confidence and the ability of Australians to make money and show profits. The latest ABS figures indicate that the gross domestic product is increasing only by around 1.5 per cent per year. The other failure of the One Nation statement is that it does not address the problem of the industrial relations of this country. I will talk more about this. It has added just another 1,000 pages, as I mentioned to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), to the wholesale sales tax package. Members of the accounting profession, having spent three days reading it, cannot understand this. That is just one example that has been drawn to my attention. That is the state of play: the Government, while trying to simplify a tax regime, is making it more complicated. I would like to draw to the attention of the House some features of the One Nation statement, a statement which the Prime Minister spent the first couple of months of his prime ministership preparing. He made no policy pronouncements and it was regarded as a benchmark of the Keating Government. It spent $2.3 billion of extra money on capital projects, and the rate of return of these projects would have to be questioned in the shorter term. One of the interesting factors to emerge from the polls is that the One Nation statement represents no flag and no Queen, no monarchy. That is the message that the Prime Minister has been able to convey to the Australian people. So much for the One Nation mini-Budget statement. That is all it is, a mini-Budget statement of the Government's intention to spend more money. Let me compare that very briefly with the Fightback package. All honourable members in this House would be aware of the very positive nature of that. In the Fightback package, there is the abolition of seven taxes; a 30 per cent flat rate of income tax, which I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will be very happy about, on incomes between $20,000 and $50,000; an 8 per cent rise in pensions; and a $20 billion cut in business costs around the nation. The Opposition concedes the point that a 15 per cent goods and services tax will be applied to those services, but in the final analysis we know that the cost will go up by only about 4.4 per cent; in fact, the Government's own estimates suggest 3.6 per cent. All those wholesale sales taxes of 10, 20 and 30 per cent will be removed. Let me continue to emphasise that position of the Fightback package compared with the One Nation statement. It is a clear plan: it cuts taxes, it is pro-business, it is pro-jobs, is pro-saving and it is pro-investment. It is a 700-page carefully detailed document of what the Hewson Government will do when it reaches the Government benches in the very near future. I return to the industrial relations issue which members of this House have been debating in recent days and, in particular, the APPM issue. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), yesterday in this House gave a stirring speech, which demonstrated his understanding of the issue and the way in which the Opposition would handle the industrial relations matters involved in that particular dispute. The Federal Government, the State Government and the ACTU President, Mr Martin Ferguson, have tried to get involved in the act. It is the last-ditch stand for those particular people to try to save the union movement from slow and gradual decline in Australia. The fact of the matter is that the management is prepared to negotiate with the union movement about pay, long service leave, conditions, overtime, all those sorts of things, but it is not prepared to negotiate with the unions about the outdated work practices in that particular plant. That is the position of management, and it is completely untrue to suggest that the company has not been prepared to negotiate on those issues. That is what the public relations people and the President of the ACTU would have us believe. The other key point that I want to reemphasise is my total agreement with the shadow Minister that the matter of industrial relations, in this particular instance and other major disputes, is a matter between management and the workers on the shop floor. No amount of interference by the members of this Parliament, by the Prime Minister, by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), or by any other senior official will help this particular dispute. It is time that we in Australia realised that disputes are between the workers and management and need to be sorted out at that level. The former President of the ACTU, Mr it Hawke, used to ride up on his white charger and solve a dispute at the last minute-or think he did. Those sorts of attitudes are no longer relevant to the way we run our industrial relations in Australia. I totally endorse the shadow Minister's stand and suggest that all future disputes be handled by the participants and not be interfered with by members of the Government, the Opposition and the President of the ACTU. The shadow Minister was very clear on his particular role in this whole matter. The responsibility for industrial relations is at the shop floor level and that is where negotiations should be conducted. I just mention the independent contractor suggestion put forward by the Government. I have had more representations on this issue than any other issue this year. A number of independent contractors, in my electorate and elsewhere around Australia, are concerned that this Government, under the proposals put forward by the One Nation statement and other legislation, is going to force independent contractors to come under award and union control. This would mean that 84 per cent of those persons working on both small and large building sites around Australia would be forced under union control. The last-ditch stand of this Government is to force people into trade union membership. Think of all those truckies moving down the Hume Highway. As independent contractors they, too, would be forced to come under the control of the union movement. The outcome of this particular approach-and I notice that the Government is having second thoughts about it-is that a new home of $110,000, which is the average price, would be increased by at least $15,000 if the home building industry were forced to use unionised labour at all times. The One Nation statement, a memorable statement about industrial relations, reads: The focus of (labour market) reform has now switched from the industry and award level individual workplace to generate the productivity gains necessary for Australia to reap the gains necessary for Australia to reap the full benefits from general market liberalisation, structural adjustment and other microeconomic reforms. What wonderful high-sounding words about the change in approach by this Labor Government! Of course, it has not changed at all. it has corrupted the idea of enterprise bargaining and, as I observed recently, it is a hybrid type of industrial relations arrangement. It is neither fully centralist nor largely decentralised. It is neither one nor the other. The only way to go is to totally disband the centralised wage fixing system, which has taken place in New Zealand with startling results, such as in the case as the Comalco firm that I referred to on another occasion in this House. The improvements in productivity, quality control, output and labour relationships have been dramatic and startling. In the case of that company, the arrangements were conducted at the work floor level, where management and the work force got together to improve output. The gradualist approach favoured by the Government, because it is not really game to face up to the issues of industrial relations and 'dramatic changes, means that we are not addressing the competitive position of Australia in the world. According to the Economic Planning Advisory Council, foreign ownership of Australian enterprises has moved from 33 per cent to 50 per cent. Foreigners are now moving into take over our enterprises because they know they will make the changes at some later date under the new Hewson government. We have to be aware that we now live in a global economy. We have to have the advances in transport and communications that mean that we are competing with other nations. We have to have those activities on world best practice so that we are competing efficiently with everyone else. I refer to the superannuation proposals that have been put forward in the One Nation statement. Again, the Government is having second thoughts about this. The Prime Minister has advocated these compulsory to the superannuation arrangements here in this Parliament day after day without thinking through their implications for employers and for the number of jobs that might be done away with because of the high impact of compulsory superannuation. Why should the employers be totally responsible for superannuation payments? In fact, Why should the employees not make a contribution to their long term superannuation? Why is this Government forcing, by way of legislation, superannuation payments on all employers around Australia? The CAl suggests that 60,000 jobs will be lost because of compulsory superannuation. So, by the Government's very act here in this Parliament, by forcing superannuation on large and small employers, between 60,000 and 100,000 jobs could be lost over the next couple of years-at a time when we have one million Australians unemployed. So much for the One Nation statement, which is the basis of the Keating policy position for 1992. It is wrongly based, it is a big spending document and it provides no plan for the future for the Keating Government. The Fightback package will be the way to go.",92
267,Mrs JAKOBSEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"In making this contribution to the debate, I would like to recap with a brief overview of the plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for Australia's recovery. It offered a careful mixture of short and long term measures. It provided a crucial kickstart to the economy a time when it really needed it. It is beginning to get people back to work. Moreover, it has promoted growth and contains measures specifically designed to add to infrastructure by improving our rail and road networks, upgrading our air and seaports, and making our economy more efficient and productive. I note the comments of the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) earlier regard to her electorate and how some of these measures are already taking place Forde. In my own electorate I have seen an advance in employment, although at this stage no great improvement in infrastructure, because it was not actually touched on by the One Nation statement. Honourable members will no doubt recall that the Prime Minister's statement included a one-off payment to most families with children which, I might remind the HQuse, the Opposition says these people did not need and should have sent back. Well, perhaps not members of the Opposition said so, Madam Deputy Speaker, but many members of the his statement. Opposition did. They said that these families did not need this money and that they should have sent their cheques back, or that they were just going to use their cheques· and their families out to dinner. This idea the Opposition has of what families do with their money is very wrong. Most families spent the money very wisely on their children, and I know were grateful for it. This one-off payment was accompanied an increase in family payments across the board. Of course, since the One Nation statement we have also created a family payment, as opposed to a number of family payments. That money will make it easier for families to budget and will go directly to the carers of chilQren, that mostly women. The statement also included measures to create jobs now and into the future. As I have indicated, many jobs are already being created, although not as many as we would like at this stage. The statement also convocational tained personal income tax cuts-without recourse to a consumption tax. And people at will benefit from those income tax cuts. The people at the lower end of the income scale who are not included in the income tax cuts will benefit from changes in the family our national allowance structure. The statement included incentives to work and increase productivity. This is most important, and an area in which the Government has taken a great interest since its initial and subsequent elections. We do believe in microin economic reform. We do not believe in disrupting the work force through strikes and in confrontation. We believe in negotiation, discussion and consultation with·workers and employers to achieve the types of microeconomic reform that this country needs. The statement also included support for Australian products and ideas. That proposal cannot be overstated. It is an area where many people in Australia get frustrated. They see companies leaving Australia, not because of the labour costs, but because they feel they are not getting recognition for their ideas and all products. That was an area that the Prime Minister touched on as an important area in The statement also included specific help for business to invest and to export. I note the recent comments by the Treasurer (Mr Dawtake kins) which show categorically that Australia's exporting of manufacturing industry products has improved considerably I know over a continuing period. I believe that the statement offers affordable solutions to our country's problems. The by improvements which are becoming evident in the economy could not have been achieved without a positive and productive expression of Government commitment of the kind different provided in the statement. Of course, the Prime Minister did not .confine himself to making the statement. He is, is very determined that the recovery upon which Australia has now embarked will not stall for want of effort on the Government's part. On Sunday, he reiterated in no uncertain terms-and very publicly-the Federal Government's determination to take the education agenda right up to the States and to ensure that TAPE is not left as a second class cousin in the tertiary education system. This proposal offers improved access to those young people who do not want to go to university but who would rather pursue education with a more vocational orientation. It is important that people understand that this position exists and that a number of youngsters have opted for university education because they think that that is what their parents, teachers or others in society think they should do. When I was involved in the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training one of the reports that we presented was called The Restless Years. In that· inquiry we found that there were a large number of young people who would have preferred, had the options been available to them, to have pursued a vocational education from very early in high school. What we can do as a Federal government is to ensure that places are available in TAPE for them. The importance of the Federal Government's undertaking in this regard, both in One Nation and since, is that more funding will be available for the expansion of the TAFE sector; and better, more uniform credentials will result from the studies that people do in the TAPE sector. Just yesterday the Prime Minister gained the support of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party Caucus for a merger of Qantas and Australian Airlines-no mean feat. This proposal will lead to significant microeconomic reform in that industry and has the support, I believe, of the majority of Australians. Indeed, it was an area of reform that many Australians were advocating at an earlier stage when these proposals were first being discussed. Although the sale of 100 per cent of shares in the merged airline with the retention of a golden share to protect areas of national interest and prestige still requires ratification by the Australian Labor Party-it is not my preferred position, although I accept it may well be the preferred position of others on my side of the House-there is no doubt that this proposal has generated a great deal of interest and provided a signal of positiveness to the business world and the community at large as to the Government's intentions. I will leave it to the Party to decide whether we will have 49 per cent or 100 per cent ownership. Nevertheless, it is a bold proposal which is overdue. The merger is significant and the proposal to float the shares will also be significant and, I believe, welcomed in the community. Today the Prime Minister announced arrangements for the introduction of pay TV into the Australian marketplace without the involvement of any existing broadcasters. Mr Lee-Hear, hearl",95
268,Mrs JAKOBSEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"No doubt the honourable member for Dobell will want to speak on this matter, given his involvement in achieving that end. The importance of the Australian-content component of this decision to the Australian film industry cannot be overstated, as the production of home-grown drama will benefit from the requirement that 10 per cent of budget be dedicated to this type of product. Not only will the production of home-grown drama gain from this particular proposal, but also I think the hearts and minds of Australians will benefit. In contrast to the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister, the Liberal-National Party Fightback proposals impose a 15 per cent consumption tax on everything. I cannot marry this consumption tax with any claims by the Opposition that its proposals will create jobs, nor can I see that its proposals could possibly have an anti-inflationary effect, only an inflationary effect, when out Government and indeed the people of Australia have undergone so much to ensure that we have a low inflation outcome and we can now reap the benefit of that outcome. The Fightback proposals also cut sole parents off benefits when the youngest child is 12 years of age. How can it possibly marry this with its feigned concern for the welfare of children? Perhaps 'marry' is the key word in that sentence. I recall this particular proposal being raised by the Opposition in a previous election manifesto and causing great concern amongst sole parents in my electorate. No doubt that concern will still be evident this time around and people will understand that it is a very bad proposal. People. with 12-year-old children, be they male or female, do not wish to be in the work force if they are not already in the work force, and they certainly do not want to be forced to go to work because they are not eligible for benefit. I think sole parents, be they men or women, do a very good job of raising families in the community; it is a very difficult job. They would certainly be eligible for any benefit that they may apply for. Twelve years of age is very young for a child to be left alone. Fightback also proposes to cut the selfemployment assistance programs, which I again think is a retrograde step, given the importance of these programs to people's selfesteem when on unemployment benefits and given the fact that in my electorate people have commented to me that they have been able to support themselves after being on one of these programs, because they have had the time and the assistance of government people to develop a proposal for employment. Obviously, there is a need to continue this sort of assistance for people who have an idea or a craft that they can develop with a little a little expertise in financial matters and some assistance in drawing up a plan for their business and in developing a niche market. Obviously, identifying and developing that niche market is avery important aspect ,of any self-employment proposal. These assistance programs are very valuable. I cannot understand how the Opposition could be proposing to be supportive of business and also be proposing to cut these sorts of assistance programs. . The Opposition also wants to cut unemployed people off benefits after nine months. Again, I cannot see how anybody could make that proposal and still say that he was concerned about the welfare of unemployed people. There are many people who are genuinely seeking work and to whom these proposals would be an affront. We have family support improvement. As a government, that is something that we have made a priority. We have helped the housing industry and are pleased to see it improving. The Government has an excellent record in a number of areas, including education, health, industrial relations and the environment. I noted that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) was talking about the dispute in Tasmania. I simply say that it is a sign of things to come, if ever the Liberal Government gains power in this country-which, God forbid, it will never do. Interference in the back room of the APPM dispute has been a feature which has only just come to the fore, but it is one where a particular hypocritical bent is being shown by the Opposition. It has criticised the Government for its attempts to openly resolve the dispute and has been saying that there is no role for government in the dispute. I would have thought that to involve itself in the dispute in a back room capacity was an extremely bad move by the Opposition and one which is not designed to resolve the dispute at all. In terms of the New Zealand experience with the GST, I can say from personal experience that New Zealanders do not like the consumption tax. I have a number of New Zealanders in my electorate-it is not just that I happen to have been one myself many years help, ago-who have come to Australia to avoid the consumption tax. They do not like the dismantling of the labour market, either. Mr Lee-Are they shearers?",97
269,Mrs JAKOBSEN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"No, they are not shearers. I have one shearer in my electorate, but he is an Australian. The New Zealanders do not like the labour market proposals. They do not like the confrontation which has resulted from the change in government there. They do not like the consumption tax; they hate the concept of food and Clothing being taxed. As the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) said earlier, the consumption tax on food and clothing is not across the board in other nations and it is a particularly pernicious tax on poor people and people who are on fixed incomes. I certainly would never support a consumption tax if proposed by our side of the House, and I am appalled that the Opposition is seriously considering putting that burden on the Australian community, with the effect of redistributing the tax burden from the rich to the poor. The community is crying out for positive action and positive policies such as those contained in the One Nation statement. The recovery has commenced, albeit slowly. We on this side of the House are proud of the One Nation statement. and the proposals that the Prime Minister put forward then and since. I believe that the carping, negative and scaremongering campaigns run by the Opposition have no support in the community, and nor should they. (nme expired)",98
270,Mr COBB,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I am delighted to engage in this debate tonight. I would like to correct one thing that was said by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen). She says that there is no consumption tax on food and clothing. I do not know what she thinks payroll tax, sales tax, fuel excise tax and all these types of things are. On clothing there is a consumption tax equivalent of 35 to 40 per cent due to the tariff on clothing alone. This side of the House has pledged to get rid of that. So we are getting rid of a consumption tax of 35 to 40 per cent, which is impacting very much on the poor. The country at this stage is in a hell of a mess. We have an overseas debt which rose again yesterday from $145 billion to $148 billion, which is a 2.4 per cent increase for the quarter. On an annualised basis, that is a 9.6 per ·cent increase, which is a horrific figure to contemplate. There are one million people unemployed, which is 10 per cent of the general population, and 3D-plus per cent of the youth of this country. There are record bankruptcies everywhere. We have members on the Government side getting up and trumpeting the One Nation statement. They may have made the statement, but nothing in the country has changed. Things go on as badly as ever. Measures introduced in the One Nation statement were supposed to create 800,000 jobs over time. That is a very interesting figure. The previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said he personally had created one million or so jobs while he was in office. We worked out that it was costing Australia $70,000 to create each job. Under this One Nation statement, if an extra 800,000 jobs are created, on the projections of the blow-out in the overseas debt it will cost $109,000 to create each of those jobs. It is very easy to create jobs by using somebody else's money; it is a different matter to create them yourself. The upwards of two million jobs which we say in the GST-Fightback package will be created before this decade finishes will not be created by government. Government will not have anything to do with it. In that sense, they will be created by business. Businesses will be creating the jobs because government will be getting off their back and allowing them to create the jobs themselves. That leads me to speak about the GSTFightback package. It is not just about taxation; it is about a whole host of portfolios, the main one of which will be industrial relations, which will give a great impetus to getting this country going again. I always cite the SPC canning factory at Shepparton .in Victoria as an example. It was going broke as a result of bad management decisions and bad industrial practices. The management said to the workers, 'We will all be out of a job in a few months unless we come to our senses'. They sat down and negotiated an enterprise agreement together. John Halfpenny, bless his heart, heard about it and managed to water it down. Even with that watered-down agreement, there has been a 35 per cent lift in productivity and the company has gone from a $12m loss last year to a $6m profit. There is some hope for that company now, as a result of that enterprise agreement. If that was not in place, no dOJIbt that company would have been shut down. That example shows that although people are despairing now, the potential is out there for dramatic lifts in productivity. They will not come from the Government necessarily doing anything at all, but, quite the reverse, from the Government doing nothing but getting out of it and letting the management and workers solve the problems themselves at the workplace without having to trudge off tugging the forelock to the trade unions or the Industrial Relations Commission in Melbourne. That shows what can be done. I have looked at the Government's own figures in this great volume-it must have 1,000 or 1,500 pages-which contains the briefing papers that came from Treasury as a result of the quarter of a million dollar computer model that was set up by a previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Werriwli (Mr Kerin), that was going to destroy the Fightback package. The document says quite clearly how much each industry is going to benefit by as a result of taking into account only a portion of the GST-Fightback package. This table only takes into account abolishing the payroll tax, abolishing the fuel excise and abolishing the wholesale sales tax. We know there are many other benefits to come.. The document says that agriculture alone will benefit by $1,025m. If we divide that into the number of farms in Australia, it works out at $160 per farm per week for the rest of their lives-an amazing figure. These are Treasury's own figures. The document says that the mining industry will benefit by $677m; manufacturing will benefit by $5,370m; and services industries will benefit by $7,722m. Think of the jobs that that will create and the businesses that that will make more profitable and will get going in Australia. I am delighted to see, by the Government's own figures, that it supports the GST-Fightback package, too, even though the Ministers themselves are not honest enough to admit it when they are talking to the media or here in the Parliament in Question Time. We have a shemozzle of a system in the country today as far as taxation is concerned. We have only· to look at the system as a whole. If we had to pick three things that are wrong with the taxation system in Australia today, we would say that the taxes we pay are far too high, the taxation system is far too complicated and the tax mix is wrong: we pay far too many direct taxes-taxes on earnings; as opposed to indirect taxes-taxes on consumption. We intend to lower the level of tax that we pay, to simplify the whole system and to change the tax mix. Essentially, that is what the GST package is all about. It does all those things. The easiest way to envisage that is to look at the wholesale sales tax system that we have in this country today. We have five different levels of sales tax: a zero level, a 10 per level, a 15 per cent level, a 20 per cent and a 30 per cent level. There is no rhyme or reason why any commodity falls within any particular level. If we went out into the street and asked people to explain the rationale of it, they would probably say something along the lines of, 'Luxury goods are in the 30 per cent level and the basic staples of life are in the zero per cent level'. If that was the case, we could see some logic to it. But that is not the case. For example, on simple things such as the wristwatch on my arm we pay a 30 per cent tax, and the clock radio we turn on in bed in the morning to listen to the market reports before we get up attracts a 30 per cent level. On the other side of the scale, things such as pornographic magazines and caviar are exempt from sales tax. Anyone who can tell me the logic of that-the logic of having one tax on ornaments and another tax on souvenirs, or one tax on towels that are made out of cloth and another tax on towels that are made out of paper, or one tax on strawberryflavoured Quik and another tax on chocolateflavoured Quik-is a better person than I am. We intend to abolish sales tax altogether and replace it with a tax at one level right across the board so that it is honest, visible and simple. It is something that close to 50 countries have done around the world. I think 22 out of the 24 OECD countries have done it. There has been no greater advocate of this tax in this country than the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He was quite right back in 1985 when he spoke glowingly on numerous occasions in favour of a tax of this type to replace the taxes we have now. I am sure he still believes that, even though he speaks differently of it today for political reasons. We are putting a GST of 15 per cent in place and we are abolishing seven taxes. We are lowering three taxes and we are delivering a host of other benefits, such as increasing pensions by 8 per cent and doubling the family allowance. It is the best system we could put in place, taken from the best features of all the countries in the world. cent When we have this in place, we will have the level, best GST system in the whole world. Some countries have done it wrongly, such as England and Canada, but they have still benefited from the tax. New Zealand was the second last country to bring it in. It brought it in in a very proper manner, but we have even improved on that, I am pleased to say. One of the taxes we are abolishing-which I as a country member am particularly pleased to talk about-is the fuel excise tax. There was a 6c a litre tax on fuel when the present Prime Minister became Treasurer in 1983. He talked about petrol bowsers being tax collection officers. I notice that when he left the treasury bench that tax had quadrupled from 6c a litre to 26c a litre. We intend to abolish that and replace it with a GST. For example, in a country town where petrol is selling for 76c a litre, if we abolish the 26c a litre excise, the price of petrol will fall from 76c a litre to 50c a litre. The 15 per cent GST, in round figures, would be about 7c a litre. The petrol would then rise to 57c a litre. In other words, if we are using the petrol for our own private use to drive away for a holiday or to travel around town to see our friends, we are going to have a cut in fuel excise of 19c a litre. In a 60-litre tank, for the average car, that is an $11.40 benefit. For people in business, the GST costs will be totally refunded-as all GST costs are-so they will benefit by a full 26c a litre. The other day I was talking to a small businessman in Nyngan. His name is John Richter, and he runs a stock transport company with only two trucks. On the abolition of the fuel excise alone, he will benefit by $65,000 a year. If we take a 30-tonne truck carrying stock from Cobar to Dubbo, the benefit one way on that journey will be $120. If we take into account all the taxes that we are abolishing, for a longer distance from, say, Wanaaring in my electorate to DubbiJ, on a one way trip with a 30-tonne stock truck the benefit will be $241. The abolition of the payroll tax is particularly beneficial to country people. I had Roger Fletcher, from the Dubbo abattoir, in my office the other day. He said, 'What are you going to do for us?'. I asked, 'How many people do you employ?'. He said, 'I employ 520.' I said, 'That's interesting. How much payroll tax would you pay?'. He said, 'I pay $1.3m'. I said, 'We are abolishing it'. He sat there stunned. One industry in one country town is going to benefit by $1.3m just from the abolition of one tax. The Forbes abattoir is in an interesting financial position at the moment and would have difficulty in keeping its doors open if it did not have overseas ownership. It employs 300 people. The wages that go into the Forbes district at this stage are equivalent to $8m. If that place had to close, the loss of those wages being spent in the town of Forbes and surrounding places would put businesses in that area in a dire position. But by the abolition of the payroll tax alone the Forbes abattoir will be better off by $563,000. That is an enormous advantage in securing jobs and keeping the abattoir open. I understand that it kills about 47,000 beasts a year, most of which go to export. As businesses and people in the street hear more and more of the factual, genuine detail of this package, they are embracing it more and more. They are very excited about it. They are agreeing with what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said when he was Treasurer back in 1985: that we should have a tax of this type. It will make business more profitable, it will create two million real jobs by the end of the decade, and it will be particularly advantageous to disadvantaged people. A pensioner couple will get an extra $40-plus in their fortnightly cheque, and people with disabilities will receive, over and above what is in their cheques, a non-taxable $45. I am delighted to see that these people will be not merely compensated for the small inflationary effect of this tax, but compensated many times over through various measures. Next to the freight industry it would be hard to pick a group that is more advantaged by this particular package than the pensioners and disadvantaged people in the community. This simple, visible and honest tax is going to benefit Australia and everybody who lives here. (TIme expired)",99
271,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"At the next election the people of Australia will have a very clear and simple choice. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), has outlined how he thinks the Opposition will overcome Australia's difficulties. Simply put, the Opposition will impose a 15 per cent tax on everything that people buy and everything that people spend their money on. That is its solution to the problems of overseas debt, unemployment, inflation and industrial relations. By comparison, the Government has set out a strategy, starting back in February this to accelerate the economic recovery and to : ensure that there is a proper balance between short tenn and long tenn measures which will be in the interests of all Australians. April, in my own electorate on the central coast of New South Wales, the family payment was made to the 27,000 families which receive family allowance. That injected $5m into our local economy. That $5m will ensure that our local economy-local business houses, people who work in the supermarkets-gets a kick-start. Even on the Gold Coast we had, I think, over $300m injected into the national economy through the payment to families. It was an excellent short tenn measure that I believe was necessary. I believe it has already started to flow through in the improved economic statistics that are beginning to appear. That was a very important short tenn measure by this Labor"" Government to try to get unemployment down a1! quickly as possible. Not only have we implemented short tenn measures, but we are also addressing some of the long tenn problems that have not been addressed by governments, Labor and Liberal, in the past. It is the Keating Labor Government which has announced the major programs to construct new road works and a freight rail highway, and to carry out additional expenditure at our airports and seaports to ensure that we increase the economic competitiveness of industries in Australia. That will create jobs for more and more Australians in the long tenn. People in the gallery who come from Sydney might be aware that as part of this road expenditure the Government is accelerating work on ring road 33 from Hornsby to Parramatta. The widening of that road will improve the economic efficiency of road freight and cut back delays for motorists who use the road. That is a road improvement which is very important to the economic infrastructure of that part of the Sydney region. I think work on the Glebe Island Bridge has already commenced. A major bridge which is important to the road network in Sydney will be constructed, not because of year, the Greiner Government but because the Federal Labor Government has put in the extra money now so that jobs can be created and that economic infrastructure provided for In early years to come. The Government has announced the most radical refonns in the area of rail. This is the first government since the Whitlam Government to make a major commitment to improving the economic competitiveness of our national rail network. The Government has committed extra funds to ensure that we have a standard gauge freight highway on our rail system which will stretch all the way from Brisbane to Adelaide and Perth. It will assist in ensuring that we can get freight off our roads and back onto rail, which is where more of it should be travelling. I am sure, Madam Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of the great importance of the rail projects which are part of the One Nation statement, because I understand there is one rail project that goes through the Gold Coast. I am sure many of your constituents would welcome this Labor Government's initiatives in ensuring that people in the Brisbane and Gold Coast area receive the benefit of this new rail system. On the matter of our airports, the Government has announced that funding will be provided to ensure that there are common user tenninals, so that we do not go through the difficulties that Compass went through in the last year or so. Yesterday the Government went one step further and announced the most radical revolution ever seen in Australia's aviation industry with the decision that Qantas and Australian Airlines are to be merged. That proposal will, for the first time, allow Qantas to compete on an even footing with all the other international airlines that have a domestic base feeding into their own international systems. I am sure that all members of this House would be aware that United Airlines encourages Australians to fly with its airline by offering us special discount air fares in the United States. In the same way, British Airways advertises that, if we fly with it to London, it can provide us with cheap air fares around continental Europe. Because Qantas has not had a domestic base in Australia, it has not been able to compete on a fair basis with the other international carriers. It has taken this Labor Government to merge the two airlines and to ensure that Qantas does not have to fight with one arm tied behind its back. As part of this package the Government has agreed that up to 35 per cent of the airline can be sold to foreign shareholders. I have no difficulty if some of those shares are sold to one of the foreign mega-carriers, whether it be Singapore Airlines, British Airways, Lufthansa, or one of the other quality international airlines. I happen to think that it the long term interests of Qantas to have an alliance with one of the mega-carriers that are increasingly dominating world aviation. In that sense, Qantas can have someone who can speak on its behalf and advocate in Australia's interests an expansion of Qantas's access to routes in other parts of the world. I think it will work to Qantas's advantage if a major foreign shareholder is a mega-carrier. As we all know, market forces take their place not only in other parts of the world but also in Australia. If one of the mega-carriers does not bid a high enough price, perhaps 100 per cent of Qantas will remain in Australian hands but it will be in the hands of people who might bid at a public share float in years to come. Two people have expressed some concerns to me about the· proposal to sell 100 per cent of Qantas and to merge Australian and Qantas. The first criticism is that this will reduce competition in the Australian aviation industry and it will be unfair to Southern Cross Airlines which is about to relaunch Compass in a month or two. Those people seem to ignore the fact that Qantas has had an alliance with Ansett Airlines for a considerable period. All that will happen is that the strategic alliance which Qantas now has with Ansett will be transferred to a strategic alliance between Qantas and Australian Airlines. Qantas has announced that it will continue to run Australian as a separate domestic airline for the time being. The second criticism that has been made is that if we sell off Qantas how can we protect Australia's interests? The Government proposes to maintain a golden share in Qantas which will allow the Government to protect designated Australian interests such as the name, the home base of the airline and its major route structure. That should ensure that if there is any attempt to threaten these designated Australian interests the Australian Government can take action to ensure that that does not take place. I know this is a proposal that will be welcomed by the overwhelming majority of honourable members, but it is a proposal that has been implemented only because this is in Labor Government has been prepared to grasp the nettle, as announced on the Sunday program, and implement changes that I think will work in the interests of not only Australia's air travelling public but also both airlines. Today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had another victory in the announcement of the arrangements which are to apply for pay television. In a move which I know the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who is in the House, would support, the Government has decided that no networks, nor the national broadcaster, will be allowed to participate in the consortium that will control transponders 1 to 4. The honourable member for Bass, who has a long history of supporting greater diversity in the media, on occasions, would certainly argue that the networks should not be involved in transponders 1 to 4. I think that we will find quite a rapid expansion in pay television when it is launched perhaps late next year. I understand that the satellite signal will be able to be picked up by about 95 per cent of Australians. While it may cost about the same as a video recorder for the decoding equipment and a satellite dish, I think we will find, as we did with videos, that Australians will purchase this technology very rapidly because they seem to be addicted to television, like myself and perhaps others in the House. It will not take long before pay television will be playing a very important role in providing more news, information, sport and entertainment to Australians. It has been this Government that has been prepared to take the hard decisions, to say to the networks, 'No, you are not allowed to be involved in transponders 1 to 4'. In that sense we are ensuring that there is greater diversity in Australia's media. Mr Smith-It was a pretty quick decision though, wasn't it?",101
272,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Yes, it was a very quick decision. It just shows what a remarkable Prime Minister this country has in that he has been able to put forward proposals on both aviation and pay television whilst fending off the puny attacks from the Opposition on matters such as those raised in Question Time today. I want to make a few comments about the Opposition's alternative vision which can be simply reduced to a proposal to put a 15 per cent tax on everything we eat, wear and drink. It is important that people realise that this is a tax which will apply not only to goods but also to services. That does not only mean that if people go to a hairdresser or a barber they will pay 15 per cent on top of the price they currently pay; it means that when",104
273,Mr CADMAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,That's not true; that's not the way it works.,104
274,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"When the honourable member for. Mitchell pays his electricity bill he will be paying an extra 15 per cent tax on the cost of his electricity. The proposal means that when the honourable member for Mitchell gets a bill from the Sydney Water Board for his water rates he will be paying an extra 15 per cent tax on the service provided by the Sydney Water Board. When the honourable member gets a bill from his local council, because it provides a garbage service, a cleaning service or some other service, there will be a 15 per cent tax on that service provided by the local council. People should not forget that this is a tax on services as well as goods. I was interested to receive a note in the last week or so from the Insurance Council of Australia. The Council has been given what is called exempt status, which I would have thought it would have welcomed. However, it is the reverse. The Council has demanded that a GST be applied to it. Because there will be so much complicated paperwork involved in its being an exempted industry it is demanding the Opposition to put a tax on it. If that does not demonstrate how ridiculous and how complex the Opposition's system is, I do not know what will. My prediction is that if the Opposition introduces a GST, in the unfortunate event that it is elected to government, we will see a return to the barter economy, where people will be seeking to exchange goods rather than deal in cash because they know they will be expected to charge a GST on that good or service which is exchanged. In Canada and other places school tutors offer to tutor students if the father or mother of the student fixes the plumbing or provides some other service to the tutor. We also have to realise that there will be an extra incentive for people to avoid tax-to enter the black economy and deal in cash and not tell the Tax Commissioner. It is a recipe for massive tax avoidance. It is a tax that will require an extra 1,000 public servants just to administer all the paperwork. It is a tax that will not address the major problems of this country-the major problems which this Government has sought to address in the One Nation statement.",104
275,Mr CADMAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Mitchell) (6.58 p.m.)What a fascinating speech by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee). After all that members of the Australian Labor Party have done to the Australian economy and the Australian people, they have the hide to stand up and take credit for a million people unemployed in their electorates and in mine. In my electorate there has been a monthly increase of 10 per cent unemployment in middle management, and the rate is increasing. Men and women aged between 30 and 45 with teenage children and mortgages, people who have held responsible jobs and have probably spent a IOJ)g time in a particular place of work gaining credit and skill, are losing their jobs. Similar things are happening in the electorates represented by members of the Labor Party. Tonight we are debating the impact on Australia of the statement made on 26 February by the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), entitled One Nation. The Prime Minister commenced his speech on that night by saying: When I became Prime Minister a little over two months ago I pledged to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy I could muster. Four to five months later we can assess how beneficial the One Nation statement and those decisions of this Government have been. In that time we have seen that, despite the promises in that statement, our domestic deficit has increased from $4.7 billion to $9.3 billion, in those few months a doubling in the loss that the nation has made. The Prime Minister said on that evening that under Labor's plan he would endeavour-I think he promised-to create 800,000 jobs. There is a commitment to get things moving, to fight unemployment and to create 800,000 new jobs. Unemployment continues to rise, and still there is no relief for the Australian people. Having created massive unemployment, the Government continues to produce gimmick after plan, after deception, after deceit, to hoodwink the Australian people into thinking the Government is in control and managing and governing for the benefit of the people of Australia. That is not the case. A million Australians are testimony to why the Government has failed. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can understand why a man of your sagacity, with your distinguished career in the Parliament, would see that this is a place that you would rather be away from. Despite 10 years of claimed hard work by the Australian Labor Party, it has just put Australia in a worse position than when it first started to govern. What have those boom years, those heady years of the mates, with Bob Hawke off on fishing boats and travelling the world as a statesman, amounted to? Complete and absolute failure. All members of the Australian Labor Party ought to be feeling that failure very sorely tonight. They ought to be feeling it in their electorates. They ought to be seeing it in the businesses that are closing, in the houses that are having to be sold, the homes and cottages that people can no longer maintain, and the kids and middle-aged people who are out of jobs with no prospect of gaining employment. That has been the result of 10 years work. The One Nation statement purports to resolve those problems. On becoming Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland said: I have heard the message. I know I, as Treasurer, created a problem, and now I am going to rectif);' it. It took him eight years to create that problem, becoming first the world's best Treasurer and then the world's worse Treasurer. When he became Prime Minister he finally admitted that he had made a hash of it, but having become the general manager, he was going to put things right. I remember the discussions in this Parliament between the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Treasurer, the now Prime Minister, when Mr Hawke sought valiantly to defend the policies of his Treasurer. He said, in metaphoric teims, 'My arm is around Paul. He is my friend, and I know he would not lead Australia astray'. In fact, in the Parliament we saw the downfall of the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, brought about by the poor economic policies of the current Prime Minister. In the statement made in February by the Prime Minister, entitled One Nation, there are pro-ises for a stronger Australia; getting things moving; and an immediate pay-out of $300m to Australian families-well warranted. But for those families it is like going to the bank manager whilst heavily in debt and being promised a loan from the bank's finance company to see them out of trouble. It is just what Australian families do not need in the long term because it puts them further into· debt. As I see it, the promises made in the One Nation statement are not factored into a calculation of where Australia stands in its economic balances of trade. They are not factored into how Australia will balance its books or how we will pay for the massive borrowings that we have made, or how we will rectify the $148 billion trade deficit, or the deficit of $9.3 billion for the current year. Nobody has considered that. It seems that the Australian Labor Party, while castigating the banks, is being a Shylock in its own right. It is just forcing Australian people further debt, claiming purity at the same time. The deception and the deceit practised by the Prime Minister have created a situation where the Australian community no longer believes that deception and that deceit. In the One Nation statement, the Prime Minister announced that he would return Australia to a surplus Budget by 1995-96, in a short three to four years. The first figures that effort show that we are going further backwards. The Prime Minister has only two choices to solve that domestic deficit: to raise taxes or to cut government expenditure. He has no other options. He cannot manufacture the money; our credit ratings are not good enough. Today we had the decision to sell Qantasa decision that I applaud-but, unfortunately, the proceeds of that sale, instead of paying off our debts, will just go to produce a little bubble of excitement and pay-outs for the forthcoming election and will basically be frittered away. I cannot imagine why the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) would want to bring the proceeds of that sale of Qantas-the Government claims it is $1 billion-into the Budget for other than political reasons and for reasons that are of no long term benefit to the Australian people. The Government is not using the proceeds of an asset to rectify the long standing debt problem. It is not paying off the debt. Instead, the Government is just using that money to fiddle the books and to get itself through the next election. For the sale of a great asset, it will get $1 billion. Around Australia today, asset after asset is being sold. We are selling the silver; we are seIling the farm. For what purpose? So that the Australian Labor Party can stay in front, so that it can appear to have the books balanced. When the facts are realised, one sees that we are sinking further and further into debt. With private investment low, the Prime Minister in the One Nation statement in February said: ... we will take the opportunity to build railways, roads, ports, electricity grids, air terminals, waste management plants, colleges, schoolsanything! It seems like the Government is involved in a giant auction with borrowed into money from a bankrupt nation. What is the Prime Minister on about? We have seen those efforts. We have seen his endeavours in the past. They were the things that produced the circumstances that we are in now, and we are going to have more of the same. As I read on in the One Nation statement, I find that there is to be building of railways and competitive ports, as I have outlined, and a better and of safer road network-all on borrowed money; all something that the nation cannot afford; all not funded. The cost of providing the jobs that will be created by these projects is massive. There is only one long term way in which we can create jobs in this nation: to allow those people in the private sector, the nongovernment sector, to be able to be profitable and to have satisfactory returns so that they want to expand and employ more people. The Australian taxpayer cannot go on funding forever. On one side of the equation we have the profligate attitudes, the profligate ideas, the profligate policies, of this Prime Minister. He will revolutionise the aviation industry-I have adverted to part of that in regard to the sale of Qantas. The other side of the equation is also interesting. Let us look at the way in which Compass was put down by the Australian Government, because it was unwilling to operate an effective, competitive aviation industry. The Government was content, despite its criticisms, to allow the two-airline policy to continue. One has only to read those Cabinet notes of the discussions between Ted Harris, Peter Abeles, the Prime Minister, the  Morris) and other Ministers, to realise that the plot in the pilots strike was to maintain two airlines, and the plot since then has been to retain two airlines. Where will Ansett be, given an international licence? There will be very few entrants into the field. The Government has rejuvenated Qantas. I hope Compass succeeds. But Compass should not count on too much support from this Government in gaining access to airports, in fair play between the other airlines or even in the proper application of the Trade Practices Act. The Government has some powerful friends and the Government supports those powerful friends, as we saw in the pilots strike. The Government is going to generate more power; it is putting $100m into that. In Adelaide, we are going to get the multifunction polis going. That is part of the One Nation statement. What a ridiculous project that is. If it will not work with private enterprise funding, it will not work at all. Why should the taxpayer sink money into the multifunction polis for the sake of the hide of the South Australian Government? I have visited the site; I have spoken to the operatives; and I have read widely on it. Japanese academics condemn it. They say that patriotic Australians should be most cautious before giving their support to the multifunction polis. It is a nebulous idea created on paper, backed by few with finance but by many who are prepared to say that, if the Australian taxpayer will foot the bill for the multifunction polis, they will endorse it. Of course, once they have tapped into the milch cow of the Australian taxpayer to pour more and more funds into this project, they cannot but succeed. I wonder who the beneficiaries of that project will be. On the other hand, what the Opposition has devised is a complete program, not a tax. It has devised a program called Fightback, which abolishes seven taxes. The total package puts $50 billion per annum, as defined by Treasury, back into the economy, back into the private sector, back into job creation. It removes taxes. It moves ahead in a substantial way in micro-economic reform. It also seeks to modify and change the workplace relationships between Australians. But, in contrast, the Government has produced the One Nation statement. The other aspects of the Fightback proposal are that families and those who are elderly benefit. They are the beneficiaries of the Fightback proposal. Families, those with children, gain the most advantage from the changes. But, overall, all Australians will benefit because no-one is basically worse off. Everybody can see that there needs to be a change. Australians want a change. They do not want the fiddling and expenditure that the current Government is prepared to go on with. They need to see that hope and opportunity exist for them. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and our team have a plan. It is a fair plan, despite what is being said by those opposite. It is a plan that will be fair to the elderly, to those with children, to those seeking jobs, to those seeking to create jobs. It will be a plan which will give peace of mind to the Australian people because it is not radical; it is sensible and well laid out. It is the type of plan that says, 'Paul Keating won't get my dollars before they go into my pocket. I, by some discretionary expenditure, will decide how and when I will pay tax'. (Time expired)",104
276,Mr GEAR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"That was an .exciting end to a fairly pedestrian speech-talking about Fightback and what a great thing it would be. One can just imagine the coalition party room about a week ago with Andrew Robb there with a sales pitch, the slides and the glossy packets. They were all there waiting to here about Fightback and the second phase-or maybe it is the third phase. Fightback has gone over like a lead balloon out in the community. To hear those sorts of platitudes given to it by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), makes one wonder. I happened to be walking past in the corridor when the coalition members were coming out with their glazed eyes and glossy pamphlets under their wings, going out to try to sell this Fightback package. We did not have to wait long to find out what was in it, because that night we saw the loaded gun, the frightened pensioner and the claims that Fightback will stop break-ins in homes. This is convoluted thinking at its worse, for sure. If the Opposition is starting to make those claims about Fightback, one has to start wondering about some of the other claims that are yet to come. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell, claimed that Fightback will be good for the elderly. The one thing that all people who have retired know is that they have been brought up in a regime where they have paid high income tax. The proposition now is to lower the income tax and start taxing expenditure. One does not have to be a Rhodes scholar to know that retired people or those approaching retirement have got to be affected by the worse of both worlds. During their working life they had to pay all of that income tax and, now that they have built up a nest egg, they will have it devalued by 15 per cent by what is essentially the tax on all their goods and services. The honourable member then had the hide to say that Fightback was going to create jobs. It is a pity that he did not listen to Mr Frank O'Collins, who used to work for the Liberal Party and was retrenched. He had a few words to say about the way in which Fightback was put together and some of the outcomes that might have been expected from it. He warned that unemployment would soar by at least 200,000 under a coalition government. Here is somebody who is intimately involved in the Fightback package claiming that another 200,000 people will be put out of work as a result of the Fightback package. The honourable member for Mitchell railed against the unemployment rate. There is nobody on this side of the House who takes those figures lightly. There is nobody on this side of the House or, I am sure, on the other side who would be happy that the figure is as high as it is. But certainly we on this side of the House are doing something about it. Mr 0' Collins said that he was not being bitter. He stated: If my speaking out means Hewson gets beaten around the head a bit on Fightback for a month, then it will do him and Australia good. He went on: . . . the Coalition's plan to end tariff assistance would be particularly damaging and would result in about 200,000 people being sacked during the first term of a Hewson Government. So that is the truth of it. Fightback is going to increase unemployment. We know that it is going to increase inflation and, with inflation going up, interest rates will go up. But that is the sort of panacea that is being held out by the Opposition as its prescription for what the country needs. The honourable member for Mitchell also talked about the money from Qantas. He said that there was no long term benefit and that we were going to fiddle the books. All I can say about that is that, if we are going to fiddle the books, what was the Opposition going to do with the money? Was the Opposition going to fiddle the books also? I remind the honourable member for Mitchell that, if he is talking about paying back - ebt, there has only been one government in the nation's history that has ever done it, and that is this Government. We are paying past Liberal Party Government debt. Mr MCGauran-It was $13 billion when you came to office.",107
277,Mr GEAR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"It is good to hear the honourable member for Gippsland come to life. We are always happy when we get a little contribution from him, because around here he has a certain reputation for jumping in and not knowing much-moving the mouth before the brain gets into operation. Mr MCGauran-And you're a real intellectual?",108
278,Mr GEAR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I could mostly do the honourable member over. The one thing that we do not hear from the Opposition-and it will be interesting in a few minutes to hear the next speaker-is talk about solutions apart from Fightback. We hear about Fightback in general terms, but nothing specific-no labour market programs. The previous speaker talked about the pilots strike, the two-airline policy, Compass and the aviation policy. Where was he in the last week? Does he open his eyes and see what is happening in the place? One only has to come in here in Question Time to hear the sorts of questions that are being asked of the Government by the Opposition. Yesterday, we did not get one question on the economy, on unemployment or on any matter of substance. Every question was about the so-called Marshall Islands affair, on a day when significant things were happening and when the Government could have been open to some probing questions about part of its policy. The Opposition was stuck on the Marshall Islands. Mr MCGauran-You won't answer questions.",108
279,Mr GEAR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The honourable member for Gippsland says that we do not answer questions. The Qpposition gets fulsome answers. I thought the answer that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave today to the honourable  ripper. It was perfect. It was so comprehensive that it was more than the Opposition expected, I am sure. Talk about walk into a brick wall. What a beauty. That is the sort of tactic that the Opposition adopts. It was a grubby qu_estion. The Opposition sought to make some capital from the fact that the company in which the Prime Minister had invested did not have its returns in on time. Yet the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) left him for dead in those stakes. I think it begs the question: what are members opposite on about? Where is the substance and where are the policies? We hear speeches like that from the honourable member for Mitchell, who talked about the terrible fact that people in his electorate are losing jobs. The revolution that has occurred in the Australian economy over the last eight or nine years has meant that jobs will be lost. People who have been in jobs for a large number of years will see those jobs overhauled or replaced. But for every job that is lost, others are created. For far too long, this country has gone along thinking that people could be employed at age 15 and knock off at 65 and still be in the same job in the same workplace. But those days are long gone. Back in the 1960s it may have been possible to think like that; but we have to change our attitudes, and they are changing under this Government. This is the only Government which has made significant changes in the economy-whether it is in the area of taxation, industry or tariff policy, or social welfare. All of those areas and more have been overhauled. Somebody revisiting Australia in 1992 would not recognise it, such has been the transformation in the last 10 years. The One Nation statement takes that transformation even further. At a time of depressed economic activity, the Government has decided to inject sums of money into railways, roads, ports and all of those areas which will help our exports and our industries and which have been neglected for far too long. After the railway contracts have been let and completed, for the first time ever it will be possible to actually load something in Fremantle and take it all the way to Brisbane. How long has it taken Australia to get to that stage? I would say it has taken far too long. This initiative must do something to lower the cost of imports. Part. of the Government's strategy is to make roads and ports more efficient. I think the efficiency on the waterfront would match that of any other area in the Australian economy. Also contained in the One Nation statement is the additional allocation of $720m to TAFE. As a former TAPE teacher, I know that the money will be spent more efficiently in that education sector than in many others. It is that sector which will educate the people who will fill most of the positions that will be created in the Australian economy and most of the jobs that will be needed in the future. Not only will TAPE provide this education; links with industry will also be generated as a part of the overhaul of the TAPE system. The Government's approach-making training available to young people and thus enabling them to learn the skills with which they will be able to get jobs-is in stark contrast to that of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). On 7 May this year he was asked by a reporter: Do you think it's less likely that it will hit 11 per cent, as Dr Hewson was saying several months ago? He was asked that question in light of the latest unemployment figures which showed that the number of unemployed had actually plateaued. The honourable member for Bennelong replied: I don't want to make any predictions about where it will hit. I mean, I haven't in the past done that because I want it to go down. I want Australians to get jobs. I want young Australians to have more hope. I want us to go back to a situation that used to exist when I left school, and that is, that wanted to get a job as a kid you could.· And, we used to have a saying in Australia called the dead end job. That referred to somebody who got a job that didn't involve any kind of training, but you could get those in 50s and 60sThose were the glory days of the Liberal Party. Mr Simmons-Back to the future!",109
280,Mr GEAR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"As the Minister at the table says, 'Back to the future'. It was a period when governments did not have to interfere much and growth was natural. The honourable member went on to say: . . . you can't get them anymore. And, I would like to see Australia go back to those daysthat is, back to the days of the dead-end job when no training was required. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, most of the jobs in Australia did not require training. Basically, in those days all we did was shear sheep, ship out wool, and dig up minerals and send them off. We never did anything smart with them. It was not until quite recently, when we started to see the advantage of adding value to our raw materials, that we started to think about training our people in Australia to add that value. But the honourable member for Bennelong, in his nostalgic visit to the past-or his vision of the future; depending on one's point of view-said that he would like to go back to those days. We on this side of the House would not like to go back to those days because there is no future in having dead-end jobs. A country's prosperity can be measured, not by its physical resources, but by its human resources. For far too long, Australia has been negligent in training its people. I remember that when I was working as an electrician there were hardly any apprentices around. We used to import all of our tradesmen from overseas. It was a lot cheaper for employers to get them from overseas than train them themselves. Nowadays, we know that all successful economies train their own people and that is what we are doing. That is why the $720m which has been allocated to TAFE in the One Nation if you statement-which is in addition to the money that is already being spent on TAPE-will go a long way to giving our young people the skills they need in order to get better jobs. For each person who gets a better job in Australia-a job which pays more moneythere will be a cumulative effect across Australia. If all of our young people get jobs, all of that extra earning will be reflected in the country's gross domestic product. It stands to reason that if there is a paddock full of people with no skills and a paddock full of people with skills, we will always do better with the second. Mr MCGauran-They're not cattle.",110
281,Mr GEAR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Those are the honourable member's words, not mine. The fact is that the more skills people have, the more chance they have of getting a job and starting a career, and the more chance Australia has of making something of its natural resources. I conclude by saying that the One Nation statement, as opposed to the Fightback package which, as Mr O'Collins says, will cost 200,000 jobs and boost inflation and, with it, interest rates, does give Australia a chance. If there is a recovery on the way, the Fightback package is one good way of stopping it in its tracks. Debate (on motion by Mr Webster) adjourned. NA Selection Committee: Amended Report",110

Western New South Wales: Drought",110
283,Mr HICKS,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to bring to the attention of the House the' message contained in a votergram that I received today. It was sent on 31 May, so I apologise to Mrs Deirdre Behsman of 'Glenview' in Cobar, New South Wales. It is a votergram from the Western Action Group of the western division of New South Wales which, as honourable members would know, is in drought at the moment. It is headed 'Western Division SOS.'. It states: 3 year drought-sheep dead-no production-no income-extreme pressure and foreclosures by banks. Families suffering and disintegrating. No future-no hope....:...no faith-no revenue-no tax! Help! We're sinking fast! Contact us now! We need lifeboats! Many members of the Parliament received this votergram and, as I represent most of the western division, I thought it was only proper that I bring this matter to the attention House. We all know that these people have been suffering over the last several years as a result of poor wool prices; the HawkeKeating recession, now the Keating-Dawkins recession; and problems with the drought. There have been many pressures on them over the last several years. This has meant that the matter has been drawn to our attention on many occasions. Tonight I would like to speak about the rural counsellors who are trying to help the people in the western division. Where once upon a time there were only a few counsellors, there are now '19, and another seven are proposed for this year. Three years ago the rural assistance scheme was helping about 2,600 people; that number is now up to 7,000. Assistance by way of carry-on subsidies is provided through the rural assistance scheme for drought, for improving the farm, for maintaining the farm and, of course, for leaving the farm. As can be seen by this votergram, more and more people are leaving the farm because of this drought. Times at the moment are difficult and volatile. I would like to mention one particular rural counsellor, Fran Rowe, who has been in that position for six years. I do not know how Fran manages to carry on in this work, because it is difficult.' Many of the people who see her are at their last ebb. They are affected in many ways. Their families have problems which have been brought about by the difficult situations they are facing. Overall, the number of farms in Australia in the last 25 years has dropped from 200,000 to 120;000. I believe that people leaving the land will increase by about 50 per cent this year alone. The people on the land at the moment are facing very difficult times, more particularly the people in the western division, whom I represent. I am bringing this matter to the attention of the House because in the past these people have .been amongst the major wealth producers of this country. We have lived off the sheep's back and have lived on the toughness and resilience of these people in the west. I know a lot of the members here have been in the west, certainly the Minister of the for Family Support (Mr Simmons) and the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), and they know just how tough the situation is. The farmers have been through drought, recession, low wool prices-just about every possible suffering they could go through-and every time they have put their head up it has been kicked. Eventually things start to fall apart. On behalf of the Western Action Group and the people of the western division, I call on the House to try to do something to assist these people to stay on the land, because they are the wealth producers of this country, along with the mining fraternity and, to a small extent, the manufacturing sector. I call on the House to support the farmers where it can. Industrial Relations",111
284,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I want to talk briefly about industrial relations. As I represent the Wollongong and south coast areas, I think it is appropriate that I say a few words about industrial relations and what is in store for the workers of Australia in the unlikely event that those opposite gain the treasury bench at the next election. Much has been said in this House over the last few months about a goods and services tax of 15 per cent on everything. We know what a disaster that will be. But an even greater hidden disaster is coming up, because I think there are three lines about industrial relations in the Opposition's so called Fightback program. Those opposite have a hidden agenda which illustrates their psychological hatred of the trade union movement in this country. If people want an example of what could well be in store for Australia in the unlikely event that those opposite gain the treasury bench, they only have to go to New Zealand. I was in New Zealand two weeks ago and I had a look at how its industrial relations were, whether working or not working. It is the most divisive system that one can ever imagine. We hear a lot about work contracts. I have a work contract that was given to me in New Zealand. I am happy to provide a copy of this to any member of the House. I will say, in fairness, that it is in relation to a logging company in the North Island and it is one of the better work contracts. It is a little different from the contract the honourable member for  shown when we attended a meeting. The people there told us about the work contract they had to sign. The work contract had two paragraphs. The first paragraph said: The employer - hall set the level of remuneration. The second paragraph said: The employer shall have the right to vary the set level as he sees fit. Those were two paragraphs in this work contract that the people were forced to sign. If they did not sign it they were out of a job. In this work contract, under the heading 'Remuneration', we see that their rate of pay is $12.50 per hour. It states that, for the first 60 hours of any week employees get $12.50 per hour, irrespective of: (a) Commencement times (b) Whether work is undertaken on a Saturday or a Sunday (c) Whether the daily hours worked exceed 8 hours. The Employee shall be paid a meal allowance of $6.50 per day for any day where the hours worked exceed 10 hours. It must be even worse than the food we get in this place. It continues: WAGES shall be reviewed from time to time at the discretion of the company. NA THE employee agrees: (i) TO work for up to 70 hours per week. . . (ii) THAT Saturdays and Sundays shall be classed as normal working days. Mr Webster-It sounds like the Remuneration Tribunal.",112
285,Mr HOLLIS,HOURS OF WORK,"Yes, indeed. This is a trucking company. The contract gives all the instructions of what the employee should do. I particularly like the following: All vehicles will be kept clean at all times and thoroughly cleaned once a week. Such cleaning shall be undertaken by the Employee in his/her own time. This is one of the better contracts. The other day in this House I heard an Opposition member talk about work rates in New Zealand. He mentioned how the rates had increased; none had decreased. He did not say that the conditions had decreased. I was talking to a bus driver in New Zealand and he had calculated the hours he worked last year and the hours he worked this year. He was $2,000 down on what he had earned in the preceding year. That is going to happen time and time again in Australia in the unlikely event that the Opposition gains the treasury bench. The best lulu of them all was when I was at a log loading company. The people there were going on about how they did not have many employees. I said, 'Surely log loading is a dangerous thing?'. They said, 'One person does the lot. If you have more than one, you are more likely to have an accident, so it is safer to have one person than three or four'. (TIme expired) Fightback Package Dr HARRY.EDWARDS (Berowra) (7.38 p.m.)-I iwould like to comment on the remarks made by the honourable for Throsby (Mr Hollis). However, I came into the chamber to comment on another point-a point repeatedly made against the modelling contained in the Fightback package. That modelling is not meant to be more than illustrative, nor is it meant to cover the whole gamut of the Fightback package. Honourable members opposite repeatedly-yesterday, for instance, it was the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch)-make assertions against, all the benefits this side of the House claims, rightly, for the Fightback package, yet the modelling, in supplementary paper No.1, embodies an increase in labour productivity to the year 2000, which is not much different from that which was actually achieved in the 1980s. Thus, when we adjust for the dependency effect and the participation and unemployment effects, the average increase in labour productivity for the 1980s is 0.7 per cent per annum, and for the Fightback modelling to the year 2000 it is 0.8 per cent per annum. What I would stress in this connection is that the 0.7 per cent per annum for the 1980s is an average figure. After 1983, there was a lift in labour productivity associa.ted with economic recovery and the bringing into full use of new equipment. But from 1985, with the deadening effects on productivity of the accord, the increase in productivity flattenS out. There was virtually no growth in labour productivity through to 1990-91, as set out in Industry Commission and other sources, including even the Australian Financial Review this very day, at pages 36 and 37. When in the Fightback supplementary paper, then, there is presented the widely accepted Murphy model-the case where there are no major policy changes-for the period to 1995-96 and on to the year 2000, the average increase in labour productivity envisaged is only 0.43 per cent per annum, scenario A, or 0.4 per cent per annum, scenario B, reflecting the gradual but modest productivity growth from the latter 1980s doldrums. When, however, you inject the microeconomic reforms, the tax reform and the labor relations reform-voluntary agreements for increased productivity-of the Fightback package, then, on the basis of Industry Commission, Business Council and other estimates, this is envisaged as raising the average productivity growth to the year 2000 to 0.8 per cent per annum. Mr Webster-A big jump.",113
286,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,HOURS OF WORK,"It is a big jump. It is true, then, that, on the face of it, this is only a small increase on the 1980s average, which was 0.7 per cent per annum, but it is a near doubling as compared with the situation in recent years and the accepted Murphy model projections in the absence of the major Fightback reform's. Yesterday'S national accounts figures do not provide any grounds for questioning the relative shape and general thrust of these projections. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have acclaimed the 0.6 per cent increase in GOP for the March quarter as continuing the recovery, the so painfully slow recovery, of recent quarters from the most severe recession of the postwar years. That is welcome enough. I But if we look at table 3 of the accounts, that is, the contribution in percentage points of growth of the various components of GOP growth, we have increases in consumption, private and public, and in dwellings, totalling a full one percentage point of growth, more than outweighed by yet another-the eleventh in succession-decrease in private investment, a .decrease in public investment and a decrease in net exports; a total of minus 1.1 percentage points of 'growth'. Sot her e remains only the increase in stocks, private and public, of 0.7 percentage points to give you the recorded net growth-an item notoriously subject to considerable vagaries of estimate. It is the items on the negative side which are the cause for concern, fraught as they are with longer term significance for the recovery and sustainable growth of the economy. We have had this massive decrease over the last three years in investment, and this sudden . turnaround from the welcome recent increases in net exports. Private sector estimates so far as investment is concerned suggest that the national capital stock is actually decreasing. What is extraordinary is the conjunction of that with the massive increase in overseas indebtedness, when you include net equity liabilities, amounting to $200 billion. That is the net figure, including net equity liabilities. So the challenge facing the country is immense. Nothing but our Fightback package will meet that challenge. (Time expired) Fightback Package",114
287,Mrs CROSIO,HOURS OF WORK,"I rise tonight in the adjournment debate to bring to the notice of the House what I believe is one of the most obscene press releases I have ever come across. It has been released by the Liberal candidate for the seat of Prospect. It talks about poverty and how the children of the area are starving, how it our responsibility as a Labor Government and how we have caused all of these children to be deprived. I started to read it and thought, 'Finally he is going to have an independent thought'. One line I came to said, 'Unemployment is the single greatest contributor to poverty in Australia'. I thought, 'Where have I read that before?' I then went to the Australian of 18 May of this year in which a heading, relating to ACOSS and its submission to our Government for the Federal Budget, read: '600,000 kids in poverty'. Sure enough, there it is: 'Unemployment is the single greatest contributor to poverty in Australia' . I went on to read the press release further and I thought, 'Maybe he will have something interesting to inform me' about what he perceives the Opposition is doing to assist the growth of this country. He went on and said, 'The real answer, with all the solutions for everyone, is Fightback'. I would like to remind him, and particularly our members opposite, that in all of the OECD countries that have introduced a consumption tax, the rate has been subsequently increased-and increased substantially. The United Kingdom was going to be the great follower which the coalition wanted to copy. In the UK, the rate has increased from 10 per cent to 17.5 per cent-a 75 per cent increase. In France, the standard rate has increased from 13.6 per cent to 18.6 per cent-a 37 per cent increase. In Austria, the standard rate has increased from 8 per cent to 20 per cent-a 150 per cent increase. In Denmark, the rate has increased from 10 per cent to 22 per cent-a 120 per cent increase. In Germany, the standard rate has increased from 10 per cent to 14 per cent, and will increase further to 15 per cent in 1992. In Italy, the standard rate has increased from 12 per cent to 19 per centonly a 58 per cent increase. And of course we have the great New Zealand model. In New Zealand, the rate has increased from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent, without any compensation, in just three years-in other words, a 25 per cent increase. Let us look at what this Government has done to assist those people in need, the ones is to whom this so-called Liberal candidate has referred. In particular, we have helped families. Over 200,000 families across Australia in the last 12 months have received a family allowance and family allowance supplement. To assist those families, the money goes directly to the carer. We also find, when we investigate, that 90 per cent of the family allowance supplement is used by those families to help pay for everyday essentials, relating particularly to the bringing up of .their children. We know that 80 per cent of the family allowance supplement is spent by families on clothing for their children. We also know that over 50 per cent of that supplement payment to them by this Government is spent on food. Forty per cent of the family allowance supplement is spent on home expenses. In other words, the family allowance supplement is spent on the necessities of life, which would all be subject to tax under the GST, or so-called consumption tax. That consumption tax of 15 per cent will slash the capacity of these families to meet their children's, needs. It will also increase the cost of clothing. It will increase the cost of food. It will increase rents. Yet we have the Opposition, and particularly the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), attempting to claim that the consumption tax would be very good for Australian families. It will be very good, all right. We will see Australia change. We will see people after nine monthS receiving no benefits. We will see universal superannuation completely opposed by the Opposition. We will see Medicare completely opposed by the Opposition. Capital gains tax will be opposed by the Opposition. Yet electorates such as mine are confronted with such ignorance in press releases by a candidate who has been brainwashed by the Liberal-National Party policies on what the Fightback package and the GST are all about. I say to him and I say to all members who have not fully studied and realised the ramifications of what a package such as this would do to their community to take time to sit down and read it, and then take time to go around the community and talk with the people it is going to affect. Sure, the rich will get richer. They are the ones who will benefit from it. Obviously, the coalition and its members are the only ones they choose to represent them. But on this side of the House, we make a point of representing those who are least able to afford to pay and, most particularly, those who are least able to stand up for themselves, to defend their rights. I hope that we on this side of the House continue to fight and to make sure that those people can be served, that those people are getting the best and, most particularly, that those people never have to suffer a goods and services tax, as indicated by the Opposition in its Fightback package. It is no fight back; it is absolute disaster. (TIme expired) Clothing Donations",114
288,Mr WEBSTER,HOURS OF WORK,"I rise to bring to the attention of the House something that is really gratifying to talk about. It is good news that I am pleased to bring. The good news is the overwhelming response by the people of Canberra to a call by the Reverend Fred MCMaster to donate good quality clothing to the children and people of the Ukraine, particularly in the Chernobyl area. Reverend MCMaster, who was the superintendent of the Baptist churches in Canberra at the time, wrote a letter to all the churches appealing for as much clothing as they could possibly get. The response was overwhelming, with over 3,000 kilograms of excellent clothing being donated by the people from the different churches. The logistics of getting three tonnes of clothing to the Ukraine was a pretty big problem. I was able to come into the story. I discovered that Aeroflot had two planes coming into Melbourne-one this week and one early next week-to pick up exchange crews for research and fishing vessels that have been brought into Melbourne. The General Manager of Aeroflot, Mr Victor Kasenov, has agreed to take the three tonnes of clothing back to the Soviet Union next Tuesday morning. The people who coordinated the gathering  tina Gaschke, who were Ukrainians and are now Australian citizens; They came back with the cry that Australian people need to come to the aid of the people of the Ukraine in terms of clothing. So this has been a magnificent response. The. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been overwhelming in its support. The embassy in Moscow is going to make sure that the transfer of goods in Moscow is satisfactory and that the 18 bales of clothing actually get to the people in Kiev who are waiting for it. Qantas, under the direction of the general manager of freight in Australia, Mr EllUl}et Hobbs, and the manager in Melbourne, Mr Richard Davies, has been absolutely overwhelming, to say the least, in its cooperative efforts to make sure that nothing goes wrong. We are able to get the 18 bales to Melbourne. All the paperwork, the Customs clearances and so on are being undertaken by Qantas. It is going to be a smooth operation to get the 18 bales of excellent clothing from Canberra; due to the generosity of the people here, to the Ukraine via Aeroflot, Qantas and the Russian embassy here. The two people who raised the alarm for  Valentina Gaschke, are going on the Russian airline with. the bales. They have been allowed to travel on that airliner. The Russian embassy has been excellent. In particular, a chap by the name of Andrei, one of the Russian offiCials in the visa department, has been very helpful and very gentlemanly, and was extremely cooperative in seeing that Mr and Mrs Gaschke had their visas to go into Moscow and their visas to go from Moscow into the Ukraine stamped in their passports today. The whole exercise is one that we in this Parliament need to applaud and that the people of Australia need to applaud. The people of Australia need to repeat it so that we can help our fellow human beings who are suffering in a major way, particularly the children in Chernobyl as a result of the disaster that occurred there some years ago. I would like to place on the official record of this House my appreciation of what has been done. Indeed, I feel that I am echoing the appreciation of the whole House. Goods and Services Tax  p.m.)-I want again tonight to raise the question of the impact of the goods and services tax upon the Australiari community, Australian families and Australian business. I have asked in this place on several occasions: when is the Opposition going to come clean and explain why it is misleading the Australian public? It says on page 116 of its document: . we will continue to provide preferred tax treatment to the family home-in other words, we will not tax the family home ... But if one goes to the trouble of reading right through the document, one finds that on page 225 it says: In the case of an average home....,... it is not a family home; it has now become an average homethe net Goods and Services Tax impact is $2856 after discounting the effect of abolishing' wholesale sales tax and petrol tax. That is a blatant contradiction. It needs to be explained. Is it that an average home is never a family home, or is it that a family home is never an average home? There is a contradictionand a conflict in terms. The essential point lies in attempting to tell people that the cost of housing will not rise following the imposition of a goods and· services tax. I· want to go on to refer to the impact on families, particularly lower income families, when they are forced to pay a 15 per cent GST on everything that they put in their mouth, on their feet and on their back. I have seen the brochure that has been handed around by the Opposition. I will come back to that in a moment. But there is another detail that I wanted to show specifically for the record so that honourable members on the other side of the House can come to understand just how· specific and how personal the impact of goods and services tax would be on families. The Opposition says that it is going to reduce the family bill by the imposition of a goods and services tax. But bacon is not taxed, so it goes up 15 per cent; neither are bread, breakfast cereals, cheese, coffee, eggs, flour, fruit and vegetables, margarine, meat, milk, peanut butter, frozen peas, tinned pineapple, rice, spaghetti, sugar, tea, tomato sauce and tuna. But do people not eat those products? The Opposition is saying that the costs will be reduced by the abolition of the wholesale sales tax. It is a wonderful statement, but a dishonest statement. The brochure says that abolishing the wholesale sales tax will save Australians $9.4 billion. For the information of the House, I have run through some of the items which will be going up in cost by at least 15 per cent. In actual practice, they will go up by more than that because, as distributors and small business people pay GST, as they outlay money, they will mark their margin up on the increased cost. They are not that generous. They do not go on the basis of what they have on credit. If they have paid out cash, the standard practice in their experience is to put their 20 per cent or 33% per cent margin on top of that. So the actual increase is more than the straight 15 per cent. In item one of the Opposition's brochure it says: Wholesale sales tax abolished! Saves Australians $9.4 billion. It substitutes a collection of $27 billion through GST for $9.4 billion. It goes on to say: You might not realise it but right now you are paying up to 30% on many goods you buy. The 30 per cent tax rate produces 6.8 per cent of total sales tax income. In other words, 93.2 per cent of sales tax does not come from the 30 per cent tax rate. I would love to have the Opposition's calculations to see how one can take 6,8 per cent of gross sales tax income and use that to make people better off in respect of all those goods and services that are to be taxed at 15 per cent. Another matter is the 15 per cent imposition upon tourism. Tourism is that industry for which we have a wonderful potential. It is growing. Historic aviation policy changes in the last two days will assist it. But what the Opposition wants to do is impose a 15 per cent differential, which will immediately increase the price of all the tourist services in this country and put us at a substantial disadvantage in comparison with the countries and regions of world with which we compare. The best example is to look to 1990, when the Swedish Government extended the VAT to include tourism. (TIme expired) Goods and Services Tax",116
289,Mr MCGAURAN,HOURS OF WORK,"The honourable member for Shortland  long line of Government speakers today that have tried to attack the coalition in regard to the goods and services tax. Needless to say, he is part of an organised, deliberately structured speaking list to try somehow to raise doubts or concern amongst the Opposition. As I have only one minute to try to respond to the number of matters raised by the honourable member for Shortland, I shall simply advise him, in regard to housing, for heaven's sake to read the Fightback package and learn something about the difference between exempt and zero rated industries under the GST. I am certainly not going to do the reading for him. He should also look at the increase allowed to first home buyers. We have a special scheme to boost first home buyers so as to overcome the problem that may result for them from the housing construction industry being an exempt industry rather than zero rated. He should believe us-I would not expect him to for a moment-that the cost of living will increase under a GST by only 4 per cent, not 15 per cent, as he alleged tonight; he should take his own Treasury figure of 3.6 per cent. We are conservative. He should look at his own calculations. It will not be 15 per cent. That is a deliberate misrepresentation.",118
