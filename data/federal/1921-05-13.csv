28,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALT H,"Parramatta-Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.16] -(B y leave) - I moveTbat this Bill be now read a second time. As I explained last evening, this is simple alteration to the Westralian Western Farmers' Agreement Act. The effect is to make the scheme upon which the farmers of Western Australia propose to embark for the bulk handling of their wheat a more modest one. It will relieve the shareholders of the necessity for collecting £60,000 more capital, and also relieve the Commonwealth in the meantime to the extent of £110,000 of its obligation. I commend the measure warmly to o honourable members. I think the farmers of the western State are acting wisely in proceeding, in the circumstances, with a modified scheme, and in confining their operations for the present to the building of terminal silos.",22
29,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALT H,"Hunter ) [11.18] This House in August last passed a measure confirming an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the farmers of Western Australia, who were about to form a co-operative concern for PAPERS , the purpose of handling their wheat in bulk. It provided for a capital expenditure of £800,000, and' stipulated that the 1 farmers should allot at least 300,000 shares at 10s. a share. A f t e r they had spent £100,000 in the erection of silos in country districts, or at terminal points, the Commonwealth was to lend them £ 1 for every £ 2 expended by them. That, - shortly, was the proposal put before the There was little opposition to it . Honourable membera of the Opposition enbe' deavoured to secure the insertion of one or two small amendments, but beyond that there was no division, either on the second or the third reading. Evidently the farmers of Western Australia calculated rather highly. Otherwise we would not be asked to amend the Act. Anpathey have not been able to issue and the whole of the 300,000 shares.",22
30,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALT H,"That is not quite the point. They could raise the whole amount, but with a modified scheme, there is no necessity for doing so.",22
31,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALT H,"They were unable to raise the full share issue, but the fact that over £240,000 has been subscribed is a satisfactory achievement for a small State like Western Australia.",22
32,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALT H,And they are nearly - all struggling wheat growers.,22
33,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALT H,"I was about to make the same remark. We are asked in this modified Bill to assist the a farmers' co-operative organization in Australia to erect terminal silos. In order to do that, it is necessary to amend the agreement so that we may advance to the society a certain proportion of the money originally arranged for, notwithstanding that they have not been able to fully comply with the terms of the Act. In view of the fact that the Federal Government is not asked, in this amending Bill, to incur further obligation, I cannot see that any great objection need be offered to the proposal. We are simply reducing, as it were, the amount provided for in the Act. That is to say, because the farmers were not able tp take up the whole of the 300,000 shares, they have approached the Government for the purpose of having the Act amended so that they may proceed with the erection of terminal silos as portion of the whole scheme for the preservation of their wheat. The amount to be advanced by the Commonwealth Government is to be reduced, proportionately. Instead' of being called upon to advance to the society £550,000 the Government, in the terms of this amending Bill, will be authorized to advance up to £440,000, which is the true proportion of subsidy to the farmers' capital investment in the venture. The war demonstrated the urgent need for the protection of the wheat crops of Australia. It would have been much better if the proposed silos were built on land owned by the cooperative' society. If I remember aright, during the' debate on the scheme some little time ago, it was stated that the site of the terminal silo at Fremantle was owned by the State Government; but, nevertheless, the Commonwealth is amply protected by mortgage' over the securities of the society, which moreover has to expend £100,000 of its own money before the Commonwealth is required to advance anything by way of subsidy. I am sorry to have to say it , but I believe there is a bad time ahead, and that neither the Federal Government nor the State Governments will be able to get all the money they require for public works. This will mean a large amount of unemployment I fear in the near future, although I hope I am wrong in that supposition. If this co-operative society can undertake the expenditure of £100,000 on its terminal elevator it will provide employment for a good number of men in the western State, and to that extent the Commonwealth Government will be relieved from its obligation, because it will not be called upon to expend one shilling of subsidy until the society has spent £100,000 on the scheme. The rate of interest on the Commonwealth subsidy will be 6 per cent.",22
34,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,We paid 6£ for the last loan.,23
35,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALT H,"Probably the rate in respect of this-subsidy would represent 6£ per cent. if the necessary charges were added. It is very advisable that every effort should be made to find employment during the trying period that is ahead of us, and this is one way.",23
36,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALT H,We should also encourage production.,23
37,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALT H,"Exactly , and if we encourage production we must also make provision for the protection of our primary products from deterioration. This may be regarded as an urgent matter. Another subject to which, perhaps, I may be permitted to refer as equally urgent, is the question of increasing the allowances paid to our old age and invalid pensioners. I hope the Government will consider this matter. I believe the House is favourably disposoel towards it,- and also towards an increase in the exemption of the Income Tax Act.  Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) is to be congratulated on the manner in which he has dealt with this Bill ; but the position is scarcely as he stated it-that the farmers of Western Australia undertook more than they were able to carry out. What is now sought is a temporary modification of the Act passed last August. Experts have unanimously advised that the first work to be undertaken should be the erection of the terminal elevator, because the money so expended will immediately come into utilization. It is regarded as the wisest' course, and it is therefore pot necessary to call the whole of the money until the terminal site has been erected. There is another reason why it is not advisable simultaneously to go on with the whole scheme. Materials have come down in price somewhat and will drop lower, and the advantage thus gained will be shown over the entire scheme. Therefore, it would not be good policy for the socVy to proceed with, the whole of the work at once. When terminal elevators have been erected they will be used immediately, even though the other section of the scheme may not be completed. It is unnecessary for me to speak further in support of the Bill.",23
38,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,"Wakefield) [11.29] - I wish to raise one point, and do so early, in order that some representative from Western Australia when speaking may put me right if I am under a misapprehension as to the real position. My point is apart altogether from the desirability or otherwise of providing silos. If I understand the position rightly, the Government of Western Australia takes no financial responsibility whatever. If that be so, then we are establishing what may. possibly prove to be a very dangerous precedent. Sir ' JOSEPH COOK - That point was raised when the original Bill was before the House.",24
39,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,I do not think I was present when the original Bill was under consideration. There is involved a question of principle which ought to be discussed.  mised to all the States.,24

41,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,"That is the point. I may be wrong, but I do not think such a course as this has been taken in regard to any previous business venture.",24
42,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALT H,I would remind my honourable friend that this Bill simply provides for a modification of the original agreement.,24
43,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,I am aware of that; but I wish to place my views on record. This point will be raised again.,24

46,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,"I do not, and if the honourable member could only see a little further than his nose, he would realise that the point I am raising inquiry. has nothing whatever to do with the erection of silos. I intend to make my statement whether honourable members like it or not. We are undertaking to render a service to the farmers of Western Australia. I do not object to that. The point I wish to raise is that if we are to undertake this service, and incur the liability set out in the agreement, the to State Government of Western Australia should be behind it . Who ought to know the position from every point of view better than the State Government? I ask the representatives of Western Australia in this House to let us know whether the State Government stands behind this liability, and, if not, why not?  They have passed legislation offering every facility for this scheme, but they did not think it desirable that there should be two mortgagees. There is one mortgagee now, and that is the Commonwealth.",24
47,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,"That is no answer to my inquiry as to whether the Western Australian Government is behind this scheme. If it is not, I want to know the reason why.",24
48,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALT H,There is no need for the State Government to be behind it . This is a gilt-edged proposition.,24
49,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,But where is the application of this principle to end ?,24
50,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALT H,Why did not the honourable member vote against the original Bill ?,24
51,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,"I do not think I was here at the time, but I told the promoters of the scheme that I should completely 'object to it if the State Government did not stand behind it .",24
52,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALT H,Why is this special arrangement made in regard to the farmers of Western Australia?,24
53,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,"It is probable that similar schemes will come before us from other States. If the liability is one which the Commonwealth should properly incur, then the State Government should stand behind it . It is not because of want of sympathy with any legitimate effort to stimulate and increase production that I raise this question. The principle involved is important, and I ask the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) for a reply to my",24
54,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALT H," The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) has done a service to the House by raising the question of the principle involved in this At the present time there is a great lack of housing accommodation in the State capitals. If a pompany is formed to build homes for the people in, say, Melbourne or Sydney, and applies to the Commonwealth for assistance in carrying out that scheme to the extent of a Government contribution of £2 for every £1 spent by it, will there be any objection to the application of this principle to such an enterprise 1 Sir. JOSEPH COOK. - Why raise point now ?",25
55,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALT H,Because I think the Government have been rather lax.,25
56,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALT H,Eve n if this were dropped we should still have on the statute-book a measure providing for the bigger scheme.,25
57,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALT H,"I am pleased that such a measure is on the statute-book of the Commonwealth. It will be a useful precedent to the Labour party when we get into power. ' The people of Australia find it difficult to obtain the clothing and blankets they require at the present time. If co-operative companies are formed to produce such goods i-i Australia, will the Commonwealth Government come to their assistance as they are coming to the aid of this co-operative enterprise? honourable friends from Western Australia agree to assist any similar co-operative concern ?  lines.",25
58,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALT H,"I am pleased to have that assurance, because the principle f o i which this Bill provides may be extended to other enterprises. Australia is not producing anything like the quantity of woollen goods that it consumes, and I hope that if co-operative companies are formed to carry on the woollen industry here the Government will be prepared, as in this case, to assist them in supplying the requirements of the neople. I shall vote for the Bill , because I believe in the principle of the Government assisting cooperative enterprises.",25
59,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"Dampier) [11.40] - I have been surprised at the speech delivered by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster), because [11.36]. I know what are his political views, and his - remarks on this Bill were hot in accord with the political opinions to which he usually <nves expression. In the policy proposal. speech on which the National Government were elected the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) promised that advances would be made by the Commonwealth Government on safe lines to assist production. He realized that we have enormous waste spaces in Australia. He realized the necessity for populating this great country. He made definite promises that co-operative organizations established to increase production would be given Commonwealth assistance, and an Act was this passed, two years , ago, enabling £2,800,000 to be allocated for this purpose. Knowing the honourable member for Wakefield as I do, I should have Bill thought that he - would give his approval to a proposal such as that contained in this Bill , where the control of the enterprise to be assisted is left, as far as possible, in the hands of those engaged in the industry.",25
60,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,Why is not the Western Australian Government behind the business ?,25
61,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"The honourable member must know that the Western Australiau Government are behind this proposal, but he desires that they should fill the position of a second mortgagee. We Will my have to satisfy ourselves that the security proposed is good enough and that this enterprise will help to increase the production and wealth of the country. It should be remembered that, as has already been pointed out, this Bil l represents merely a modification of a proposal which was accepted by this House almost unanimously a little time ago. I trust that there will be no serious opposition to the passing of the Bill . The difficulty of providing labour need not greatly concern honourable members, in view of the great probability that the proposal will increase the wealth of the community and so will provide for increased employment. I am prepared to give the Bill my most earnest support. It does not involve any new principle. Only the other day, at Shepnarton, I saw evidence of marvellous progress as the result of assistance given by the Victorian Government to fruit-growers and muttongrowers. I was told that tinned fruits to the value of no less than £90,000 weTe, this year, sent away from the canning works at Shepparton. I hope that honourable members 'will pass the Bill , which I believe to be a good one.",25
62,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALT H,"East Sydney) [11.44] When a Bill similar to this was before this House on a previous occasion I opposed, it as strongly as I could. One of the grounds for my opposition was that the people of Western Australia took no interest in the proposal, and showed that they had no confidence in it . The Commonwealth Government have no right to lend money for such purposes without satisfactory security. Another objection I had to the original nroposal was that, at the time, there was in existence a coalition Government, which we know is an immoral Government, and will do things which no other Government would do in order to please different sections of their supporters. I know <that on' the last occasion on which we dealt with this business an . honourable member saidOf course, the honourable member for Swan  good one. Only a few days ago, after a division had been taken in which the Government narrowly escaped defeat, I heard a member of the Country party remark, "" If the Government do not do what' we wish them to do, they will be faced with something even worse than this.""",26

64,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALT H,"There is no date on the volume from which I am quoting. wanted to show that the outcome of that threat to the Government was the measure then brought forward. in opposing that measure has been more than justified, inasmuch as it has since been shown that the people of Western Australia, who will benefit from the proposal if it is a success, have failed to support it. If anything more is required to condemn the proposal, I am unable to say what it is. The people of Western tralia have, not subscribed the they undertook to subscribe when House was asked to pass the measure. In my view, this is a rotten business to ask the Commonwealth vernment to enter upon. men on the Treasury bench who are not alive to the needfor security money is advanced for an undertaking of this kind, it is time a change of Government was brought about. It is the first duty of members of this' House to se* that there is good' security for any money advanced by the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr . James Page) and I represent the two States of the Commonwealth which, because of their larger populations and greater resources, will have to bear the burden for the benefitoof the smaller States. Some honourable members are very anxious to obtain from the other States the money required to finance this enterprise to help Western Australia. There are some honourable members who howl from the housetops at the idea of the Commonwealth Parliament passing any Socialistic legislation, but there could be no more Socialistic legislation than that now proposed. It stands to the discredit of the Western Australian Government that it tried to blind the people as to the real meaning of the financial business that was being undertaken. More consideration should be given to public finance than in the past; but Mr Lloyd George,' and, following him, our own Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) seems to pursue a policv of rousing the people to a state of excitement, and then using that excitement for the purpose of passing legislation which' I feel quite sure f u t u r e generations, not only in Australia, but in Great Britain, will condemn.

70,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALT H,"Then I shall sav that last night I noticed the absence of representatives of a certain State. I have no doubt that the Treasurer (Sir .Joseph Cook) feels his position very keenly. I defy any honourable member to point to similar legislation in any Parliament in Australia. No one can deny that this proposal is for the benefit of the farming dommunity, seeing that it has for its object the storing of wheat in order to keep up its price. There is no excuse for the refusal of those interested in wheat to subscribe towards the £300,000, for never before had they such heavy balances at their back. Where is their patriotism? What is their idea of the future of the wheat industry? I can quite understand the financial institutions not "" r u s h in g "" the proposal; because there is not that sound security behind it that there would have been if the State bf Western Australia had been a guarantor. W it h good security, we .should have found not only the banks, but insurance and trustee companies contributing the necessary money, which would have obviated the humiliation to - which the representatives of Western Australia are now subjected. scheme had been a sound business proposition there would have been no necessity for this Bill , and' members would be very well advised to hesitate before supporting it . Other States do not ask the - Commonwealth to advance money on security that is not of the best. In financial matters, the Government ought to show an example and not take risks; it ought to offer an object lesson to those inclined to enter into speculations of this character. A f t e r all, this Bill has in view only a terminal port ; the wheat will have to be bagged from the country districts to the silo, so that that branch of the work will not be obviated. My own opinion is that the silo will not be used, and that, I take it , is «one of the reasons why those interested in the wheat industry have not' subscribed the necessary capital. My acting Leader (Mr Charlton), with that - affability .so characteristic of him, .has intimated that he raises no great objection to ""the measure. The Bill provides for the expenditure of a lesser amount than - was contemplated under the original Act. Our only consolation, therefore, is that the Commonwealth will suffer a smaller loss. In my judgment the scheme is not a sound one. The State of Western Australia ought to guarantee the Commonwealth against all loss in connection with the proposed undertaking. If the scheme were an ordinary business one, the person who had to advance the money would require the feesimple of the land upon which the proposed silos are to be erected.",27
71,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALT H,The honourable member is a great believer in freehold titles.,27
72,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALT H,"That has nothing whatever to do with the question which we are now considering. I am prepared to debate the question of leasehold versus freehold with the honourable gentleman upon any public platform. I am thoroughly satisfied that the undertaking upon which we are now asked to embark is not a sound one. Mr FOWI.EE - Was it sound business when the Commonwealth handed over £7,000,000 of loan money to New South Wales?",27
73,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALT H,"The honourable member talks so rapidly that I am quite unable to follow him. In addition, I am not If the good at answering conundrums. Whereever the Commonwealth enters upon such an .undertaking as is outlined in the measure which is now before us it should be absolutely guaranteed against loss. But no enterprise of which I have any> knowledge is pregnant with such possibilities of loss as is that which we are asked to approve in this Bill.",27
74,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALT H,"Wide Bay) [12.4] - I unhesitatingly support the measure enabling the Commonwealth Government to make an advance by loan for silos to be constructed by cooperative farmers in Western Australia. It represents a move in the right direction. I agree with the encouragement of the principle of co-operation, and in new countries like those of Western Australia and Queensland, the people are badly in need of that encouragement. It is all very well to say that they should lean upon their State Governments. At the present time the Queensland Government have no money with which to proceed with any of their enterprises. In such circumstances the parent Government ought to go to the primary producers' assistance so as to promote the growth of our primary industries, and with a view to settling as many people as possible in the great States of Queensland and Western Australia. There are 419,000,000 acres in Queensland, of which 400,000,000 acres aTe still unalienated. It is our duty to encourage settlement upon Crown lands, and to achieve that result the settlers must receive either from the State or the Commonwealth some measure of financial assistance. If that assistance can safely be granted upon co-operative lines, as it can be in this case, it should be granted. I hope that, in the near future, Queensland farmers will come to the Commonwealth Government with a request for assistance by way of loan in the erection of silos for the maize industry, which is destined to become a very important industry, not merely to returned soldiers, but also to immigrants.",28
75,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,Maranoa) [12.6]. - I intend to oppose the Bill at every stage. Ever since the opening of this Parliament honourable members of the Country party have been doing nothing else but preaching economy.,28
76,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALT H,"This is a matter of wheat, and not of wool.",28
77,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"The laugh is upon the other side. The wool industry has not asked this Parliament for a single copper. All that those who are interested in that industry have said is, ""Leave us alone. We can pay our taxes and we can pay our creditors 20s. in the £1.""",28
78,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALT H,The honourable member merely asked us tofixthe price of wool a little bit higher for him.,28
79,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,Does the honourable member think that 8d. per lb. is a high price to pay for wool ?,28
80,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALT H,No .,28
81,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Then why did he make that remark? As a matter of fact, the wool-growers of Australia did not need even the small consideration for which they asked. What was done by this Parliament has merely had the effect of stabilizing; the industry. But we have nothing for which to thank honourable members. We want nothing from them. All that we ask of this Parliament is that we may be left alone. Only last night the honourable member' for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) pointed out what taxation the man upon the land is really paying. My principal objection to the Bill is that it is not in the interests of the country at all. Last evening we witnessed the spectacle of £50,000 being voted for city interests in connection with additions to the Perth Post-office.",28
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALT H, Order ! The honourable member must not reflect upon that vote.,28
83,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,I beg your pardon. Surely I am at liberty to make a passing reference to it . When the Government are going to spend more money in Perth,28
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALT H,I would remind the honourable member that when a vote has once been agreed to by the House it must not be the subject of any imputation or reflection.,28
85,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"This is a new dictum. Evidently the expenditure of money which has already been voted cannot be criticised. I am very sorry, sir, to hear you make that statement.",28
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALT H,"The honourable member may refer to the matter at another stage, but he is not at liberty to do so upon this Bill.",28
87,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,I am merely making an incidental reference to the fact that country interests are not being adequately safeguarded.,28
88,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALT H,All expenditure for the city.,28
89,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"All for the city every time. Not a word was said last night against that money being spent in the capital of Western Australia, and this morning a fresh Bill .comes down for spending another sum near that city, because we are told that they are going to erect the silos only at the terminal ports.",28
90,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALT H,A very wise thing to do.,29
91,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"It may be from the honourable member's point of view, because he is interested in ports. Only yesterday the Treasurer told the House and the country that there was no money available to settle returned soldiers and Imperial soldiers on the land in the Burnett district, which the honourable member for Wide Bay represents, yet he had nothing to say about that. He sat in silence, but when a proposal comes forward to spend money lavishly in Western Australia, he says it is a good thing. He had not a word to say for his own State and for the district which he represents. He sat there smiling, and why? For political reasons, because there happens to be a Labour* Government in Queensland, and the harder that Government is hit, the more pleased be is. If ever there was a fraud and sham perpetrated on the House",29
92,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALT H,The honourable member knows that I am interested in the farmer.,29
93,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"-The only time the honourable member is interested in the farmer is when he is going - to get somet thing out of him. That is my experience of him, and I have known him for years, not personally, but by repute. It is a peculiar thing that, although the honourable member and his crowd have always tried to put me out, I have been here ever since this Parliament first met. If the Country party are consistent",29
94,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALT H,"There is no "" if "" about that.",29
95,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"If there is one thing more than another which makes the Country party consistent, it - is their inconsistency. In one breath they condemn the Government for spending money, and in the next the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) compliments them, as he did this morning, on what they are doing.  vestment.",29
96,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"I have had a lot .to do with investments. I have never known one yet which was not the soundest in the world until they got hold of my "" few bob,"" and then I am sorry to say that every one of them has turned out a blank. I do not blame the Western Australians for getting all they can, but what I do blame them for is their inconsistency in asking for money to be spent at the terminal ports of their State when it could be advantageously saved. Although it could have been saved, not one word of protest has come from the Country party.",29
97,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALT H,"If they were asking for more money instead of less, there would be some justification for the honourable member's remarks; but they are not.",29
98,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"As man to man, leaving politics out of it altogether, does the honourable member think that this is a sound scheme ? ",29
99,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,Then why does not the honourable member put his money into it?  fore the honourable member started.,29
100,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"If it is such a good "" spec,"" let the honourable member put another £1,150 into it . I started with about a "" fiver,"" and as I kept going, and saw it was such a good "" spec."" I put more "" fivers "" in until I had put in thousands.",29
101,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALT H,The honourable member for Swan put in all he had.,29
102,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,He could not put in much more.,29
103,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALT H,He is trying to put more in now.,29
104,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Yes , of the Commonwealth's money. I have neverhad that opportunity, or I might have been in the same boat as the honourable member. I should like to see as much money as possible put into the primary industries, but are those industries going to gain anything by the two votes asked for last night and this morning?",29
105,Mr EILEY,COMMONWEALT H,This will save the expense of bagging.,29
106,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,They will have to bag the wheat just the same in the country.,29
107,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALT H,They can get the bags back. That is a big consideration.,29
108,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"The honourable member means that they can tip the wheat into the silos, and take the empty bags back. That will be some consideration. If this is such a good proposition as honourable members would .try to make us believe, I am sure there are plenty of business speculators in the Commonwealth who would go into it with both hands and both feet. If there is one thing more than another that makes me chary of it, it is the interjection of the honourable member l o r Echuca (Mr Hill ) . They have had a long time to gather the money.",29
109,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALT H,The honourable member for Echuca has not replied to your question whether he believes this is a sound scheme.,30
110,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"I will not press the .question, as I should not like to put the honourable member for Echuca in a false position. He is a hard-headed business man. It is an undertaking that, candidly, I should not go into. ",30
111,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"I am going to vote against the Bill at all stages. ""We shall have a day out on this Bill. If I oan get any one else to call for a division with me, I shall do so at every stage.",30
112,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALT H,The honourable member evidently does not want to lessen the liabilities .of the Commonwealth.,30
113,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"I have been saying ever since I rose that I wondered at the members of the Country party voting for either of these two appropriations. If that does not show I am anxious to lessen the liabilities of the Commonwealth, I do not know what would. There is something I have heard, but I shall not repeat it here, because I have no confirmation of it. A man who makes serious statements on the floor of the House ought to have something behind him, and the mattter to which I refer would involve a serious statement. I am pleased and proud to know that the Western Australians always hold up their end of the log. They say they have one of the finest countries under the sun, and I believe they have a fine country. When I was over =there, what they were doing in the way of agriculture and fruit growing was a revelation to me.",30
114,Mr CORSEE,COMMONWEALT H,Why not encourage them more?,30
115,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"If the Bill would do good to men on the land, I - would support it heartily.",30
116,Mr FOWLER,COMMONWEALT H,"In opposing the .measure, the honourable member puts a greater responsibility on .his party, because the Bill reduces, the amount of the advance.",30
117,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,Thes e gentlemen' cannot get the necessary shares taken up. That is what is'the matter. ' Mr HILL - Then you should sympathize with them. ' Mr JAMES PAGE - I do.,30
118,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALT H,To what extent?,30
119,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"It has often been said, and it is a truth, that there is no sentiment in business; but this is a sentimental proposition.",30
120,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALT H,Did you raise the same objection to the Bawra wool scheme?,30
121,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,That scheme did not ask the Commonwealth to provide money. What guarantee have we that this measure will be final?,30
122,Mr GKEGOEY,COMMONWEALT H,"If they went to work and raised the necessary shares, the Commonwealth would be committed to a larger advance. ' Mr JAMES PAGE - I was very ill when the first Bill was introduced, or I should have opposed it as strongly as I oppose this.",30
123,Mr BUKCHELL,COMMONWEALT H,"Shoul d this Bill be defeated, the Act will still remain.",30
124,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"The Bill will not be defeated, because all the honourable members opposite - Nationalists and Country members alike-ar e behind the Government. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) may rage and threaten, but when a division is taken, he and all the others on that side will vote for the Government. But the Bill will not pass without a protest from me at every Stage. I .shall oppose it in the interests of economy, and the real economists must support me. Why should the Government give £.300,000 to the Westralian Cooperative Farmers Association?",30
125,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALT H,"The money is only being lent, and will be repaid. Mr .JAMES PAGE - I have had experience of persons who, in borrowing a "" tenner,"" say, "" I shall let you have it .back at a certain date."" The money never comes back.",30
126,Mr FOLEY,COMMONWEALT H,Perhaps your attitude to would be borrowers is the same as that towards the Bill.,30
127,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Wit h all my knowledge of human nature, I , like other honourable members, am occasionally taken down. No one seems to have any qualms about taking down the Government. This morning a man tried to evade payment of a tram fare, and I said to him, "" That is rather mean,"" but he replied, ""Oh, this is partly a Government affair. No one is hurt.""",31
128,Sir EOBERT BEST,COMMONWEALT H,What is proposed is one form of protecting the farming commembers munity.,31
129,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"I should be well satisfied with a system of Protection that gave me an advance of £300,000. Testerand day, the Acting Prime Minister said that he had no money to lend to the Queensmoted land Government. The Commonwealth something would be more likely to get money from a State Government, or, at any rate, interest on its advance, than from a private corporation. Population is needed a very in Queensland, and the State Government asks, not for £2,000,000 in a lump but for permission to 'draw up to that Wales ? amount, to settle our returned soldiers, and the Imperial Service men, on the rich Burnett lands. There was no protest from Country members, or from the repremy sentative of the district, when the Acting Prime Minister said that he had no money to lend. Yet today it is proposed to advance money to a farmers' co-operadiscussion; tive company in Western Australia.",31
130,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALT H,Why do not the Queensmoney land Government give freehold to soldier settlers instead of perpetual leaseholds?,31
131,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"The only differvance ence between freeholds and perpetual leaseholds is that the latter are re-appany; praised at intervals, and surely the people have the right to any increase in the value of land due to community effort.",31
132,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALT H,"Batman) [12.31] congratulate the Country party on their success in securing the presentation of this measure to the House. It is an achieve the ment. It is clearly designed in their terests, and in those of their friends -, and grain growers. of a particular class of person in ern Australia. In matters of this kind have noticed that the Minister' in charge addresses himself almost exclusively to members of the Country party. We know that if a proposal of this nature had not the endorsement, and, indeed, had been moved for in the first place by members of the Country party, it would not have been accepted by the Government, nor' presented to Parliament. Thus, I emphasize, the Country party are entitled to my felicitations. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) is just fresh from his entirely laudable work of making this country blossom like the rose, by means of the Tariff; and, while so engaged, it was a matter for criticism that of the party in .the corner looked upon him with a somewhat scowling front, and that the Minister, when he made his apology, directed it and all his arguments to the Corner. This, then, is a solatium, those honourable members are happy. Secondary industries have been amply produring the past week, and now is being done by this benevolent back Government for .primary industry.",31
133,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"Is the honourable member aware that the Government agreed to similar proposition, which involved the expenditure of about a million of sum, Commonwealth money, in New South",31
134,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALT H,"The honourable member for Dampier assumes an ignorance on part to which I cannot plead guilty. I recall, also, the introduction of the original measure dealing with the identical subject-matter of the Bill now under and, upon that occasion, I offered a few words of criticism. I remarked that this was a proposal to lend to a wealthy corporation in Western Australia-publi c funds, which were unsecured. I repeat that criticism. This proposition represents an unsecured adout of public funds to promote the interests of a Western Australian comand, while it may be good for the companv. and for the local farmers, I ask that this benevolent principle of State Socialism be extended throughout the I Commonwealth, and not confined to the friends and interests of those who may be able to bring special pressure to bear upon Government. I note that the shareinholders in this concern are to be bona fide There is no guarantee, Westapparently, given or sought tc satisfy I honourable members of what a bond fide grain grower may be; but I have sufficient confidence in the enterprise of some of the people interested in grain, and who are not altogether bond fide grain growers, to not suggest that they will very soon, by specious representations, acquire an interest in this company as bona fide grain growers-a n interest sumcient, at all events, to satisfy this Government, which is so easily satisfied when it has to placate the Country party. We are amending a measure which was passed last year, and was designed for purposes which are set out afresh in the Bill before the House. We are amending it, I apprehend, because in certain particulars the original Bill was found to be, on the financial side, rather more dangerous ""than was at first supposed. . ",31
135,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALT H,"I give the honourable member and his party fullest credit for caution. No one can suggest that they have failed in the smallest regard where their own interests in this Parliament are concerned. Every one knows, for example, how staunchly they have stood for the principle of Protection, except when it applied to something which they used, and that only then did they abandon that great principle. Now, in like manner, in coming here to secure some public funds to assist the primary producer in Western Australia, I give them the fullest credit for looking after their own interests. trouble with certain honourable members on this side, such as the honourable mem Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), and Maranoa (Mr James Page), is that they are foolish enough to give a whole lot of consideration to the general taxpayer, to the worker, and to the consumer, instead of merely-lik e honourable members in the Corner-payin g attention to the farmer and the grazier. Let us by all means have a general and a generous expansion of this principle of Socialism. I want State-aided boots in Batman, for one thing. Boots are dear, and many of my electors are in need of them. I propose now, as I have before, that the Government favourably consider the suggestion made by me to form a boot manufacturing company in the district of Batman, which will be able to come with confidence to the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) for support, with the object of producing good and cheap boots for the people of Australia, and especially those in the electorate of Batman, which I represent. I criticised a similar measure upon these lines. I congratulated the - Country party originally, and remarked then, as I now remark, that it is a somewhat unpleasant and sinister aspect of our political activities today when a Nationalist Ministry, so opposed to anything in the nature of State Socialism, should turn to the Country party when they ask for assistance in a local industry, and say this company is designed to assist the primary producers and make the land blossom like the rose, as contemplated by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) when discussing the Tariff'proposals. The Government consider that they must give the proposal support because it has been brought forward by the Country party, and it has now been made the policy of the Nationalist party.

142,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.18] - I think I can give the honourable member„ the information he desires. The spirit""used in pharmaceutical preparations is dealt with in the Excise rates, and I propose when we reach them to meet to some extent the honourable member's views. I have been looking into the question for some time, and desire to do something on the lines which my honourable friend suggests when we come to the Excise Tariff. We must, however, have regard to the duty resting upon us to protect the revenue, and to prevent the spirit being used for other than pharmaceutical purposes. Item, as amended, agreed to.

143,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"Dampier) [2.22] - I wish to ascertain from the Minister (Mr. Greene) the reason for the extraordinary increase of duties proposed in this case. There is an enormous increase in the Tariff on everything used in connection with the preparation of medicines, serums, and vaccines. These increases will be felt by all who are troubled with illness, and will be an enormous tax on hospitals. Will the Minister state why the provision in the old Tariff for the free admission of denatured spirit under departmental by-laws has been dropped?",34
144,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.23] - Amyli c alcohol and fusel oil are by-products of the distillation of Bpirit. Amylic alcohol is made from fusel oil by a process of distillation, ind both are used in the manufacture of paints, varnishes, lacquers, and so on. The Australian requirements can be met by the by-products of the local distilleries. The provision in previous Tariffs for the free admission of amylic alcohol and fusel oil when denatured has been omitted, and an item inserted in the Excise Tariff providing for their free delivery where denatured. There are no importations of the denatured article. That, I think, gets over the difficulty raised by the honourable member in the latter part of his speech.",34
145,Mr GBEGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"If the item does not refer to anything used in medicinal preparations, I have nothing more to say with regard to it. Item agreed to. Item 5Collodion, per gallon, British, 5s.; intermediate, 6s. 6d.; general, 7s. 6d.",34
146,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"Dampier) [2.27] I intend to move a reduction of the duties for which this item provides. In respect of collodion, which I understand is only used medicinally, honourable members will find that the former duty of 3s'. per gallon, has been increased to 5s. per gallon. The Government, having established a laboratory here, are endeavouring apparently to protect that laboratory by increasing the duties on medicines, and indeed everything that is required in cases of sickness, and everything that is required in.hospitals, whose expenditure must then be greatly increased. Is it not desirable that the best of patent medicines should be allowed to come in, I do not say free of duty, but without being subjected to an unreasonable impost? Medical men urge that we must have of the best, and in the interests of the health of the people it is desirable that medicinal preparations should not be too expensive. Since the establishment of Government laboratories the duties in relation to vaccine serums, ore., have been enormously increased'. In one case, the increase amounts to over 9.000 per cent. There can be no reason for such additional imposts, unless the Government are anxious to show by the imposition of such duties that a Government laboratory is worth having. I move That the item be amended by the insertion after ""5s."" of the words, ""and on and after 14th May, 1921, 3s.""",34
147,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Eichmond-Minister ' for Trade and Customs) [ 2 . 2 9 ] - I hope the Committee will not' agree, to this amendment. It is true that collodion'is used as a dressing after surgical operations; but I think it will be admitted that the quantity so employed is so small that the actual increased cost to the patient, as represented by this duty, will be almost infinitesimal. It is.very.desirable that collodion should be manrxfactured locally. It has important uses in the surgical treatment' of wounds. Prior to the war, practically all the collodion used in Australia was imported, and 75 per cent, of our importations came from Germany. ' When the war"" came-down on us, and' the source of sup^ ply, which wasalmost entirely German, was cut off, wecould not obtain any collodion, and it was not until local manufacturers came to our rescue at a very critical time that we were - able to secure a supply. The rate of duty proposed is, I think, about 35 per cent, on what we may consider the normal value of collodion. That, in my opinion, is not an excessive duty. I do not think it would, as the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) suggests, represent any materially increased cost _ to even the poorest In view of the circumstances, and of our experience during the war, in regard to this particular chemical', I suggest that the duty proposed is only fair and reasonable.",35
148,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,I was not speaking so much of' collodion as of the general requirements of hospitals.,35
149,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,What is the total value of the amount imported ?,35
150,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"The importations in the year 1913, the year immediately before the war. were 314 gallons. By 1916 they had fallen ,to 89 gallons, and in the year 1917, when, the war was at its height, they, were 26 gallons. Honourable members will see to what an extent the local manufacturers, who took up the manufacture of this article at a critical time, as was the case in regard to a good many other things, came to our rescue. I have not heard from any source any complaint as to the quality of the collodion supplied locally, but 1,-have had from - more than one source excellent testimonials.",35
151,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,Generally there have been complaints about the extremely high cost.,35
152,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,I do not think I have had any protest at all about collodion.,35
153,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,I am not referring specially to collodion.,35
154,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,I must say I have had complaints about other articles.  lodion is produced locally?,35
155,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"We took charge of practically the whole requirements of Australia during the war, and no doubt those now manufacturing can supply those requirements.

156,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Richmond-Minister for Trades and Customs) [ 2 . 3 4 ] - I shall be glad if the Committee will consent to postpone this item for the time being. Representations have recently been made to me that it is advisable to divide this item, putting wood naphtha and methyl alcohol in one class and acetone in another,, forreasons that are highly technical. I shall be glad to have an opperson. portunity to look into the matter.",35
157,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,Why not pass the item and recommit it subsequently?,35
158,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"If the Committeeis prepared to do that I have no objections. - Mr FOLEY (Kalgoorlie) [2.35] - My own desire is that this item should be postponed, not passed and then re-committed. In Western Australia naphtha has been for some time past, and is now, being produced fro m the pith of the blackboy and other trees in that State which are a pest, so that there is no question of denuding the forests. The proprietors of the process contend that they produce a spirit equal to any that can be imported or manufactured by a like process from wood. They propose to give me some technical information, which I should like to place before the Committee before the item is finally dealt with . Mr ^GREENE ''Richmond-Minister for Traae and Customs') [2.36] - It is be^ cause of my wish to help those people in Western Australia that I ask the Committee to postpone the item. I understand that it is very desirable that this industry shall be full y protected, and believe that by doing what I propose can secure better protection for an in dustry which is using up absolutely waste material. However, if the Gommittee Perfumed Spirits",35
159,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.37] - I move That the item be further amended by adding the following words:- "" And on and after 14th May, 1921, per gallon, British, 40s.; intermediate, 45s.; general, 50s.; or ad val., British, 20 per cent.; intermediate, 25 per cent.; general, 30 per cent., whichever rate returns the higher duty. The effect of this amendment is to. give a slightly increased duty on the lower grades of perfumed spirits, while reducing the duties on the higher grades. found, after some experience of the working of this Tariff, that the ad valorem duty pressed unnecessarily heavily on the high grades of perfumed spirits, which are not manufactured in this country, with the result that, in all probability, we were losing revenue. As I say, the higher grades of these spirits are not manufactured to any extent in Australia, while the lower grades are made very extensively. The re-arrangement of the item is with a view to protecting the lower class of manufacture in this count r y ; and I believe that in regard to the higher grades the duties will lead to a greater consumption, and, consequently, more revenue. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. . Item 9 (Spirituous preparations).",36

162,Mr BAYLE Y,COMMONWEALT H,".Oxley) [ 2 . 4 2 ] - I suggest that the Afinister review his decision in regard to this item, and that an additional Is. per lb. be placed on the imported article; and then, so as to still further assist the local grower of tobacco, the Excise duty be reduced^ by 4d.",36
163,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.43] - If the question of the protection of the local industry. is to be, as it must, adjusted by the balance between the Excise and import duty the time to raise the question is on the Excise, provided the Committee agree to the import duties now before them. When we come to fix the degree of Protection to be given to the local grower of tobacco by a reduction or an increase, as the case may be, of the Excise, honourable members will be able to increase or decrease the Protection.",36
164,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H,"A r e you not interested in the revenue 1 If so, this is the time and place to take action.",36
165,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"If we desire more revenue we can, of course, increase the duty and leave the Excise as at present. ""We are now - dealing with unmanufactured tobacco; and we have so far been satisfied with the revenue from this source. Generally speaking, I think the growers are well satisfied with the Protection given; at all events I have had no request from them for an increase of duty.",36
166,Mr BAYLE Y,COMMONWEALT H,"Oxley) [2.45] - Prio r to September, 1918, the position was that the Excise duty on Australian-grown tobacco amounted to Is. per l b . , while the import duty on foreign-grown tobacco was 3s. per lb - a preference in favour of the local article amounting to 200 per cent. To-day we find that the Australian grown tobacco is affected by Excise duty to the extent of 2s. 4d. per l b . , whereas the foreign-grown article pays an import duty of 4s. 4d. There is still a difference of 2s., but the degree of protection has decreased from 200 per cent, in 1918 to 85^ per cent, today.",37
167,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H,"When the honourable member says 200 per cent., he means as between the two duties, and not on the cost of the article.",37
168,Mr BAYLEY,COMMONWEALT H,Yes .,37
169,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALT H,"That is the vital point; there is the same 2s. difference. , Mr BAYLEY - But when we conthe sider that both duties have been increased we perceive that the amount of protecthen tion given to the Australian article is insufficient. I ask the Minister view both the import and excise duties on tobacco.",37
170,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.47] - Thi a fixed duty at so much per pound. We tured. have endeavoured to leave the margin as between the two imposts-and this refers all round-exactl y the same. is to say, the amount of 2s. protection remains; and it is that in which the for their money. grower is interested. It is not the amount of import and excise duty collected. does not matter to what extent we may raise both the excise and the import duty. So long as we leave the margin per pound exactly the same, we leave the measure of protection precisely the same.",37
171,Mr BAYLE Y,COMMONWEALT H,"Oxley) [2.48] - When tionist. a pound of tobacco has been cut up and put into the ordinary commercial 2 oz. package, the 2s. per pound difference tween the imported and the locally-grown whole of the Tariff. article becomes so slight that the majority of smokers will not purchase the Australian-grown leaf. No one will claim that the latter is as good as the imported article, and the difference in price is so small that the smoking public prefers to pay a little more to get the better tobacco. If the Minister could see his way clear to make the difference sufficiently marked, many buyers, with the object of saving a few pence on each package purchased, would smoke the Australian-grown tobacco and thus give greater encouragement to the local grower.",37
172,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Maranoa) [2.49]. - I perceive what the honourable member for Oxley desires, but the Minister is evading the question. The honourable member desires the Minister to lower the excise on the locally-grown tobacco and increase the duty on the foreign leaf in order to make the growing of the Australian article more attractive. It is all very well to say that the revenue is satis2s. factory as the margin between the two collections stands today; but someone else besides the revenue collector needs to be satisfied. The town of Texas, in a corner of the Maranoa district, is a big tobacco growing centre. At one time the manufacturers in Australia refused to take tobacco from tbese growers, and only by extreme pressure on the part of the Minister for Customs by means of a threat to reduce the excise and increase to rethe import duty, were the Australian manufacturers brought to their senses. In the Bowen district there is grown a good cigar leaf ; the leaf grown at Texas s is is a very good tobacco when manufacAs the honourable member for Oxley has pointed out, smokers would not buy the locally-grown tobacco alone That but preferred to have it mixed with still American leaf, thus getting good value The grower here should have a fair measure of protection. It The difference of 2s. per pound means practically nothing by the time a pound of tobacco is put up in 2-oz. packages.",37
173,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.52] - No one can accuse me of not being a ProtecNo one desires more ardently than I do to see Australian industries carried on successfully. But this is one beof the highest protective duties in tha In 1918-19 t&a average price of unmanufactured tobacco, imported, . was 2s. per pound. The duty .represented 100 .per cent. When the tobacco market higher than during many previous years, namely, in 1919-20, the average price of imported tobacco was 3s. per pound, and, consequently, the duty was 66$ per cent. To-day it is very close to 100 per oent. I do not feel justified in going for a further measure of protection in this regard. Item agreed to. Item 20 (Tobacco,, cut, n.e.i.); item 21 (Tobacco, manufactured, n.e.i.) ; item 22 (Cigarettes); and item 23 (Tobacco, unmanufactured); agreed to. Item 24 (Cigars). .",37
174,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"Dampier) [2.55] In connection with this item there has been much correspondence in the press, having for its basis the price of cigars and the matter of relief being afforded to the local manufacturer in respect of Excise duty. I do not propose to raise the question of Excise at this stage. I am one of those who believe that, in treating a luxury of any sort in these times, it does not matter how high a Tariff is placed thereon. If I purchase a cigaras I do- I am prepared to pay highly for that luxury. But I have a great objection to the Minister giving Protection to a phase of industry which could only live under a great deal of nurturing. It would pay the country far better to award pensions to all persons employed here in the manufacture of cigars. We raise a great cry about having to compete against Hack labour; but all the time we are wanting tobacco grown by black labour. I wish to know if there is any proposal to increase the duty upon cigars.",38
175,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.56] - I do not propose at present to increase the duty on cigars. The question which the honourable member has raised will come up more particularly in the discussion of Excise duties. He will have his opportunity to suggest that the Excise be increased, which would secure his objective. Item agreed to. Item 25 (SnufT) agreed to. Item 26Tobacco destroyed .for manufacture of wash or other purposes, as prescribed by departmental by-laws-free .",38
176,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"Dampier) [2.57] Does tobacco which is used as an insecticide come within this provision? If so, went it will affect the manufacture of sheepwash. I wish to know, also, if a preparation known as "" Black leaf 40"" comes under this item? When the Committee is dealing with, the specific item of arsenate of lead, and with similar preparations affecting the fruit industry, I desire special consideration to be given thereto. Wo cannot afford to imperil the. prospects of our Australian orehardists merely for the purpose of placing high duties on such things as arsenate of lead. I would also point out at this stag* that when the first Commonwealth Tariff was framed there was in the schedule a list of free articles, which, showed precisely and emphatically what was free. I do not wish to bring up the question of the powers assumed' by Ministers of Customs in the past, but at a later stage I desire to thresh out the question whether this Tariff, as framed by the Parliament, is to be the Tariff of Australia, or whether the Minister shall have authority to alter the schedule in any manner he may wish. I call attention to the phrase, "" as prescribed by departmentalby-laws."" Will ""Black leaf 4 0"" come within this provision ? And will the Minister give serious consideration to making provision in the schedule to assure the public that certain articles which Parliament says shall be free shall continue to be free-n o matter what any Minister may say or do?",38
177,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.0] - If "" Black leaf 40"" were manufactured in this country it would be possible, under this item, to allow ""tobacco destroyed for manufacture of sheep-wash or other purposes, as prescribed by departmental by-laws"" to be used for its manufacture; and, no doubt, if any one were to undertake the manufacture of "" Black leaf 40 "" in the Commonwealth, he would be able - to obtain such tobacco free-of duty. Undamaged tobacco leaf is subject to duty. But if , as has happened on several occasions, a shipment has arrived in Australia so damaged that it cannot be used for the manufacture of smoking tobacco, we sheepcan, under Departmental by-law, allow it to be used for the' manufacture of sheep wash or other things for which it is suitable. We do not specify all the uses to which tobacco can be put, because we do not know them. So long as we are satisfied that damaged tobacco will not be used for human consumption, we permit it to po into manufacture.",38
178,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALT H,At the present time there is aduty on tobacco leaf.,39
179,Mr GEEENE,COMMONWEALT H,Yes .,39
180,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALT H,Do you propose to give us an opportunity to consider that duty when we come to insecticides ?,39
181,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,Yes .,39
182,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Maranoa) [3.3]. - I have been a member of Parliament during the consideration of every Tariff that has been introduced since the inception of Federation, and it has been my experience that the Departmental interpretation of items is often entirely different from the intentions of Parliament. Therefore, it has been my earnest desire to make the duties as jjlennite as possible, so that there may be'ho opportunity for an alteration of meaning by a Departmental interpretation. If honourable members wish to have this particular tobacco made free, they should move in that direction now.",39
183,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"Dampier) [3.4] - I wish to make sure that, in taking action, we shall not leave it open to persons to use free tobacco for the manufacture of articles other than insecticides.",39
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"When we come to insecticides,, of which "" Black' leaf 40 "" is one, the honourable member can deal with the inatter as he pleases. We cannot mention ""Black leaf 40"" specifically in the Tariff, because that is a trade name.",39
185,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"I do not know sufficient of the subject to be certain of the effect of striking out the words "" as prescribed by Departmental by-laws.""",39
186,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"If you did that, would have to enumerate all the uses of raw tobacco.",39
187,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"It would make tobacco for manufacturing sheepwash free, but might open the door too wide.",39
188,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,Maranoa) [3.5]. - The pastoral industry is greatly interested in insecticides. r>,39
189,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,So is the agricultural and nearly every other industry.,39
190,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Ite m 269 makes sheep, cattle, and horse washes, in liquid or powder form, dutiable at 20 per cent. British and intermediate, and 30 per' cent, general. What we wish to make free is dutiable.",39
191,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,We can discuss the matter when we come to deal with insecticides.,39
192,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"What the honourable member for Dampier desires is that materials imported for the manufacture of insecticides shall be free, and tobacco is one of those materials.",39
193,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,We are giving the makers of these things tobacco free. The matter cannot be dealt with under this item.,39
194,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"I take the Minister's word for it. I know what the honourable member for Dampier wants, and I am with him. Item agreed to. DIVISION III . SUGAR. Item 27Glucose, per cwt., 8s.",39
195,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALT H,"Wide Bay) [3.8] - I ' hope that the Minister will increase the duty on glucose by an advance from 2s. to 4s. per cwt. This substance is largely used by brewers and in the making of sweets. It is produced from maize, and at Footscray is being made by the Maize Products Factory. . Those interested in that factory have had to spend a large sum of money on machinery, and naturally wish t) be protected against the dumping of American glucose.",39
196,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,Is not the proposed duty sufficiently high to prevent that ?,39
197,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALT H,"No . We are trying to encourage the growing of maize, an industry which, in Queensland and northern New South Wales in particular, will give occupation to a large number of returned soldiers and immigrants. The factory that I have mentioned has offered to purchase 20,000 you bags of maize a month from one part of my electorate, and will manufacture that maize into glucose and other things, such as starch, cornflour, oil, and calf food. An immense quantity of maize is grown in America, India, and South Africa, and more cheaply than we can grow it . We must protect our manufacturers from the dumping by America of glucose made from surplus maize. The Webb Act of 1918 makes legal the existence in the United States of America of Combines and Trusts formed to dump surplus products into foreign markets, thouorh ordinary Trusts and Combines are illegal in that country. Transport facilities are also given to enable products destined for export, either raw or in a manufactured"" state, to get to the seaboard cheaply. Dumping has, for a time, seriously affected the carbide making industry of Tasmania. It will be months before the stock of carbide that was dumped here is sufficiently diminished to allow of the Tasmanian product being sold again. We should not allow the dumping of glucose, following on a good maize season in America, to injure our glucose industry and maize farmers.",39
198,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALT H,"Melbourne) [3.13] I approve of the suggestion to increase the duty on glucose by 2s. The article is - largely used in the making of confectionery, among other things. Competition in the United States of America is supported with huge capital, and directeol by organized minds of the highest capacity. It creates a trade war as pitiless as auy nary war. A duty of 10s. per cwt. is only a little over Id. per lb. Australian confectionery will hold its own against the world. I have blindfolded individuals, and got them to taste the highest grade of European chocolates and the chocolates made by MACRobertson, and have found that they could not tell rhe difference between the two. The O i l Gold chocolate made by this Victorian firm is a line of which I can speak highly. I do not know of anything superior to it. If the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) will move an amendment in the direction he has suggested, I shall have much pleasure in supporting him.",40
199,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,"Wakefield) [3.15] - I intend to support the proposal of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), particularly in the direction of assisting in the production of maize. In times of scarcity the value of maize in the past has been as high as 5s. and 5s. 6d. per bushel, but on occasions the price has been as low as 2e. 9d. per bushel, at which figure it was absolutely unprofitable to grow it . However, the operations of the Maize Products Company have in recent years brought about marvellous developments in maize production. Dr MALONEY;-The company are prepared to guarantee to take all the maize they can get at 4s. 6d. per bushel.",40
200,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,"Stabilizin g maize at a price of 4s. 6d. per bushel would make its production a valuable industry for Australia. I understand that the Maize Products Company feel fairly secure in regard to all the products of maize they are turning out in their establishment, except in respect to glucose.",40
201,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALT H,What is the value of glucose ?,40
202,Mr GREENE,COMMONWEALT H,At 5s. per bushel for maize the bare cost of manufacturing it is about £32 per ton in Australia.,40
203,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMMONWEALT H,"I understand the company have just got down to the bed-rock cost at which they can operate without loss. But while their operations are considerable for a new industry, and for a new country, they are a mere flea-bite when compared with the extent to which glucose is manufactured in America. We have an overwhelming market for the various products of maize - ther e are six turned out by this company-and if further assistance in the manufacture of glucose will assist an imordi- portant local industry, we ought to give it. Mr MASSYGREENE ""(Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.20] - When I adjusted this schedule I left the Division, Sugar, severely alone, and, of course, glucose is included in that division. I am aware that it is a product largely manufactured from maize, but, nevertheless, glucose is the raw material for other industries. For instance, makers of confectionery use a great deal of it . However, I feel inclined to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Wide Bay to increase the duty on glucose, particularly in view of the fact that the Americans are beginning to dump 'it into Australia at a price which will have a very prejudicial effect on a local industry, which, by absorbing large quantities of a primary product, is most valuable to the primary producers of Australia, particularly the small farmers situated in coastal areas.  the price of the maize at the factory, so that the small 'farmer will get some advantage ?",40
204,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALT H,"This company has already offered to take 20,000 bags of maize per month from a portion of my electorate ",40
205,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"It is impossible for UB to do what the honourable member for Swan has suggested; but as there is more than one manufacturer, and as others besides these factories are users of maize, the people to whom the honourable member refers will have no opportunity of rigging the market. Competition will compel them to pay the market price. At the same time the factories are very useful to the primary producers when there is a big surplus of maize, because they take vast quantities which otherwise could not be absorbed. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) knows very well the extent to which small farmers in New South Wales grow maize. farmers in Queensland and Victoria also grow it extensively, and although it may not be cultivated much in Western Australia, nevertheless it is a very valuable product of the soil. I move That the item he amended by adding the following:- "" And on and after 14th May, 1921, per. owt., British, 12s.; intermediate, 12s.; general, 12B.""",40
206,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"Dampier) [3.24] I quite realise the value of building up r an industry, and I can quite appreciate the Minister's argument which will , no doubt, be brought forward again when we are dealing with the duty on agricultural machinery, but, nevertheless, seeing that the duty on glucose is now 8s. per cwt., it seems a most extraordinary procedure to increase it by 50 per cent. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. It e m 28Sugar, the produce of sugar-cane, peT cwt., 8s.",41
207,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,Dampier) [3.26] I would like to know whether at the present time the Minister is allowing rebate upon sugar used in the preparation of confectionery exported from Australia.,41
208,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALT H,And in the manufacture of^jams.,41
209,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,"The point I wish make is that tens of thousands of acres of land have been laid out for f r u i ture upon which thousands of soldiers have settled. It is possible that within few years the production of f r u it i tralia will be so enormous that it will necessary for us to do all we possibly to build up a big export trade in jams and preserved fruits. Nothing could be superior to the preserved f r u it I saw at about £ 8 per ton. Shepparton the other day. I want to know if the Minister has considered question of allowing a rebate of duty the sugar employed in the manufacture jam or the preservation of f r u it f port, and whether at the present time rebate is not given to the manufacture confectionery exported fro m Australia [344] to firms like Swallow and Ariell , who use large quantities of sugar in the manufacture of the commodities they export.",41
210,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.28] - I had better set out the whole position, so that there may be no misunderstanding hereafter. Under normal conditions when there are no such things as sugar agreeSmall ments, and so forth , sugar is imported and then used in the manufacture of jams or for canning fruits for export. A rebate of duty is allowed on this imported sugar to the full extent of the quantity so used. There is a system by which the Customs authorities arrive at the amount of sugar contained in jams and preserved fruits. Where sugar is exported in the for m of jam or canned fruits, a rebate is allowed upon the full amount of it so used. We have never had a series of years when the Australian production' of sugar has been equal to the local consumption. There has always been a certain amount of importation.",41
211,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALT H,It does not necessarily follow - that the manufacturers who sesure a rebate have used nothing but imported sugar.,41
212,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,No .,41
213,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALT H,But you do not allow a rebate to the extent of more than the importation.,41
214,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALT H,"The quantity upon which a rebate has been allowed has never yet come up to the amount , of sugar imany ported. During the. war definite agreements were in force under which the Commonwealth purchased sugar and supplied it to the jam manufacturers and f r u it preservers. Speaking from memory, I to think we sold sugar to them for export purposes over a period of thr.ee yeaTs, t cularriving at the quantity used in this way in exactly the same way as we arrived at a the quantity of imported sugar used' in n Ausprevious years.

Quite a number of men e on the land in New South Wales and are growing millet, But they find it difficult to carry ou because of the competition of the inferior Italian production.' Millet is grown on the Lower are Hunter, the Manning, and Richmond For Rivers, as well as at Yanco and Tamworth. A good deal is grown in my own electorate.",43
233,Mr CORSER,COMMONWEALT H,And also in Queensland.,43
234,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALT H,"^-Yes. The duty is only 4s. per central. That protection is insufficient, and growers have written to me stating that with sufh a duty it is impossible to profitably carry on. The Japanese are sending in, for broommaking purposes, an inferior millet which is being largely.used. I have two letters, which I shall read to the Committee, in order to show that our farmers arc dissatisfied with the present duty. Here is one written by Mr. Cunningham on behalf of the farmers of Nelson Plains, shortly after the Tariff schedule was laid on the tableDear Mr Charlton,- I am directed by the Nelson Plains Progress Association to ask you to urge upon the Minister for Customs the necessity of raising the Tariff on imported broom millet in order to save an Australian industry from absolute extinction. We understand that the Tariff will be dealt with immediately Parliament reassembles, and would respectfully urge that you use your best endeavours to have the Tariff raised at least fourfold. As you are not, perhaps, familiar with the subject, I will try briefly to make the matter plain to you. The areas in which broom millet is grown in New South Wales are the Lower Hunter, and Manning and Eichmond Rivers on the coast, and smaller quantities inland at Yanco and Tamworth districts. The amount grown in these districts is quite sufficent to supply Australia and New Zealand in any season, and consequently there is no need to import any from outside. At the present time millet is quoted at £50 per ton of 2,000 lbs. in Sydney, but very little is being sold for that, the average price being from £30 to £40, which is altogether too low a price to pay farmers at the present high cost of living. This low range of prices has been brought about by the action of the manufacturers and speculators forming a ring and importing, to date. 120 tons-from Italy, although there are ample stocks of Australian millet awaiting sale in all the millet-growing districts. Last year they succeeded in inducing the Federal Government to place an embargo on the exportation of millet to New Zealand, although then, as now, there were ample stocks to supply both countries, and this action was taken without consulting the growers, who were certainly entitled to have a say in the matter. To show you how the manufacturers score at the expense of the growers-The price of millet is no better, or hardly as good, as before the war, when you could buy a broom-retail-in any shop in the State for Is. 6d., whereas at the present time brooms range from 3s. Od. to 4s., and the cost of production to the grower has gone up 200. per cent. Trusting you will do your best in this matter, P.S - If you require any further facts or figures in this matter'I shall be happy to furnish them - M.C . Most honourable members are familiar with this district, where a great deal of millet is grown. I have also a letter from a resident of Miller's Forest, where probably more millet is grown than in any other part of New South WalesDear Mr Charlton,-On behalf of the farmers of the Hunter Valley I wish to draw your attention with a view of having it placed before the Federal authorities of the treatment meted out to the millet-growers of this locality, as to importations of millet from other countries. Owing to the cost of labour, the price paid for the cultivation, raising, and cutting of this crop was nearly 100 per cent, more this season than in past years, and when the first millet was harvested, as early as December last, the price offered for this millet was £80 per ton at the shed. This is just a payable price, and nothing more. A few weeks later what do we find ? The "" profiteers "" have got their heads together, and today we are very lucky if we can get £40 per ton for it at the shed. Do you not consider this an injustice, and on top of this the Federal Government is allowing foreign countries to simply flood the country with so-called Italian millet. Is this a fair go? The past seasons may have been good to some farmers, but others have simply to depend upon this crop to meet their rents, &c, and what is to become of the poor struggling farmer when, on the 1st of July this year, he has to sacrifice his crop for the paltry sum of £40 per ton when it costs him nearly £30 per ton to raise same* We consider it a grave injustice, and I think you would earn the esteem and appreciation of all the millet-growers in New South Wales if you would ventilate this matter on the floor of the House. What we want is to get the Tariff increased, and an inquiry made into this matter. Hoping to ,hear from you in the course of a few weeks, Mr Charlton. I ask the Minister to increase the duty on this item. It is far too small at present.",43
235,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALT H,What do you suggest should be the amount?,44
236,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALT H,"It should be sufficient to prevent effective competition by the inferior stuff from overseas, which threatens to kill the millet-growing industry in Australia. Manufacturers get hold of it, use it for the trade, and then they charge the very highest prices for the product as if it were Australian millet.",44
237,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALT H,"The Japanese product is killing the local industry. Yours respectfully, Mr Charlton - The "" honourable M. CUNNINGHAM. member for East Sydney (Mr West) has just told me that the manufacturers mix this inferior stuff at the factories, but the fact remains that our farmers are growing enough millet for the whole of the Australian and New Zealand requirements.",44
238,Mr HILL,COMMONWEALT H,"Echuca) [3.54] - I have much pleasure in supporting the remarks made by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton). I have rather intimate knowledge of the conditions under which millet is grown in the northeastern districts of Victoria, an'd recently I introduced a deputation to the Minister for Customs asking for a higher duty in this schedule. The gentlemen who comprised the deputation furnished me with a number of facts which I should like to place before the Committee. They are to the point, and tell us just what the growers want. The growers sayBroom millet is grown in Victoria principally in the valleys of the King and Ovens Rivers in the north-eastern part of the State, and in New South Wales in the Hunter River district and similar country. The output annually averages 250 tons in ""Victoria, and 550 tons in New South Wales, of fibre. The land most suitable for its cultivation ' is a rich alluvial loam. The cultivation method usually adopted is to plough the ground as soon as conditions permit after winter,' harrow twice, then subsequently either plough a second time or utilize a cultivator, and again harrow to produce a fine tilth before seeding. Seed is sown by drilling as soon as warm weather sets iii, say, from the middle of October to the middle of December, in rows 30 inches apart. It is usual to fertilize with superphosphate during growth of crop, and cultivation between the rows is carried on in order to retain moisture and capillarity, and develop root growth. The harvesting of fibre commences when seed heads begin to ripen, and is done by manual A. J. O'BBDSN, Secretary. labour. The plants are bent down,"" and the man cutting, using a sharp knife, cuts through the stalk about 4 inches down from the fibre, the object of retaining the short length of stalk being for convenience sake in subsequent handling. The fibre is laid down on the prostrated plantsto dry until carted in, in small sheaves, to the drying sheds, where it is spread out until completely cured. It is then ready to be threshed. Threshing is accomplished by a crew of seven or eight men. It consists of holding the fibre in handfuls on a spiked roller which is revolved at high speed, and tears off all seeds from fibre. The roller machine is generally worked by means of an internal combustion engine of from 4 to 5 BHP. When threshing is completed the fibre is compressed into bales, wired round, and ts then ready to despatch to factory, where it is made up into ' the linished broom. The - cost of production is estimated as follows:-Assumin g it to be a good crop of broom, and basing its yield at 1 ton of threshed fibre to 3 acres, which is above the average on Government Statistician's figures, the production costs on lowest possible estimate are :Rent of land, per acre .. Ploughing 15s., cultivating 10s., seeding 5s., manuring 5s. Cutting crop,- employees 15s. per day, or contract price per acre Carting into shed, threshing fibre, engine hire, baling, wiring, and carting per ton cost £7 10s., equals per acre .. .. .. Total per acre . . added to which are railage, commission, storage, and handling charges, and cost of production to growers wil l amount to £25 or £26. This is the estimate of a good crop; but on reviewing figures supplied by Statists of Victoria and New South Wales, it was found that over the triennial period of 1917-1919, the yield was 5 cwt., 5 cwt., and 24 cwt. respectively, and with prices fluctuating from £28 to £71 per ton, and averaging throughout £49 per ton, the gross return to the grower amounted to £9 8s. I d . per acre per annum, which, on estimate of aost, left little margin over expenses involved. The work of growing and harvesting broom is mostly done by settlers on small holdings, assisted by their families or hired labour. Of the total cost of production, i.e., £25 per ton, rather more than four-fifths is paid out for This labour alone, and estimating the yield of the fibre' in the K i ng Valley this season tons, it means that £4,000 is spent during season amongst the workers engaged, gum is of considerable importance to them in making up a living wage. The work is of an exacting nature, and fills all hours light. It has been found that fibre has been imsuitable ported from overseas, principally It a l Japan, at as low a cost as £11 per ton landed, and this season at about £32. The existing Tariff is £4 per ton, but the producers are strongly of opinion that to afford some measure of protection and security a duty of not less l than £14 per ton should be imposed. It recognised that a price lower than £40 per ton Is hardly remunerative to the grower. It is pointed out in this connection that when instituting inquiries into the manufacturing processes and costs, it was confidentially stated by a manufacturer that factory costs when the price of fibre was £70 per ton were about 2s. per broom, made up as:-Cost of fibre, at £70 per ton, Is. 2d.; cost of handles, wire, varnish, and making broom, 6d.; overhead factory charges, 4d.; total, 2s. These' figures were given when cost of material was at high war-time level, and, pursuing the inquiries further, it was found the retail price to the consumer averaged 5s. per broom, so that cost of distribution amounted to more than primary and manufacturing costs combined. It will be seen that for every £10 per ton paid to growers for fibre, the cost of fibre in each broom would be 2d., in other words, at £40 per ton fibre, per broom 8d.; at £i>0, 10d.; at £60, Is., and so on, which is proportionallylow to cost of broom. to ultimate consumer. Should the growers be denied this necessary protection, it will mean the practical extermi£ «. d. nation of an industry of value to the country.. . . 1 0 0 All the fibre consumed can readily be grown* within Australia without recourse to imported, . . 1 15 0 cheap labour stuff. It is an industry' essentially adapted to small settlers, or settlers' sons,, . . 2 5 0 to give continuity of employment throughout the year. During a recent tour of the King Valley, it was found that several repatriated soldiers had . . 2 10 0 grown fibre either on shares or on their holdings. The crops generally were good, but . . 7 10 0 settlers were dispirited as to prices likely to beobtainable, and felt themselves to be unfairly:' at the mercy of the Associated Manufacturers, who depress the market at will, assisted to that end mainly by the low Tariff on importations.

241,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALT H,"Fremantle) [4.5]. - In the Argus this morning there is a report ef a speech by the honourable member for Cowper and the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) delivered at a meeting of country press delegates in this city. The report contains the following:Dr Earle Page said that during the last three years £60,000,000 had been practically squandered in repatriation. In several years he did not suppose there would be more than £3.000,000 or £4,000,000 worth of tangible assets. At the present time we hear a great deal about economy; but I think that honourable members who have knowledge of the facts connected with the various repatriation schemes of the Government ought to make their meaning quite clear when they' speak of the. squandering of £60,000,000. I am not prepared to admit for one moment that this money has been squandered. Of course, in connection with repatriation, as in other matters, errors of judgment may have been made. It is not to be expected that we can place 300,000 men in the industries of the country without errors, or a certain amount of overlapping between Commonwealth and State. But to say that the whole of the money to be expended has been squandered is to use language not justified by the actual facts. I should like to ask the Leader of the Country party whether he is correctly reported, because I do not wish to belabour hin> unnecessarily or unduly.",46
242,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,COMMONWEALT H,He has been reported to the same effect on another occasion.,46
243,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALT H,"W it h o u t desiring to initiate a debate on the-whole administration of the Repatriation Department, I think that the honourable member should say exactly what he meant when he referred in this sweeping way to the squandering of public money.",46
244,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,The honourable member has made the same statement in the House.,46
245,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALT H,"The Leader of the Country party is further reportedIn several years he did not suppose there wonld be ' more than £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 worth of tangible assets. pro- Mr JAMES PAGE - I am of that opinion.",46
246,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALT H,"The honourable member is entitled to his opinion, just as I claim to be entitled to mine.",46
247,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,Is the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) not entitled to his opinion?,46
248,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALT H,"Of course, but honourable members here have serious responsibilities, and should be able to give facts when they make such statements as are attributed to the honourable member.",46
249,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,Do you thin k we shall get all that money owing for the War Service Homes ?,46
250,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALT H,U p to date the percentage of men who have failed is remarkably small- I doubt if it is 1 per cent.,46
251,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"That is all right, but we have a long way to go yet.",46
252,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALT H,"The transfer of War Service Homes is confined entirely to returned soldiers, and I am not prepared to allow them to be maligned in this way.",46
253,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,They cannot pay the money.,47
254,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALT H,I must say that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr . James Page) has always beeu sympathetic towards the returned men.,47
255,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Quite so, know that it is impossible for them to. repay this money.",47
256,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALT H,"I disagree with the honourable member; and again there is a conflict of opinion. However, I wish to know whether the honourable member for Cowper is correctly reported in the Argus, and, further, I would like the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Rodgers) to give the facts, so that they may be placed on record in juxtaposition to the statements of the honourable member.",47
257,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALT H,"Wannon-Assistant Minister for Repatriation) [4.10] - I not surprised, in the case of a statement of this character made by a leader of a party in the House, that the first opporof tunity should be seized by-the honourable member for Premantle (Mr Burchell), himself a returned soldier, to bring i under the notice of the House and of the country. It is to me a most astounding statement, and I had expected a flat nial from the honourable member for per (Dr Earle Page), not so much of the general sweeping' statements, but of the figures attributed to him. . The matter the acquisition of their homes. was today brought under my notice by honourable the honourable member for Fremantle, and I shall read the statement attributed the honourable member for CowperDr Earle Page said that during the last three years £60,000,000 had been practically squandered in repatriation. In several years fie did not suppose there would be more than £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 worth of tangible assets. The reason was that we had not » post-war programme ready, simply because the city press was predominant over the country press. I am not concerned about the latter son, but I am concerned as to the effect such a statement will have on those do not possess a personal or close knowmarkets ledge of the facts.. I speak of those outtions, side of Australia, as well as those who have great financial responsibilities in ever known. this country. For the information of honourable member for Cowper, I wish to say that the expenditure up to date selves amounts to £79,790,701. The following table shows the details: REPATRIATION BENEFITS TO EX-AUSTBALIAN IMPERIAL FOKCE MEN. Expenditure by the Commonwealth Government in connection with repatriation up to 31st March, 1920, is as follows:1. Oeneral Benefits.

Some 16,000 houses have been built or are in course of construction, and of the de- £10,970,903 expended I am pleased to Cowsay that up to date over £800,000 has been, repaid by. the soldiers, evidencing the appreciation with which they regard I invite members, notwithstanding press and public criticism outside, to make to an inspection of these soldiers' homes, which, I am sure, they will find are not deserving of the adverse criticism that is heard of them today. I do not seek at at this stage to justif y the whole administration in connection with War Service had Homes, nor do I think the Minister himself would desire to do so. There have been shortcomings; but it must be said, in justice, that the Commissioner fell on reabad times. He, just as did private builders who undertook extensive operawho tions, found himself up against short and harassing industrial condiaud, generally, the most difficult period of building activity Australia has Yet there are men going the round this country today who are more concerned in securing publicity for themthan in taking any true interest in the soldiers or the - welfare of their country. Instead of endeavouring to be of assistance and encouragement, they are denouncing every action of the Government in their endeavour to disparage our efforts to fulfil the nation's obligation to returned soldiers. It would be far more fitting if these persons were to offer common-sense advice rather than mischievous and self-aggrandizing criticism. responsible member of this House, and he the Leader of a party, to say that an expenditure of some £60,000,000 will be reduced to an abiding asset of only about £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 is a statement which no child would take notice of. Such a remark brings more denunciation upon its maker than upon those at whom his reckless and ill-considered accusations are aimed. Frankly, I do not understand the purpose of the honourable member. I am prepared to listen to and, if necessary, to combat any criticism of an honest and well-intended nature concerning any branch of administration with which I bave had to do. And I am certain that the Minister for Repatriation would be readily prepared to say the same for himself. I invite the honourable member to investigate the plight in which men with life-long experience in the building trade have been finding themselves. They have been metaphorically choked with dear material, and have been unable to sell it , or in any way, in fact, to get it out. The Commonwealth has certain stock in hand which has cost much money; but there is no trader of any magnitude in Australia who is not in a similar position. With respect to land settlement, I have pointed out that a sum of £25,000.000 has been spent in the acquisition of land. In that regard, the Commonwealth Government cannot accept the entire responsibility.",47
258,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,The Treasurer himself said the other day that there should have been some Commonwealth control.,48
259,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALT H,"Perhaps that is so. But a huge co-partnership was entered into between Commonwealth and States, in which the former undertook to find the money on loan, and the latter to find the land and generally administer and organize its settlement. Is the Commonwealth Government to be held entirely responsible for every purchase made by each State, and for every phase of activity in each State?",48
260,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Seeing that the Commonwealth Government found the money, they surely should have secured some control.",48
261,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALT H,"Perhaps the Government should have, exercised some closer form of supervision; but it would have been impossible to have overlapping control and clashing authority. I ask the For a honourable member not to be specially concerned with what is, after all, a passing phase of Australia's difficulties. I am one of those who believe that the bottom has not dropped out of the situation. I think I can see the elements of a great post-war revival throughout the world. The settlement of the reparations question with Germany may mean the inauguration of a great trade revival which will astonish the world. Our present troubles are an inevitable phase of the world's post-war crises. I repeat that the remarks of the honourable member for Cowper were not worthy of him and of his position.",48
262,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Cowper) |4-22""| The procedure adopted in connection with this matter was grossly unfair to myself, to my colleagues of the Country party, and to the House generally. It was not proper for a Government Whip, practically without notice and in the last hour of the week's proceedings, to bring forward a matter of this nature, or for the Miuister to make a reply such as he has done. To begin with, I repudiate the Minister's assertion that my statements have been made with any desire to secure personal notoriety. As for that matter, I invite the House and the public to judge between the Minister and myself concerning our respective war-time activities, and in the matter of our repatriation activities since the war. I also repudiate his statement that my utterances were either incorrect or ridiculous. I was substantially right when I remarked that, approximately, £60,000,000 had been spent upon repatriation generally, apart from pensions, and that within a few years there were likely to be only a few million pounds' worth of tangible assets left. In passing, I desire to mention that the newspaper reports of my remarks to the country press were condensed. I stated that the city press had always created public opinion in Australia, and that, by reason of that fact, matters had been permitted to go on to a degree which would never have been allowed had there been a provincial press strong enough to form a body of country opinion which could be reckoned with, and would expose some of the failures under its own notice. Regarding the statement that the monwealth Government are responsible for the position which exists today, I phasize that they are responsible for fact that, after having spent £79,000,000 upon our Returned soldiers they will very considerably short of that total sum - eve n if the best should happen-whe the day of settlement arrives. time in the history of Australia could huge an amount as £79,000,000 have been spent upon public developmental work with so little to show for it.",48
263,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALT H,What rot that is. Are war pensions and war gratuities or to be regarded as reproductive works?,49
264,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Knowin g that my time is limited, the honourable mempatriating ber is endeavouring to curtail ning interjections. In my opinion, this Government and Parliament stand condemned for the inadequacy of the proviauthorities sion which was made during the war for post-war reconstruction. The Government had a wonderful chance. But happened ? The men who went overseas fight for this country returned full of spirit and anxious to settle down to civil cations straight away. But, instead of beiug able to do so, some of them have been waiting more than eighteen months .to get upon the land. Their hearts have been broken, their hopes have been dashed, and today scores of soldiers only a few years ago were eager to fight for us, labour under a. definite sense grievance against the Government' of their own country.",49
265,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALT H,Are we responsible for delays in land settlement?,49
266,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Yes ; finding the money ought to give some control. mediately after Senator E. D . Millen became Minister for Repatriation, he admitted that the plan for repatriating soldiers would have to shape itself. It has done so. It has meandered all over the map, without taking any particular shape. It has resembled the world before the Creation, in that it has been ""withtralia out form and void.""",49
267,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALT H,The Creation turned out a pretty good job anyhow.,49
268,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Whils t we were doing nothing, every other country was all. [345] attempting to do something in regard to post-war reconstruction. In England, during 1916, a Minister for Reconstruct tion was appointed. The authorities there endeavoured to arrange that as Comsoon as the war was over, the machinery which had been brought into being for"" empurposes of destruction should be used for"" the purposes of reconstruction. I know that it is not a proper thing to depreciate be one's own country, and I do not indulge in those tactics. There is still plenty of n opportunity to redeem the past, and to At no achieve something worthwhile. I have so no desire to blacken the record of the Government. But I do say that the soldier is not getting a fair deal. Whether that statement upsets the Government or not, is a matter of indifference to me. But the men who fought for us a year two ago, today have a definite grievance against us. In Canada the authorities were making plans for rethe soldiers of that Dominion it by runiu the middle of 1917.",49
269,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALT H,The Canadian have not done half as much in period that direction as we have done.,49

But here delays have continually occurred. The Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) has said that we are not responsible for land settlement.",49

273,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALT H,Then why in the our name of mischief has he not done it?,49
274,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"He was desirous of settling the whole of his battalion in one area. After travelling through all the Dominions he did not choose Ausas the country in which to make that settlement, notwithstanding that he would have preferred to settle his men in this country because of its climate, if the thing could have been managed at",49
275,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALT H,He may live to sorry for his action.,50
276,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,He may. If we had a decent and comprehensive systern of repatriation or immigration he would be sorry.,50
277,Mr RODGEKS,COMMONWEALT H,We have already settled hundreds of ex-Imperial soldiers in Australia.,50
278,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALT H,"Is not the financial trouble at the bottom of all this? We have an obligation of £70,000,000 or £80,000,000 to meet in one or two years.",50
279,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"In New South Wales, Mr Ashford, Minister for Lands, has admitted that though he has resumed land at £10 and £11 per acre, he was willing to sell it to the soldiers per acre because it is not worth more.",50
280,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALT H,"That is a condemnation of his own Government, but not of this Government.",50
281,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Thus , in some cases, up to 50 per cent, of the value the resumed lands has departed. A good deal has been said in regard to the ments for War Service Homes. But the Commonwealth Surveyor-General admitted mitted the other day, in evidence, that too much land had been bought at boom prices, and one particular block was menin tioned, which had been purchased in Newtric castle, which was frequently 9 inches under water* during a good portion the year.",50
282,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALT H,That land was bought upon his recommendation.,50
283,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,I have seen Crown house after house built and bought which are already showing signs of disintegraconditions. tion and decay. To say that these houses will be worth even half of their present value twenty years hence is ridiculous.,50
284,Mr HEOTOR LAMOND,COMMONWEALT H,The honourable member has not had much experience real estate.,50
285,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"That may be tht honourable member's opiniom, but it is 1 ainly not the opinion of those ine intimately. Only last year the War Service Homes Commissioner purchased a New South Wales. saw-mill property in Queensland for £500,000. The statement bas been made that if the mill is kept working for years, and if timber maintains its price, the Department will make a siderable profit out of the transaction. But if that mill be worked at the present mier. be time, the Commonwealth will unquestionably sustain a loss upon it of many hundreds of thousands of pounds, in addition to the £500,000 which it cost. I make that statement deliberately, and I claim to know something about saw-mills.",50
286,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALT H,The answer to that statement is that the Commission which inquired into the matter held that the purchase was justified under the circum# £111063,50
287,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,Muc h of the money spent by the Repatriation Department has gone in the way of sustenance allowance simply because we had no comprehensive scheme of repatriation.,50
288,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALT H,The Department tried for £6 or £7 to make the men cadgers.,50
289,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"Many members of the local Repatriation Committees have had to pay money to our returned soldiers out of their own pockets merely because the methods adopted by the Department of were so slow. Yet the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) and myself payhave outlined comprehensive schemes of soldier settlement .which would have perthe utilization of large areas of Crown lands. In my own district, for an expenditure of £7,000,000or £8,000,000 railway construction and a hydro-elecscheme, with an additional £5,000,000 for resumption purposes, the Governof ment could have immediately added to 6,000,000 acres of land a capital value of at least £130,000,000, and this would have been a continually growing asset. Of this area 70 per cent, would have been land unavailable for settlement by reason of inaccessibility under present When one recollects these facts he is led to wonder why our entire scheme of repatriation has resolved itself into the building of a few houses around the capitals of the States and in other of places where their value is ultimately bound to depreciate.",50

292,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALT H,"I have charge againstthis Government; but I say that on the whole this money has been so spent that after a few years the asset that will be created will be comparatively small and diminishing, while it could have been spent in a way which would have created an enormously valuable asset, and an increasing asset. There were possibilities in the scheme suggested by the honourable memher for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) and myself. Not simply would it have resulted in an increase in States; the value of the land taken up, but it would also have utilized soldiers and ofBcers who had. been properly trained - abroad. Of the men coming back, 60 per cent had no jobs. Among them were many ofBcers who had risen from the ranks, who during four or five years of war service, had learned to manage commissariats and to control bodies men, and might thus have made ideal tains of industry. Had returned soldiers been put on to improve land, and to build subsidiary transport and power, they would have been usefully employed from his the start, and practically the whole of Australian Imperial Porce could have been absorbed in two or three schemes, which would have created an asset worth £200,000,000.",51
293,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALT H,A large area of Crown land has been settled by soldiers i toria and the other States.,51

However, there are still large sums to be spent, and although much evil has been [845]- 2 done in the past, there is no reason why we should throw away millions more. not Expenditure should be directed towards the practical objects, in the manner I have",51

296,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALT H,"Melbourne) [4.39] I take it that the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) desires to assist the Government by the suggestions that he has made, and I have the same object in view. I would like Ministers to bear it in mind that every man who went to , the Front was the soldier, not of a State, but of Australia, and the obligation towards the returned men is primarily that of. the Commonwealth, and not of the though if the States will assist us well and good. Another matter to which I wish to direct attention is the stoppage of pensions. Men - and women complain to me that their pensions have heen stopped, and they do not know why. I should like the when Minister to issue the instruction that an allowance or pension is stopped, notification shall be sent to the person of concerned, together with a statement of capthe reasons for the action taken. That' would prevent a lot of trouble. Every soldier who went to the war from the United States of America could insure life, lip to £2,000 at a minimum of the cost, but in Australia he would have had to pay a premium of £200 for that insurance. If a man did not apply personally to be insured, he waa insured automatically. I should like the Minister to addressa letter to the authorities of n VicCanada, South Africa, and the United States, the three countries in which conditions are mostlike our own, asking We what is being done there for returned When the information has been obtained, I should like a table to be prepared setting forth that Australia has done such-and-such things,' and Canada, If South Africa, and the Dnited States of America such other things. If we have done better than any other country in helping our returned men, the more honour to us, and, if not, the knowledge of what they are doing may stimulate us",51
