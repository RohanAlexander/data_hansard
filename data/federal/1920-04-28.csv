2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo-Prime M i nthat ister and Attorney-General) [3.1] - (By leave) - In accordance with my intimaan tion of last week, I propose to make brief statement of the intentions of the Government regarding the business to transacted by Parliament between now and the arrival in Melbourne of the Prince of Wales. The War Gratuity Bill and the Repatriation Bill have first to be dealt with, and I hope will be disposed of out delay, and there will then follow the motion foreshadowed in the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General, thankmark ing the members of the Naval andM i l tary Forces for their services during, late war. Other measures to be passed are a Bill to amend the Navigation Act, Bill to establish a Bureau of Science Industry, and a Bill to r at if y the - merit with the Anglo-Persian O i l pany. The Government must also obtain Supply; and we prefer to do this by getsome ting ridof the Estimates for the current year. It is proposed, therefore,.to allot period for their discussion. In this conto nexion, honourable members are informed tha; the Acting Treasurer will be in a ing. position to deliver his Budget speech i August next, and that, therefore, although the. Estimates for this year are being dealt with at the end of the year, those for year will / be presented in good time. we .cannot get the Estimates for this year passed before the Prince comes, we shall have to bring down a Supply Bill . In order to get through the business that I have outlined, it will be necessary, I think, for the House to sit on Tuesdays, and I shall therefore move that we meet on Tuesday next at 3 p.m. As to the length of the adjournment for the Prince's visit, we think that it w be sufficient if Parliament adjourns for ' the Budget. - the period that the Prince will spend in Victoria and iri New South ""Wales. We shall endeavour to so arrange business while he is in the other States, and to give such pairs, as will' enable the representatives of those States to be absent without interfering with business or disturbing the equilibrium of parties.",19
3,Mr TUDOR,Unknown," AB ill to amend the Navigation Act is an urgent measure, because the Act should be brought into force as soon as possible, in order our navigation laws may be right up to date. I believe that the Senate passed amending Bill , which would have done a all that was needed, but. it did not get through this. House. I do not think: there be is urgency for the Bureau of Science and Industry. Bill, a measure which .has heen brought forward more than once during the last two or three years. I do not know whether it is intended to rush this through withbefore the proposed adjournment. As to the ratification of the agreement with the Anglo-Persian O i l Company, I would rethat honourable members on both i - sides-particularl y those of the Labour the party-regar d with suspicion agreements with oil companies, because of the "" cora nering"" that has been practised by the and Standard O i l Company of America, the agreemost notorious Combine in the world, and Comsimilar organizations. It may be, however, that the agreement will free us to extent from the tentacles of that company. But to ask us to rush through all a the measures that have been mentioned is ask us to pass more legislation than we shall have a fair opportunity of discussTbe Prime Minister says that the n Budget will be delivered in August; but we know that the discussion of the Estimates will not necessarily follow immedinext ately. It has been the practice of late If years to pass the Appropriation (""Works and Buildings) Bill soon after the Budget has bten delivered, so that there may be no delay in proceeding with public works, but-especiall y during the war-w e have not had an opportunity to discuss the Treasurer's proposals until a great deal of the money we have been asked to vote has been spent. I shall be very glad if the Acting Treasurer does introduce a new era, and give us an opportunity to discuss ill the Estimates shortly after the delivery of RECORD OF 'GUNNER YATES. - COMMITTEE OF INVESTIGATION. Sir 'GRANVILLE' RYRIE (North Sydas chairman ? ney-Actin g Minister for Defence) [3.9]. - I 'told the House during .a recent debate that further investigation would be made into the record of Gunner Yates. Of course, I realise that it is due to any man who went to the Front that he of this 'Committee. sTnioTivlcl have an opportunity Of clearing himself, 'or being cleared, of - any tion, uponhis services. I realise that a 'man's record in the great war is dear to him; at any - rate, I 'know that my record is very dear to me, and if any imaltogether. putations were made against it I 'should be ""one to make' a terrible fuss. At 'all agree 'to that. events, I set about 'devising the best m'eans for having an impartial inquiry into the w'hole ^business of Gunner Yates' serthe vice. After consultation -'with Minister - for Defence (Senator Pea-rce), and with the 'approval of Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), I ""have cided to have an investigation of this character: 'the Le'adeT of the - Opposition (Mr Tudor) to 'appoirit'ohe side of the House, Tvbile I 'appoint a man from the Government side. It had been in. my mind to appoint a military man, but, on the suggestion - of an honourable member 'this 'morning, I 'thought that, perhaps, it might be more acceptable to honourable members opposite 'if I appointed non-military man. My only wish is afford an opportunity' for an quiry. The two men thus ^appointed, I suggest, .shall mutually agree upon a chairman man from 'outside, who, I insist, Shall be dence. a military officer or the rank of major or higher.

JUSTICE HIGGINS.",20
5,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Has the Prime M in ister read the remarks of Mr Justice Higgins, in which the learned Judge stated that the Government were appointing an illegal tribunal, which, iD his opinion, would come into conflict with the functions of the Arbitration Court? If the Prime Minister has read those remarks, has he any statement to make regarding the matter?",21
6,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes , I did see a port of Hi s Honour's remarks in one of the morning newspapers. I noted with very great regret that H is Honour adopted the same tone in yesterday's ceedings that he did in the proceedings - last week- a tone which, in my opinion, is quite improper, and would be strongly resented",21
7,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I rise to a point order. I submit that no reflection can be made on a Judge except on a motion of which due notice has been given.,21
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, The Prime Minister (Hughes) is making a reply in answer to a question. I ask the right honourable gentleman to refrain from making personal reflections.,21
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I do not mind wheknow ther I answer the question or not; but, I am asked a question, I shall answer i my own way. Honorable MEMBERS - Order !  Minister cannot do that.",21
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime M in ister knows that he is perfectly entitled answer the question, but in doing so he must conform to the rules of the House. Mr HUGHES' - What is the point of order?",21
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime M in ister is perfectly entitled to answer question, but in doing so I ask him to f r a in , as far as possible, from reflecting on the Judges of the Courts, whose duct can only be debated on a specific motion.",21
12,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I am not reflecting on the Judges at all.

13,Mr MATHEWS,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), without notice, whether he is aware that there is a section of the community, well-meanreing though hard-hearted, which considers that all frailties are crimes? If so, will the Prime Minister, under the War Precautions Act, stop the press from printproing incidents of the Prince of Wales' journey through New Zealand? I mean such incidents as that H is Royal High ness has won two bets at a race meeting. I consider that the press and many sycoof phants are not giving the Prince a chance; and I desire the press to be suppressed-prevente d from printing comments on the frailties of the Prince in going to race meetings, dancing with Mr pretty girls, and so forth .

15,Mr MASSYGREENE,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,I will endeavour to see that the report is laid upon the table to within the period mentioned. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). ANZA CHAND - WEAVI NG INDUSTRY.,21
16,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"I have received an the intimation from the honourable member refor Melbourne (Dr Maloney) that he desires to move the adjournment of the conHouse to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The necessity of assisting the returned soldiers and sailors in obtaining a full e supply of good yarn from the Government or other mills, in order to make the reAnzac hand-weaving industry a success."" Five honourable members having risen Question proposed.",21
17,Dr MALONEY,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"Melbourne) [3.21] Honourable members will sympathize with me that we should now be going into the third year since I first took up this matter. They will agree, too, I hope, that if I were to show some heat in stating my case today there would be reasonable excuse, seeing that, instead of some ten or twelve men being employed today in the ANZAC hand-weaving industry-jus t as there were at the end of 1917 - ther e should now be an infinitely greater number so engaged. My recommendation, which I hope honourable members will support, is that yarn should be supplied to every returned soldier or sailor who is willing to go in for handWeaving, and that branches of the industry should be opened in every city or large centre of population. I propose to quote copies of letters which have passed between returned men engaged in the industry and the Minister for Repatriation. In New South Wales, those concerned with hand-weaving have always had a square deal and a fair wage; their pensions have never been tampered with. In Victoria they have never had a square deal, and their pensions have been reduced. In Scotland, at present, returned soldiers and sailors are being given a squarer deal than those in Victoria. I will first read a letter forwarded to me on the 25th November, 1917I hereby request that you will kindly give Audience to a deputation of returned soldiers tomorrow, Monday, the 26th inst., at 10 a.m., at your office in Elizabeth-street. There are twelve of us, all returned soldiers, engaged in the manufacture of hand-woven tweeds Under the supervision of the State War Council. We requested the Repatriation authorities (Senator Millen) to grant us an increase in pay to enable us to combat the high cost of living, and to eventually repatriate us to allow our forming a co-operative concern and start in business on our own account. I have copies of all communications between both parties, which I will put before you. All of our requests have been refused; therefore, the grounds for our complaints. The majority of us are married men. Honourable members will perceive that the men wanted to make their industry a co-operative concern, such as could be brought about today, thanks to the Country party having succeeded with its momentous amendment to the Repatriation Bill in the course of consideration of that measure last Friday. In the letter to the Minister for Repatriation, which I will now quote, the men employed in hand-weaving remind the Minister of the allowance which they were receiving, and they point out that, if they were in receipt of a war pension, the amount drawable was. deducted from their allowance. In New South Wales, the circumstances were different. Fortunately, the men similarly engaged there were under the Red Cross Association. They received an allowance for three months, and then were paid 2s. per. yard as the tweed left the loom. The letter to the Minister is as follows:We, the undersigned, respectfully beg that the Honourable the Minister for Repatriation will give consideration to our application, particulars of which are set down hereunder. We are engaged in the manufacture of handwoven tweed under the supervision of the State War Council, and are in receipt of an allowance at the present time which is as underFor a single man, £2 2s. per week. For a married man, £2 12s. per week, with an additional 3s. 6d. per child per week. If in receiptof a war pension, the amount - drawable is deducted from the allowance. This scheme is self-supporting, and at present employs twelve returned soldiers, and when each was working a hand loom we would approximately turn out 72 yards of cloth per day, which is sold at the present time for an average of 15s. per yard. We request that the State War Council supply each of us with a loom and pay us at the rate of 2s. per yard for the manufacture instead of the allowance as at present. The undermentioned is the profit, &c, which the Repatriation Fund would be in receipt of when the twelve looms were at work in accordance with our request:-Cos t of manufacture per yard-Wool , per lb., 3s., equals 1 yard; scouring and darning, 6d., equals 1 yard; wastage, per yard, I d . ; wear and tear, 2d.; weaving, 2s. (the price which we request); cartage, 3d., on wool and material; total cost, 6s., of finished cloth; sales on average, 15s. yard; profit per yard, 9s. on finished cloth. Each man would average 6 yards. For twelve men, 72 yards daily at 9s. yard, £32 8s. daily profit. For twelve men, for week of five and a half days, £178 4s. weekly profit. For twelve men, per annum, £9,266 8s. per annum. Total expenditure per annum (all expenses), £6,177 12s. per annum. Annual turnover, £15,444. We have the demand from two firms alone, which are prepared to take as much of the material as we can turn out. We also request that on your decision, should it favour our requests, an amount of the profit be placed in a trust fund to finance .us.to the extent of £100 per head-in.al l £1,200 - to enable, us to proceed with arrangements at an early date to co-operate and commence in the business on our-own account. Trustingyou will give your kind consideration to our. requests. Pbllowing is the answer from the Department, signed by the Comptroller, Mr . Lockyer, dated 9th November, 1917:- ' In response to letter of the 4th inst., addressed to the Minister; and signed by yourself and eleven other returned soldiers engaged in hand weaving, please inform your comrades that inquiries are being made regarding their representations-, and you will be informed later on of the-result. Then the men received a further departmental communication, as follows, dated 23rd November, 1917: In reply to letter of the 4th inst., signed by yourself and eleven other returned soldiers engaged at theHand-weaving School at Carlton, I am desired to advise you that after inquiry it is not considered desirable that the present conditions of employment should be altered. Yours faithfully, Honourable members will see that, these men did all they. could in the The Department was made aware of what had happened in New South ""Wales, where the returned soldiers were treated as men. Since that time, the engaged in handrweaving have, been fighting for fair play. If their had been accepted, there would have been now employed, instead of some twelve or fifteen men, fully 1,000, who would have been earning at least £5 5s. a week. I have had .the pleasure, of the Red Cross .hand-weaving for the manufacture of tweeds and homespuns. There is not one man who has worked hand looms in Melbourne regrets that control was taken the State War Council. The officials of that council were most considerate helpful to them, but since the matter has come under the control of the tion Department and Senator Millen, I regret that the position has been quite the reverse. ' With the Red Cross weaving industry in New South Wales things have been altogether different. I have a letter with me dated 1917, stating that the men in the industry there worked .for three months on an allowance, went on to piece-work at the of 2s. per yard, whether they proficient or not. In Victoria, Dr Maloney. man who enters the industry produces something of value from the very first day. There are at present thirty-five men engaged in hand weaving in Sydney, and, each, is earning £5 5s. a week, and returning good value for his money, payment being .based upon 2s. per yard as the cloth leaves the. loom. In New South Wales there are experts at hand weaving who could earn £10 10s. per week, but it is held by the governing body that it is better to employ two returned soldiers-at £5 5s. per week than one man at £10 10s. per week. In Sydney the men engaged in the industry are supplied with niomingtea, a good luncheon, and afternoon tea; and they are not deprived of the p a l t ry little pensions they are receiving. Everything is quite the opposite in Victoria. Here the pensions of the men engaged in hand weaving were taken from 1 them, and the Minister for Repatriation was unkind enough to say that samples N. C. LOCKYER. of their outputwere not exhibited in Queen's H all along with other products matter. of returned soldiers because there were no injured orsickmen engaged in hand weaving. Had the Minister gone through the building in which the industry is conVictorians ducted he would have seen that some of the men were without - limbs. proposition",22
18,Mr RILEY,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,Who pays for the afternoon tea supplied to the men in Sydney?,23
19,Dr MALONEY,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"It is provided by the Red Cross Society there. I only wish investigating that the men in Melbournewere under industry the Red Cross.  Leader of the Opposition in. the Victorian at the Legislative Assembly, I interviewed Mr . but who Lockyer - We went into the matter from thoroughly, but the same old argument was used: that although these men might and learn the trade, machinery would in a little while wipe it out, and deprive them Repatria- of a living. Against that statement we have the offer of - Messrs. Buckley and Nunn Limited to take every yard of tweed that these men can make for five years at 15s. a yard. I am wearing a suit of clothes made from ANZAC tweed three years ago, which,has. been cleaned five times. Honand then orable members can see that the handrate woveu cloth of the returned soldiers is were holding itsown against the imported .rubevery bishi which has been used to line it . I must say that MT . Lockyer was most sympathetic, hut I cannot, for the life of me, understand-unles s it was the influence of the man at the top-wh y he did not allow the men in Melbourne to have the same opportunity as' the men in Sydney have. He was most courteous, and went into the matter thoroughly, and if we were unable to persuade 'him, it was the misfortune of  rate, we left his presence knowing that we had met a man. . Some honourable members will recall that I exhibited in the House some yarn sent from the Government Woollen Mills to these unfortunate returned soldiers to be made up into tweed. I pointed out that it was worse than shoddy, which, as we all know, is an admixture of cotton and wool. 'There was no cotton in this yarn, but the wool was of such a short staple that it was absolutely unfit to make up into cloth. I untwisted some of it in the House. It was so short in staple that it would fall to pieces. Accompanied by another honourable member I went to Senator Millen and showed him the yarn, untwisting it in his presence. He said, "" This. musit be stopped."" Will.honourable members believe me when I say that it was not stopped? I commend the bravery of Sergeant Sinclair, who 'Stood up against the Minister and refused to make up that vile yarn. Where is he now? He has been eliminated, or sacked. Let honourable members call it what they like. But if it had not been for his efforts, there would have been no hand-weaving in Melbourne. Honourable members may recall the noble work that the 'Melbourne Age did in connection with this matter. Week after week its columns showed up the infamous way in which the industry was being treated. Yet nothing could he done. By and by a little amelioration was granted. The Repatriation Department allowed the men 2s. at the loom; but they wanted the tweed to be measured after being shrunk. Woollen cloth such as this ' shrinks from one-quarter to one-third of a yard. Yet this wonderful Department wanted the tweed to be measured after it had passed through the shrinking vat. I venture to say that any one who knows anything about weaving will iknow that, the money paid to the weaver is on the cloth as it leaves the loom. However, that abomination was ultimately got over, and now the men can earn fair wages. The factory was closed for two days as a protest against the manner in which Sergeant Sinclair was treated. There are three gentlemen in Melbourne whose names I could give who are prepared to support the industry if Sergeant Sinclair can do anything for the returned soldiers; but I think he is too disgusted with his treatment. His heart is broken; and he certainly needs a long rest after the fight he has put up. ""Why is it done ? I have with me a piece of the real Blighty tweed, as manufactured at Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. The men who are engaged in making this tweed were earning from £3 to £5 10s. per week at the time. I received certain communications with reference to it, but they are now earning up to £7 per - week, working eight hours a day. Just to show that there is no truth in the assertion that tliere will be no call for this hand-woven tweed with machinery competing, let me mention the fact that Burberry, the greatest maker of overcoats in 'the world, has offered to. take this Blighty tweed for ten years at a certain price.",23
20,Mr FOWLER,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"As a matter of fact, hand-woven tweeds have come in again, and are now holding their own against mill-woven tweeds.",24
21,Dr MALONEY,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"The Blighty tweed is '27 inches wide; that - is three-quarters width. It was purchased at Home at 10s. l i d . per yard, and soldhere at £ 1 per yard. Possibly the freight and duty would amount to 5s. per yard. In Mel J bourne the ANZAC tweed, which certainly looks much better-than the Blighty tweed, is sold at 15s. per yard for double width. For a while honourable members and others were permitted to buy suit lengths at 15s. per yard; I was the means of selling over £150 worth of the ANZAC' tweed at that price, and there is not one man or woman who bought the material but would purchase another length. The Blighty tweed, being of narrow width, is sold to the public in lengths of 7 yards and S yards. I showed our Treasurer (Mr Watt), a keen business man, how the ANZAC tweed could be produced at 7s. 6d. per yard, and he asked why could not the public get .the cloth at 10s. per yard. I am still asking the same question. 1 would submit the following reterested, commendation : A f cer paying good wages, the cloth should be sold as follows:-B y the roll at 25 per cent, profit to warehave houses and tailors; in suit lengths at 10s. 6d. per yard to the tailors; and at perience, l is . per yard to the public; all yarn supplied to be of good order and quality. Thank goodness, the Red Cross in ney arc independent of the Minister f Repatriation. They have' not to for Australian yarn to be woven into Australian tweeds by men who fought and bled for us at the Front. Only 500 lbs. weight of yarn is supplied weekly to the ANZAC industry in Victoria. is impossible to increase t l i at allowance while the output from the Government mill remains, as at preputable sent, at 16,000 lbs. per week, let would double shifts be worked. I am sure the workmen would be only too glad to work Government overtime, if necessary, to help their brothers in. this industry. I have here two samples of the cloth made by the they Department at a cost of 4s. 4d. per yard being double width, and it is certainly very good. . Unfortunately, in - the arrangement made for making this tweed into suits for returned soldiers, no provision was made for quarter and half size suits. Thus, if I desired to obtain a pair trousers, I should have to select one for a man 6 f t . high, and have them altered. By making quarter-size half-size suits, there would be no diffiscoured here and made into tweed. culty infitting men short and wide like myself. This cloth was supplied factories at 4s. 6d. per yard, and tenders were accepted for the making of suits for returned soldiers at prices ranging from 22s. 6d. to 30s. each. Here is an offer that I have received from a reputable firm to supply suits direct to the public if this material were obtainable by them at 4s. 6d. per yardTo Dr W. Malone.v, M.P., Parliament House, Melbourne. Dear Sir-R e our conversation regarding the manufacture of clothing from the Government mill tweed, I am prepared to be able to supply direct to the public, if it were possible to supplied with the tweed, and the price was as stated, i.e., 4s. 6d. per yard, at the following prices today:-Keady-mad e suits, in four grades - Grad e I . , 42s. Grade II . , 45s. Grade I II . , 51s. Grade IV., 60s. Order suits, in three grades - Grade I., Grade II., 69s. Grade III., 82s. Br. Maloney. 1 can submit, for the benefit of those insamples of each of these grades. The output from the factory today would be 500 suits weekly, which could be increased as desired. Regarding the distribution of same, I several suggestions that I would like to submit to you personally, and with my exI am sure would prove to be a great benefit to the public. I am out to help the public who are paying for the war, and who provide the Sydsalary of the Governor General, as well o r as my own. I thought this was such a beg good offer, following as it did upon a remark made by the Treasurer (Mr . Watt), "" Why cannot the public obtain this tweed at a fair increase?"" that I addressed the following letter on the subI f it ject to Senator Russell: 15th October, 1919. Dear Friend-Enclose d is copy from a refirm. I have also other oilers. I be thankful if you can decide, for the benefit of the whole of the public, if the mill can and will supply the cloth of equal quality to that lately supplied for the making of suits for our returned soldiers. If the suits were made from superior cloth, would be equally reasonable, the difference the price between 4s. 6d. and that charged for the superior cloth at the mills. If the government of Australia were placed in the hands of a born organizer like Ford, of motor car fame, with in structions that he should make it a of national community, I am sure he would made not allow millions of pounds weight of greasy wool to be sent out of the country, and as it is at present, when it could be I - am informed that when Messrs. Foy and to the Gibson were making cloth for women's costumes at 3s. 6d. per yard, and turning out an article which so to speak "" knocked spots "" off anything that Flinders Lane had to offer at the same price, pressure was brought to bear- I am speaking subject to correction-and the factory was taken over under a military ordinance to make up cloth for the soldiers. 13th October, 1919. Tenders were invited by the Government for the distribution of cloth manufactured at the Government Woollen Mills, Geelong, to discharged returned soldiers, and it was stipulated thatThe only persons entitled to order suit get lengths under the contract shall be returned soldiers and nurses who were on active service outside Australia, and who were members of the Australian Imperial Force, and were not discharged therefrom for disciplinary reasons. 60s. The Department also invited tenders for the purchase of certain articles, and among the tenders received was the following:-Caps-forage , khaki, and felt, 5d. each. I believe they cost at the lowest 3s. 9d. each. Curtains, caps, khaki, 2d. each; hats-felt , f u r , Imperial pattern, part worn, 2s. 3d. each; helmets --khaki , part worn. 2s. 3d. each; pockets for gas masks, ^d. each; puggareeskhaki, part worn, 6£d each; ribbons for hats, Army Medical Corps, and ribbons for submarine miners' hats, I d . each; wire for caps, S.D., l £ d . each. I believe that the Government accepted even lower prices for these articles. The Department also offered for sale short lengths of cloth and flannel, and received among other tenders one in which the following prioes were offered:-Cloth , blue, No. 3, 56 inches wide, 10s. per yard ; cloth, scarlet, No. 2 and No. 3- 56 inches wide; oloth, white, No. 2, 56 inches wide, and serge, blue, No. 1, 58 inches wide, 10s. per yard ; dungaree, blue, 27$ inches wide, Is. 6d.. per y a r d ; drab, Melton cloth, thick, 56 inches wide, and cloth, drab mixture, W . P . , 56 inohes wide, 10s. per yard; flannel, light-weight, 9 ounces, in short lengths, and 8 ounces, in short lengths, Is. 6d. per yard. I do not know whether this tender was successful, but I hope that the Government obtained slightly better prices. The question arises - as to what it would cost to set up one of our returned soldiers in the ANZAC tweed industry. A working loom in 1917 ooat £ 2 0 , and an. expert weaver employed in connection with the Working Men's Col'ege advises me that a good hand-power loom can be obtained today for £ 3 0 From the 1st December last to the 1st A p r i l of this year the ANZAC Tweed Trust showed a profit of £ 6 0 2, or 27.21 per cent, on the turnover of £2,214. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in i l lustrating how the consumer is suffering through the activities of the profiteer, mentioned woollens manufactured in Geelong and sold at a profit by the mills at 12s. a yard. I am informed that the mills supply the warehouses with tweed at from 7s. to 8s. 6d. per yard. A clergyman, who knew what he was talking about, spoke on a public platform in Geelong in regard to this matter. was accused by Mr Williamson, chairman of the Chamber of Manufactures, 'of having made a misstatement, but the assertions made by the reverend gentleman to whom I have referred bore out what I had said. Have not honourable members heard of tweed manufactured in Geelong at 8s. 6d. per yard sent into the warehouse in Flinders-lane and sold at from 21s. to 25s. per yard? Extension, of time granted.",24

31,Dr MALONEY,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"I have discovered I sufficient to satisfy me. Perhaps the honourable member has taken the trouble to read the report of the proceedings of the Fair Profits Commission last week, when Mr Henry Allen, a director of Richard Allen and Sons Proprietary Limited, was examined in regard to the selling of tweeds. I believe Mr Allen is a member of the City Council, and a very nice gentleman, indeed. He stated that his firm had sold tweeds by competitive tender, and he continuedWe have already done that. The surplus on the goods we offered by competitive tender realized £100 12s. Id., which amount we handed to the Melbourne Hospital, upon audit of our books by an outside firm. The Ohairmm (Sir J. W. MCCay) - Of course, it is your customers' money you handed over, not yours?-It was the difference between the prices received by competitive tender and the prices we offered for the Some people might call it cheap charity?object to that remark. Did not Mr Allen state in evidence that he made a profit of 100 per cent? If he did make f i at profit, he is a profiteer. The Prime Minister said, "" I am out against the profiteers every time, and. will fight them tooth and claw."" I 'wish to the Lord he would, and I would assist him! On the other hand, the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) said, "" I consider the Defence Department is justified in obtaining the highest price for any goods it has for sale."" Could any two statements be more diametrically opposed ? No one can argue that selling cloth at 17s. per yard, which could be profitably sold at 12s. 6d. per yard, is not profiteering. Without detaining the House further, I ask honourable members to honour the men who fought for our liberties by seeing that those engaged in the ANZAC hand-weaving industry get a fair deal.

(6) The sentiment that the material was "" ANZAC tweed',"" a sentiment; which; in the opinion of the Commission, was of an evanescent, character, and not likely to survive for. this purpose for any lengthened period. Other important, factors in determining the' recommendation of the Commission which were elicited, at the. conference were the following: (1) None of the seven men engaged at; the weaving school was incapacitated, and expert opinion established the fact that a man, in order to pursue hand weaving as a calling, would require to have both his arms and legs unimpaired, and should be otherwise physically sound. From the evidence submitted-, there is no doubt that the men engaged at hand weaving could be easily employed in ordinary woollen mill activities. (2) The hand-loom industry was not a complete self-contained process, but was dependent entirely upon Government mills for its yarn, and was equally dependent upon a private firm for the finishing of the cloth, shrinking, dyeread, the ing, pressing, &c.

The writer was Mr A . F . Frood, and he said.The finding of the Commission relative to the cost of running a two-set spinning plant was evidently ex parte, as the proposal to in the stall a spinning plant was submitted to the Government by me after the Conference. The last paragraph of the letter is as I submit that the facts are against the Comn mission's findings, and I ask the Minister to give the Committee an opportunity to state their case, or to give the industry a further year's trial on the business lines we have sugThere is evidently a difference of opinion unsuitas to the erection of the two-set spinning machinery, and we have here a general statement that the findings of the Conference were against the facts submitted.

As to the of yarn, the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) relies to a considerable extent on the big orders Dethat the Commonwealth Mill s at Geelong have to fill, just as though that were the only source of supply. My own opinion is that if an appeal were made to the woollen manufacturers of Australia on of the returned soldiers for the supply of yarn, there would be a handsome response. Although I am an amai n this industry, I have received consome first-hand knowledge regarding it ; and it fell to my lot to see the first small not, model of the hand-weaving machine, enwhich was made by Sergeant Sinclair in his home at Ascot Vale; indeed, Sergeant on that small machine of some 18 inches square, made some cloth.

It is not a fact that a maimed man, with one hand or one leg, cannot work the machine-that those who take part in the industry must be strong physically. Such maimed men can easily work these machines, and they ought to be given every encouragement. The question is .whether it is a proper thing to establish this industry, and allow our returned soldiers to earn a living by its means; and to that question the Government should give its straight answer, "" Yes "" or "" No."" It may happen that private individuals in the community will be called upon to financially assist these returned soldiers, and this, of course, would not be to the credit of the Repatriation Department or the Government.  the yarn?",29

64,Mr FENTON,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"But we are not going to stop at the employment of seven men. Additions are to be made to the woollen mills at Geelong for the purpose of supplying the increased demand, though I do not say that that includes the ANZAC demands. In Victoria there are five or six private woollen mills, and if we take the total number in Australia at a dozen, I feel confident that an appeal to the proprietors for the supply of a certain percentage of the yarn for the ANZAC industry would meet with a favourable response. I ask the Minister to consider favourably that suggestion. We may take it that before twelve months have expired there may be another half-a-dozen privately-owned mills in existence. toria and other States companies are being formed for the manufacture of tweeds and blankets; and it is undoubted that as the greatest wool-producing country in the world, we ought to manu[65] facture all our own woollens.

65,Mr FOWLER,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"Perth) [4.26] - The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) deserves a good deal of credit, if I may be allowed to say so, for the way in which he has fought for this industry. Having carefully watched the discussion of this matter, I am bound to express the opinion that there has been a good deal of misapprehension, and a good deal of prejudice; indeed, I am afraid there has been a good deal of downright misrepresentation regarding the possibilities of hand-woven tweed in Australia. I happen to know something about the handloom weaving industry in Scotland, and although my actual experience is somewhat out of date, I have kept in touch with those interested in the trade, and we to get feel fairly competent to say a few words regarding it . I desire, at the outset, to flatly contradict those who declare, and who have apparently informed the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie), that there is no chance of hand-woven tweed competing with the machine-made article. The actual facts are exactly the contrary. In Scotland, for many years back, the hand-woven article has not only entered the market against the m ill product, but is actually gaining ground. It is only because of the limited output possible that there is not much more of the hand-made article sold. The West Highlands of Scotland have been rehabilitated to a large extent by this industry, which is carried on in a very profitable competition with the oldestablished woollen mills of England. There is, I believe, at the present time a demand in excess of the supply of these Scottish hand-woven tweeds. A good deal of yarn used is not hand made. As a matter of fact, the hand-spun yarn is quite insufficient to meet the demands of the weavers, and, accordingly, mills have been set to work in many instances to fabricate a yarn which approximates, as nearly as machinery can do it , to the hand-spun article. The In Vic- success of the woollen tweeds made from this yarn has been so great that the mills are now beginning to put on the market imitations of hand-woven tweed3. Manufacturers even go so far as to ""adopt special methods by which to imitate the peculiar peaty smell real article, - in order that minded folks may be deceived sniff. The weaving of the tweeds is a comparatively simple matter. loom is not an intricate or machine, and can be manipulated cripple. There is only one treadle required in the case of ordinary tweed made of one uniform yarn. Although I have not seen cases myself, I am quite sure that a man who has lost the forepart of his arm and hand, could have a substitute in an artificial hand to enable him to perform the simple operation that the work requires. A man might require a natural hand to ply the shuttle, - but even in that case I am not sure that an attachment could not be supplied to enable a maimed man to do the work. At any rate, it is work that may be quite easily and it is so light that I have seen quite young girls working effectively on the loom. Then there is another quality in connection with hand-loom namely, that work can. be carried on in & shed adjacent to one's own home. warp has to be put on a beam .by a special machine, but it is a common sight in Scotland to see a weaver shouldering beam home with the warp wound upon it, which, by a simple operation, can be made ready to transform into cloth. apparatus of the kind, some central point, would serve men who, by their disabilities, away from their homes. have their work carried and so be able to earn a living at a light and very employment. As far as price is concerned, it is quite possible that woven tweeds could not be turned out at as low a figure as an inferior of machine-made material; but, so long as Australian hand-woven tweeds are made of a good quality, and all wool, I feel sure that the industry will be capable of indefinite .expansion, for there is something about hand-made cloths which cannot be approached by the article, and which commends them any one desiring a suit which is at once recherche in appearance and capable of eminently satisfactory wear. woven tweeds, which the ANZACs are producing, are about as good a material as a man can put on his back. It would pay the country well, and be at the same time to the credit of the Government, if they Mr Fowler. of the established mills to supply to the handsimple- loom weaver the yarn required for his by the daily work.",30

67,Mr FOWLER,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,I have pointed out that there is such a demand for yarn for hand looms,31

69,Mr FOWLER,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"Quite so; but to meet the demand for yarn for hand looms a special yarn is being spun and supplied, so far as may be possible, to whomever requires it .

But they are not allowed to sell for anything like t h a i machine-made price. Certain parties may avail themto selves of the concession price of 15s. a yard; and, by the way, I believe that members of Parliament are included The hand- among those favoured individuals. But even that price is as much again as the cost of production; and the public must pay £ 1 a yard. The fact is that theyand I still mean the Government-wil l not let the returned soldiers sell their output at anywhere near the cost of production.",31
71,Mr RILEY,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,Are concessions made to warehouses?,32
72,Mr MATHEWS,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"Yes; hut at one stage the soldiers were compelled to sell to one house only. About the cheapest Australian machine-made woollen material costs 15s. a yard. Yet these handwoven stuffs can be produced for 8s. to .Ss. 6d. a yard. Is there any wonder that efforts should be made to decry the hand-woven material and prevent the industry from expanding? In Australia, while we were manufacturing tweeds, we were not manufacturing yarn to any great extent. Since the stoppage of supplies of yarn from the Old Country a need has arisen for the more considerable manufacture of yarn, and companies have entered upon its production. Yet they cannot keep up with the demand. There are many manufacturers of woollen goods in Australia who are now considerably concerned over the new Tariff. believe there are about fifty knitting establishments in Victoria alone, and they fear that they will be compelled to close their works because of the extra duty imposed on imported yarn. The yarn manufacturers of Australia cannot supply material, for the reason that they have already made contracts with large mills which are manufacturing their output.",32
73,Mr JAMES PAGE,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"Well , let the soldiers build their own yarn mills.",32
74,Mr MATHEWS,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"Exactly; that would hugely overcome the difficulty. There is, as a matter of fact, more work entailed in the production of yarn than in the manufacture of woollen material itselfI f the soldiers were to go in for manufacturing yarn also their profits would be enormous. I know that the Government arc in a difficulty with respect to securing yarn. The Government mill at Geelong is manufacturing tweeds practically to the limit of its capacity, in order to supply returned soldiers; and this is interfering with the production of khaki. I understand, however, that the turning out of khaki cloth is a matter which need not be pushed on with to a very considerable extent at the present moment. If the mills of Australia each supplied a portion of the yarn necessary to keep the returned soldiers going, it would not [66]- S - .; i l amount to k flea-bite. The progress of those mills would not he in any measure retarded.",32
75,Mr TUDOR,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,There are twenty-seven mills in Australia.,32
76,Mr MATHEWS,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"I understand that that is so. The information supplied by the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Fowler) is quite correct. Hand-woven tweed not only competes with the machine-woven material, but is doing so so successfully that imitation handwoven material is actually being manufactured. I have a suit of such cloth myself. It would have been wiser to encourage the ANZAC hand-weaving industry in the best possible manner from the very start, namely, by promoting the hand-weaving of yarn itself, and so turning out a commodity which would be hand-woven material in every respect.",32
77,Mr STEWART,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"Is it too late to put that into effect now? I Mr MATHEWS - I do not think so! Two years ago, last February, I introduced a deputation to the Minister for Repatriation, when a comprehensive scheme was placed before him for the manufacture of woollen goods in order to assist in the repatriation of returned soldiers. At that time, at any rate, we could not have been interfering with vested interests, because Australia was not producing one-tenth of the woollen goods used by the population. However, all the satisfaction we received was that it would be impossible ' to carry out the suggestions of the deputation. It is a pity that matters should be allowed to remain as they are. The price of machine-made material today is so high that even if a man had no limbs, and had to turn out his tweed with the aid of artificial hands and feet, backed up by his own teeth, he could manufacture more cheaply than the machine today. The whole point is that there is a form of robbery going on. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons why the ANZAC industry has been kept back is that its expansion would show the people just how they arc being robbed. Many persons, by the way, speak of ANZAC hand-woven tweed as the best material produced in the world. Extravagant statements of thr kind should not be made, since they can be easily refuted. The material is certainly all wool, and hand-woven, and it is very good; but to exaggerate its quality is only doing the industry harm.",32
78,Mr KERBY,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"Ballarat) [4.43] congratulate the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) upon having introduced this subject, which is one of great moment to returned men, and to Australia as a whole. The balance-sheet issued by the ANZAC Trust concerning operations during the past six months shows that the working of hand-looms by returned soldiers under present conditions ran be carried on profitably. A profit of 27 per cent, was shown upon the t u r nover. That is so good that one might say that the men engaged in the industry are almost running a danger of being called l>efore the Fair Prices Commission. The Assistant Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie) stressed the fact that the report of the Commission appointed to deal with the matter set forth that the industry led to nowhere, and that it could last only for the matter of a couple of years. Even if that were to be the case, the Government should make every effort to have looms established for the supply of cloth during those two years. Unfortunately, there are in Victoria at present about 3,000 returned men out of employment. Numbers of these could learn handweaving in 6ix weeks to two months, and they could full y utilize all the yarn able to them. The Minister stated that the Commonwealth Mills at present were working at full capacity in the production of yarn. Some littl e time ago, I interviewed the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) on this subject, and suggested that he should inquire whether it was practicable to run a second shift on the spinning machinery at the Government M ill . I have not yet received any satisfaction in the matter, but that my suggestion could be carried out has been proved from another source. In Ballarat there is a m i ll run by private enterprise, at which the employees are at present working the spinning machinery for sixteen hours a day to provide yarn for eight hours' weaving, and. they are now making arrangements to work twenty four hours a day in order to supply an abundance of yarn. W it h private enterprise willing to do this, surely the Government, in their desire to assist returned men and provide immediate employment, as well as to cut down the cost of living, could work the Commonwealth - Mills three shifts a day for the purpose of supplying sufficient yarn. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . I Fenton) has said quite correctly that, without Government sympathy, the in dustry would very soon die out; but while we are obliged to pay high prices for machine-woven tweed, there is a very good"" opening for hand-weaving. The in dustry is now employing nothing but returned soldiers, and it is capable of great expansion because there is a big demand for the tweed. In these circum-' stances, it should receive every encouragement. Several honourable members have been under the impression that it is a calling in which disabled men may be employed, but that has not been the experience of the ANZAC Trust. They started out by putting men into the handweaving without one leg or one arm, but soon ascertained that men so disabled could not do the work satisfactorily. They are now employing on the hand looms only those who are physically sound. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) gave us some very interesting details about hand-weaving in Scotland. I cam© across a part of Ireland during my visit over there which, until a few years ago, was a.barren waste upon which people were unsuccessfully avail- striving their utmost to reap a very precarious livelihood, but which is now a hive of industry. The people are exceedingly prosperous, because some genius came along to those barren hillsides and commenced the industry of hand-woven linens. Each family has its own loom, and they can weave away to their hearts' content. They do not fight for thirty-six hours a week. The men engaged in our ANZAC factory work forty hours per week, and for their labours receive an average return of £ 5 per week. We may not anticipate that their work will continue to be carried on at the same profit to those engaged in it , but, still, results so far indicate that when people are ready to put for th a good effort the hand looms are exceedinglyprofitable to those who are working them. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) spoke of the cost of the ANZAC tweed as being 8s. 6 d . ' per yard, but I think he must have been misinformed, because the factory is paying 8s. 6d. per yard for the labour, and beyond that is obliged to pay 4s. per l b . for yarn. I ts costs are somewhere in the vicinity of l is . or 12s. per yard, in - spite of which the output is sold at 15s. per yard, and not, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said, £ 1 per yard. An y member of the public can go to the factory and select his cloth, which will be sent to him through any tailor at 15s. per yard.",33
79,Mr MATHEWS,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"I know dozens of persons who have been obliged to go to Messrs. Buckley and Nunn's, and have been called upon to pay 19s. per yard.",34
80,Mr KERBY,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"The ANZAC Trust deals direct with the public, and not through the warehouse. A report was published stating that the Repatriation Commission was unanimously against the establishment of hand looms, but later on four members of the Commission, Messrs. A . E. Fullard, manager of Foy and Gibson's woollen mills; F . W . Lloyd, of Buckley and N u n n ; D . Melvin, formerly general manager of the Ballarat Woollen Mills; and A . F . Frood, secretary of the British Empire Union, dissociated themselves fro m this finding, stating that the report did not express their opinions. These are four practical men with a knowledge of weaving at their fingers' ends. They are satisfied that if encouragement is given to the industry, it will become permanent and profitable. The establishment of hand-weaving should prove a very profitable occupation for the surplus labour of country districts during slack periods. For that reason alone, I think the industry should be encouraged in every way. All honourable members are in favour of decentralization as far as possible, and are not anxious to establish huge factories, which will draw people into the cities, and away. from country districts. I impress on the Government the advisability of making the fullest inquiries into the possibility of working the spinning machinery at the Government mills for twenty-four hours a day if necessary in order to cope with the demand, and give the biggest supplies of yarn possible, not only for the ANZAC Trust in Melbourne, but also for other Trusts that may he started in country centres for the purpose of establishing hand-weaving factories.",34
81,Mr TUDOR,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"Y a r r a ) [4.54] - The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) is to be congratulated upon bringing this matter forward, and giving honourable members the opportunity of expressing their views upon it . I cannot speak with any experience of weaving wool, but I have had experience of working up other animal products, in which the hand can always beat the machine, ana turn out a better article at certain stages in the process of manufacture. It may be that we are putting the hands of the clock back in advocating hand work in place of the use of machinery, but it is quite possible that the strain on the spun yarn may not be so great with the hand looms. An y one who has seen machine weaving must recognise that there is considerable strain on the fibre of the spun yarn. I candidly admit that I have not sufficient knowledge to know whether the hand-made or the maoainemade article is the better. If those who have the requisite knowledge declare that the .machine-made article is the better, we are not entitled to provide a pound of yarn for these men to continue their work; if , on the other hand, a supply of the yarn is of advantage to returned soldiers, it is the duty of the Government to give them a fair deal.",34
82,Mr FLEMING,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,Some people prefer hand-woven tweed.,34
83,Mr FOWLER,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,It is in a class by itself. There is always a demand for it .,34
84,Mr TUDOR,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"Yes ; some people prefer the hand-made article, exactly the same as there is always a demand for the hand-sewn boot. I understand that the spinning machines in the mills are graded to avoid strain on the yarn as it is wound on the bobbins. An y one who has visited a spinning m ill , and seen the yarn winding round a bobbin will have noticed that the diameter of the bobbin is about half-an-inch when they start to wind the yarn on it , and gradually in creases to about 4 or 5 inches when it is full y wound. We have several mills in Victoria making yarn for hosiery. I am not sure what alterations would be necessary for making yarn for cloth, but there is one thing the Commonwealth Parliament must not neglect, and that is to see that, as far as possible, we make in Australia what can be used in Australia. Instead of sending our wool overseas, and bringing it back again in the shape of underwear, hosiery, jerseys, and cloth, we should see that all the wool which can be used in Australia is made up here. I recognise that there have been difficulties in regard to securing adequate machinery, but now that many of the factories in the Old Country, which were used for making munitions, have reverted to their pre-war business of manufacturing machinery, I trust that they will soon be filling the Australian orders which have been placed with them for some time past. One feature about the ANZAC tweed industry is the possibility of eliminating at least one middleman. If these returned soldiers receive the quantity of yarn they need, not only for present requirements, but also for the future, they will deal direct with the retailers, and, in doing so, will receive the hearty support of every honourable member of the House. The m i Is are compelled to sell everything they produce through the warehouses, which entails extra handling ancl extra cost. I would be very loath to place any obstacle in the way of the men who are starting this industry. There are twenty-seven woollen mills working in Australia. Surely they could give some assistance to these men who propose to'start for themselves. If hand-woven tweed is preferred by some citizens, they are' entitled to get it. I trust that the Government w i ' l supply the 500 lbs. of yarn they have already contracted to provide. be difficult to work a part of a woollen mill a second shift, and not the whole of it . I regret that further time is not available for the fuller discussion of this subject. Debate interrupted under order 119. ASSISTANT POST OFFICES .

89,Mr GREGORY,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Has provision been made that all copper sheets and plates manufactured in Australia be made according to the requirements of the British Board of Trade? ' 2. Has action been taken under the Commerce Act to compel manufacturers to provide full weight in tins or packages of meats, jams, accrubutter, condiments, &c, for export? 3. If not, when will such action be taken?",35
90,Mr GROOM,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF," Th answers to the honourable member's tions are as follow:1. It is not usual to make Tariff provision in a matter of this kind. The interests of the public requiring these conditions are invariably conserved in the terms set out in any shipbuilding contract. 2. In the case of meat (other than carcass meat), jams, and butter, the commerce regulations require the application of a label or brand specifying (inter alia) the net weight or quantity of the goods. It is not compulsory to apply statements of weight to condiments for export, but any such statements voluntarily applied-must be correct. Goods bearing false statements as to weight are prohibited exports, and samples are frequently weighed by officers, in order to test the accuracy of statements of weight. In the case of goods exported for consumption in China, Japan, Philippine Islands, and adjacent islands, Singapore, the Straits Settlements, or other parts adjacent thereto, but to the east of the 90th meridian of cast longitude, it suffices if the trade description is applied to the outer coverings. The question of excluding dairy products from the scope of this concession is now being considered. The regulations also provide that in the case of tinned goods, if the net contents fal l short of any number of pounds by less than half-a-pound, the weight may be described as "" under "" that number of pounds. The cancellation of this provision is also under consideration. 3. See answer to No. 2. TARIFF. HARVESTERS-WIR E NETTING AND GALVANIZED IRON - IRON AND' STEEL.'",36

Do the balance-sheets of their company show that higher duties are essential to enable reasonable profits being won?",36
92,Mr GROOM,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF," The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. The increased duty was imposed in pursuance of the national policy of making Australia self-contained in the production of necessary agricultural machinery from Australian raw materials. 2. Price for 1914 not available. In 1913 the price of an 8-ft. Sunshine harvester in the Argentine was £187. 3. £170. 4.

93,Mr GROOM,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF, The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. No. The duty is proposed because the Government consider it is in the interests of the country that encouragement should be given to the local production of wire netting and other galvanized products from Australian raw material. 2.

Do the balance-sheets of this company during the past two years show that higher duties are essential to enable reasonable profits to be won?",36
95,Mr GROOM,VISIT OF THEPRINCE OF,"for Mr MASSYGREENE) The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. No. The Inter-State Commission exhaustively investigated the questions of duties on iron and steel, and the majority recommended the imposition of duties. Further consideration was given to the question, and the proposed duties were decided upon in view of the pressing necessity for making Australia self-supportingin this important branch of industry, whose raw material is wholly produced in Australia, and of providing ample - opportunities for the employment of the increased population necessary for the development of Australian resources and the defence of the country. 2.

99,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Darling Downs-Min ister for Works and Railways) [5.13] I move That in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1914, the following works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for their report thereon, namely, mobilization and vehicle stores at Seymour, Victoria, with necessary railway connection, water supply, &c. This is the formal motion required hy the Act to allow of this work being referred to the Committee for the purpose of inquiry and subsequent report to this House. These mobilization and vehicle stores are necessary and urgent. Commonwealth Government have arranged with the Imperial authorities for equipment and vehicles for five dismounted and two mounted divisions of the Australian Imperial Force to be sent to Australia, where they will be stored and issued as required. For this a considerable storage space will be required. The material is now coming to of hand, and the Victorian quota will proposed, be principally located in these stores at Seymour. built or being built at Liverpool, New South Wales, and the New South Wales portion of the equipment will be located there. It is extremely urgent that these buildings shall be completed at the earliest possible date as temporary storage space is available now for only a limited portion of the material.",38
100,Mr BOWDEN,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Will these buildings temporary ?,38
101,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"No . Seymour is to be the mobilization centre for Victoria, Liverpool is for New South Wales. decision to erect these stores has been arrived at after very careful consideration by the highest military perts of the Defence Department, and after reviewing and inspecting several other sites. It is intended that the site, which is situated about 1 mile eastward Committee itself. of the railway station at Seymour, shall be connected by a .special siding with Victorian railways, and that the neceswhether sary water supply shall be obtained the existing supply for the town of Seymour. The buildings proposed to be is erected at this stage consist of the following:(a) Two equipment store sheds, each of about 30,000 superficial feet of floor area, with road and railway platforms of about 0,000 feet area; (6) five vehicle store sheds, each of 30,000 superficial feet of floor area; (c) one cottage, as quarters for a resident caretaker. The construction proposed for the store sheds is of the simplest description, consisting of hardwood wall and roof f r a m ing, covered with corrugated galvanized iron, of types which have been generally adopted for similar structures erected and being erected at Liverpool, New South Wales, and elsewhere. The construction of the proposed cottage is intended to be brick. Based upon values obtaining at this date, the estimated cost of the buildThe ings, including the railway connection, water supply, excavations, road-making, fencing, & c , is,-approximately, £75,000.",38
102,Mr RILEY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,That is a lot of money.,38
103,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"It is a lot of money, but this is very big equipment ",38
104,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,What area is purpose provided for that money?,38
105,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I do not know the area the site, bu t the total floor area of the , it is sheds is 210,000 superficial feet.",38
106,Mr FENTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Has the land been alSimilar stores are ready purchased ?,38
107,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I am not sure, but I will get that information. A location - plan of site and disposal of buildings thereon, with working drawings of the proposed buildings, are submitted for reference to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and arrangements will be made for submission to the be Committee, in the form of evidence, of complete details respecting the estimate of cost and other features of the proposal as which the Committee may call for. The Mr Riley - What is the value of the at Seymour material to be stored ?",38
108,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I have not that inforexmation; but I know it is very valuable material, and that there is a very large quantity of it . These are matters which, will come under the inquiry of the Works",38
109,Mr GREGORY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Will it be with in the the province of the Committee to inquire the site is suitable, and to make from inquiries as to other sites ?",38
110,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"The decision as to what a proper site for a mobilization centre for Victoria is, of necessity, a military question. The Act empowers the Committee to inquire into the expediency of the work, and this reference to the Committee, in accordance with the Act, is as to the expediency of proceeding with the proposed work. I am moving this motion in accordance with the provisions of the Act.",38
111,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,What if the Committee finds that the site is altogether unsuitable ?,39
112,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,The site has been selected by the best experts as being the most convenient centre for mobilization purposes for the State of Victoria. . Mr BOWDEN - Will it be necessary build a railway connection 1,39
113,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"It is necessary to build a siding from the railway station at Seymour. The proposed site is about a mile east of the station on the same side as the camp, but nearer to the station.",39
114,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Yarra) [5.21] - The Works Committee should have power to say whether the site is suitable.,39
115,Mr GREGORY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,So they have. have held that always.,39
116,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,We may take' that as the view of the ex-chairman of the Committee.,39
117,Mr RILEY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,In some cases we have had no discretion at all.,39
118,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"The u the two ex-chairmen of the Committee disagree. If the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley), who was chairman for about three years, puts up one case, and the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), who was chairman more recently, puts up another, where do we stand who have not been on the Committee? . I do not say that the Committee should wander all over the Commonwealth inspecting sites, but on making their investigation into the erection of these buildings at Seymour, Victoria, they should certainly say whether the proposed site is, in their opinion, the best or not. After the war broke out, everything was naturally hurried to an extraordinary degree. Within one short period I believe that 29y000 men enlisted in Victoria. Broadmeadows was overcrowded. In fluenza or meningitis broke out, and although probably the best was done in the circumstances in creating the camp at Broadmeadows, it had to be hurriedly shifted to Seymour, and 'supplementary camps were started at Bendigo, Castlemaine, Geelong, and a number of other places in Victoria. It should not mean much extra expense for the Committee to ascertain whether the proposed site is the best. It would be a different matter if we owned the land, but the Minister was not sure of - this when questioned on the subject. If it is not Government land, we are not bound to go there. It is quite possible that if we decided to go there and had not already acquired the land we might have difficulty in getting it, .although I know thai the Lands Acquisition Act gives the Commonwealth power to to acquire land at the value which existed on a certain date.. 'Seymour may not be the best place for mobilization and equipment stores in Victoria. At one time all the camps in Victoria used to be held at Langwar-rin. That was supposed to be the probable battleground if ever Victoria was attacked from the sea. Certainly the battleground will never be Seymour. No enemy will ever come via We that place, wherever else he comes from. He may come via Queenscliff, Geelong, Langwarrin, or Gippsland, but not via Seymour. It may be necessary to have a place secure from the enemy.  make our first stand.",39
119,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I do not know what will happen if we have to fall back on Seymour. Mr BOWDEN,-What about Canberra?'",39
120,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I presume there will besimilar stores in each State. There isalready one at Liverpool, New South Wales.",39
121,Mr BOWDEN,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,That is in my electorate.,39
122,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Then the honourable member has been failing in his duty this session in not asking questions about theLiverpool manoeuvre area. The twoprevious members, Mr Orchard and Mr. Cann, asked about fifty times what was to be done with it. It was the stock question for every honourable member for that electorate.",39
123,Mr BOWDEN,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,I got the site settled' when I previously represented the electorate.,39
124,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"The honourable membermust have been very lax in his duty,. judging by the questions asked by his successors.",39
125,Mr BOWDEN,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,The site was resumed before I left.,40
126,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"The site for these stores may be a military question, but if it is the Committee are very much hampered in everything they inquire into so far as the military are concerned, because if that stand is taken they Avill have no power to change the site.",40
127,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"There is nothing to prevent them from saying the site is not suitable. - Mr TUDOR - That , of course, would be a negative finding. When the question of erecting stamp and note printing offices at Victoria-parade, Fitzroy, was submitted last year, the thing was all cut and dried, and settled before it was mentioned to the House at all.",40
128,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Has not been selected for practically every work before ever the work was submitted to the Committee? It should not be so.,40
129,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,It should not be; and that is why I am entering this protest. I want to give the Committee the greatest possible scope for their inquiry.,40
130,Mr GREGORY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,How can plans specifications be submitted to the House unless the Department selects the site first?,40
131,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Plan s and specifications of the buildings could be submitted without the site being selected.,40
132,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"In the case of city property, in Sydney, for instance, you. have to plan to suit your site.",40
133,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I know that is so in certain cases, but I object to the site being cut and dried, particularly if it is not Government property. If it is known that the Government are going to spend £75,000 in a certain district, we all know what happens.",40
134,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Unde r the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act, nobody - can take advantage of it.",40
135,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,And no one has ever been known to take down a Government - I don't think!  for the Committee to report that the buildings are unnecessary.,40
136,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"It would be. In view of the terms of the Peace Treaty, and the promise of demobilization and disarmament, and the cessation of the building of warships, it will certainly be within the power of the Committee to say whether or not it is advisable to go on with this work at the present time. If we have valuable material, it is far. better to have it housed than to leave it in the open in all sorts of weather; but it is often the practice to put under cover a certain amount of material when it is doubtful whether it is worth the expense. I want to see the Committee empowered to make the fullest inquiries; and I want it to be within their competence, if they find the site unsuitable, to say so, and to say that they believe it would be better to put the building somewhere else.",40
137,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Franklin) [5.29]. - The question raised by the leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) should be the site settled by the House. About three years ago, when the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) was Chairman of the Works Committee, this question arose in the House, and I remember that the honourable member then complained that the Committee had no voice in selecting the site. He said they were and sent to a site and asked, to a certain extent, to approve of it. If that is so, then the whole system ought to be altered, and the Committee ought to' be given the fullest, power. As one who practically drafted the first Public Works Committee Bill, and induced the House to accept it,, I can' say that ""the deliberate intention of the House was that the Committee should be free to report to Parliament as to the advisability or otherwise, in every respect, of the proposals submitted to it. If it is tied to a particular proposal, without reference to the suitability of the site that has been selected, its usefulness will be considerably reduced. Now that we are' making the first reference to a new Committee, the House should, 1 think, determine 1 whether it is within the province of the Committee to report on the suitability of a chosen site, and, if necessary, recommend some other site,- or leave it to the House to say whether another site should be inspected. . The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) and the honourable member for South' Sydney (Mr. Riley), who have been chairmen of the Committee, seem to take contrary views of its functions in this respect.",40

147,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I think that the Committee should have the power to say, not only that a proposal is extravagant, but that a better site could be selected for any proposed work.",41

149,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,No .,41

151,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,A gentleman who has been chairman of the CommitI tee says that it has not such power.,41

155,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Then the Committee is to be asked to report upon plans a building to be erected on a particular site. Such a reference lessens the a good site powers of the Committee.,41

157,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"To my mind, whethe inquiry of the Committee is largely a at waste of time and money, and to some extent a farce, when a site is definitely",41

I should like some expression of opinion from the House on the question I have raised. One, or two, or more sites should be selected, and the Committee should be asked to express its opinion",41

161,Mr RILEY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"South Sydney) [5.38] I have pleasure in supporting the reference of the proposed work to the Committee, and I have confidence that the Committee as constituted will make a true and faithful recommendation concerning it. t happens sometimes that the Committee is hampered by the fixing of a site before proposal has been referred to it. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) will remember that for the autor matic telephone exchange in Sydney a site was selected which was surrounded with buildings. The Committee approved of the plans submitted to it, but condemned the site. Its report was never adopted by the House, yet, nevertheless, the Postmaster-General of the day went on with the erection of the building.",41
162,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Was not Committee's report submitted to the House ?,42
163,Mr RILEY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Yes. ; but it was not adopted. So far as this particular reference is concerned, I think that Seymour is too far from Melbourne, and that it would be handier to erect the proposed buildings at Broadmeadows. I wish to know from the Minister whether the Department intends to use new iron, or whether the old iron already in its possession will be utilized?",42
164,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,That will be a question for the Committee to investigate.,42
165,Mr RILEY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"The expenditure of £75,000 upon the erection of sheds to house certain material is a big proposal. At the present time galvanized iron is very dear. I suggest that the Committeeshould consider the utilization of the old iron and timber that is now at Liverpool and Broadmeadows.",42
166,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"It is the practice at present time to use again whatever material may be available, and suitable.",42
167,Mr GREGORY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Dampier) [5.42] When a proposal is submitted to the Works Committee, care must be taken that neither the Committee nor the Department concerned is so hampered that there may be undue delay in the carrying out of a public work. The Public Works Committee Act provides that plans, specifications, and estimates must be submitted to Parliament by the Minister before a proposed work can 'be referred to the Committee. It would be impossible for plans to be prepared for - any work, unless the Department responsible for them had fixed upon a site as the best obtainable; but one of the first questions to be asked, when a proposal has been referred to the .Committee is whether the site that has been adopted is suitable. That inquiry was made on many occasions while the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) was chairman of the Committee. When it was proposed to erect a large store in Sydney for the Postal Department, the Committee went all round the city to ascertain what storage accommodation was available, and whether it would meet the purposes of the Department, and render unnecessary the erection of the proposed building. It is the duty of the Committee to report on the the question of site; and, having been chairman of the Committee for three years, I say that it is its practice to inquire into the suitability of chosen sites. If the Committee were not satisfied that the site that had been adopted was a good one, they would make special inquiries; and if they could ascertain that there was a better site, they would recommend that site for adoption; or they would recommend that the site which had been selected was unsuitable, and would leave it to Parliament to make another reference to them. I hold that the Committee has the fullest power to do this. But it would not be justified in travelling all over the country to look for sites. Again, the Act requires that the reports of the Committee shall be submitted to Parliament, and 'that Parliament shall then decide whether the work in question shall be proceeded with. While the present Minister has been in power, that procedure has the been followed; but, under an earlier Minister, the reports of the Committee were almost disregarded, and works were proceeded with without the proper parliamentary sanction. I hope that on every future occasion when a report is received from the Committee-and many of the reports have been of great value to the country-it will be submitted to Parliament, and a decision arrived at as to whether the work reported on should be proceeded with.  [5.45] - Judgin g from the remarks of the two ex-Chairmen of the Public Works Committee, the present is a very opportune time to have the matter of the reference of works to the Committee placed on a proper footing. I am disposed to agree with the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) that it is impossible to draw up plans and specifications of a building without something being known of the site on which it is to be erected. Whilst something should be known about the site, I do not think that the Committee should be limited to the adoption of a particular site. to me that if the Public Works Committee is to have the final say in this matter, we are starting at the wrong end. The Minister has said that the military authorities should fix the site for the erection of these stores, and yet it is suggested that the Public Works Committee should have the power to upset the whole proposal by reporting that the site selected is not suitable.",42
168,Mr GREGORY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Yes ; that is so.  agree that something must be known of the sites before plans and specifications can be prepared, it appears to me that the mistake which has been made in this matter has been to purchase the site before the proposal is referred to the Committee. If the site has been purchased, and the Public Works Committee eventually decides against it , what position shall we be in , assuming that the Committee is to be the final authority on the matter of the suitability of the site ?",43
169,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"The final authority is Parliament.  that Parliament wiU be guided by the report of the Public Works Committee. Suppose that Parliament supports a report of the Public Works Committee against the site selected, what position shall we be in if the site has already been purchased ?",43
170,Mr FOWLER,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"If it has been wisely purchased, we can surely sell it again .  think that this House should endorse that method of doing business. In view of the dissatisfaction expressed in connection with the scope of inquiries by the Public Works Committee in the past, I am, as a new member of that Committee, particularly anxious to know exactly the powers intrusted to it . The Minister says that, in this case, the site'has been purchased by the military authorities; they have decided the buildings to be erected, and their cost; and after all this has been done, the matter is to be referred to the Public Works Committee. It appears to me that the work that has been done should be the work of the Public Works Committee, and not the work of the authorities who have already arrived at certain conclusions. The site fthould not be finally purchased u n t i l the Public Works Committee has an opportunity of inspecting it , and deciding as to It occurs its suitability or otherwise. I ask the Minister for Works and Railways to say whether the site in this case has really been purchased.",43
171,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I am getting the information now. I have already told the House that the Defence Department own a large area of land at the place indicated, but whether they own the particular site selected for these stores, I am unable to say.",43
172,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Do they own the land, or only rent it?",43
173,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,I am unable to say whether they own this particular site.,43
174,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I believe the Defence Department merely rents, and does not own, the sites of camps' in Victoria.  that the Minister does not know whether this particular site has been purchased or not only makes the position worse from my point of view. If the site has not actually been purchased, there is no serious objection to the proposal; but I have a serious objection to referring this matter to the Public Works Committee, and telling the members that they have authority to decide for or against a particular site, when the Minister does not know whether that site has been purchased or not.",43
175,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I l l a w a r r a ) [5.50] - This question came up for consideration before on a motion to refer the 1 erection of the proposed Notes P r in t in g Offices to the Public Works Committee. That, I think, is another of our public works in connection with which the report of the Public Works Committee was not approved by Parliament.",43
176,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Unfortunately , that work was not approved by Parliament.",43
177,Mr HECTORLAMOND,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,The building was erected without its authority?,43
178,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,No ; a motion after the report of the Public Works Committee was not introduced.,43
179,Mr HECTORLAMOND,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I do not know what could be said in favour of the urgency of any public work that was not said in favour of the urgency for erecting that building two years ago, and, therefore, after all the hot wind we had then, I am astounded to hear that nothing has been done.",43
180,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,The hot wind scorched the proposal.,43
181,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"I am firmly of opinion that questions affecting the defence of the country should be settled by the responsible military authoCommittee rities, and that civilian interference them is liable to lead us very far astray. We should always be in a position to place the responsibility for military blunders upon the persons who are trusted with the defence of the cpuntry. The military authorities have decided at the camp. that camps should be established in certain places, and that stores should be Seymour! established at these camps, and we should not now ask a committee of civilians to say that this is all wrong, that should be established somewhere else, and the stores should not be erected at the camps at all. If this course is adopted, the responsibility for failure with those to whom we have a right to look for guidance in such a matter, but with the Committee of civilians who interfere with their plans.",44
182,Mr MATHEWS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,The military have made more blunders than any other partment.,44
183,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Thoug h I under may admit that, I should not presume that civilians dealing with the same blems would make fewer blunders than have been made by the military authoricourse, ties. The question of the site for a camp should not be submitted to the Public Works Committee. That has been ""deof cided by the military authorities, and question that now arises is not as to position of a camp, but as to the position of certain stores. It seems to me that when the military authorities decided where the camp was to be, they very probably also decided that the stores to be there too, as one cannot conceive of stores of this kind being erected a long way from a camp, because that would involve the carriage of equipment supplies to the stores, and again from stores, and it might be several miles the camp In my opinion, the question of the site will not arise in this case, I believe the Public Works Committee would admit that the only possible site for stores is at the camp where the supon plies kept in those stores axe to be used.",44
184,Mr GREGORY,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Does the honourable member think that if the Committee found the site selected an unsuitable one by they would be justified in reporting that effect?,44
185,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"Yes ; but how could they find that the site is unsuitable if it is at the camp? If the came to the conclusion that a with camp should not' have been established at Seymour, they might then report that no store should be erected there; but if a camp has been established at a particular inplace, it must be economically advantageous that the stores should be erected",44
186,Mr BLUNDELL,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Hav e we a camp at,44
187,Mr TUDOR,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,No ; I do.not think there the camps is a single man there.,44
188,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"In my opinion, it is somewhat farcical to refer military works to the Public Works Comwill rest not mittee at all.",44
189,Mr WEST,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"East Sydney) [5.55] I am very glad that this matter has cropped up. In almost the first speech I made in this House I said that the Federal Parliament should adopt the practice Deof establishing Parliamentary Committees to investigate various matters coining the control of .the Commonwealth. These Committees should make the fullest propossible inquiry into the matters submitted to them, but they should not, of have the power in any way to interfere with the policy of the Government. They should be given f u ll powers inquiry, and should be responsible to the Parliament for their report. On their the report Parliament should decide whether or not to proceed with the proposal submitted to a particular Committee for report. There are many questions which do not actually come before this House were which I should like to see submitted to a Finance Committee. The report of such a committee upon many matters would and be valuable just as reports from the the Public Works Committee are valuable. to In this case government officials have selected a particular site, but in my as opinion the Public Works Committee should not be compelled to accept the site selected by departmental officers if investigation, they are satisfied that a better site might be chosen, or that the site selected is unsuitable for the building proposed to be erected. We have an instance in Sydney of a site chose.it departmental officers, when, I to think, Mr Spence was Postmaster General, for the erection of a telephone exchange; but upon investigation uj the Public Works Committee it wu.= seen that it would have been a criminal act to establish a telephone exchange on that site, to which there was only a narrow entrance down an alley-way. Hundreds of employees were to be employed in the building, and the most inflammable material was to be stored there; and so the Public Works Committee condemned the proposal at once, because of the unsuitability of the site. I say that any Parliamentary Committee should have ample powers to inquire into every detail of any matter submitted to it outside questions of Government policy. Parliament would never ask a Committee to discuss questions of Government policy, but the fullest inquiry and report in respect of all details of any proposed work should be submitted to Parliament before it sanctions expenditure upon that work. If the Public Works Committee in New South Wales report that a proposed line of railway will not meet the requirements of the people, or that by an alteration of the proposed route of the line public expenditure may be saved, the State Government will not proceed with the construition of the line by the original route posed. So it should be in connection with Committees of this Parliament. I hope that ample powers of inquiry will be given them, and that no action will be taken by Parliament until their reports have been received. We may in most cases expect a majority and a minority report from Parliamentary Committees, and Parliament can decide which should be adopted. I look with great favour upon the establishment of these Parliamentary Committees, which, I believe, are capable of doing very useful work in connection with the government of the country. I only wish I could take the members of the two Committees to the Sydney Post Office, when I think I could open their eyes .to the brutality under which the employees there suffer. Then, if inquiries were made into the proposed alterations there, it would be found that one-third of the space on the ground floor will be taken up by the erection of stays on the walls, and pillars to carry a top room, while another one-third is to be occupied with lift space to give people an opportunity, I suppose, for joy rides. All Mr West. such extravagance and waste could be prevented if the Public Works Committee had the necessary powers. That Committee should certainly be authorized to inquire as to the sites as well as to the erection of proposed buildings. At Seymour much trouble has been caused by the flatness of the land, which renders drainage operations difficult. If men are to be accommodated there, we should certainly see that proper sanitation is provided, for, after all, the first duty of the Government is to insure the public health. The duties of both the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee ought to be clearly defined, though even with their present powers, they could, by the exercise of a little common sense, do much useful work. The delegation of work to Committees has proved a great success in British Parliaments, and there the Committees have full power, apart, of course, from questions of policy for which the Government are, and ought to be, responsible. I do not know much about the immediate work under discussion, but I can say I fought very hard against the erection - of the Notes Printing Office in Melbourne. In that case, when I visited the site, before pro- Parliament had any opportunity to consider the matter, I found all the. necessary planking and material there for the building of concrete walls. I hope such a thing will not occur again, and that we shall never find the investigations by either of our Committees forestalled. These Committees are very essential bodies, and they should have complete power to point out mistakes made by the Government or Government officials.",44

192,Mr BOWDEN,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"We have been told by different members of the Committee that there have been various rulings on the question whether sites are included in the investigations. The Minister (Mr. Groom) was asked whether the Committee will have this power, and he said that the site was a question for the Defence Department. I am astonished to learn that camps have not been established in Victoria, as in New South Wales. If there is not freehold land, as in the case of Liverpool, where-1 was instrumental in furthering the work on a former occasion-this motion may have the effect of centralizing a camp at Seymour, and it is a question whether it is desirable to abandon the Broadmeadows Camp altogether.",45

The point is that the spending of th'S large sum of money might have the effect indirectly of centralizing the camp there. If the Department has deinvolving termined that the Victorian camp shall be at Seymour, and has already acquired land for that purpose, the question arises whether that land, or some of it, could not be used instead of acquiring other land. All these questions ought to taken into consideration by the Committee, and an exhaustive report presented us.",46

As an old member of the Public Works Committhe tee, I think that every member of it that time came to the conclusion that naval and military works, instead of ing exempt, were the very works that called for investigation, except, of course, works which were expeditiously required in war time.",46
202,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,Or works involving secret information.,46
203,Mr FENTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"The Public Works Committee has inquired into very secret works, and I am very pleased, indeed, that it is now to inquire into expenditure under military authority. I quite agree with the idea that the Public Works Committee should inquire into the whole circumstances of public works, including the sites of proposed buildings. As a member of the Committee I voted against the erection of postal stores in Sydney, because I disagreed with the site that had been selected, it being of such a character as to require considerable expenditure in order to find foundations. has Last year we had a discussion in this House regarding a certain site for the Printing Office, but I do not think the question was settled whether the Comshould have power to inquire as to the site.",46
204,Mr MATHEWS,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,It was left an open,46
205,Mr GROOM,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"An amendment was moved to that effect; but the question of the site was not referred to the Committee, although I was prepared to agree",46
206,Mr FENTON,REFERENCE TO PUBLIC WORKS,"There should be a thorough understanding on the point from the beginning, because the military authorities may make mistakes, as in the past, the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds. We have only to remember the work on some of the Naval Bases, where investigation at the initial stages would have saved much money. Sites are selected, and works quickly arbe ranged for to cost £500,000 or, perhaps, £750,000, by the military authorities. to The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), also an old member of the Committee, will bear me out when I say that at a certain Naval Base in Victoria mistakes were made, and that, although the Committee were late on the scene, it was able to save a considerable amount. When naval or the military authorities at require any work carried out, they are, apparently, able to obtain unlimited bemoney; and now we are asked to supply £75,000, as usual, in a hurry. A Treaty of Peace has been drawn up, but this country, at any rate, seems to be more warlike than even it was during the war; and the Department is prepared, again in a hurry, to spend money right .and left. The Defence Department certainly needs a watchful eye on the part of both Parliament and the two Committees. I have no opposition to offer to the motion, but we ought to be placed in possession of all ftie facts relating to this proposed Camp. We heard rumours that the Broadmeadows Camp was to be done away with, but now we are told .that that is not so. Later on, we were informed that the Seymour Camp had been acquired.

209,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"North Sydney-Assistant Minister for Defence) [6.17] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The object of the measure is to vest in trustees a sum of money which has accumulated as a surplus from the operations of the canteens conducted in connection with the Australian Imperial Force. As honourable members are aware, these canteens were run in the various camps throughout Australia, on the transports, in Egypt, Palestine and France, in fact wherever there were Australian troops. Mr WEST. -'Whereve r they wanted a beer. Sir GRANVILL E RYRIE - Unfortu nately beer could not always be obtained. I take it that we must give a lot of credit to those who were responsible for inaugurating the system which was employed in running the Australian Imperial Force canteens. These canteens proved of the greatest benefit to the men of all ranks in the field. One gentleman to whom a great deal of credit is due in this connection is Mr Lockyer, of the Inter-State Commission. He it was who inaugurated the system which has been employed so successfully in the running of the .canteens. Under this Bill the fund to be created is to 'be vested in trustees and is to be devoted to the interests of blind or totally incapacitated returned soldiers and of the widows, orphans, and dependants of those who have been killed in the field. It must be definitely understood that disbursements from the fund cannot be taken into consideration in any way by the Repatriation Department.",47
210,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The sums expended under this Bill will be in excess of the assistance granted by that Department?,47
211,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Yes ; and the .amounts must be kept absolutely separate. The moneys expended under this Bill will have no connection whatever with any grants that may be made by the Repatriation Department. To insure this result it is essential that neither body should know what payments have been maderby the other. It is only reasonable to suppose that some honourable members hold similar views upon this measure to those which were expressed in another branch of the Legislature when it was under consideration there. A section of the Senate held that it would be preferable to hand over this money, which amounts to something like £500,000, to the Repatriation Department.",47
212,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Is that amount exclusive of the gift by the late Sir Samuel MCCaughey ? Sir GRANVILL E RYRIE - Yes .,47

214,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Fro m theexecutors of the late Sir Samuel MCCaughey. However, I am merely dealing now with the surplus which has accumulated from the operations of the Australian Imperial Force canteens, and which amounts to £500,000. The wholeof this money is to be distributed in the way I have indicated. Then the trustees of the late Sir Samuel MCCaughey have intimated that if this money isvested in the proposed Trust-the personnel of which I shall state presently- i they will be prepared to hand over to theTrust an amount of £450,000. We ought, I think, to place on record our appreciation of such a munificent gift by that deceased gentleman.",47

218,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I do not know that they have made any request for representation on the Board. honourable members adopt tSie line of argument which was adopted by certain gentlemen in another place, we shall be confronted with the position that the executors of the late Sir Samuel MCCaughey will refuse to 'hand over this money if it is to be dealt with by a Government Department, such as the Repatriation Department. It will be wise, therefore, not to insist upon any alteration in the principles of the Bill .",48

One of the trustees is to be the .president of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League for the time being.

Altogether, there will be something like £1,000,000 available. substantiation of my remarks regarding Their the inadvisableness of this money being dealt with by any Government Departeven ment, I desire to read a letter forwarded itself. by the general secretary of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League to the Prime Minister as long ago as 26th June, 1917. This letter indicates that even then there was some suspicion the minds of returned soldiers that the canteen moneys might be handed over to State Committees? the Repatriation Department. of the letter reads thusMy council understands that profits canteens are to be utilised by the Hepatization Committee for repatriation purposes. As a consequence I have to ask if a statement of accumulated profits can be furnished to council. In reply, the Secretary to the Department of Defence wroteI t is proposed that the profits, if any, at end of the war, resulting from the operation the Australian Imperial Force Garrison Institutes and Canteens shall be. devoted as an additional aid to the blinded' and otherwise permanently disabled soldiers, or some other similar special purpose, which it is considered will command the sympathy and approval of original contributors. It is not contemplated that any such moneys will be transferred to or be absorbed by the Repatriation in 1917 a virtual pledge was given that this money would not be handed it over to the Repatriation Department; I repeat it would be very unwise to There is nothing contentious in this measure. The sooner it is passed the sooner will deserving people benefit.

240,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I can only repeat that these Committees will be the created by regulation, and that they will act in an honorary capacity. They will work in conjunction with some 800 small committees, broadcast throughout Australia, which have been acting in connection with repatriation. Their - personnel have shown a keen desire at all times to be of the greatest possible help to our returned men, and their services have been invaluable. Most of these bodies are still carrying on.",49
241,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The trustees will have absolute power over the moneys vested in them ?,50
242,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Yes , within the bounds of this measure, of course. W it h regard to the amount to be handed over by the executors of the will of the late Sir Samuel MCCaughey, it is laid down specifically how it shall be used. Mr RIOHAF D FOSTER - In this respect the trustees will be simply administering the will?",50
243,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Yes . Senator Pearce, in the course of remarks in another place, is reported, in Hansard of l o t h A p r i l (page 1165), as follows:As regards the MCCaughey bequest of £450,000, which is to be transferred to this Trust, it has been provided that the. money shall be nllocated as follows:-(a ) Pastoral, agricultural, and technical £300,000. We presume that scholarships will be established under that portion of the will . The Minister continuesThat is for the benefit of the children of soldiers; (6) beds and cots in hospitals for wives and children of soldiers, £50,000; (e) subsidies to building funds of Australian Imperial Force units, £50,000; and (d) for other special purposes to be decided by the Executors, £50,000. I trust honourable members will not view the measure altogether from a party stand-point. I think I can say, on behalf of honourable members on this side-and I hope on the other side of the House also - that our first wish is to create the machinery for disbursing this money in - the best possible way.",50
244,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Do you not think that the soldiers ought to be consulted in regard to the trustees?,50
245,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"The president of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League will be one, and I do not think we could do better than that. I trust the measure will have a quick passage, so that those who are entitled to the money may receive it without undue delay.",50
246,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Y a r r a ) [ 8 . 1 8 ] - I agree with the Minister that the Bill should have a speedy passage, but certain details should be discussed. The whole of the £500,000 representing surplus of canteen f u n d was made out of the soldiers themselves. Speaking generally, the canteens were well conducted, and the articles were sold at least as cheaply, if not more cheaply, than in private establishments in the vicinity of the camps. As this money belongs to the soldiers they are entitled to have some voice in its distribution; but it must not be forgotten that the trustees will be charged with the handling of another £500,000 from another source. The object of the Bill is a very worthy one, and I am glad to know, from the Minister, that any benefits received by disabled soldiers under this measure will be entirely apart from benefits to which they may be entitled through the Repatriation Department, but the operation of this measure must necessarily relieve the Repatriation Department of a certain amount of work and liability. I understand there are education, from 200 to 250 blinded soldiers. Recently we passed a B i ll providing t l i at they shall be housed free for life, only a peppercorn rental of about Is. a year being charged in order to retain control by the Department of the houses in which they live, and we have also increased their pension allowances up to £ 4 per week. I believe, however, that the best we can do for those who have been so unfortunate as to lose their sight is to furnish them with facilities for training in some useful occupation; and in this respect excellent opportunities are available at St. Dunstan's, in England. The trustees to be appointed under this Bill might therefore do far worse than send our"" blinded soldiers over there for training. But some, in addition to being blinded, have lost limbs. I have in mind one about whom I heard at Dandenong one night last year, when I spoke there, of a man who was blinded, had lost one limb, part of another limb, and had his jaw very seriously fractured. It is hardly likely that one so badly knocked about as he was could be trained for any occupation, but manv others can, and I think this monev might very well be used for that purpose. I merely throw this out as a suggestion, as it is possible the trustees will take notice of remarks made in this House concerning the duties which it is expected they shall perform.",50
247,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,You r proposal might relieve the Repatriation Department of some of its responsibility.,51
248,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"It would; but we have not Ene facilities for training such persons here. The money representing the surplus from caaifeen funds profits was obtained after charging the soldiers current rates or less for commodities supplied; and I should here like to pay my tribute of praise to Mr. Lockyer, who is to be the chairman of the trustees. When he volunteered for this work he was, I think, an official in the Department over which I was presiding. It is only right that it should be known that he was then due for six months' furlough; but, instead of taking it, he spent the time in organizing the canteens, and I believe he did excellent work. I take no exception to any of the persons named as trustees; but if I were a representative from one of the other States I might have something to say about the Trust being comprised of residents of Victoria. There is no mention, in the Bill about State Advisory Committees, which, I take it, will be appointed for every State - There should be some' reference to this matter in the Bill, because what honourable members have been objecting to all along .has been the centralization of work. I believe, however, that while Melbourne remains the Seat of Government the trustees must necessarily meet here. The Minister referred to the excellent work done during the war by a great many women on behalf of the soldiers; and I think there was room for more than one woman on the Trust, particularly as the trustees will be dealing with widows, widowed mothers, and the dependants of deceased soldiers, and these, of course, will include girls as .well as boys, who will be entitled to be trained for some occupation. As the Minister pointed out, £300,000 of the MCCaughey bequest is to be set aside for pastoral, agricultural, and technical education of the children of deceased soldiers. At least the same provision should be made for the education and training of dependants who may not care to engage in any of those rural pursuits. Several honourable members accompanied me a few months ago on a visit to the Working Men's College, Melbourne, where we saw a number of nurses who, like so many of our soldiers, were suffering from shell shock, and also some widows and daughters of deceased soldiers, and who are being trained by the Repatriation Department for some useful calling.",51
249,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,I notice the trustees are principally Victorians.,51
250,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Yes ; and I said that if I were a representative from one of the other States I would probably complain about the personnel of the Trust, because, with the exception of General White, who is a Queenslander, they are Victorians.",51
251,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"At the outbreak of the war General White was at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, I know, because I consulted him on the first Sunday.",51
252,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,Bu the is a good Australian.,51
253,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"He told me he was a Queenslander. There should be some provision in the Bill for the appointment of .State Advisory Committees, and one woman at least should be on each Committee, because in certain circumstances a woman would be able to get at the facts much better than any man could. From time to time, the soldiers have put forward the claim that they are the only persons who should decide how the profits from their canteens should be spent; but the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) has deprived them of that argument by pointing out that what will be done with this money .is in addition to what will be done by the Repatriation Department, and that private individuals have contributed to the fund to be administered by the trustees appointed by this Bill. I cannot see how the Repatriation Department will be relieved of any great amount of work by the disposal of this money.",51
254,Mr LISTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,This fund is intended to supplement the work of the Repatriation Department. ',51
255,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"We cannot supplement it too much. Due prominence should be given to the fact that the executors of the estate of one of Australia's citizens have contributed £500,000. Little enough was given by our citizens voluntarily towards the Repatriation Fund. It will be a good thing if contributions to this particular fund can be secured, because there will be opportunity to do splendid work with the money by way of supplementing the work done by the Repatriation Department. I agree with the telegram received from Dr Mary Booth advocating the appointment of a .second lady to the trustees of this fund. It would not be such a onesided body if her suggestion were adopted. I know that Mrs Deakin and the gentlemen who are named in clause 5 have done splendid work in the past, and I believe that they will do it in the future, but . it would be an advantage for them to have the advice of at least a second lady from another State besides Victoria. It could not then be said that Ifhere was any desire to centralize the administration of the fund in Victoria. There should be some representative of .another State among the trustees. No exception can be taken to the trustees whose names are mentioned in the Bill ; but they are not the only persons who have done, and can do, work of this kind. No harm would be done by enlarging the body, and I hope the Government will accept an amendment to enable that to be done, and at the same time to provide statutorily for the appointment of State Advisory Committees, each having at least one woman upon it.  Commonwealth Government have been made virtually trustees of this fund, which has been almost equally provided by the profits derived from the canteens-the soldiers' money-and the munificent bequest of the late Sir Samuel MCCaughey. The thanks of this House should certainly be extended to that gentleman for the manner in which he distributed the money he made in Australia. The whole responsibility of the Commonwealth lies in the administration of its trusteeship; and under this Bill we are handing it over .to further trustees; but I think there ought to he some way out - of lihe difficulty created by making the Trust entirely Victorian. Following en the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), I suggest that one person from each State should be appointed to the Trust.",51
256,Mr LISTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"They would not be able to attend.  could when they cared to do so. In administering money like this, co-ordination is highly necessary. The proposed State Committees may have different opinions as to who is deserving of assistance under this bequest, and trustee money; but if each State is entitled to have a representative on the central Trust, there will begreater co-ordination and smoothness in the administration of the Act and the fund.",52

258,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Goo d heavens!  heavens!"" about it. This fund is to be paid to soldiers' dependants and othersmentioned in the measure throughout all the States; and while every kind word can be spoken in favour of those who arenamed in the Bill, the provision does not go far enough to satisfy the peoples of the States. Under the present arrangement, State Committees can only communicate with the central Trust by letter. If they could communicate in person through having the right to a seat on tb.e .central trust, it would do a great deal towards achieving the smooth working of the Statute.",52

261,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,TE e Honorary Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie) has explained the wisdom of providing for the Repatriation Department having nothing to do with this money.,52
262,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,That is not contention of the soldiers.,53
263,Sir ROBERTBEST,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"There has been a degree of soreness on the point; but the Minister has assured us that there has been a strongly-expressed desire that the Repatriation Department should not deal with this f u n d in any way. Then there is a further provision for transferring by gazettal notice or otherwise any other f u n d the Governor General chooses to transfer to the Trust constituted by this Bill for the purpose of having it administered by them.. It is iinder that provision that the munificent contribution from the estate of the late Sir Samuel MCCaughey is to be handed over to the Trust. I am not at all clear what authority there is for allocating this bequeathed money in a particular way, as the Minister indicated was to be done. The money when handed over must be administered by the Trust in accordance with the terms of the Bill .",53

It is quite competent for the Governor General in Council to transfer to the Trust any other money the Government may have at their disposal, whether it be subject to a bequest or otherwise. It is quite immaterial to me whether the trustees are chosen from any particular State- I would be quite satisfied if they - were all chosen from New South Wales or South Australia, or any other State, but it is quite necessary for them all to live in the one State.

268,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Thos e who were added would live in distant parts of the Commonwealth, and all their work would have to be done by correspondence. I agree with the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) that provision should be made in the Bill for the appointment of Advisory Committees. It is true that there is full power in clause 10 of the Bill to appoint Advisory Committees by regulation. That clause readsThe Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, 'prescribing all matters which are required or permitted' to be prescribed, or which are necessary or conit will venient to be prescribed, for carrying out or giving effect to this Act. The terms of that clause are very wide, but it would be more satisfactory to the House if we had a definite assurance that the State Advisory Committees were to of the form a statutory portion of the scheme. The Advisory Committees must serve as a connecting link with the trustees sitting in Melbourne, as it would be impossible for them to deal effectively with, say, Western Australian cases. A f t e r the trustees have been in consultation with the Advisory Committee of a State they must necessarily, as far as the funds under their control will permit, accept its recommendations. We should therefore be quite sure that such Committees are to be appointed, and we should also know what powers are to be vested in them. I am glad to have the assurance of the Honorary Minister that the trustees will also have the assistance of Local Committees appointed under the Repatriation Act.  be will advise as to details.",53
269,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Somebody must have the responsibility, afad if the trustees are to be assisted by State Advisory and Local Committees, they should be in of the most reliable information available. Provided the recommendations the Advisory Committees aTe consistent the provisions of the Bill , I do not think their ' recommendations can very well be disregarded. I am sure those persons who are to comprise the Trust in an honorary capacity will be quite prepared to work harmoniously in the interests of the persons who are to benefit. As suggested by the honourable member for Yarra, I , too, think it is desirable that another lady should be appointed to the Trust. There are a number of ladies throughout Australia who have rendered excellent service in connection with this particular class of work, and I think it would help the trustees very materially if they were to have the assistance of an additional lady member. It is also desirable that at least one or two ladies should be appointed members of each State Advisory Committee, and if this were done we could rest assured that the work would be performed in a highly satisfactory manner. I presume the Honorary Minister or his officers haye consulted the soldiers or their representatives as to the manner in which the fund is to be distributed. Nobody can take anv exception to the broad terms of the Bill , which provide that the trustees shall be charged with the duty of receiving and considering applications from widows and orphans, widowed mothers, and other immediate dependants of deceased soldiers, and from seriously disabled soldiers, for assistance and benefit. I feel sure the measure will meet with the general approval of those who are' likely to benefit, and doubtless they have been consulted in some way or another.",53
270,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,They have special representation.,54
271,Sir ROBERT BEST,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Yes ; but I am speaking more particularly of a primary consultation as to the disposal of the fund. It is gratifying to know that the proposed Trust is to have the able assismoods tance of Mr Lockyer, who has devoted special attention to this particular clas3 of work, and if the trustees accept his advice they cannot go very wrong. I join with the honourable member for Yarra in appreciatively to benefit. acknowledging the fine work he has done in the interests of our fighting men, I compliment the Honorary Minister on having been able to arrange for the pointment of such a suitable Trust. sonally, I would not have any objection to a Trust comprising persons selected from ' any other State, and my only desire is that this important work shall be carried out in a thoroughly efficient manner.",54

Has it been arranged that the Trust shall pay, say, £1 a week to some persons and 10s. a week to others, or is that to be decided by the Advisory Committees?

As the State Committees are to be appointed under regulations, we do not know how many persons are likely to constitute a Committee. It has been said that we are not dealing with public money, and although such is the ease, we cannot disregard our responsibilities in the matter. Every one desires that the best possible machinery shall be provided for the effective distribution of the money, but I cannot conceive how the scheme will work satisfactorily unless Committees are to be appointed in all the States, including Victoria.",54

277,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"If a large number of persons is appointed to the central Trust and to the Advisory Committees the work will be hampered in many ways. As regards the MCCaughey bequest, it appears that there is some reluctance on the part of the executors to place the fund under the control of any Government Department, and, judging by my experience, Government Departments certainly do exercise a good deal of reluctance in distributing money to persons entitled to it . I do not desire to say anything against the late Sir Samuel MCCaughey, but many of the soldiers who will not return were sweated by that gentleman.",55
278,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,That is a most disgraceful statement to make concerning an honourable gentleman who was most liberal in donating funds for charitable purposes. The honourable member ought to be ashamed to make such a statement.,55
279,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I am not ashamed. As president of the Australian Workers Union I am in a position to say that no man gave more trouble to us than the late gentleman, and there is no man who has sweated his men more than he did..",55

296,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"The MCCaughey bequest provides that the sum of about £300,000 shall be devoted to training men in agricultural, pastoral, and other The proposed Trust will not possibly be able to undertake that training. If a Trust of three members iii New South. Wales or Queensland were given control of that phase of the work alone, how could we expect them, acting in an honorary capacity, to give the whole of their time and attention to matters that are already covered by governmental activities? They could not, and I am sure they would not, do it. There is an allocation of about £50,000 for beds and cots in hospitals for the wives and children of members of the Australian Imperial Force, and a like amount to be used for special purposes to be devised or decided upon by the executors. They, I take it, will be the executors of the MCCaughey estate, and they will instruct the trustees of the Canteens Fund as to how this money shall be disposed of. That arrangement is not satisfactory. Once Ave accept that money we undertake certain responsibilities, and I believe that the funds cannot be satisfactorily administered by persons acting honorarily, for the reason that they have neither the knowledge nor the time to deal with highly technical subjects upon which large staffs are employed throughout the Commonwealth. There are the system of vocational training in connection with the Repatriation Department, and the instruction given by the various State colleges and experimental farms in agriculture, viticulture, horticulture, and many other rural pursuits. It is now proposed that, in addition to those activities, some very estimable people, known perhaps for their patriotic work, shall be given the task of deciding highly technical questions in regard to education. They will be unfit for the work, which will necessarily be delegated to other persons having the necessary knowledge, and who will be paid for their services. In its present form, the Bill is a mere skeleton; evidently very little care has been given to its preparation. So far as the measure goes, it has beenexplained, but much in connection with these funds has been left unexplained. The creation of a huge and cumbrous committee of trustees is the only tangible scheme contained in the Bill, together with an all-embracing power to make regulations which will be the real legislation under which the fund will be administered. The Minister would act wisely if he recast the Bill, withdrawing it for that purpose if necessary. In its present form it is bound to cause a good deal of work in Committee. I shall move to provide for the creation of three head trustees, and Committees of not more than four in each State. The Committees wiil do the local administration work, and their recommendations will be sent to the three head trustees. If the Government will not accept that amendment a good deal of time will be occupied in discussing the Bill, and there will be divisions and other delays which should not be necessary in connection with a measure of this character. If the Government will recast the Bill onmore definite lines, and give more information to the House, the measure will be passed much easier than it is likely to be in its present form:",55

The late Sir Samuel MCCaughey made his wealth by increasing the production of Australia through improving what is, after all, the chief industry of this country. To no man in the history of the Commonwealth do we owe more for the improvement of our flocks than we do to the deceased gentleman, whose memory has been attacked this evening. Any man who improves the flocks and herds of the country takes no money out of anybody's pocket, but puts money into the pockets of the whole community.",56

On the contrary, they will be ashamed of his utterances. Another statement which he made showed that he is utterly confused as to the purpose of the Bill. He talked about the distribution of nearly £1,000,000. This measure does not propose to distribute that sum of money.",56
302,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The honourable member knows nothing about the Bill .,57
303,Mr FLEMING,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"What the Bill proposes to distribute is the £500,000 in the canteens fund . The MCCaughey bequest cannot be distributed by the trustees' to be created under this B i U ; they can deal only with the interest on that money. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) also seemed to have a confused idea as to the proposal before the Blouse, because he indicated that the funds which are the subject of this legislation might be used to relieve the Repatriation Department of some of its obligations. It is most definitely laid down that this money shall not be used for any purpose of the sort, and I am sure that the Government do not propose that it should. The Honorary Minister (Si r Granville R y r i e ) , when explaining the Bill , quoted a letter written in 1917, which showed that the Government had definitely l a i d ' down the policy that these funds shall not be used to relieve the Repatriation Department in any way of its duty to the soldiers. I quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) that women should come into the administration of this Bill more than is at present proposed. One of the chief functions of the trustees will be to provide for the women and children of soldiers, and we all know that women are much better at handling children than men can ever be. Therefore I cordially endorse the suggestion that more women should be placed on the central Trust. I also suggest that there should be at least one woman on each State Committee. The whole of the' administration of the repatriation activities from the central body down to the hundreds of Committees distributed throughout the States is being altered, and the new scheme seems to be as good a one as can be devised. But in every case where they have power to do so, the Government should appoint women to positions on Trusts and Committees; for the Repatriation Committees as at present constituted do not usually include women. We must have more of the feminine touch if the Bill is to be administered as successfully as it should be. I have a little cause of complaint against the Bill in that it is rather fused as to the handling of the two separate funds. I .have already endeavoured to show that they are on different footings, but clause 6 provides(1) The trustees shall be charged with the duties of(a) receiving and considering applications from the widows and orphans, widowed mothers, and other imme- diate dependants of deceased soldiers, and from seriously disabled soldiers, for assistance and benefits; That applies quite readily and fittingly to the distribution of the canteens f u n d , and if it were laid down definitely that that' provision applies only to the canteens fund , it would meet the situation exactly. But sub-clause b con tinues(6) investing in securities of the Commonwealth or a State, or on fixed deposit, or on current account in any bank incorporated or carrying on business in the Commonwealth, such part of the fund as is not immediately required. That part applies, with perfect fitness to the MCCaughey bequest; but the two funds should be kept apart and distinct, so that there would be no confusion in the minds of honourable members, and, possibly, in the minds of the trustees and Committees later. It has been stated in another place that it is hoped that the whole of the canteens f u n d will be distributed within a period of about six months. I think that estimate is too sanguine, b ut the money is the r i g h t f u l property of the soldiers. They provided it, and it belongs to them; it is in no sense a governmental f u n d . But there was no other method than that which has been devised for the distribution of the money amongst its r i g h t f u l owners. As soon as I returned from abroad my first action in the House was to inquire as to what was being done with the canteens f u n d and to draw attention to the fact that they should be used for the benefit of the women and children of the men who f e l l . at the Front. I am delighted to see that the Government have taken action in that direction at the earliest opportunity, but it would be wise for them to lay down more definitely a clear-cut distinction between the funds drawn from the canteens and the MCCaughey bequest. That would remove all difficulties and complaints and conto a large extent eliminate the obstruction with which we are threatened when the measure goes into Committee.",57

320,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"East Sydney) [9.25] - I is quite evident that the last speaker (Mr Jowett) rose merely for the purfund pose of making some very kind remarks about the president of the Australian themselves. Workers Union (Mr Blakeley). must be totally unacquainted with the provisions of the Bill, or he would have made some of the remarks he did across the chamber. make. The House is virtually resolving itself into a society for the admiration the persons named in the Bill ; but, my humble opinion, there are other people in the community who worked just as hard, and deserve just as much credit as they do. The Australian Imperial Force canteens showed a surplus over above the money required to pay their expenses. Some of the men who ran canteens put their money into start them; and if the Honorary Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie) likes to look up the correspondence from myself the Defence Department on behalf those people, he will find that they done out of their money, which was never returned to them. We are dealing in this Bill with £500,000, which has come from soldiers, and I am satisfied that if soldiers had had the appointment of the a Trust to administer the fund, those appointed would not have been all of the political colour, as the members of the Trust proposed by the Government The Minister for the Navy (Sir Cook) will remember that we had funds similar to this in New South Wales for the relief of sufferers from the Bulli disaster, the Ly-ec-moon disaster, and The Australian people, with that Ausmagnificent generosity which they always show to those who require' assistance, conlarge sums of money, which were in trustees, just as this Bill proto poses. In those cases the trustees 3tuck a to the money until the older people died, other and the boys and girls, for whom it was Then they turned round and told us that there was nobody to receive the money, and it remained unused for years. I have nothing to say against the proposed trustees personally, but their sympathies and views are so at variance with those of the secbut tion that I come from and represent tht»t it is possible, unless the Bill is altered, that the fund will not be administered in the spirit and intention which the men t who supplied the money would have approved. I urge the Minister to have the administered in the way in which those men would have administered it The House would have He heard nothing about an Inter-State not Trust but for an interjection I made As soon as I got the Bill I saw the flaw in it, and interof jected, when the Minister was speaking, in that the members of the Trust all came from one State, and that there was no provision for administration in other States. The Minister replied, "" We cannot have"" any one from other States and on the Trust, because he would have to travel to Melbourne, and that would the mean additional expenditure."" I am sure the proposed trustees will not administer the fund properly. The Minis- ' ter should show his honesty of purpose to by withdrawing the Bill, and insertof ing the necessary new clauses in it. were That would be a statesman-like way of dealing with the matter. Those who have been in political life for any length of time know that promises count for little. Prominent in the I?rime Minister's career are the promises made and not carried into effect. In my opinion, the promises made in regard to the Bill may never be fulfilled. I have nothing to say against the gentleman whose bequest will form part of the fund that will be the subject of the proposed Trust. He became a millionaire, and no one believes that any one can become a millionaire all of whose transactions are above suspicion. As to his money, he could not take it ' with him. Naked we come into the world and naked we go out of it again. think it is a good thing. I feel sure that Mr Ashton and Sir Joseph Carruthers, who are trustees under his will , and derive kudos fro m their connection with his affairs, being public men, will not allow themselves to be deprived of anything that would increase their political importance. I understand that some of his money was devised for the promoting of classical study at the University, and that there are bequests in aid of technical education as well, for the benefit of the children of soldiers. I knew the old fellow, and on one occasion stopped three days at his house. doubt he was a good business man, and, like most Scotchmen, if he spent £ 1 he got £ 2 for it . It will always be my endeavour to see that funds subscribed for philanthropic purposes are administered in the spirit that prompted the beneficence of the givers. That will happen only when persons like myself are charged with their administration. I have had a long experience of affairs, and have been trustee of many funds, and still am a trustee. This is a very crude measure, and shows no special ability on the part of the draftsman, though he may have the excuse that he drew it on the information that was given to him, and was badlv informed. It is not. clear whether the children who are to benefit are to receive a weekly allowance or occasional doles, or whether widows are to be set up in businesses. The £500,000 which was earned in the canteens was contributed by those who drank beer and spirits most freely, because it was out of alcoholic drinks that the canteens made their profits. We are told that this is only a small measure; but it contains vital principles. Parliament should see that those for whom the money of which it disposes is intended get what has been provided for them. The Bill does not show how the money is to be apportioned. ' Apparently, the Minister got a letter from Dr Mar y Booth, and it frightened him, because she is one of his constituents, aiid an opponent, and a pretty strong one at that. I hope that - we shall be told definitely who are to be appointed to the Committees in the various States. In my opinion, this f u n d should be administered by representatives of the soldiers, not by ornamental society leaders. If you want a tooth drawn, you go, not to I a stonemason, but to a dentist. At the present time nearly all those at the head of public affairs have a string of letters after their name so long that they might well be called alphabetical people, and some of them have so many letters in front of their name as well, that to address a letter to them in full would take from 9 in the morning until 5 in the evening. The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) remembers the Bulli disaster in New South Wales, which brought into existence a f u n d , the trustees of which became regular professional philanthropists. They invested the No money that had been subscribed for the victims of the disaster, appointed one friend as secretary and another as clerk, and applied the interest in miserable doles, such as were not in tended by the subscribers, a woman with six children receiving 6d. a day for a child, and the children of the sufferers being treated as if they were different from other children. A well-known teetotaller in Sydney was in charge of the administration of the f u n d , and administered it in such a way that afterwards persons could not be got to subscribe to similar funds, and in New South Wales the fountains of charity were for a number of years sealed up. These canteen profits were made chiefly by the sale of alcohol.",59

I advise the Government to withdraw thi* Bill , and submit another proposal which will set out specifically what is to be done in the distribution of these funds.

Mr Carruthers and Mr Ashton are pretty cute men, and know well the duties of an executor of a will .

I appeal to them again to permit this Bill to be so framed that the administration of these funds may be honourable placed in the hands of persons who know something of the conditions of those whom it is intended to benefit' by their distribution.",61
333,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Cowper) [9.47] I am one of those who are responsible for the existence of the surplus - canteens funds. I should like, therefore, to say a few words about their distribution. The way in which I usually became acquainted with the canteens f u n d at the inception of the canteens was by putting a couple of make pounds into the proposal to enable a start to be made. I never happened to be there at any time when there was to be a distribution of profits. I have been disappointed to-night to find that there appears to be a general desire on the part of the Government and the House to get r i d of this £500,000 of accumulated profits in the quickest possible time. It has been suggested that these funds should be distributed in the course of about six months. I agree with the honourable member for Robertson (Mr . Fleming) that some means of dealing with this money should be devised other than the paying of it out as a sort of extra war gratuity in the way which has been suggested. The benefits provided for under clause 6 of the Bill appear to me to be benefits already provided for by other legislation passed by this Parliament, and are benefits the cost of which should be met by the whole of the people of this country. Those who have suffered to the by reason of the war should be treated in the most generous fashion, and not in a casual way. If this ' £500,000 is distributed in a casual way, as it will be if we leave its distribution to honorary trustees .and honorary advisory Boards, there will be nothing whatever to show for it . It seems to me that the suggestion put forward by Sir Samuel MCCaughey in his will is one \jhich might properly be followed by this House in the disposition of the surplus canteen funds. An amount of £300,000 of the MCCaughey bequest is to be devoted to education, and, in my view, the £500,000 of canteen surplus profits should be set aside to provide for the education of the orphans of men who f e l l on the other side, or of men who have returned disabled to Australia. If the Government take the step of augmenting the MCCaughey bequest in this fashion there will not be wanting men of similar spirit who, during their life-time, will give generously towards such a fund, and make-secure the future education of the orphans of the men who died in doing their duty to their country. It is easy enough now to he generous, because the remembrance of the war, and the terrible danger we escaped, is present; but in ten or fifteen years' time, when the boys and girls are growing up, there will be less inclination to handle their cases liberally. I think that the sum I suggest should be capitalized and appropriated in a similar way to what is suggested in the MCCaughey will. I further suggest that one of the executors, or at least a nominee of the executors of the will, should be one of the Trust which has the administration of the fund. I go further, and suggest that, as well as an Advisory Board for the central administration, we should go direct to the electorates for the next body of advice, and not worry about State administration. There are only seventy-live electorates, and if we distributed the money, even under the present arrangement,"" it would mean £7,000 or £8,000 in each electorate. If there is a State advisory body as well as a central body, we shall have continual circumlocution, and a great deal of expense, with very little satisfaction to anybody.",61
334,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,We have to link up with the Repatriation Committees of each . State.,62
335,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"The Local Repatriation Committees could much more readily work in the electorates than in the States. One of the difficulties of repatriation is .that its administration is not sufficiently centralized. It seems to mc that the country children will be penalized in the future by reason of their distance from the centres of education, and these are the children who should receive the greatest benefit under the will. think it goes without saying that the . constituted Trust should be from one centre. There is no reason whatever for any State jealousy; and if the suggestion I have made for electorate Advisory Boards is adopted, these will be in communication with the central Trust, and remove any occasion for such, jealousy.",62
336,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Maranoa) [9.54]. - I will not detain the 'House many minutes, but merely desire to say a word [66] or two, because I was interested in the canteen funds as a member of the War Council in Queensland. All the positions I'.nder this Bill are honorary, and, therefore, the Country party cannot be accused of not aiming at economy on this occasion. When the Repatriation Bill was under consideration, the Minister in  edly said that all the business connected with the returned soldiers, particularly the pensions business, should be carried on under one roof. The Bill before us affects none but the soldiers themselves; this is practically the soldiers' fund, to which they themselves contributed, some directly and many of them indirectly; and if there is any part of the business that should be brought under one roof it is this. The Repatriation Department, with its great staff, should take over the distribution of this fund. I have no fault to find with any of the persons who have been named in the Bill as trustees. One or two of them, as I know from personal observation, devoted the whole of their time, and in many .instances much of their money, to making the canteens a success. Mrs. Deakin, the widow of the late Hon. Alfred Deakin, did honorary work during the war second to that of no woman in the Commonwealth; and if any one deserves a position on this Board or Committee it is that lady. Then there is Mr Lockyer. Perhaps honourable members, or the soldiers themselves, do not know the interest that that man took in work of the kind, particularly in connection with the canteen business. There was six months' leave of absence due to him for long and meritorious services in the Commonwealth, and he devoted that leave to fixing up the canteens throughout me Commonwealth. I For all that work he hoped for no reward, and took none; and now, at the ""final flutter,"" he comes forward and offers his services free. There is no party politics in this Bill. Some of the gentlemen mentioned are good men. We know, for instance, what the Hon. George Swinburne, of Victoria, has done. He has done his "" b it "" here as far as any man could, and the others were all engaged in work connected with the soldiers, either at the Front or in the Commonwealth. Then, again, I think the ladies who have been the leading lights of the Red Cross Society here deserve some recognition. Some of them were wholly and solely devoted to the welfare of the soldiers across the seas. They denied themselves of every pleasure, and in many cases of 'every comfort, in order to help the boys who went to the Front; and as there is' no provision made for their recognition in the Bill, I should like to see, under the regulations, one, or, perhaps, three of them, appointed to the advisory bodies. No one could administer this part of the business better than some of the women of Australia. I agree with my namesake, the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), in the suggestion that this money should be capitalized in perpetuity. There is, roughly speaking, about £1,000,000.",62

341,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"I did not advocate it, but I voted for it.",63
342,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,And now that the Government propose to pay cash the honourable member wishes to have this money tied up.,63
343,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"If the Government desire to throw it about, by all means let them do so.. Thank God the executors of the late Sir Samuel MCCalighey will not allow them to throw his bequest about. That has been tied up in such a fashion that it will be of some value in the years to come. Do Ministers imagine that in ten years time the public of Australia will think as much of those men who went across the seas to save this country as they do today? Time works wonders. Every day the children of those who fell in the war will be growing up, and in a few years many of them will be able to look after themselves. It would be wisdom on the part of the Government to add to this fund one million pounds or two million pounds, so that the Trust might . have interest amounting to £180,000 annually to distribute amongst necessitous cases. That would be money very wisely invested indeed. But it will not take long for the fund to disappear if it is distributed in the way that has been suggested. However, I recognise that it is idle for me or any member of the Opposition to make recommendations to the Minister. But the people outside will take notice of those who wished to do the best that is possible for the widows and orphans of our fallen soldiers.",63
344,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Is it not a fact that Mr Lockyer discussed this matter with the representatives of the soldiers, so that the scheme provided in the Bill is largely the result of their own conclusions ? After all, it is the soldiers' money, is it not?",63
345,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"""Why does the State enact legislation to prevent people getting drunk? Is it not to save them from themselves? If the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) had very little to come and go upon, and if he were offered his choice between £100 now and £100 distributed over ten years, I know which he would choose. the Sir JOSEPH CooK.^This is the soldiers' money, and it is only the difficulty of returning it to them that is responsible for it being dealt with in this way.",63
346,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Minister s say that the money is to be, distributed amongst necessitous cases. I do not believe that there is a single soldier who, if consulted, would not say, ""Whatever my cut is out of it, give it to the widows and orphans of those who have fallen.'' When we were winding up the' canteen in Brisbane a f t * the buildings had been sold, there remained a certain amount of money to. bo distributed. A ""vote was taken as to what should be done with it , and I am pleased to say that there was not one soldier who did not say, "" Give it to the. widows and orphans of our mates who fell overseas."" They have paid this money, they have "" boozed"" it up, and they are quite satisfied that the surplus shall go in the direction I have indicated. I agTee with the honourable member for Cowper that if the money were invested wisely a good deal might be done with it .",63
347,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"He does not look as if he "" boozed "" much. Mr .TAMTOS PACE - He said that he put a couple of "" quids"" into the fund. A man docs not need to be a drunkard to contribute to a fund of the kind, he merely requires to have a drink now and again, just as I do.",64
348,Sir JOBEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,This money been made out of 2d. beer.,64
349,Mr JAMESPAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"If the Minister has not had a ""booze"" in. the canteens in the camps here,, he occupies a unique position. I have never known a M in ister to visit a camp without having something to. drink, even if it were lemonade.",64
350,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"Amongst Mr. Lockyer's achievements, he induced the authorities to brew a new kind of beer for the canteens.",64
351,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"And it took so much more of that beer to make the men drunk that the canteens became more profitable than they would otherwise have been. As one who was associated with Mr Lockyer on the cantoens in Queensland, I wish to pay my tribute to him for what he has done for the soldiers and Australia.",64
352,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,It is mainly his suggestion that we shpuld apt in this way.,64
353,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"But "" in the multitude of counsellors there is safety,""' even if those counsellors are only Labour men. Mr Lockyer may not have thought of the wisdom of investing this money. But if He and the Government think that the method provided is the best for dealing with this matter, I have no objection to urge.",64
354,Sir JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,The Bill has been drawn' loosely in order to give the Trust all the power that we-can. [66]- 2 Mr JAMESPAGE : - I believe that the Repatriation - Department should know nothing of the doings of the Trust which it is intended to constitute.,64
355,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,That Department has neither created the fund nor endowed it .,64
356,Mr JAMES PAGE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERI AL FORCE,"No . I can understand why this scheme has been put forward. It is intended to provide for the equitable distribution of the. money amongst the widows and orphans of deceased soldiers. So far as I am concerned, I wish it all the good luck that can attend it. I have implicit faith in the trustees to be appointed, and particularly in Mrs Deakin and Mr Lockyer. W i th them upon the Trust I ' am certain that the fund will be as well administered as it would be if 1 were a member oft the Trust myself. Debate (on motion by Mr BOWDBK) adjourned. has House adjourned at 10.12 p.m.",64
