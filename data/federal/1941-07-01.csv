Were the books of this company made available for examination by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner in order that he could satisfy himself concerning the profits of the Sydney Morning I l e r a l d V Will such books, if available now, continue to be available? - Why are certain daily newspapers in Sydney permitted to charge 2d. a copy for their publications whilst newspapers in Melbourne charge only 14-d.? Have the - increases in the .advertising rates of Melbourne newspapers also been approved by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner ? Mr HARRISON' - The Commonwealth Prices Commissioner authorized an increase of the price of newspapers in New South Wale.;.when the rationing scheme was first introduced some considerable time ago in order to offset its effects upon such journals. The Commonwealth Prices Commissioner has access to the. books of newspapers, otherwise he would - not be in a position to make proper decisions concerning prices. The Commissioner has authorized an average increase of not more than 10 per cent, in the advertising rates for classified advertisements, but as to how the increase shall be applied, the newspaper organization itself will determine. This increase is also intended to offset possible loss in connection with the latest rationing of newsprint.",24

In connection with the mining dispute which was recently discussed in this House, did the Administrator of New Guinea on his own initiative, visit the gold-fields in an endeavour to bring about, a settlement, or was he instructed by the Minister to dc Aus- so? Is the Minister aware that the visits of the Administrator to the gold-fields have been short and infrequent? Is he aware that the head of the Mines Department in New Guinea made his first visit to the gold-fields in six years when he recently accompanied the Administrator there? What training and practical experience in mining has he had ? What steps does the Government propose to take to place the control of the Mines Department in New Guinea under a competent man with a knowledge of mining?",27
37,Mr MCDONALD,NEW GUINEA MININ G,"by l.eavo- I cannot say whether it was at the instigation of my predecessor that the Administrator of New Guinea visited the gold-fields, but I know that he did visit them., and. that he stayed there for three days. I also know that he suggested that a conference be held of representatives of the owners and of the workers, with a magistrate as chairman, in an endeavour to compare the dispute, and that he did all that was humanly possible to (bring about a settlement. Since then a report has been .current that the strike is settled. I have been advised by the Administrator and the company that new conditions and rates retrospective from the 5th May, 1941, and to he operative for twelve months from the 24th June, 1941, have been accepted unanimously by the men who resumed work. ' The new conditions and rates are stated to be as follows:Underground miner-raise d from f l 5s. to £1 (is.

As part of the terms of the engagement of employees by the company, the men are granted houses, rent free; also light, water, firewood and medical attention free of cost. I have not received up to date information from the Administrator ns to the number of men who have not resumed work, but the company informed me today that not more than fifteen cf the men who went on strike, and who are now on the gold-fields, have not - applied for work. The Administrator ' has reported that he foresees considerable difficulties in the enactment of legislation that would be appropriate to, and effective for, the conditions of the territory of New Guinea, having regard to the fact that the majority of the workers in the industries of the territory are natives. The investigation of the industry with a view to determining the necessity for the introduction of any further legislation, or of machinery for arbitration, is being examined in the light of the views expressed by the Administrator, aiid a decision in regard thereto will be made at an early date. NA SCHEME. FORMAT. MOTION FOR AIMOURHMKNT.",28
38,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Hon. W. M. Nairn). - I have received from the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Scully) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The wheat stabilization scheme of the Government, having special regard to the restrictions imposed by the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board, and the Government's failure to to f 1 Ss. make payments more expeditiously to the farmers with respect to the wheat supplied to the respective pools"". Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion-,",28
39,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Gwydir) [4.27] -- I move That the House do now adjourn. "" I desire to draw attention to the wheat stabilization scheme of the Government, having special regard to the restrictions imposed by the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board, and the Government's failure to make payment more expeditiously to the farmers with respect to wheat supplied to the various pools. The administration of the wheat stabilization scheme, particularly that'part of it which has to do with the registration of wheat lands, is causing great alarm throughout the whole of the wheat-growing districts of New South Wales. Growers in that State are only now receiving information as to the area which they are to be permitted to sow for harvesting, and I understand, from honourable members who conic from other States that the growers there have not yet been advised. When the Minister for Commerce (Sir - Earle Page) introduced legislation providing for the stabilization of the wheat industry, I opposed it on the ground that it would be impossible to give effect to the Government's intention. That has since been borne out by experience. The attempt of the Government to restrict acreage has proved to be the most colossal blunder. It would be absurd were the effects not so ruinous to the growers. One would have expected . the authorities to notify the growers without delay of the areas allotted to them, but although the growers put in their applications some months ago, the notifications regarding acreage are only now being received. - On behalf of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board, the chairman (Sir Clive MCPherson) advised farmers to proceed with normal sowings. A definite knowledge that the previous season had been poor relieved the board. of a serious responsibility. The last harvest received into the Commonwealth - wheat pool totalled only - 63,000,000 bushels, compared with'195,000,000 bushels in the previous year. As the decrease of production in twelve months, amounting to the colossal figure of 132,000,000 bushels, was twice as great as the quantity received by the pool, the Government had no justification for attempting to restrict sowings this year. Its policy wil l ruin hundreds of wheat-growers in New South Wales. A fortnight ago, when I directed the attention of the Minister for Commerce . to the position, I did not understand that the situation was so serious. Throughout New South Wales, .th? Government has been roundly condemned by many sections of the com-' munity, and farmers are up in arms against the tyrannical and decision of the board. The Sydney Morning Herald, on the 23rd June last, contained the following comment by Mr . if . S. Robertson, a member of the executive of the Wagga. District. Council of the Farmers and Settlers Association:The federal wheat stabilization scheme will crush every farmer and every rural community producing cereals. Emanating from a man who is thoroughly conversant with the position, that is ' a mo3t damaging indictment. my arrival in Canberra today. I re"" Mr SdiUy. ceived a letter from a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales who, incidentallyis not a member of the Labour party. He wroteThese lines are just to congratulate you upon bringing before the notice of the (Joveniisient last week the position under the Wheat Stabilization Board. As a matter of fact, either the Menzies Government are endeavouring by all means in. their power to ruin the wheat farmers or are totally incapable of understanding the position so far as wheat-growing is concerned. I have a number of cases before me at the present time which show conclusively that the Government is endeavouring to absolutely ruin the owners of the properties . . . The peculiar part about the letters received from the Stabilization Hoard is that most of the applications for registration wore lodged as far back as February last, 'rhe board and the Government waited until the wheat was sown and then politely advised the fanners that the properties were not eligible for registration.",28
40,Mr B ADMAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Farmer s were asked to lodge their applications before the 25th January, 1941.",29
41,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"As a result of representations by various farmers' organizations, that date was extended and, finally, the chairman of the board advised farmers to proceed with normal sowings. In those circumstances, any blame for the present position rest3 not with wheat growers but with the Government and its . agent, the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board. The correspondent added that he could produce numbers of specific instances of wheat-farmers who hacl been informed that their properties were not eligible for registration. Condemnation of the Government is not limited to farmers. From the Warrah Shire Council I received the f o l lowing letter:The Council has been informed that under authority of the Wheat Stabilization Act absurd several settlers on small areas in the Warrah district have heen notified they are not to grow wheat. In previous years they had been in the habit of sowing up to twenty acres. 'J he Council considers that it is unfair to prohibit settlers growing small areas such as this, and the necessary reduction could be attained by a reduction of a small proportion oflarge wheat-growing areas. To reduce a man's wheat acreage; from 1.000 to !)->0 acres M-nuld not entail hardship such as prohibiting three settlers from growing any wheat on the previous aggregate area of, say, 50 acres sown by theni. The next critic is a country storekeeper, On who allows credit to many farmers in one of the most flourishing wheat-growing districts in New South Wales.. - wroteI was pleased to notice in the press that you had. on the 1loor of the House exposed sonic of the foolish and ruinous edicts issued by the power's that control the acreage to be sown for wheat. One of your constituents here has received notice that he caii sow only ten acres. What a ridiculous command. One would think they were poultry farm areas in this district. As you well know that from 400 to 1,00(1 acres is the general area sown lry individual growers in this district, anyone that can only sow ten acres would be ruined. I also saw one notice a, farmer received that he could not sow any. These' notices come along after most of the wheat is in. Another letter conies from a solicitor in the Gulgong district. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Badman.) - would be interested to learn that in this instance the application for registration was lodged on or about the ISth January, 1941. The letter StatedNo word was received as regards registration and the share farmers fallowed the laud and later sowed it . After the crop was Sown, Mr MCDonnell got a notification from the chairman, a copy of which is enclosed. Not having received any word, naturally the share farmers sowed the land as wheat is always sown in A p r i l or May in this district. The wheat cannot be taken out of the ground and must be harvested. The notice which is despatched to farmers readsI desire to inform you that examination of your application for the registration of certain property as a wheat farm has disclosed that the property is apparently not eligible under the provisions of the Wheat Industry Stabilization regulations for registration as a wheat farm. It should he understood, therefore, that no wheat may be sown for grain for sale on this property although for this year, up to 10 acres may be sown for grain for your own use. What a. magnanimous concession!",29
42,Mr BADMAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,What acreage did the farmer sow previously?,30
43,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"He sowed 90 acres in .1937, 170 in 1939, and a similar acreage last year. The executors of an estate which is situated near Bellata, New South Wales, arc also numbered among the critics. Of three sons who were the beneficiaries under their deceased father's will, two are serving in the Australian Imperial Force abroad, whilst the third enlisted last week. During their absence, the executors arranged with a. sharefarmer to work the property. Government should refuse to grant to him He a permit to grow wheat there, the executors will be placed in. a most embarrassing position. They wrote to me a3 follows:We think you will agree that men who nre lighting for their country overseas are entitled to extra consideration at the hands of the Government in an endeavour to preserve their birth right handed down, in this ensi:, by their father. Another complaint emanates from the owner of a wheat farm in the Bosrgnbri district. In 1938-39 he sowed S10""acrcs, which yielded 5.600 bags, and in the following year a similar acreage yielded 2,400 bags. Because of drought last year, he harvested only 37S bags. The board has now magnanimously permitted him to sow this year 10 'acres on condition that he does not offer the grain for sale. These facts show that, scant consideration has been given to this matter. If persevered with, the wheat stabilization scheme will bring ruin to hundreds of men who have been growing high-grade wheat for years. 1 know these areas well; I know the individual holdings, and, without fear of contradiction, I say that they are the most reliable in the Commonwealth as regards, both production and quality. I have another revealing letter from a farmer at Pallamallawa, another district-which grows high-grade wheatYour remarks last Thursday in Parliament nt Canberra will meet with Jiearty endorsement throughout the length and breadth of the wheat-growing areas in Australia, this is tyranny in its worse form from Government servants in the pay of the taxpayers. Those damned loafers to justify their existence are stopping for no one on this crusade which boiled down amounts to a huge farce hut air and smoke lacking effective tire. I will quote my case to assist you iii your splendid effort to bomb out these I have a notice here from this wheat area Stabilization Board date (ith .Tune, 1041 to effo:-t that I am not entitled to registration as a wheat-grower and I grow wheat at my own risk, &c. When this belated bulletin arrived T had already sown my area, taking full advantage of the rain we had sufficient for complete germination, this is two (2) mouths later than our sowing, period which makes the chairman a much bigger mug than he appeared -- at first to bo . . . \Leave to continue given.] This wheat grower has been growing wheat for 20 .years continuously. He has four sons in If the the Defence ForGes, three being with the Australian Imperial Force overseas. This season he has sown 1.250 acres.. I could cite many more similar cases. I say with all - the emphasis at my command .that the situation is intolerable. Farmers are clamouring to have the wheat stabiliza? tion scheme shelved and replaced by something more logical. Ninety-five per cent, of the wheat-growers in my electorate are against the scheme, lock, stock, and barrel. Other honourable members will show that opposition to it is general throughout other 'v'aeat-growing areas. The scheme - takes away the liberty of the subject. Furthermore, it takes the con'rol of the farms out of the hands of the owners, and places it in the hands of irresponsible people with no knowledge of the facts. Nothing more tyrannical than the refusal to register these farms can be imagined. Men, whose sons are overseas fighting - that they may be able to live as free citizens, are the victims of one of the cruellest acts of fascism. The system of appointing local committees consisting of two farmers to act .as agents for the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Board is objectionable. Those men .are required to act as spies on their neighbours, and to give decisions. They say, - in effect, to Jones, a wheat-grower, "" Y o u have to convert 100 acres to grazing"". Mr MARWICK : - Not this year.",30
44,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Yes , this year. Those instructions have been printed in the country press of New South Wales. The local committee may say "" You have to cut 100 acres for hay and conserve that as fodder"", although the farmer concerned may already have a couple of hundred tons of lucerne hay stored. Wheaten hay, if kept for any length of timej becomes worthless. It is-outrageous that men should sit in judgment on their fellow farmers and instruct them as to the management of their holdings. .The Minister for Commerce should immediately cancel all the notices that have been sent out, and, at least for this season, withdraw the wheat stabilization regulations which require the registration of wheat farms. ' Mr Scullin - A r e the members board the sole judge?",31
45,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Yes , and the farmei has no redress. I bolster my statement that the regulations should be withdrawn at least for this season with the fact that applications-, for registration were made in January or February, well before the wheat was sown, whereas the replies to tlmce applications were not. received until two months after the sowinghad taken place, and when wheat was well above the ground. I have never seen wheat looking better than it looks onhundreds of acres of iand, the registration of which has been refused. The wheat is already six inches above ground and the crop pronii es to be bountiful. I impress upon honourable members the seriousness of the situation. I do not care what the Minister for Commerce contends; these are the facts. Never - in the history of primary production in Australia has there been so much chaos and-discontent as exist throughout the wheat industry in New South Wales. Other honourable members, doubtless, will chow that similar conditions operate in other parts of Australia. The history of the wheat stabilization scheme has been one of blunder after blunder. The continuance of the scheme will bring ruin to hundreds of Australian wheat-growers..",31
46,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Cowper-Minister for Commerce) [ 4 . 5 5 ] - I am glad that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr . Scully) has moved the adjournment of the House on this matter, because it gives to me the opportunity to make an authoritativestatement, which w i ll completely diepose of alleged facts that have been brought before the House, but in reality have no existence. This debate will also enable me to expound the actual plan,' indicate the benefits which w i ll accrue to the farmer, and inform the House and the country at large that 90 per cent, of the 60,000 wheat-growers are solidly behind the wheat, stabilization scheme. I shall put in their proper perspective those who are dissa.tis fied with the scheme a.nd | shall also state the general position of the wheat in due-try. I shall set put the shipping difficulties which we meet with in selling wheat overseas. I shall show how essential it .is to preserve this scheme, which has received the endorsement of the of the State governments, of which four are Labour governments. I shall show how democratic this plan is. The scheme ensures that the control of the industry shall be in the hands of the farmers themselves. These facts were explained by me in the House before the regulations were actually introduced and proclaimed-. It has since been explained on many occasions by the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board. The objections to thia scheme come principally from two classes «of people. The first, class consists of .those who are ignorant of the facts of the case and have not made their applications, in the proper way, and the second class of those who are seeking to obtain .at the expense of the general body of wheat-growers, in whose interest the scheme was brought into being, something to which they are not entitled. I shall first dispose of the honourable gentleman's .reference to instructions, which he said were sent throughout Australia, by stating exactly what the Wheat Industry .'Stabilization Board has done. It . has not' vcaused any notification to be sent to wheat-growers regarding the areas which ""they may or may not sow this season, but farmers whose properties are regarded .as being ineligible . for wheat-growing have been informed that they may sow 10 acres, if they wish to do so, for their - own purposes. That is the only kind of - direction which has been given by. the board in regard to acreage. Mr SOULI/IN - What makes a far m ineligible? . Sir EARLEPAGE - I shall explain that later. The board has issued instructions to State organizations to forward to wheat-growers notifications regarding the registration of properties in accordance with the Wheat Industry Stabilization Regulations. These notifications have taken the following three forms:1. Where it is-considered that properties areeligible for registration as wheat farms, the owners have been informed that such properties will be registered. .2. Where properties obviously are ineligible for registration as wheat farms, the applicants have been so informed. . 3. Whore some doubt exists regarding the eligibility or otherwise of the property, the owner has been so informed, but has also been advised that his case will be considered by the Local Committee o.f Review which, has been established in his district to deal with all applications for registration. Similarly, the board has instructed the Local Committees of Review to investigate and report on all applications for registration, irrespective of whether they are considered to be eligible or ineligible for registration. Those are the only instructions that have been issued. On the 20th June, before this matter was raised by the honourable member for Gwydir,- the secretary of the Farmers and Settlers Association of JSfew South Wales, which is the biggest wheat-growers organization, of that State, wrote to me in the ""following terms:I liiivc noted in the paper various questions being asked by members in regard tn the anomalies in the Wheat Stabilization Scheme Personally I think-that many of the complaints given to members are not based on facts. No doubt they have received notification that they are not entitled to registration, and this has hucn taken as the final word. .1I have had a. number of complaints and when I have investigated I find that the letter sent out is due'to the fact that the application dees not give sufficient' information, or that essential information has been omitted. Mr Cambridge telephoned to me this morning and said that only yesterday two men had visited him. When he asked to see a copy of their application for registration he found that they had left completely blank that part of it which deals with the quantity of wheat grown by the applicant during the last three years. The Letter continuedIn every case where I receive these letters I am now advising the applicant to write a letter nf explanation to the Officer in Charge, Wheat Stabilization Board, Lauds Department, Sydney, and ask that his case he brought before the Local Committee of Review. As these committees consist of local growers who arc conversant with the iiidustry, the district in which they live and the growers, every grower is then in the position to state his case to his fellow grower, and if in their wisdom they consider he has been harshly treated they h'ave the right to make a recommendation. . I am of opinion that'this is the most democratic manner in which tliese appeals can be dealt with, and it is. most unfortunate that instead of trying to rectify any anomalies everyone seems to raise all the pin pricks they can Without putting anything constructive in the place of what they are criticizing. - I refer now to three cases which, the honourable member for Gwydir brought to my attention about ten days ago. The first is that of a man whose application did not show what wheat had been either sown or harvested on his property during the relevant'years. He wa3 asked to supply the information, but did not reply to the inquiries. Consequently he was notified that his farm was ineligible for registration. Information has just been received-bu t not fro m the applicantthat Avheat was harvested on this farm, and a3 the result it will be registered when full details are obtained. In this case, the application was incorrectly compiled and this was aggravated by failure to supply essential information. second of these cases is a doubtful one. The application shows what wheat was sown during the period, but it does not disclose that any wheat was harvested. Further investigation will have to be made before a licence can be issued. . If the local committee reports that, wheat was harvested from the property during the period specified a licence will be issued. The third case concerns a member of the Australian Imperial Force, whose attorney was informed that-the'application was in the doubtful category. The attorney replied that he was unable to state whether wheat was grown or not during the three-year period. Naturally, the application cannot be granted until the rase is investigated, and the local committee will do this as soon.as possible. I shall now discuss the position of the wheat industry throughout the world. At the present time there is a huge surplus of unsaleable wheat. This is concentrated chiefly in Canada, the United States of America, and Argentina, which, with Australia, make up the "" big four "" wheat export countries. At the end of la.?t July the present cereal year opened with world stocks of wheat estimated at 1,400.000,000 bushels, the greatest accumulation of wheat ever known. It seems that the present month, and the cereal year, will end with the stock position practically unchanged. During the next twelve months the exporting countries will face great difficulties in finding markets . and storing their surpluses. W it h the new harvest soon to be gathered in the United States of America and Canada, there is a considerable risk of furthe r increases of the already burdensome stocks. . We face an increase of the total surplus during this year, and the year 1942-43 may open with the industry in a worse position still. Sir Earle Page. , ,[ j ^ lj;j>[j In addition to all this, we have to contend with great shipping difficulties. During-the first year of the war we were able to export our wheat fair l y readily. We had a huge crop of about 200,000,000 bushels, and we sold a substantial quantity, of which a great; deal was exported to the United Kingdom. We still ' hold about 20,000,000 bushels which was sold to the United K in gThe dom Government, but has not yet been shipped abroad. Last Thursday I described to honourable members the extraordinary shortage of shipping space that has been caused by,German activity, particularly in the Atlantic ocean - I pointed out that, altogether, only one-fifth of the shipping space that was available to us for the shipment of food to England during the first year of the war will be available for the transportof food products to Great B ritain during the coining year. I directed attention to the extreme difficulty that we should experience in regard to the shipping of refrigerated products. Only one-third of the pre-war space will be available for meat, one-half for butter, and almost none at all for eggs. The tonnage available for wheat will be one-fortieth of that which was available during the first year of the war for the shipment of wheat and flour to Great Britain . The wheat stabilization plan is the result of many years of effort by Australian wheat-growers, the Common-. wealth Government, and the State Governments. While the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Sculiin) was Prime Minister he made four of five attempts to "" achieve something like stability in the wheat industry, but because of the conditions operating at that time he was unsuccessful. I have been engaged in politics ever since the last, war, and I do not know of any problem which has so engaged the attention, of all the Parliaments of Australia. We have been trying continuously to find some means of stabilizing the industry. We thought that we had succeeded in 1935, but the Priv y Council decided that we were acting unconstitutionally and the whole plan was destroyed. It was not u n t i l the outbreak of war, when the Commonwealth Government was given special powers under the National Security Act for The defence and security of Australia, that we were able to bring this stabilization scheme into being. Honourable members will recall that, from the time of the depression, the Commonwealth Government was called upon annually to make grants to the wheat industry, sometimes from loan funds and sometimes from revenue. In the years between 1930 and 1939 probably £20jo00,000 was allocated by the Commonwealth Government for the.assistance of the wheat industry. But these grants were always in the nature of a palliative, not a cure. ' During-the years of peace we failed to secure the unanimous co-operation of the State governments in stabilizing the industry. The Commonwealth Government was repeatedly urged to foot the bill for wheat stabilization, but it could never persuade the State Governments' to control production. Consequently we were never able to bring a stabilization scheme into existence. Before the outbreak of war, the Wheat Growers Federation, which represents all of the wheat-growers' organizations of Australia, conceded that the wheat industry could not accept a guaranteed price while production was unlimited. It urged the Government to combine the fixation of a guaranteed price with limitation of'production, and to make certain that there would be a limitation of the benefits that would accrue from stabilization to the genuine wheat-growers. It considered that excessive increases of production should be prevented so that men already engaged in the wheat industry should not suffer. Accordingly, when the Commonwealth''Government introduced this scheme it limited its liability to crops equal to the average production of the Commonwealth over both the last five years and the last ten years. Obviously this will not bring ruin to thousands of wheat-growers, as the honourable member for Gwydir has said - I ask him how a guaranteed price of 3s. lOd. a bushel oh an estimated production >of 140,000,000 bushels, can cause ruin to thousands of growers. As a matterof fact the scheme has brought security to 60.000 wheat-farmers, and I shall do everything in my power to prevent anybody from sabotaging it - This plan has the strong support of the wheat-growers' organizations; in fact it is a wheat growers' scheme. I consulted the official representatives of the growers, they suggested amendments to, the original proposals, and I put them' into effect. They suggested the appointment of an advisory committee representative of wheat-growers from all States which could consult with the Commonwealth Government, and they suggested the creation of local committees of farmers who would understand conditions in their own districts, in order that the scheme would have the most democratic system of control possible, instead of control by a .bureaucrat remote from the wheat growing areas who worked out plans on paper.",31
47,Mr SIIEEHAK,WHEAT STABILIZATION,Why were those committees not established last year?,34
48,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"When I introduced this scheme I was taunted for bringing it down too early. I was asked, ""Why not wait until next year?"" I introduced it at the earliest possible: moment after I assumed office as Minister for Comonerce, because I knew from the experience of more than twenty years, that all sorts of promises had been given to the growers every - year, but that nothing had been done for them until October or November, when the wheat was being harvested. This Government started twelve months early because it knew that it. had a Herculean.task to perform. It secured the services of the best possible men, and they are doing highly valuable work. In drafting this plan we decided that wo must impose strict conditions in order . to protect the growers, and that we must limit the liability of the Commonwealth Government. Therefore the scheme was made to apply only to licensed wheat growers on registered farms. Registration is granted to. farms whose owners can show that they have harvested wheat as grain between the 1st October, 1938 and the 1st April, 1941. There is no question about quantity. Complaints have been made that this provision is too rigidly enforced. But let us consider the nature of the objections. Very few of those farmers who have raised objections can show-that they have been treated harshly. The instructions which have been sent out to the farmers were issued only in order to enable the board to. obtain the - information for the registration of farms. Even if a farmer is declared to be inthan eligible for registration, he has the right to appeal to lu3 local committee, to which such a scheme. he may show his exact position. If , because he has not kept books of account --and many farmers do not do so-h e wheat?cannot produce documentary evidence in support of his claim, he may call neighbours as-witnessss to prove that this year, or the year before, or the year 140,000,000 bushels. before that, he grew wheat. But it is beyond question that many people now see, for the first time for a good many years, an opportunity to grow wheat for profit. Because of the introduction of the stabilization scheme, these inmittees dividuals, who inay not have had 100 acres of - their land under wheat for number of years, consider that they now have, an opportunity to sow' 1,000 or even 2,000 acres to wheat - They are therefore saying to themselves: ""This looks a good thing to us. We shall obtain registration for our property and use our tractors to put as much as possible under wheat"". Such persons, have not been interested in wheat-growing for number of years and are not the people for whom the stabilization scheme was devised. Our desire is to help the genuine wheat-grower and, so far as I am able - do it, I shall administer this scheme for the benefit of farmers who truly deserve any advantage that can be obtained from it. I am not in favour of permitting scheme to be used by persons who are not genuine wheat-growers but, having large areas of land under their control, now desire to register their farms and reap benefits not intended for them. real object of this scheme is to benefit small wheat-growers, and, if I have way, they are the men who will reap the benefit. I shall not lend myself to any Attempt to sabotage the scheme by mitting large land-holders who are not bona fid -} wheat-growers to render it unworkable.",34
49,Mr LAKGTJI,WHEAT STABILIZATION,Y - The Minister must go further back to get at the real results the scheme. I want to know what price the farmer will get for his wheat?,35
50,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I have already said that the guaranteed price is 3s."" lOd. a bushel for 140,000,000 bushels. Surely it is better for a farmer to get 3s. lOd. a bushel for a harvest of that dimension 3s. or 2s. 6d'. or even 2s., which is all ' that might be obtained in the absence of",35
51,Mr LAKGTBY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"What we want to know is how much the farmer will get for his his .. Sir EARLE PAGE - The farmers will get at least 3s. lOd. a bushel, for I appeal to honourable members to do everything possible to enable the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board to investigate, through the local committees, the real position of the farmers. These comwill need to carry out their responsible duties wisely. Unless they act a carefully, much damage may be done. The Wheat Industry Stabilization Board, on its part, must also act with extra-' ordinary care to try to ensure that the farmers themselves, through their lack of education, or their failure to keep accounts, do not suffer avoidable injustice. Prom my knowledge of what has been done up to date, I assure honourable mema bers that the board is doing its best to achieve the greatest possible success. At present, efforts are being made to include within the scheme farmers who, to possibly because of too rigid an interpretation of the regulations, are in danger of being treated harshly. [Leave to continue given.'] Instances have been the brought to notice of the exclusion of farmers who, during the last three years, have not grown wheat but are essentially wheat-farmers. If these can show that they grew wheat four or five years ago The .their claims will be examined on their the' merits, and. everything possible will be my clone to fix a basis on which they may participate in the scheme. Other farmers, in response to. appeals made three or four peryears ago not to grow too much wheat because of marketing difficulties, have been growing a good deal less than their normal average. Their cases also will be examined sympathetically. How can it be said, iri these circumof stances, that the scheme is likely to ruin thousands of farmers? It cannot justly be contended, that men who have not been growing wheat for three or four years will be ruined if they are not permitted to grow wheat this year. Honourable membevs need not weep crocodile teavs over personsin those circumstances. I certainly shall not do so. We all should keep in mind the fact that this scheme is intended to assist genuine wheat-growers, and we should not allow that worthy section of the community to be made pawns in a game designed to benefit large landholders who are not in need of the assistance that the stabilization plan is intended to give. Without any doubt an attempt is. being made to sabotage this scheme. I , and many otlier honourable membevs, have wovked unsuccessfully fov ^the last, 20 or 30 years to try to organize a scheme of this description, and I am certain that now that we have achieved this measure of success, we shall not now allow ourselves to be used to smash the scheme. We know that the arrangements now made have been possible only through the altered conditions due to the war. My hope ie that during the war period this scheme will become so firmly established that when peace returns it will be impossible to smash it .",35
52,Mr BKIEXXAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Would the Minister describe for us the class of wheat-farmer - who, for personal reasons, might be apposed to this scheme?",36
53,Sir EARLEPAGE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I do not think that any bona fide wheat-grower will oppose the scheme, but it is being resisted by those who are antagonistic to organized marketing, and who for many years, have been endeavouring to prevent the adoption of a stabilization plan of this kind. ",36
54,Sir EARLEPAGE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,If the honourable member has eyes in his head he can see them.  support his assertion.,36
55,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"During the last 2.j years I have made my position in regard to the wheat industry quite plain, for I have declared it from platforms all over the country. The farmers know where 1 stand. I ask honourable mennbers not to draw a "" red herring across the trail "". The Wheat Industry Stabilization Board includes in its personnel the 23resident of . the Australian Wheat growers Federation, Mr F . H . Cullen; Sir Clive MCPherson, who is the chairman; and the secretary of the Department - of Oommevce, Mv. J . F . Murphy. Would any honourable member suggest that these three gentlemen are likely, suddenly, to take it into their heads to choose out of the 60,000 wheat growers in Australia 10 or 100 or even 1,000 farmers for special penalties? The members of the - Wheat Industry Stabilization Board are deeply in terested in. the welfare of the p r i mary industries of this country and it is ridiculous to suggest that they would desire, for any reason whatsoever, to penalize the wheat-growing industry. I appeal to honourable members, therefore, not to do anything that will have the effect of undermining this scheme. The legitimate claims of all bona fide wheat growers will be carefully considered. We should not give credence to any suggestion that would have the effect of enabling a few large land-holders to sow a much greater acreage than they are entitled to sow. The local committees will carefully scrutinize all doubtful cases, and I say with confidence that every man who has a just case will obtain registration. The local committees consist, in each case, of two local wheat-growers, and a State government official, who will be either a member of the staff of a State Agricultural Department or of a State LandsDepartment with special knowledge. Already more than 300 local committees have been established and approved in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. In the time available, it has not yet been possible to establish and approve of committees in Western Australia, but when I was in that State recently, and particularly while I was in the Division of Swan, appeals were made to me by the representative of every road board with which I made contact to proceed as quickly as possible with the formation of local committees, becausei t was realized that the committees would ensure that farmers would be given a f a ir deal. Every effort is being made to accelerate the formation of the local committees throughout the Commonwealth. The Wheat-growers Federation of Australia, and also State government and local government bodies, are in favour of this scheme of local committees. We should not sow any seeds of doubt as to the value of these units. I realise that abuses and anomalies may occur in the early stage, but both may and will be rectified as they are brought to light. The Wheat Industry Stabilization Board, which will have at its command the knowledge of the local committees, will be able to do a great deal to improve the prospects of the wh ea t-gr owing ind ustry. The honourable member for Gwydir alleged that the Australian Wheat Board had been slow in making payments in respect of various wheat pools. It must be realized that at the outbreak of the war the Commonwealth Government had to take over the marketing of all our primary products. Great difficulties were encountered in regard to all export surpluses, and, in order to avoid chaos, the most carefully devised plans were made. Unfortunately it was not possible to avoid a measure of chaos in connection - with the marketing of apples and pears, but a very good job has been done in connection with the marketing of wheat. The operations of the Australian Wheat Board have Pool. Date ol Acquisition. September and October, 1939 November, 1939 (commence195,570,000 and 3 ment of harvest) November, 1940 (commencement of harvest) Sir Eurle fa ye. been so successful that the position of our wheat industry compares more than favourably with that of the industry in most of the other wheat-exporting countries. At present only small quantities of' wheat arc on hand and our carry-over stocks will be smaller than those of practically every other wheat-growing country excepting Argentina. Our position is very much better than that of Canada, in which country, we are told, only about 65 per cent, of the crop could be handled.",36
56,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT STABILIZATION,Our position has been influenced a great deal by drought conditions.,37
57,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"That may be so, but wise selling has also played, its part. We had, 210,000,000. bushels of wheat to deal with last year, and it was handled well. In the last two years £50,000,000 has been paid to the wheat-growers of this countiy. That the organization of the Australian Wheat Board has been steadily improved, is shown in the dates on which payments have been, made in respective years. The following table gives the details of the date of acquisition, quantity acquired, advances and dates of payment in respect of the several wheat pools:ADVANCES ON WHEAT POOLS. Advances. Quantity Acquired. . Mate Hugged Wheat..! Bate.

I believe m giving credit where credit is due, and the board deserves credit for what it has clone. The overdraft position is interesting. Figures furnished by the Australian - Wheat Board show that on the 18th March, 1940, the overdraft for pools Nos. 2 and 3 was £21,492,000. The position today is that the overdraft of the board on the two pools is about £10,500,000.",37
58,Mr JOLLY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Will that represent loss? Sir EARLE PAGE I'AGE - We hope not. It is expected that further payments will be possible as additional realizations are made. The board has made some excellent sales. The general manager of the board, Mr John Thomson, has been extraordinarily fortunate, or wise, or, more probably, both, in having been able to charter ships to take our Avheat to those parts of the world where it is needed. The sales have been made at reasonable prices from the growers' standpoint and I give to the board every credit for what it has done. It, must be remembered, however, that the activities of the Australian Wheat Board have nothing to do with the control being exercised by the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board. I earnestly appeal to honourable members not to do anything that will prejudice the success of the wheat stabilization control.'",38
59,Mr LANGTRY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Riverina) [5.29] My electorate, like that of the honourable m-cmbcr for Gwydir (Mr Scully), is - seething with dissatisfaction in connection with the control' of the wheat industry. It is felt that the altered conditions world, and particularly the altered tion of wheat in relation to power alcohol, should make great improvements possible. There shculd not be such a great need now fcr a rigid stabilization scheme. Considerable misapprehension exists, also, as to the price the farmers will receive for their wheat. Many farmers in one part of my electorate believe that they will receive '3s. 3d. a bushel. There ccn.fusi.on as to whether the guaranteed price is 3s. lUd. a bushel f.o.b. or f.o.r. The elucidation of that point is imporBiverina tant? I doubt whether there is a farmer conference in Australia who could tell me, with any certainty, what he will get for his wheat. The farmers simply do not know. The Minister does not know. The whole of the liability for all storage and handl i ng charges' is on the wheat-grower, not on the Commonwealth Government. On this ground alone, the act needs amending. A very largely attended meeting of the district council of the Farmers and - Settlers Association of New South Wales was held, last week at Temora, which is, I suppose, one of the first half-dozen great wheat centres of Australia. When the wheat stabilization scheme was brought forward, a large number of the. men who attended this meeting were in favour of the acreage basis. At the meeting, however, a resolution was carried unanimously in favour of the adoption of a bushel lage basis, with payment at the rate of 4s. a bushel at country sidings in respect of 3,000 bushels. I have always regarded the bushellage basis as the right, one to adopt. I do not think that it is proper to impose a restriction on the area sown, because the grower does not knew whether his return in twelve mouths will be 2 bushels, 10 bushels, 15 bushels or 30 bushels to the acre; that is determined by nature. Alteration o.f the scheme to a bushellage basis with a limited quota would, I believe, give satisfaction to SO per cent, of the wheat growers, particularly the small men. The Minister has claimed that the small man - the genuine grower-wil l derive the greatest benefit from the present scheme. I do not believe that he will, because the cost of production is lowered proportionately with the increase of the acreage sown, and, in addition, revenue is derivable in much larger measure from stubble of the and feed: The big man, too, can afford posito take risks which are outside the capacity of the small man. It cannot be contended that delegates to the district' council of the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Walc3 are sympathetically disposed towards the Labour party. The terms of the resolution that they passed are as follows:-- Delegates to tli.c annual meeting of the is Temora District Council of the Farmers .and Settlers' Associat ou in Temora. on Thursday, : decided to urre upon the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page), the member for (Mr .T. I . Langt.ryl. and the annual of ' the Farmers and Settlers' Association in Sydney, the need for amending the wheat stabilization scheme to place it on a bushel quota basis as against the acreage basis as at present provided for'. Mr Kendall, who travelled 110 miles in order to address that .meeting, pointed out that the wheat stabilization scheme provided for an expenditure of £26,750,000 in respect of - a crop estimated to total 140,000,000 bushels, and that that would return to the grower 3s. lOd.'a bushel at ports. That statement is not correct; the price is not at ports, but f.o.b.' Until I had explained the matter, the impression was that the deduction for different charges would amount to 7d. a bushel. From information that I received after I left this House last week, the expenses of the No. 1 pool were very little short, of Is. a bushel. The return from bagged wheat will be less than from bulk wheat. The cost of bags in Sydney at present is lis. l-|d. a dozen. Freight and other charges raise it to approximately 12s. a dozen, or 4d. a bushel. If other expenses be taken into account, the return from the stabilizedscheme will be approximately 2s. 6d. for bagged and 2s. 8d. for bulk wheat. Under the stabilization scheme, this will apply to 140,000,000 bushels. Since that scheme came into operation, Russia has become an active combatant in the war, and that may have a very big effect on the world market for wheat. The report of thePower .Alcohol Committee, released last week, stated that practically the whole of our surplus wheat could be absorbed at a better price to the farmer than the stabilized price. It has been proved that power alcohol can be manufactured at a cost of 2s. a gallon wholesale, and 2s. 2d. a gallon retail, from wheat purchased from the farmer at 3s. 6d. a bushel at ports or distilleries in country This alters the whole complexion of the wheat stabilization scheme. At the moment, the restrictions imposed on the use of petrol are severe, and their severity is likely to be increased, with the result that thousands of persons will be thrown out of employment. I blame the Government on that account. That 3,000,000 gallons of power alcohol can be manufactured from. 435,000 bushels of wheat, for sale retail at 2s. 2d. a gallon, should be a strong ducement to the Minister to alter the scheme completely. The result would be Mr Laniytry. to restore an industry which is now, and has been for the last seven or eight years, in the gutter. It will not be assisted by means of the wheat stabilization scheme. It is impossible to get out of difficulty by receiving less than the cost of production. The Gepp wheat commission, in its findings, stated that 20 per eent. of the growers were producing wheat for 2s. 9d. a bushel or less; 40 per cent... for 3s. 2d. a bushel or less; 60 per cent, for 3s. lOd. a bushel or less; and. SO per cent, for 4s. 8d. a bushel or less. [Leave to continue given.] At the guaranteed price of 3s. lOd. a bushel, f.o.b., only one-half of the wheat-growers will receive the cost of production. .The commission which made these findings took evidence from leading experts on wheat throughout Australia. Judged by tho3e findings, from the point of view of the wheat-grower the wheat stabilization scheme must be a complete failure. Australia needs annually 32,000,000 bushels of wheat for human consumption, 15,000,000 bushels for seed, and 8,000,000 bushels for animal consumption. On the basis of a crop of - 160,000,000. bushels, this would leave 105,000,000 bushels for export ' or the manufacture of power alcohol. The Government should lose on time in giving effect to the recommendation of the Power Alcohol Committee, because by January next the surplus of wheat will be very small; the chairman of the board has informed me that there will be practically none. Distilleries could be provided at, the principal wheat-growing centres within two years, and. the equipment of each distillery would cost only £500,000. The benefitthat would accrue to wheat-growers, and the needs of the defence services, centres. demand the storage of a surplus of power alcohol. The proposition would be a very fine one for the Government, hecause of the present shortage of supplies of petrol. The Minister should consequently reconsider the scheme in its entirety, People are being driven from the country to the cities and towns simply because they cannot live in existing circumstances. Mention has been made of the imposition - of restrictions on lamb raising. What will a wheat-grower be in- able to do with his land if he cannot grow wheat profitably on it and is-prevented from raising lambs? He will still have to pay the interest lie was charged when the price of wheat was good. The Government should immediately appoint a special committee to confer with the Minister who deals with the production of power alcohol, with a view to having distilleries provided at different points throughout Australia, so that one of the greatest of our industries may be uplifted. If .that be done, wheat-growers will receive a payable price for their product, and thousands of country storekeepers and business men of every description will be ben. fifed. Practically 100 per cent, of the wheat-growers of my electorate consider that the scheme should be altered from an acreage to a bushellage basis, with the payment of 4s. a bushel for 3,000 bushels delivered at country sidings. When the wheat had been placed on trucks the responsibility of the farmer should cease. The Commonwealth Government and the Wheat Board should clearly what the grower is to receive immediately his wheat is delivered, not two, three, four or five years later. - Whatever price is guaranteed-2s . 6d., 2s. Sd.. 3s., or, as it ought to be, 4s. a bushel - the Government should say that that amount is guaranteed to the growers and that it will accept the responsibility for storing and handling the wheat. Until that be done, the wheat-growers will never know what they are to receive for their wheat. For the safety of Australia, the prosperity of the wheat-growers, and the benefit of the industry generally, I hope that no time will be lost in putting into operation the recommendation of the committee which investigated the production of power alcohol. Mr EADHi&N (Grey) [ 5 . 4 8 ] - I am confident that both the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Scully) and the honourable member for Biverina (Mr Langtry) desire only to assist the wheat-growers whom they represent. In fairness to the Government, as well as to the farmers, honourable members - must state the position of the wheat industry as they see it . I have the honor to represent in this House about 54 per cent, of the wheat lands of South Australia, in which more than that percentage of the wheat-growers of the State reside. Since the Government's stabilization scheme was inaugurated, I have received only two complaints concerning it from wheat-growers. The first complaint - was from a man who is primaril y a grower of barley, but who, in giving effect to a policy of crop rotation, grows wheat every five years. He asked to be allowed to continue to gro.w wheat on the former basis, but his application was refused - He accepted the position when it was explained to him . The second complaint came from a farmer whose sons had been working on shares with him and also on an adjoining farm. Last year they relinquished share-farming on the adjoining farm and purchased 1,500 acres of land on which wheat, had not. been grown for five years, the laud having been used for raising stock. They fallowed 500 acres of the newly-purchased farm , and applied for a licence to grow wheat, but the licence .state was refused. However, after their case had been explained to the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) by the. secretary for Commerce and myself,' those young men were allowed to carry on under certain clearly defined conditions. I can say confidently that 95 per cent, of the farmers of .South Australia are pleased with the efforts of the Government to stabilize the wheat industry. The scheme which is now in operation follows closely that which was proposed by Senators Wilson and Uppill, of South Australia, with the exception that their proposal did not allow for the restriction of production which is embodied in the Government's scheme. For ten years the wheat-growers of Australia have asked for security of tenure, so that they could carry on their operations and pay their way. Business people in wheat-growing districts have also felt the need for security. War conditions have emphasised the need for security. Before the war, Australia and other wheat producing countries were prepared to flood the world markets with wheat. We produced wheat in excess of our capacity to dispose of it , and when we sought assistance from the Government other sections of. the community, which were protected in. various ways, complained that the wheat-growers were being spoon-fed. The loss of the export market for wheat has forced the Government to control the production of wheat, in somewhat the same way. as has been found necessary in respect of apples and. pears and other primary products. Four or five years ago I advocated in this House a restriction of wheat production, with a view to obtaining better prices. . In my opinion, the wheat-growers of Australia should be well satisfied with a scheme which gives to them 3s. lOd. a bushel up to a total of 140,000,000 bushels. It is strange that complaints should come from New South Wales where, in many districts, including that represented by the honourable member for Gwydir, wheat can begrown satisfactorily without the use of much superphosphate or resort to extensive fallowing. The conditions in the greater part of New South Wales are entirely different from those which exist in the wheat-growing areas of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. It would appear that many New South Wales wheat-growers saw an opportunity to grab something for themselves. "" I ask the Assistant Minister for Commerce (Mr Anthony) if it is not a fact that in that State farmers applied for licences' in respect of 50 per cent, more acreage than they have sown to wheat during the last four years?",38
60,Mr LANGTKY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,That is not a fact.,41
61,Mr BADMAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I have been informed on reliaible authority that it is so. Although I am a farmer, I must admit that some farmers are unscrupulous in such matters. They grab' at the last penny for themselves. Had the wheat growers of Australia'been paid for their wheat on the basis of 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. during the last ten years, there would have been no room for complaint. I hope that under the stabilization scheme farmers will be paid for their wheat as soon .as it is delivered. Under the 1939.40 and 1940-41 pools the Government was not able to dispose of the wheat immediately, and therefore it had to make advances to the growers. While waiting for complete - payment many of them were embarrassed, financially. I do not think that the Government could have done 'better than it has done in connection with the 1939-40 pool, although it is true that a considerable time elapsed before the final payment was made. In connection with future pools, the Government should pay to the farmer the total value of the wheat delivered, so that he will have money to meet his expenses, and thereby avoid heavy costs in connection with overdrafts. The stabilization scheme is fortunate in that it is in the control of experienced men. Members representing wheat areas should be satisfied that the industry is in charge of such men as Sir Clive MacPherson, Mr Cullen, Mr Til t and Mr. Kendall. [Leave to continue given']. I am prepared, to trust such experienced men with the conduct of the stabilization scheme. Some mistakes were unavoidable in inaugurating the scheme, but when the war i,s over-it is to operate for the duration of the war, which we hope will not be long-the farmers will, I believe, ask for its continuance, rather than that the industry should revert to its former uncontrolled, state. I desire now to refer to the production of power .alcohol. I am informed, by Mr. Garnett of the Berri distillery, in South Australia, that in five or six- - weeks the distilleries in that State could convert their plants to produce power alcohol from wheat at a cost of less than. 6d. a gallon. The cost of producing power alcohol in the United States of America is about 4d. a gallon. The total cost of the power alcohol would be about 2s. a gallon. M.i: Garnett also says that South. Australia has been allotted a production of only 3,000,000 gallons, whereas the plant which he says already exists in that State is capable of producing about 10,000,000 gallons a. year. If power alcohol can be produced at 2s. a gallon, by a plant which is already in. existence in the Commonwealth, the Government should be prepared, to accept as much of it as can be supplied. Towards the end of the last war as much as 5s. a gallon was paid for petrol imported from the United States of America. At that time, the import duty on petrol was not so high as it is now. The production of power alcohol from wheat would not only be of value to the Commonwealth in .providing another source of power, but it would also help to stabilize the wheat industry.",41
62,Mr WILSON,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Wimmera) [5.59] - I approach this subject dn a spirit of .cooperation. As one who has. consistently advocated the stabilization of the wheat industry and, indeed, of primary industries generally, I can assure the House that there is no desire on the part .of any one associated with the wheat-growing industry, or senting wheat-growing' electorates, to injure the existing stabilization scheme. I feel sure that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Scully) desires, if possible, to suggest ways and means to improve the scheme, and to rectify the anomalies that exist. Let me point out some of the weaknesses that are apparent. Most of the crops throughout the wheat belt of Australia have already been sown, and yet the business of allotting licensed areas has only just been begun. There is no hope of effectively controlling areas, because, as I have said, the greater part of the crop is already sown, though it may be possible to make the scheme effective in future years. I know that there is a considerable amount of dissatisfaction among growers over this attempt to control production by the methods followed, and particularly with the system of appointing local committees to'co-operate with the authorities in policing the regulations. The men who have been appointed to the committees, though they have accepted the positions because they want to assist the Government, have done so under protest in many cases. They do not like to be placed in the position of having to report adversely upon the activities' of their fellow growers. I have previously advocated what I regard as a better way of controlling production, especially in a young' country like Australia, and it is this: Seeing that 140,000,000 bushels has been fixed as the quantity upon which the guaranteed price will be paid, no undue restriction should be placed upon the area to be sown. The growers would be allotted a quota, and would .be paid on that quota only. Quantities in excess of the quota would be accepted, and a receipt given for them, but no advance would be made at the time on the portion in excess of the quota. This would tend to restrict unnecessary production, but it would leave the way open for the building up of a reserve of grain in Australia to meet a possible emergency caused by drought or by the opening up of an export market.",41
63,Mr BADMAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"What about the man who, because of drought, has had a low average over - the last two or three years?",42
64,Mr WILSON,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Such a man should receive special consideration. Whereas represome areas seldom suffer from drought, and a fairly consistent level of production can be maintained, other areas of equally goodwheat land are subject to periodical droughts. Growers in areas of the latter kind might be permitted to market a larger proportion of their crop to the pool than would otherwise be the ease, or to establish reserves on the farm or with the pool for future marketing in subsequent years when due to crop failure he could not furnish his quota. This matter of restricting acreage bristles with difficulties. If this season every grower is completely loyal to the scheme, and agrees to sow only his normal acreage, and the season is a good one, it is certain that the allotted quota of 140,000,000 bushels for Australia will be exceeded. I'make that statement on the authority of an executive member of the Victorian Wheat growers Association, who has gone into the position very carefully. An amount of £26,7'50,000 has been provided with which to pay a guaranteed price of 3s. lOd. a bushel on 140,000,000 bushels. If there is an excess of production over 140,000,000 bushels, the price to the growers will be decreased proportionately. If Australia produces only 140,000,000 bushels, the growers will receive 3s. 10d. a bushel, f.o.b., which works out at an average price at country sidings of 3s. for bagged wheat, and 2s. lOd. for bulk wheat. The continual stressing by Ministers and others of the fact that the Government has guaranteed a price of 3s. lOd. a bushel for wheat tends to create an erroneous impression in the minds of the public, who are led to believe that the growers are receiving that amount. That is not so. From that figure of 3s. lOd. must be deducted the cost of handling, railing, aud loading on board, or the cost of storage if we are not able to ship the wheat, so that the return to the grower in some instances is only 2s. lOd. a bushel, not 3s. lOd. If the Australian crop amounts to 160,000,000 bushels the return to the growers will be 3s. 4d. a bushel f.o.b., - which works out at an average price at country sidings of 2s. 7d. for bagged wheat, and 2s. 5d.' for bulk wheat - This is not the scheme which was advocated by the wheat-growers' organizations - throughout Australia, and in support of that statement. I quote the resolutions by the Wheat-growers Federation of Australia,- a body which is representative of every wheat-growing State in the Commonwealth. They arc as follows:That in order to implement a wheat stabilization plan the Federal and State Governments provide1. Acquire and take control all that wheat grown under an Australian wheat board with a majority of growers' representatives. 2. Tliat in view of .the serious international situation in regard to wheat surpluses if control of production is found to be inevitable, it be implemented on a marketing percentage basis. 3. That the Federal Government guarantee a price of wheat so marketed that will cover full costs of production, when the known cost is determined by a. committee represented by the Australian Wheat-growers Federation and - the Commonwealth Government. .4. Such committee to be established permanently as an advisory committee to recommend such measures to the Government on all matters, including marginal - areas, and adequate wheat storages, affecting the wheat industry from time to time. - There is not a majority of growers' representatives on the Australian Board. The policy which applied by the board is designed, largely in the interests of millers, merchants and trading interests, and the have only a very small say in it. [Leave io continue given.] It has been stated that some growers are anxious to sow as large an area as possible in order to wreck the scheme, or for some reason which I do not profess to know. know, however, that the wheat-growers are among those primary producers who today are in severe financial straits, and they are making every endeavour to place themselves in a position to meet their commitments. It is not unreasonable, in the circumstances, that they should seek permission to sow as large an area as possible. The price paid under the scheme cannot be accepted as covering the cost of production. I do not see why the Government should not pay the full guaranteed price to the grower upon delivery of the'wheat. The price is not Mr Wilson. too large; it is, in fact, the very least with which the growers can carry on. We have, at the .present, time, a wonderful opportunity to dispose of surplus wheat by distilling power alcohol from it .",42
65,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT STABILIZATION,Hon. W. M . N a i r n ) . - That subject does not come with in the terms of the motion.,43
66,Mr WILSON,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Very well, I shall seek another opportunity to deal with the subject. The Government should Jbe careful not to restrict acreage too drastically. There is a very small surplus of wheat in Australia, and if the season should turn out badly it might be necessary for us to import wheat. I appeal to the Government to co-operate with the growers' organizations, and to administer the scheme sympathetically. If possible, the whole subject, of production control should be reviewed, and a different method applied oil the lines I have recommended.",43
67,Unknown,WHEAT STABILIZATION,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m.,43
68,Mr BAKER,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Maranoa) [S.O] - In the course of his speech the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Scully) read a letter in which the writer stated that, either the Government was endeavouring by all the means in its power to ruin wheat farmers or it was totaPy incapable of understanding their problems. One does Wheat not like to impute motives and I do not is being propose to do so now. .1 content myself with saying that notwithstanding the denials of the Minister for Commerce growers (Sir Earle Page), a check up discloses that the-letters read by the honourable member for Gwydir came from bona fide wheat-farmers. The trouble seems to be that a committee of townsmen was entrusted with the administration of this I do important scheme for the stabilization of the wheat industry. In failing to give the peop ^ chiefly concerned, the wheat1 growers, adequate representation on the committee, the Government treated them in the same way as it treated the wool-growers, and the results have been disastrous. Before this scheme was brought forward by the Government, the Lender of the Opposition (Mr . Curtin) - proposed a plan under which the growers would be guaranteed 3s. 10id. a bushel, in respect of the first 3,000 bushels, farmers taking a chance in respect of disposing of their production in excess of that quantity. The Government's scheme guaranteed to'the grower a. return of 3s. lOd. a bushel up to a total production of 140,000,000 bushels; but it appears now that it is trying to reduce the total number of bushels in respect of which the guaranteed price is to be paid. A/policy of restriction of the production of foodstuffs is always 'bad. Especially is it so today when hundreds of millions of people throughout the world are threatened with starvation as the result of the world war. As a primary producing country, Australia should do everything possible to feed these people. ""We shall have to play our part in world rehabilitation which must inevitably follow the end of the present conflict. As the result of the establishment of a wheat pool by the Queensland Government about 20 years ago, the - wheat growers in Queensland have been able to escape to some degree the chaotic conditions that exist in the industry in other States. However, we have a number of complaints. The Queensland growers do not produce sufficient grain to meet the needs of the State. .1938-39 Queensland growers had 465,000 acres of wheat under cultivation and the average yield was eighteen bushels to the acre. In the following year 300,459 acres was under cultivation for wheat, and the average yield was 1S.3 bushels to the acre. According to the Queensland Wheat Board at least 500,000 acres should be planted in wheat to provide sufficient food for the people-of the State. As usual the large growers get the big end of the stick. Having registered their farms, they have a monopoly and those who may wish to engage in wheat-farming in the future, including many young men who return from .the war, will have' to purchase their land from the large holders. It should be the aim of the committee administering the scheme to protect the small growers and not bother so much about the interests of the large growers. I object to the establishment of the local boards-. On what basis are they established, and what are the qualifications of their personnel? It seems that the members of these boards are indulging in spying on the grower.;. We have no desire to see Gestapo methods introduced into this country. In view of the unsatisfactory state of affairs that exists in the' industry today, the whole scheme for the stabilization of the wheat industry should be re-drafted. I trust that some good will come out of this debate. ' Mr MCLEOD (Wannon) [S.6^ - In view of .the limited time at my disposal I shall have to summarize the speech I - had intended to make. In the first place, I support the statements of the honourable members for Gwydir (Mr Scully) and Wimmera (Mr Wilson). Despite what has been said by the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page), I believe that 90 per cent, of the growers are not in favour of control on an acreage basis. Practical wheat-growers fear that the stabilization scheme must inevitably break down because of the difficulty of jJolicing it. The honourable member for Gwydir has shown how in the endeavour to police the sowing of wheat many growers are being prejudiced. I shudder to think what would happen if the local boards were clothed with power to dictate to individual farmers how. much of their wheatIn must be ploughed in or eaten off. The whole scheme should be re-drafted. The wheat surplus is not unduly large. I see nb reason to fear the storing of two years' supply of wheat iii these days when one-half of the world is at war. No one knows what the futurehas in store for us. Nearly twelve months ago we were told that there would be huge excess stocks of wheat in Australia, but today the. surplus is down to approximately 50,000,000 bushels. If wheat were used for the production of power alcohol the existing surplus would quickly disappear. Under the stabilization scheme the farmer has been guaranteed 3s. lOd. a bushel but, owing to the way in which charges are piled up, the return to the grower is only 2s. lOd. a bushel. The interest charged on advances by the - Commonwealth Bank to the Australian Wheat Board amounts to. approximately £600,000 per annum. All of that expense has to be borne by the grower. I urge the Government to pay the full guaranteed price. In - acquiring the wheat, the Commonwealth takes over an asset the value of which is known. There is no risk about it. If , instead of doling oui small advances, the farmer were i -. t f t 'given the full guaranteed price, he would be able to meet his commitments. I trust that that will 'be done. Question resolved in the negative. NATION AL FITNESS BILL 1941. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 25th June, 1941 (vide page 372), on motion by Sir . FREDERICK STEWABTThat the hill he now read a second time. Mr Forde. (Capricornia) [8.11] - The object, of . this bill is lative stability, to the scheme introduced by the Commonwealth Government 1939. when it made available the sum £100,000 for a period of five rate of £20,000 per annum to promote a national fitness campaign. Though we may criticize it and offer some suggesschools tions for its improvement, the Opposition will support the measure. I opinion the bill does not go far enough. In the course of his second-reading - speech, the Minister for Social Services (Sir Frederick .Stewart) said that it was leaders. proposed to allocate annually £1,000 to each. of title State governments for .organizing purposes and £9,500 to the universities' for the purpose of establishfor . ing. diploma courses. It is understood .that the .balance is to be retained -.Commonwealth Government for the chiefly administration .of, the scheme. I have .no doubt that some honourable memfor bers will .oppose, during a period of the giving of legislative approval to such a scheme; but I.believe that, as i - take seme years .to-build up a national .fitness Organization of the kind envismodation aged by the Government, it would be wise to delay. the introduction of the measure until after the war. The-State governments are already spending various sums for the encouragement of - national fitness. Last year. the New South Wales Government expended look £2S,000 on the national fitness campaign. The present Minister for Education New South Wales is very enthusiastic about ths scheme. His government will make budgetary provision this year for amountin excess of that expended last year for this purpose. Precautions must be taken to ensure that the money to provided under this bill shall not be pended in such a way as to benefit unduly the privileged section of the community. Clause 5b providesSuhject to the next succeeding sub-section, the Minister may apply the. moneys staisd'ng to the credit of the fund for the purpose of providing assistance- . . . (b) to promote physical education in Universities and other institutions. - At theappropriate time. I shall move that the clause be amended by inserting the word "" schools"" before the word ""universities"". Most of the people of Australia do not enjoy the privilege of to give legisa university education.",43
69,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Is not the in honourable member's purposealready of served ' by the inclusion of the words years at the ""other institutions""?",45
70,Mr FORDE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I do not agree that which cater for the masses are included in "" other institutions"". The universities serve a comparatively n our small section of the community.",45
71,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,This grant is required for the purpose of training,45
72,Mr FORDE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Admittedl y some expenditure is necessary for the training of leaders, for the erection of buildings, and the provision of equipment. But we must not overlook the claims of the masses by the of the people, in whom we should be interested, because the wealthy, privileged sections can afford to provide their children various forms of recreawar, tion which are conducive to improved physical fitness. When I occasionally visit t will Mount Kosciusko, not in the ski-ing season, I deplore the fact that the accomis taken up by elderly spinsters, unwho examine other visitors through lorgnettes, and by the sons and daughters of the wealthy. It is regrettable that a national playground of that kind is not withiu the reach of the sons and daughters of the masses. More and more, we must after their' requirements. Although the Minister has previously made grant-3 in under this scheme to certain organizations, including the Young Men's Christian Association and the Young Women's an Christian Association, assistance should be given to schools in which are trained the children of the masses. The maintenbe ance of public hospitals throughout Ausextralia in 1939 cost £3,000,000. Whilst a moderate percentage of that sum was unpass the medical test.. avoidable expenditure, much could, have been saved by the adoption of preventaUnited tive measures, the improvement of the physical condition of the population, the provision of means 'of recreation, cluding thousands of swimming pools sports grounds, such as are provided in European countries, the United States of America, and Great Britain.",45
73,Mr CALAVET,WHEAT STABILIZATION,LJ-And provide the with more food!,46
74,Mr FORDE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"That is most necessary, and should take precedence even over the national fitness campaign. We must imthrough prove the economic condition of the the masses, so that they can provide theming selves with adequate, wholesome food. Better living and housing conditions, dental care, and hospital treatment are interwoven with national fitness. Last year the total expenditure on mental hoscamps pitals by all States was £l,7l23,000; child welfare absorbed £1,225,000; and the Education Departments of the several States expended £12,830,000. The Comto monwealth's expenditure on the last war now totals £944,000,000, including this purpose. £312,000,000 of interest; this debt carries an annual interest bill .of £7,294,000. Compared with those amounts, the proand vision of £20,000 a year foithe national fitness campaign is a bagatelle, and any one who opposes the grant oh the ground that it is an unwarranted extravagance in war-time has not vieAved the matter its true perspective. In the year 1940-41, the Commonwealth budgeted for the penditure of £186,000,000 for war purlabourer poses. During the current financial year, this expenditure will be increased £250,000,000. To date, the present Avar has cost Australia £19i2,000,000. viously, a grant of £20,000 to physical fitness, so far from militating against the efficient prosecution of the theThere Avar, is more likely to lead to a greater Thereprejudices Avar effort, and increased ability on the part of the people to defend Australia . against invasion. Parliament must guard against alloAving the physical condition ofgenius Australians to deteriorate to the comparaplay tively poor standard of the inhabitants of some countries. Recently, I read in the press that 40 per cent, of the applicants for entrance to the various defence arms of the United States of America failed to I admit the examination is most severe. . The States of America, which attaches great importance to national fitness, and launched a campaign in 1936. This year, init Avill expend in this direction and £A18,000,000 which will be gradually increased to £A.33,000,000 at the end of five years. Legislative sanction for this scheme was granted in a bill which Avas poor introduced into Congress on the 3rd January, 1941. The measure Avas described as "" a bill to promote national preparedness and the national Avelfare appropriation of funds to assist several states and territories in makadequate provisions for schools for physical education, including athletics; instruction and guidance in healthful liA'ing; Avider recreational use of school facilities; and the development of school "". To equal, on a population basis, the expenditure by the United States of America on physical education, the Parliament of the Commonwealth, would have vote £200,000 per annum. Last year, Great Britain provided £1,500,000 for Honourable members should bear in mind that physical fitness overrides race colour. It is international. The felloAv Will the overallsand the man wearing "" the old school tie "" can meet on the same playing arena. The bringing of them together in this Avay is an excelin lent thing. Very often, the mind of the man Will "" the old ' school t i e "" is exbroadened by mixing with the Avharf on the football field. Dr John Brown, chairman of a select committee to which Avas appointed to determine Avhether the United States' of America Obshould participate in the 1936 Olympic encourage, Games in Germany, saidare only three 'areas which override of race, colour and language. is the sphere of music, in which the player disappears and we appreciate the music. There is the sphere of art, where there is the harmony of colour and the beauty of concept. These take years of training, and only the can translate it. But here in organized and recreation and in sport, we have the great unifying and harmonizing influence which leaps creed, colour and class consciousness, because all the world loves to play. People tend to confuse national fitness Will "" physical jerks "" only, aiid believe that it makes provision for teaching the average man and woman to do exercises for ten minutes every morning and evening. That is a mistaken idea, because the movement is far wider.in its implication. National - fitness, through the physical, education .of the people, makes for a balanced .development of personality, and. the promotion ofgood, citizenship. The standard of living, the health of . the people, the elimination of slums, economic and social security, dental care, proper physical training in schools and for the masses after .'the school-leaving age, and the establishment of free.hospitals and recreation facilities.are of major, importance and,. are. bound up with national fitness. ......... , Mr .ABQHXE. .CAMERON - To finance such a programme,.'

Some people misto takenly regard education and health being independent, as if mind and body were not inextricably associated with one another. Realizing the physical fitness and the interest which the Minister for Health and Social vices has displayed in the subject, I am grandfathers. amazed, not at the proposal to expend £20.000, but at the .paucity of the grant.",46
75,Mr JOLLY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"How did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition calculate that the Government will make available £20,000 a year for the promotion of principal the national fitness campaign?",47
76,Mr FORDE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"The Government propaign poses to expend £100,000 in five years, an entitled. average of £20,000 a year. The Minister made that announcement when moving national fitness in earnest. the second reading of the bill . In his book, The Administration of Physical Education, Professor Nash points out University of Stellenbosch. that national fitness movements have carried on for someyears in the .leading countries of the world. . In . England approximately £1,500,000 annually .is made available-for.this purpose. Of .that amount. £442,000 is expended in .the provision ; of swimming pools, and approximately £337,000 for playing fields. W it h the possible exception of Russia, no other country has equalled Germany's lavish expenditure oh national fitness, youth movements, physical education . and Government-sponsored physical education, such as hostels, youth walks, swimming pools and playing areas. Germany inaugurated thismovement in 1936. Delegates to the Olympic Games held in * Berlin in 1936 reported that physical fitness education had grown to great proportions.in that country. In 1936, a Ozechoslovakian went from Canada to Russia to sit on a commission of inquiry into physical education. On. his return, t to he expressed amazement at the huge ex. penditure being incurred in Russia on physical fitness and leadership of youth. I have already referred to the substanprovision made by the .United States of. America in a bill introduced into Congress on the 3rd .January, 1941. These facts emphasize the importance of physical education, the object of which is the improvement of the health of the masses. Essential to success .of such schemes is provision of facilities for recreation men, and amusement. People cannot continue work at full pressure at irksome as - trades and callings unless they are allowed sufficient time'off for recreation, and provided with facilities to make the importance of most of that time. - Mr Archie CAMERON - The honourable Sermember should have told that to our",47
77,Mr FORDE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I know that the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) is opposed to this measure. He is entitled to his opinion; but we on this side do not agree with him. The defect of this proposal is that it does not . treat the national fitness camwith the generosity to which it is The Government of South A f r i ca has taken up the problem of It has appointed a professor, and an assistant professor, of physical education at the In India, been the Government recently incorporated physical education in the syllabuses of all its universities, and appointed graduates of .Springfield University, United States of America, to supervise this work. National fitness campaigns have been launched in all the States of the Commonwealth, but New South Wales leads the way in this respect. One reason for this is the great interest which the chairman of the National Fitness Council in that State, Mr. A. E. Symon, has shown in the movement. The council held its inaugural meeting.on the 6th January, 1938, and it meets once a month. The executive of that body meets weekly, and is assisted by various committees which meet as required. A similar scheme has. been established in Queensland. At the University of Queensland, special training is being given to a staff of instructors. The Brisbane Telegraph of the 6th June last, contains an interesting statement by the vice-chancellor of that university, Mr. J. D. Story, of what has been accomplished in physical education in that State. In the course of his remarks, Mr. Story said:The Queensland University Senate was able during 1!)40 to see-its way to establish both - eertinuate and diploma courses in physical education in this State, as from the commencement of the academic year 1941. Those courses are now in operation, the enrolments for the current year being 12 fov the Certificate course (four men and eight women) and -20 for the Diploma course (10 men and 10 women). The subjects, of both courses include hygiene, first aid, appropriate elementary anatomy and' physiology, calisthenics, theory iind organization of games, gymnastics, swimming and life saving, boxing and fencing (for men) and dancing (for women). The diploma course includes also psychology,- voice culture rind speech training, and introductory chemist r y and physics. Honourable members generally are aware that at most of the swimming pools and on the beaches in Queensland and about Sydney, instructors are provided under these schemes. New South Wales alone expends approximately £30,000 a year on physical fitness, whereas, under this measure, that State will receive only £2,000. The services of instructors in swimming and athletics are made available free to the schools. A similar scheme is being carried out in country centres where swimming facilities exist. These admirable arrangements, however, are restricted because of limited finance, aud, consequently, they have not been fully developed. In order to launch this scheme properly, the Commonwealth must set up a central virile organization in Canberra to supervise it. Physical fitness is too important a matter to be looked after' in some back room of the Commonwealth Health Department. That department, over which Dr. J. H . L. Cumpston presides, is at present busily engaged in extensive research - work, and, therefore, it should not be asked to 'undertake the supervision of this scheme. Some dynamic organizing force must be applied, and' that can best be done by a special body, with it3 head-quarters in Canberra. I offer that suggestion to the Minister.. Such an organization would provide more punch than the Health Department. National fitness in Great Britain is controlled by the Education Department, We need an organization capable of presenting the campaign in its true perspective to the public and winning unanimous support for it. Up to date, no effort has been made to do that. For this work, we. should acquire the services of an outstanding man like Dr Arthur Lamb, B.Sc, M.Phys.Edue., who is now Director of Physical Education at M'ciGill University, Montreal. Dr Lamb was born in Ballarat. He served with the Canadian Forces in the last war. I have no doubt that the Commonwealth Government could secure his services, provided it paid him a salary in keeping with his qualifications. His name appears frequently in works on .physical fitness in the United States of America and Great Britain. Another outstanding man is Dr James Summers, a graduate of Springfield University, United States of America, who 'is also a - native of Ballarat. He is now the head of the Institute of Technical Physical Education at Springfield. Dr Arthur Lamb is a past president of the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada, and has brought many Canadian school teams to Australia. Although this scheme has been launched in Australia., ho State yet possesses adequate facilities to, train leaders and instructors. The Comlmon wealth should take up this matter in co-operation with the States.",47
78,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"We .alreadv done that. Mr.""FOEDE - The trouble is that the Government is now initiating a. scheme which will require much more than £20.000 annually, if it is to be tackled with the determination which its i m portance merits. As I have already pointed - out, New South Wales alone expends more annually on physical fitness than the Government proposes to provide under this bill. We know that, owing to the stranglehold which the Commonwealth has over State finances, no State government, however willing it might be to do this work properly, can afford the necessary funds. In view of the.fact that New South Wales alone expends £30,000 a. year for this purpose, the sum proposed to.be made available under this measure as a niggardly contribution! The training of leaders cannot be undertaken without the provision of costly buildings and equipment at the various universities. These instructors wil l be passed through the universities, and will be made available to the schools, in order that the masses may derive benefit from the campaign. The new Minister for Education in New South Wales, Mr Clive Evatt, with whom I have discussed the subject, is very anxious to give an impetus to this work. That State is fortunate in having the services of such outstanding men as Mr Gordon young, B.A., B.Sc.,. B.Phys. Educ, and Mr if . Le Maistre, B.Sc, M.Phys.Educ, of Springfield University. The former is Director of Physical Education, and the latter is in charge of the lecturing staff at the Sydney U n i versity. Both of tliese gentlemen were born in Australia. A great deal of the success of a scheme of this kind depends upon the co-operation of the municipal councils and of - the local committees in each centre. It is pleasing to note that, as the result of the work of the national fitness organization in New South Wales, playgrounds have been opened up by municipal councils in congested suburbs of Sydney. These playgrounds are' frequented by thousands of children weekly. In one suburb, they have been the means of almost completely eliminating juvenile delinquency. The statistical records of the Department of Education, of New South Wales; verify that fact. The have, National Fitness Council of New South Wales established complete centres in ten under-privileged centres where the children, at the expiration of their training, had sold the goods manufactured in their hobby classes from materials supplied by the council. The proceeds of that sale were used for charitable purposes. Between 4,000 and 5,000 children attended thece centres. What has been done in New South Wales could be done all over Australia, if the matter were properly tackled. Human lives are the greatest asset that this country has. Every child born into the community is an asset which should be cared for. Anything that we can do to brighten the lives and improve the physical fitness of our children should be gladly done. Under the scheme envisaged in this legislation there will ""be a great opportunity to do that. Last year, New South Wales expended £2S,00.0 on national fitness, apart from the expenditure of a grant of £10,000 for the establishment of a camp at Broken Bay. This year the National Fitness Council has budgeted for the expenditure of £33,000 as follows:Public relations appropriation-Printing brochures, films, conferences and fitness weak .. 1,000 Community centres(a) Instruction, and {b) equipment 2,000 Vacation play centresTwenty centres-(a ) Instruction, (6) equipment, (c)'professional services, ((<) milk, and (e) camps, picnics, transport, meals, &c. .. 4,000 National fitness campsBroken Bay, Macquarie and Castlereagh- £ (») Wardens and capital expenses - .. 700 (b) Equipment and facilities . . 2,000 (c) Fresh air fund . . 1.000 3,700 Youth hostels[a) Salary and wages . . 300 (6) Building and equipping two hostels . . 2.000 2,300 New properties(a) In it i a l development, (6) organization, (c) equipment- Dobroyd Point, education sites, &c, playgrounds, & c . . . .. 5,000 Model community centre . . . . .15,000 i ; 33.000 . :. - J"" - : ' : New South ""Wales intends to co-operate to the greatest degree with the Commonwealth Government. ""What I have said about New South Wales applies in a lesser degree to the other States where, owing to their comparative newness, the national fitness schemes are less developed. I emphasize that before this scheme' can provide the dynamic force that is needed, to "" put it over"", it is essential that its control be placed in the hands of a highly-skilled man of the calibre of Dr Lamb, the Australian in charge of technical education at the MCGill University. The new department must be the clearing, house for the State Education Departments. It must be able to give assistance and advice to the State govurnments, .and to prepare lectures and broadcasts and propaganda generally. It is important that we in this Parliament should ensure that an organization of this kind shall not be allowed to get' into the control of designing bodies which might try to use it for ulterior purposes, and that money provided for this campaign shall be properly expended. With those reservations, I support the measure.",49
79,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Barker) [S.44] - I can see no good in this measure. It is one of those weak anaemic, rickety things which emanates from this Government from time to time and which Parliament is expected to accept as part and parcel of war-time policy. It looks to me, from the way the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde) was labouring for 45 minutes, that he must have changed his attitude on this bill. In view of the adroit way in which the Government, at question time, somersaulted its policy regarding - the important arbitration bill, at the request, if not the orders, of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), it looks to me as if this is quid pro quo. and that the Opposition has decided to support this bill in return for the disposal of that other rather troublesome, measure. I remember that not so very long ago, when the first of these national fitness campaigns started, we were assured that it would cost nothing, whereas the next we heard about it was an account for £10,000. I have no doubt that, if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had his [22] way, the cost of national fitness to this community would run into millions of pounds. I also know something about the playgrounds to which the honourable member referred. The bill for those playgrounds was £100,000. There are certain things which belong to the province of the States and certain things which belong to the province of the Commonwealth. To my mind we. are everlastinglyoverstepping the bounds, and trespassing on what is, after all, State territory, with the very natural result that now and again we strike things such as happened at the meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers in this chamber last F r i - '. day. I believe that if the debate could, on that occasion, have been published, it would have pushed the war news on to. the - back pages of the newspapers. Min? isters would be well advised to look .again at this measure. Ifthey deceive anybody about this it is only themselves; they do not deceive their supporters, and I do not think that they deceive the country. It is time that this game ' of make-believe came to an end, and that the Government either got down to a solid policy for fighting the war or defending this country, or said that it was not fit for the job and made way for somebody else. The time has come when a few kindly references like that have to be made to the occupants of the treasury bench. I hope that opportunities , will be offered during this sessional period for some honourable members to say what they think about one or two otlier little pranks that the Government has been up to during the last few days. It is most illuminating, that the Government of this country can find time to bring in a bill for the expenditure of £20,000 this year when everything that it wants to do could be done under a regulation issued under the National Security Act, but cannot find time to debate the question of how Australian forces should be used overseas. I have asked for time to debate that matter. Little things like this bill are as manna from heaven to the Government, because they will keep the attention of the public off what really matters. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition could have 45 minutes to discuss this bill. If any service deserves recognition when the next Honours List is issued, it is the case put up by the honourable gentleman.. I impress upon the Government very forcefully that this sort of thing iscoming to an end, and that there are a few of us who want to know the why and wherefore of one or two things-. Trifling, matters like this could, well be given to the cat,, because they ought not to be taking up the time of Parliament when hundreds of thousands of men are being, enlisted by the Government which cannot provide time in Parliar ment to discuss vital matters affecting them. To put a bill like this before the . House with, the state of affairs which we have-at home and overseas is disgraceful and disgusting. Mr BEASLEY' (West Sydney) [8.57]. - I suppose that it depends on the point from which one looks at this matter whether we consider it of minor importance or otherwise; I hold the view that the well-being of this-nation rests upon the capacity of the community as a whole to provide the rising generation with the - vigour and physical development that - every nation must possessif it is to s-urevive. We must never fail to recognize that the whole structure of all we possess will . rest upon our determination to provide for the proper development, nourishment and care of our children. This is a problem to which foreign countries have - given great attention. As was said by 1>he Deputy Leader of the Opposition ((Mr Forde), who has given much time to the matter, great progress has Ibeen made in those countries. I am not anxiousto link this discussion with the Avar, but the honourable member for Darker (Mr Archie Cameron)- has done so. I think that if the honourable gentleman spoke his mind, he wouldadmit that the fighting forces,, of one arm of Avhicli ""he has had command, would haA'e had - distinct advantages if they, in ' their - childhood and adolescence,"" had been given the attention which this measure - will provide for .their children. National fitness has its origin in the propercare and nourishment of the children. This 3s something which unfortunately has - fceen sadly neglected in this country. "" ^Consider the last eight or nine years as am example of the unfortunate circumstances-which haAe prevailed in. thousands of Australian home Avhose occupants have had to depend on food relief for existence. What chance has a child in a home in Avhicli there is unemployment, and in which the parentshave to depend on Government charity for subsistence, to lay down the foundations of fitness of mind, body ""and limb that' isnecessary if that child is to take its proper place in society, in after years-. That is the basic argument which Ave consider should be advanced in regard to 'this measure. Let us for amoment try to visualize A\hat it means - to haA-e to r make-provision for a large family. There is no need to enumerate the allowances paid by various States, but all of them are totally inadequate to provide a family with the necessaries of life, and the result has been Avidespread malnutrition. It is no Avonder that there is more than an ordinary measure of sickness in the community. Children born during the depression years have suffered so much through lack of proper food that when epidemics break out or sudden changes of Aveather occur, they have not the ability of .normal people to withstand disease, and fall easy victims to Avhat-ever illness is prevalent. Their suffering is very often entirely, due to the failure of their country to make adequate provision for them'. It is a fundamental 1 obligation of any democracy to safeguard the health of its people. If it does not do that"", it does not deserve to survive. That is the position that has to be faced. I shall not elaborate on that matter because I am sure all honourable members;, particularly those Avho have families, realise their responsibility in that regardand Avhat it means-when Avant enters the home. Until noAv physical fitness campaignshave concerned largely children attending school.. While such activities naturally must command our support,. I believe that something should be done for children beyond the school age. The Deputy Leader of' the Opposition (Mr Forde) referred to the work of the Sydney City Council, which, in association Will Avhat' is knoAvn as the Kindergarten Union, has been responsible for the erection of a number of playgrounds in some of the more thickly populated centres of the City of Sydney. r These playgrounds' have been of immense benefit to the children. The council has not only provided all facilities with which a modern playground should be equipped, but also has appointed a special officer to supervise the planning and setting out of the various physical culture courses which the children should undergo. That scheme has been a great success. Some municipalities have developed schemes on the same lines, but, as has been said, the great handicap is lack of adequate financial support. It is my purpose to-night to draw attention to the work which has been dene in New South Wales with children of beyond the school age by what are known as the Police and Citizens Boys Clubs. During his visit to various parts of the world in 1937 the New South Y/ales Commissioner of Police noted the great advancement which had been made in the setting up in thickly populated areas in other parts of the world, of clubs which young fellows could attend for recreation and where their physical and mental condition could be improved by engaging in all sorts of sport, physical exercises and general training. The result was that similar clubs were organized in - various districts of Sydney, and supervision was undertaken hy the police.. Public meetings were - held, and prominent citizens were requested to volunteer for duties iri association with the'local, police for' the purpose of establishing these clubs."" I have been interested in the club in my own district fro m its inauguration, and its success has exceeded all expectations. I am anxious that, in implementing ^he proposals contained in this bill, use shall be made, of these existing organizations, with a view to assisting, extending and improving upon the work they are now doing.",50
80,Sir FREDEKICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"They in fact, a. development of the plan which we started two years ago. Ivfr. BEASLEY - F r o m discussions with people concerned, I believe that these organizations are hampered considerably because of the same old trouble, lack of finance, and it has. been suggested that I might take the opportunity presented by the introduction of this measure to urge the Government to lend its support to them. In my own district of Biilmain, which is a thickly populated industrial area and is the centre of the shipbuilding activities of the State, a club' was started in 1937. The membership of that club today is approximately 2,300."" Every night of the week, no less' than 200 boys attend the club-rooms, and take part in various forms of gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, public-speaking,' reading and all other activities calculated to foster physical and mental development. The original cost of inaugurating the scheme was £3,000, which wa3 devoted mainly to the purchase of equipment. The whole-hearted co-operation of the State Government at the time was forthcoming, and the club was given the use of a very suitable old trades school building which was not then being used. The £3,000 was subscribed by the public. The membership has grown continuously during the last four years.",52
81,Mr FORDE,WHEAT STABILIZATION,Do they take boys other than cadets for the police force? ' Mr BEASLEY - Yes . Mr JOT.LY - Of what age?,52
82,Mr BEASLEY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,F r o m fourteen yeara up to twenty years.,52
83,Sir FKEDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,They are doing a magnificent job.,52
84,Mr BEASLEY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"They are. The object of the police in undertaking, this 'work is to.takeyoung fellows-off the-street corners, and. putthem somewhere where; under proper supervision and discipline^ they may undertake a wide range of beneficial activities and thus develop whatever talents they may possess. Tc-day, it is. interesting to drop into the stetion of the club-rooms devoted to public speaking, and listen to the ideas being expressed by lads of 16, 17 or 18 years of age. The knowledge that many of these young fellows possess is amazingly wide, and given the necessary training and are, opportunities which the club is able to provide, they should show a gratifying development in later years. The library also is extensively used. The supervisors note the different types of boys frequenting the library, and the kind of books which appear to be most in demand. B y that means, the supervisors are able to understand a lad's taste and outlook on life and watch the development of his career. From the outline which I have given, honourable members will appreciate that an immense amount of. good is being done'by this, organization, which has drawn these hoys into a sphere of social activity which will be of great benefit to them later in life. It is generally agreedthat' many young fellows find themselves off the beaten track because of company they keep, and because the time hanging on their hands has not. been properly spent. The police Relieve that higher ideals and more lofty motives can.be cultivated in tliese boys by laying a .foundation of. good citizenship, and encouraging, them to become useful . members of the community rather than - charges on the'state. The principle em? bodied in. that scheme issomething worth, supporting, and organizations similar to those existing in. New South ""Wales might well be set up in other parts of Australia.. At the beginning there was some opposition from Labour supporters who believed that the idea of having policemen in charge of these clubs was not a good one. That opposition was soon broken-down hecause of the sound basis of citizen committees upon which the clubs were conducted. In such schemes the greatest difficulty is in ensuring continuity of - operation. When a new scheme is started, there is usually a good deal of public - support, but as time passes, changes' take place and many of' those who at the . inauguration were enthusiastic workers drop .out. Voluntary effort cannot lie depended upon entirely to keep - such ventures in. successful' operation. That is why the assistanceof the police in this case has been invaluable^ In all police districts, officers are detailed to look after the clubs. At Balmain there. Ts one man whose work is entirely taken up with the running of the club* That gives the club a degree of stability, and' ensures that the various aspects of its operation are properly attended to. A club was established in Woolloomooloo,which is in the electorate of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward), 1 and-it also has a very large membei'ship. There is great rivalry between the various <slubs in the different sporting activities. Sowell have the j>eople responded to the idea, that a federation - of the various clubs has been set up; the object being to raise money by various means, - such as carnivals, artMr licasley. unions, and so. on. The funds will be used to set up 'dubs in country' towns. Alreadythere are clubs at Tamworth, Attunga,. Bega, Cooma, Goulburn, Mur-rumburrah-Harden, Quirindi, Upper ITorton, Young, and Newcastle. Cliib3 in-the metropolitan area, have a membership of no less than 8,000. At Kurrajong;. 43"" miles from Sydney, the orgaiiization-has a camp, which was inaugurated by the committee of the Balmain club. It has an ideal situation, buildings have been erected, and it - possesses facilities for regular week-end camps, which are attended by under-privileged boys irrespective of whether they are members of police boys clubs or not; of course members of the clubs have first preference. The boys who attendthese camps are usually members of families in indigent circumstances, who have no other opportunities to enjoy holidays. During the last two years, 2,400 boys have attended this camp. Some of them even walked from Sydney to Kurrajong in order to do so. I again refer the Minister to some of the activities of the Balmain club. It has a gymnasium, at which honorary boxing instructors handle classes of from 20 to 30 boys each night. Some of the lads engage in exercises with the punch-bag, and spar under the guidance of members of the police force who visit different clubs each week. In another section of the gymnasium (there are wrestling mats where dozens of boys engage in matches under supervision. Others - are trained in weight-lifting. This is the body? building section, of the club, and some of the boys-lift weights of ""over 200 lbs. Their, physique is almost perfect, and is vastly different from what it was.when, they first joined the club as youngsters. In this section the boys begin with mat exercises, and' as they develop they learn weight lifting from a constable who was a State champion. In another section, boysbetween the agesof twelve and thirteen years exercise on vaulting horses and"" parallel bars, build Human pyramids, and drill withdumb bells. There, is a' library and asection for games such aschess and draughts, as well as a billiard"" room - A debatingclass has been organized, and. dances' and other social : functions are conducted regularly. Hot andcol'd'water'showers and other facilities have been installed. In its scheme for achieving national fitness, the Commonwealth Government has so far only touched the fringe of the great field for such work. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Forde) that in this campaign more attention should be given to the schools than to the universities. People whose children attend universities can afford to provide them with physical training.",52
85,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEAT STABILIZATION,That sort of thing is provided for at the universities.,54
86,Mr BEASLEY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"That is so. Unfortunately that is not the lot of thousands of other young Australians. Therefore I consider that ordinary day schools should be put first on the list of institutions to receive financial assistance. I am also deeply concerned about the care of boys between the ages of fourteen and twenty years. The Government can help them by assisting existing organizations which have proved their value, and in doing eo it will not be expending money on some uncertain venture. I commend my ""suggestions to the Minister, and I hope that the police boys clubs will receive consideration in the allocation of funds, .because they are doing work of great value to the community.",54
87,Mr FRANCIS,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Moreton) [9.27] This is a bill to establish a Commonwealth Council for National Fitness and a. national fitness fund. The Government has indicated that it proposes to continue with its scheme for making available a sum of £100,000 for expenditure over a period of five years, and the bill sets but the following objects:(«.) to encourage the development of national fitness in each State under the direction of a National Fitness Council appointed by the Government of the State; (?it to promote physical education in universities and otlier institutions . . . I believe that all honourable members are satisfied that we should give every .encouragement and assistance to a national fitness campaign. campaign should be a strong one, and on this point I join issue with the Minister for Health (Sir Frederick Stewart). The Government's effort so far has not been worthy of the title "" campaign"", except in New South Wales and Victoria, .although it is now in the third year of its five-year - term. If he will compare what has been done in Australia with the good results that have been achieved in other countries, I am sure that the Minister will be dissatisfied with the progress that has been made here. Prevention is better than cure, and' the more physically strong our race is the better equipped it will be in the event of a national emergency. If we conduct our national fitness campaign on proper lines we shall .become an '' A "" class race, instead of a "" B "" class or even a. "" C "" class race. We shall be faced Will many difficult problems Avhen' Ave emerge from the present conflict. The stronger the nation is mentally and physically the better able Avill it be to deal with the problems of commerce, and the development and - reconstruction of primary and secondary industries. We have a heavy task ahead, and the Government should ensure now that the money appropriated for national fitness purposes is properly expended. In Great Britain today £1,500,000 has been set aside for national fitness Avork, and the United States of America has appropriated £18,000,000 and proposes, by steady increases, to reach an annual expenditure of £33 000,000. National fit; ness training should begin very early in the lives of our young people, and the Avork should be continued steadily from this sound beginning. The mere appropriation of money for national fitness dees not improve the standard of fitness of the community. The money must be wisely expended according to a carefully prepared plan. From my examination of national fitness work in Queensland, I consider that the results achieA'ed are unsatisfactory. A f t e r almost three years of operation, the State council has hardly begun to organize recreation, competitive sport .and physical education.",54
88,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,Has - not Queensland machinery for dealing with this Avork?,54
89,Mr FRANCIS,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"The proposals of the But the Government have my endorsement, but I object to its method of conducting the campaign. The State gOA'-ernments could have played a bigger part than they have done, and the Commonwealth Government is not giving proper supervision to the campaign. An annual report from each State is not sufficient. The effort in Queensland has not been sustained, and I am dissatisfied with. the results that-it ' hasachieved. The Minister for Health has supplied me with a copy of the last annual report for that State. I learned from it tha% after'three years,, full information has been obtained as to the number and locations.of existing facilities-for physical recreation in the Greater Brisbane area-, ahd particulars of the numbers engaged in. organized sport and physical recreation.

That is what we are told after three It is also hoped to arrange during the Christholidays a class for. training potential leaders from the-, principal country. centres throughout the State, the object being that these trained: men and women, will then pass on the knowledge gained: to clubsandorganizations interested in their respective centres. Negotiations are in progress with t l i o ' . Queensland Lawn Tenuis-Association to launch a scheme designed, to offer coaching facilities to beginners in tennis. "" It is hoped"", and ""'negotiations are in progress "", but' we areentitled - to something, more than, that after three years.. The progress made in Queensland cannot please the Minister, unless committees he is very easily pleased.",55
97,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"The honourable member'squotationsdo not please me, because he has deliberately selected what appear to be the least interesting items.",55
98,Mr FRANCIS,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"There has been little progress in Queensland, as compared with the other States. The report f u r ther statesMembers' of the Women's National Emergency - Legion and the Australia Air League have been trained as leaders for their-respective organizations. I point out that the Australian A i r League has .ceased to exist. Another paragraph readsFitness classes for men and women have been commenced in the.public service. The progress indicated is less than one has a. right to expect after three years. Referring to university activities, the report stares- Varying sums of'money were made available by the - Commonwealth Government for certain of these activities, but: so far as the Senate of the University of Queensland was able to learn, the position with regard to the establishment of a diploma was somewhat involved. The report then goes into details with regard to activities in connection - with universities in other States, and the hope is expressed that at the beginning of the academic year of 19.41,' further progress will be made. The Minister said that 30 or 40 students were taking the two courses arranged'. I suggest that the authorization of the expenditure of the sum of - money referred. to in the bill will be - insufficient . alone to carry out the important work that needs to be done. It .is necessary to stop the d r if t and to instil enthusiasm into the work. Greater supers .vision - by - the representative of the Commonwealth Government is required to produce the desired results. The report would please only those who are easy to p^ase. I am anxious that the scheme shall be a. complete success, but probably no member will be satisfied with the resultsachieved during the last three years. I hope that action will be taken to get results in Queensland similar to those obtained in the other States.",56
99,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Batman) [9.35] This is a bill for an act relating to national fitness, and the second-reading .debate, if it can be called a debate, is proceeding. On another occasion I suffered seriously in the esteem of some leading constituents of mine by,publicly stating that I agreed with the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), but greatly daring, and tempted beyond my strength,, I venture to say that such terms as. ""anaemic"" and "" r i c k e t y "" , applied .to this bill, are too good to be resisted - I accept them as fair comment. It is true that one ivould imagine that the war was over and won, that reconstruction' had been successfully carried out, and that, in fact, we were now merely putting the coping stone, or some final decoration, upon the majestic peace edifice which had been created. That is not the position; indeed, the contrary, if one could so call it , is the fact. Have we not just reached that highly dangerous climax when we are fighting to the death with our former allies, and at the same time embracing, with unwontedprotestations of good will, our former enemies? However, that would be but a first impression, because, when one comes to examine the speech by the Minister for Health (Sir Frederick Stewart), it is immediately evident that thisis another, and I should think not very effective, Avar measure. Indeed, the Minister does - not disguise, the fact that matters which he and his friends have neglected in times of peace, although they''were peculiarly applicable to times of peace,; are noAV to be taken up at this inappropriatetime of crucial war test, - but only for the purposes of. war. It - is evident - that in this bill, as in many other proposals of the Government, we - are again doing what I . have suggested before Ave are too much inclined to do. We' are paying to the German Chancellor the highestcompliment, namely, that of imitation. The high ambition of the Government seems to be that we shall, at this stage, create what Ave have all become familiar Will as a matter of reading, namely, the Hitle r Youth. I suggest that the domain which we are IIOAV. entering is one into which the Commonwealth Government should - not go at all, and that it is peculiarly in appropriate that the Government should enter it at this particular time. Sir - FREDERICK STEAVART - Does the honourable member overlook that Ave are proposing noAV only to give permanence to a campaign which was started before the Avar?",56
100,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I do not overlook sfchat. The campaign was started before -*he war, and I have been led by the ^Minister, as well as by colleagues immediately associated with him, to believe that there is only one common purpose at this rmoment of intense gravity which should animate us, and that is carrying, on the - war to an ultimate and speedy conclusion of victory. So far as this bill pretends to be something which it is not, it is to be severely frowned upon, but, so far as it may be taken to show genuine interest in youth, it satisfies me that the Government entirely misconceives the functions' of popular government under the democratic theory. Those functions are so to manage the occupancy of this fair earth, or such part of it as we have dominion over, that production may proceed to an unlimited extent for the use of the people of this nation, and according to the tastes and requirements of the various people constituting, it. Of courseit is the function of government to keep open the broad highways of distribution in the general public interest, but, subject to that, the greatest j)os.sible of choice and measure of liberty should be preserved to each individual. As I understand it, the vicious fundamentals of the capitalist system oncerooted out, the greatest measure of freedom, should . he thereafter preserved to the individual. Youth, in my view, should be given its head. It is basically wrong to attempt .to harness youth into conforming with the theories and habits of old age. Youth, under a wise system of government, would provide its own recreation. As a matter of fact, if does so regularly and habitually within the powers allowed by governments and up to the limits of its opportunities. The first prerequisite of any system of catering for youth is an abundance of good food, and the second, the provision of congenial employment. Both flow from, - wise government. Both ' have been consistently denied youth by the present Government. . It , and most of the Governments in my experience which have preceded it, have neglected to satisfy these essential needs. In any case, in such matters as the architecture of homes, the choice of reading, and the selection of amusements) it is surely the prerogative of youth to set its own standard according to its own desires-, Hot, of course, disregarding the experience and advice of age. In the final analysis, youth should cater for itself in these matters, and I politely suggest that the Commonwealth Government should mind its own - business-. There is no call whatever for it to play the heavy father. Indeed, I suggest that all fathers might with advantage learn to talk with,, and not at, their children; Youth avails itself of the opportunities that present themselves, and this parental Commonwealth cannot hope to take the place of Mother Nature. To illustrate how youth is naturally provided with nutriment, housing and appropriate exercise, I take as an analogy, for the benefit of my Country party friends; the calf or the foal. A calf which runs with its mother and feeds on sweet, natural milk, develops rapidly and healthily, whereas a calf which is more or less artificially fed' on skimmed or separated milk, develops into, a "" poddy,"" with thin legs and a big belly. Moreover,, the calf or foal which freedom grows in its natural, surroundings provides its own recreation and exercise with unerring certainty, disporting itself on the green grass, and taking long periods of rest.",57
101,Mr MARWICK,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"'Such - calves live in the wide, open spaces. They cannot be likened to children in.crowded cities-. Mr BRENNAN,-The reference. of the honourable member is apt, but this bill covers country as well as city youths. A measure of this kind might do very well as the final act in the establishment of the perfect socialist state, but before such a final decoration could be made, the socialist state would need builders intent on giving effect to-the elementary principles of socialism. In my view anything that may be clone under the provisions of this measure may be done better, and with less expense, under the existing ample machinery for the purpose. It is true that part of the policy of the Labour party is. to create, ultimately, a sovereign Commonwealth Parliament, and to delegate local matters to local bodies; but that has not yet been done. At present the State Governmentshave charge of. such matters as health, sanitation in various forms, and education in both higher and. lower forms, as well as other matters dealt with in this bill. A . very useful work, for example, is heing done in Victoria, in caring for the teeth of children in State schools. The only reason-o r alleged reason-wh y such work is not being done generally throughout the State in respect of the vast body of children receiving elementary education, is that money is not available for the purpose, and this is to the eternal discredit of ourselves and of our Governments'. But that does not justify the Commonwealth Government stepping in at this unsuitable time to do work which it is not accustomed to, and not suited for, even though the object be to ensure that our youth will be physically fit to make soldiers. Municipalities, and local governing bodies under various names, have ample authority in. respect to parks and gardens, and they are doing a valuable work. Although much, remains to be done not only for the male youth of the country, but also for men,.women and children generally, a good deal has already been achieved. Excellent workhas been done in the establishment of pa.rks and gardens in the various municipalities of Melbourne. Swimming pools also ' have been providedby many municipalities, and they are being well managed. Those responsible for the construction and management of these pools are much more closely in contact with the people who use them, and can control them much more efficiently than newly appointed Commonwealth officers are likely to do. There is a good deal of ""hooey "" about this physical fitness business, and - the necessity for exercise to develop muscles, thews and sinews. I have had some experience of farm life, and I recall the days when good, healthy country youth jumped out of bed at the sound of an alarm clock at 5 a.m. each day and did a good day's work before leaving for school. On their return from, school, they did almost another clay's, work. These youths, bright and healthy, were the progeny of good citizens at-a time when simple living and hard working was the rule. I can imagine such young men telling an officer of. the Commonwealth Government, who proposed to draft them into public halls for demonstrations of physical 'fitness, that, unfortunately, they had arranged a game of football or cricket in a neighbouring paddock, and would not be available for the proposed exercises. So much for the proposal that Commonwealth officers should teach their grandsons to .suck eggs! And. so much for the country youth ! It is evident also that a new department, will be established. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), in the interesting speech in which he gave this bill his benediction, - suggested the employment of skilled persons for the purpose of directing Commonwealth institutions which it is evidently intended to establish, under the provisions of the bill. He reeled off, from the wealth of his knowledge, so large a number of distinguished scientists whose services lie thought might be co-opted in this field of operations, that I began to wonder whether or not he was composing, a Who's Who of eminent scientists. It would not be seemly of me to comment further upon the speech of the honourable gentleman. I think we all support' physical fitness. "" Y o u t h "" , I suppose, is a masculine term.; Youth and the Maid. It is equally important, however, that the maid of the same age should have physical fitness, the object being, a3 my friend, the honourable member for Gipps little while ago, to achieve mans sana in corpore san.o, a phrase with which we were made familiar while we were still . youths among the youth. That, of course, is entirely desirable. I have suggested;, however-and I summarize by repetition-that so far as the proposals-in ibis bill arc concerned with the objective of physical fitness, they can be dealt with adequately, and more perfectly and efficiently, by existing machinery, than by the Commonwealth encumbering itself with numerous responsibilities in a strange field, at the very time when its present responsibilitiesare so far weighing it down that it has been .found necessary to call in aid two additional Ministers, who have spilled over from the fron t ministerial bench and are hanging on by the skin of their teeth to the front benches in the corner.",57
102,Mr CALWELL,WHEAT STABILIZATION,There are three additional Ministers.,59
103,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"The number of Ministers has become so large that my powers of calculation, are unequal to the task of computing it. The proposed new department is not needed. If there be money to. spare, give it to municipal bodies and State schools. There is an excellent staff of teachers in the State schools of this country. They are a body of men and women for whom I have the greatest respect. I say that without detracting in the slightest degree from the excellence of the standards of those who are outside the State school system, in charge of the conduct of secondary or primary schools. Probably no class of persons in Australia today so well understands the psychology of youth as do the State school teachers. Especially in large industrial suburbs like Northcote, Preston and Fitzroy, which I represent, the State schools are attended by children of working-class people, and some very poor people. I have spoken to some of the teachers in those schools, and - they have mentioned' the number of children who attend inadequately fed, not to speak of being disgracefully underclad - All honour to those'who have helped' to mitigate this evil'by providing' milk-as the'late ""Dr Maloney did so effectively-food , and clothing for such children! But what"" are we to. say of this great Commonwealth Government which a""t this time steps in, not-if you please-to feed the children, not to clothe them, but to'brace them up physically, on empty stomachs and in an undernourished state to protect primarily the interests of the wealthy.",59
104,Mr MARTENS,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Every night the advice is broadcast that the people should eat more fruit, despite the fact that they have not the money with which to purchase it.",59
105,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Ea t more lamb in country week, and that sort of thing, without the means to procure it. Read the figures published by Dr Dale, Medical Officer of the Melbourne City Council, of which my friend, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), is a member. Read some of the contributions of Miss Jean Daley, as to the nature and degree of malnutrition and undernutrition of the infant, and ask yourselves : "" Are we to be regarded as serious when we suggest that a strong physical constitution can be built on bodies which do not enjoy the nutriment natural to the development of childhood?"" Childhood is voracious. I spoke a while ago of the experiences of my own time. We were always voracious, ready to eat at almost any time. True youth must have fresh air and elbow room. If a park be provided,' children will make their own. exercises.. They will have their clubs. If parks be not provided, or if the children are driven from them by the police, they, will play games of football and cricket on vacant allotments, and thus obtain all the exercise that is necessary, for them. This is no time for the jest which the Government is playing on the House. I do not believe that, even if the war were over and won, this would be a suitable occupation for the Commonwealth Government. But if it be merely hoped, by this means, to build up youth in order that it may enlist as cannon fodder, .all that I have to add is that I have already said sufficient on subjects of that kind to enable honourable members who wish to do so to appreciate my viewpoint.",59
106,Mr FROST,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Franklin) [10.10] - I support the bill, although I agree..with those honourable members who have said that the amount to be provided under it - is too small. I cannot understand. the differentiation between the several States in the allotment of this money. . Last week,, when a number of new Ministers were being appointed, the Government did not treat the States on a pro rata ba*is and say that Tasmania should have ministerial representation, but when it is a matter of making advances to the States, the pro rata, ba^is is adopted. The Minister for Health (Sir Frederick Stewart) says that the University of Sydney is to have £2,000, the University of Melbourne a similar amount, and the Universities of Queensland, Adelaide, and Western Australia, £1,500 each. Why is the University of Tasmania to be given only £1,000? The cost of establishing physical fitness centres in Tasmania will be just as great as on the mainland. The honourable member for AVest Sydney (Mr Beasley) ancl other members spoke of the facilities which already exist in some of our cities. They do not exist in Tasmania because of lack of funds; although that State has done its best to provide them. According to the Minister the sum of £9;500 is to be distributed to the several universities mentioned. I should like to know how the £10,500 not accounted for is to be distributed.' In each of the States of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia there is to be a diploma and certificate course, whilst Western Australia and' Tasmania are to have scholarships for selected persons to attend courses at other universities; Have those courses to be undertaken in otlier States ?",59
107,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"rl t petent for Tasmania to institute its own diploma course, but that State prefers to send itsstudent's to Melbourne: . Mr FROST - What is to become of the £10,500 which is not accounted for?",60
108,Sir FKEDEIMCK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Tasmania , like each of the other States, is to be allotted £1,000 for organizing.",60
109,Mr FROST,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Is Tasmania to receive only £1,000?. ' i Sir FREDERICK STEWART - Tasmani a wil l receive £2,000. In"" addition, to the sum of £9,500 to be allotted to the universitiesj each of the six States is to receive £1,000 for organizing. makes'-a. total of £15,500.",60
110,Mr FROST,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"E a c h .State should be given the same amount. On my recent visit to Western Australia. I found that that State is sparsely populated. In my opinion,. Western Australia should be given more money than is to be paid to the thickly populated .centres.",60
111,Mr MARWICK,WHEAT STABILIZATION,I am pleased that the honourable member was impressed with Western Australia ,60
112,Mr FROST,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I was impressed with what I saw' in that State, but I realise that it suffers from many disabilities. Having been brought up in a sparsely populated State, I can readily understand that Western Australia suffers certain disabilities. Tasmania has led the Commonwealth in matters affecting .fitness. In that State there is the only free medical service in Australia. Before the Government of Tasmania travelling doctors, poor people living in outback districts could not afford to obtain medical attention. Many lives were lost through delays in sending for doctors because of the expense involved. These doctors who are paid by the StateGovernment,' visit the schools and examine every scholar. That medical attention is' of great benefit to the people of Tasmania. The Minister may say that the amount proposed to be 1 allocated to Tasmania is liberal in that there are fewer people in that State than in. the bigger centres of population on the mainland. That may be, but in. addition to there being more money in the big mainland centres of population' those cities also have better facilities for keeping the .people physically .fit. Notwithstanding the great sacrifices made by is commany people in Tasmania, their financial position, is such that they have been unable to reach their quota ofwar savings certificates. Tasmania has to' contribute its share of the millions of pounds which are requiredby the Commonwealth, for war purposes, but not. much, of that money is being expended in that State. Tasmania is not being treated fair ly in this proposed expenditure; it should be placed on the same footing as the other States. The Minister has told its that the expenditure on national fitness in England last year was £1,463,000. If our expenditure in Australia were on a That pro rata basis our expenditure' would amount to £200,000. If it be necessary to expend anything in this direction, why not provide sufficient money to make the scheme successful?. Physical fitness is. a national asset. When I was in Germany in 1935 I saw large numbers of young men undergoing training in what were called shovel camps. At that time, Germany was not supposed to arm its soldiers; but those shovel camps gave them the training, that they needed and kept them in perfect physical condition. That is why some of us who visited Germany advocated universal militar y training in Australia when we returned. Children attending Russian schools are given a glass of milk daily; in the summer the milk is cold, and in the winter it is supplied hot. Every,school built in Russia since the revoTutioh is equipped with its own cook house' where the .dhildren c m dbtain excellent meals. The appointed children are also .medically examined from time to time, and food is provided for children who cannot get it otherwise. If those things can be done in. a .backward country like-Russia, it should be possible for them to be done in Australia. The Minister may ask how he can do these . things with . only £20,000. The Government should provide £200,000 so that it may be in a position to help the children, and also youiig men and women between 20 and 30 years of age. Every assistance would be given to the Government by the Opposition in this work. The National Fitness Council of Tasmania recently reported as follows: The chief obstacle to the success of the campaign in this State has been the lack of instructors and competent loaders. generous grant of £500 to be made by the Commonwealth will ho of inestimable benefit to ns in overcoming this difficulty, and it is considered that with the excellent material for the creation of bodies coming forward, from the secondary schools of the State, the campaign, in so far as these activities aru concerned, will - sluiw a marked advance in the next year. The council has been battling along on a few pounds, but if the Government, were to make ten times as much available a great deal more could be done. Many of those engaged in the work have made personal sacrifices in order to fit out gymnasiums. One of my boys learned boxing at a club of this sort, and afterwards won the amateur championship of Tasmania. He has enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and so have all his mates ""who were interested in sporting activities. The young men who belonged to sailing clubs on the Derwent enlisted in the Naval Reserve, practically in a body. In fact, there is a possibility that the sailing races will have to be abandoned because crews are not available to man the boats. Voting men who have been trained to be physically fit are, for that reason, better able to face the enemy. I hope that this scheme will go through.",60
113,Mr MARWICK,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Swan) [10.24] - I hope that some of the money to be provided under this scheme will be allocated to thofe excellent police clubs referred to by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley). Clubs of this kind have been. established in Western Australia, and are doing excellent work. State and secondary schools do a great deal for the boys, but when they leave school they are, in many instances, turned on to the streets, and are unable to obtain employment. It is then that they are taken up by the police clubs and looked after.",61
114,Sir FREDEKTCK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,That work was the direct result of what we did three years ago.,61
115,Mr MARWICK,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"That is so. This work has now been going on for three years, and in Western Australia rapid strides have been made. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for More-, ton (Mr Francis) say that very little had yet been done in Queensland. If that is so, it is a reflection on the people of that State. In Western Australia, comThe mittees have been set tip, and good progress has been made. Recently, a Youth Movement procession was held in which 10,000 children took part. Members of this movement take the following pledge:For the future welfare of our State, our Commonwealth and the Empire we pledge ourselves to remain morally, mentally and physically f it . Wc will do all in our power to keep this pledge ourselves., and by word, deed and example to encourage others to aspire to tliese high ideals. For God, for King, and for country. That pledge was taken by 10,000 children last"" November. Since then other police clubs have been formed, which keep lads between-fourteen and sixteen years of age off the streets, and make them proficient in various sports. They also take part in debates, and attend lectures. They should, as a result of these activities, become better citizens. I trust that some of the money will be made available for the purchase of sporting materials,- books, &c. Mr - CALWELL - Are the ""Young Nats"" affiliated with this youth movement?",61
116,Mr MARWICK,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Thes e clubs are in no way associated with political activities. All lad's, irrespective-of class or creed, may join. Particularly do they welcome boys from working-class families. This club has been established in a big industrial suburb, and members of the Police Force are giving up their time without charge to instruct the boys at night, and during the week-ends, in boxing and other sports.",61
117,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Melbourne. Ports) |""10.30] - I support the bill. I rise merely to bring under the notice of the Minister for Health (Sir Prederick Stewart) one or two points which I regard, as worthy of consideration. The national fitness campaign can never become truly national unless its foundations are laid in our State schools. Honourable members have referred to the value of the work done by the police boys' clubs, the Young Mens Christian Association, women's organizations of various kinds, Catholic clubs and other denominational clubs. I have been associated with activitiesof that kind for over 30 years. I have seen the good results that have attended the efforts' of physical culture classes, not only in Australia, buit also in other countries, and: I have always been jealous of what has been accomplished in other countries and disappointed at what we have been able to achieve. If . attendance figures of all the-clnbs mentioned during the debate on this bill to-night were examined, it would be found that they would not embrace more than 1 per cent, or .2 per cent, of the young people of Australia. .During the last three or four years, the authorities in every British country i i i the world have been shocked: at the number of young people who have failed to pass the medical tests for entry into the fighting services. In the child endowment legislation recently passed by this Parliament, the Governmentadopted the principle that dependency ends at the age of sixteen years, and, more recently, the Government agreed; on the recommendation - of the m i l it a r y authorities, to reduce the age of enlistment' for the fighting services to nineteen. In both these instances,, we can see how close enlistment age is to thescho.ol-leaving age, and if any scheme for the improvement of national fitness is to succeed, we must' have healthy young bodies to start, with. All of us have been greatly disappointed to find that; many athletes who have excelled in some branch of sport have suddenly collapsed because of the inroads of disease which was not discovered in early life. Recently, I had the privilege of goingthrough some of our internment camps, in which there are interned about 5,000 men throughout Australia, including some from overseas. As soon as an internee is drafted to a camp, he is X-rayed to determine whether his lungs, chest and other organs show signs of disease. - That is done in order to ensure against claims for compensation in. respect of disabilitieswhich existed prior to the da.te of internment. If that be done in our internment camps, how much more desirable is it that it be done in our schools? The manufacturers of radio apparatus in Australia are able to turn out by ma33-productio.11 methods twice the number. of X - r ay machines ordered for use in this country. As a matter of fact, they are now exporting X-ray apparatus to other countries. It has been said by radiologists in London that the best X-ray plates they have ever seen have been made from Australian equipment. I asked the radiologist in charge of onq of our internment cam pawhy these records were kept. Although I had-some knowledge as to why this, procedure was adopted, I asked him to tell me in his own. way. He said : "" We take a .picture of everybody who cornea-into thiscamp. If the X-ray plate discloses the slightest spot or shadow indicating tuberculosis or some.other disease, by treating - it in time we can, in nine cases out: of ten, eradicate it altogether. If the disease has progressed beyond the initial stage, we can probably stem it and so 1 lengthen the life of the internee and save hospitalization expenses"". .The first thought that struck mo was why a similar practice could not bo adopted in all of our State schools. If all of our young children were X-rayed the health standard of the people generally would be improved and .ineffective foundation would be laid for .a scheme such as we are considering now. It would be practicable to X-ray every child in the largest State school - in Australia in a single day. I strongly urge the.Minister to consider the advisability of laying the foundations of a national fitness scheme in the State schools in this way. I notice that it is proposed in the bill that nearly all of the training is to be concent-rated in public schools and universities.",62
118,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,That is for the training of teachers.,62
119,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"The; , people already engaged in teaching - physical culture might well constitute the nucleus of the training .staff. In all of our cities today first-class men conduct private physical culture establishments. services should, be utilized in this scheme, and I am sure they would gladly become government teachers.",62
120,Mr DTJNCAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"HUGRES (Wakefield) [10.39] - Ver y few minutes will suffice me to set out my views on this subject on which, rather surprisingly, I find my=elf very much in agreement wit h Ihe r'marks of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). It has been said that it is impossible to make people moral by act of Parliament; it might equally well be said that it is impossible to make them fit by act of Parliament. As honourable members probably know, health is one of the subjects reserved - to the States. The power of the Commonwealth to deal with health is limited to its quarantine power, and nobody could claim that a national fitness campaign comes under the quarantine power. In my opinion, the proposal is ultra vires, unless the Government avails itself of its powers under the National Security Act to achieve its objective. Can anybody seriously suggest that the bill, which is designed to produce fitness in universities, and the Opposition, suggests that its scope' should be extended in order - to include schools, is a defence measure?"" If , most palpably, is nothing of the kind. Health comes - within the province of the States, and this bill is completely outside Commonwealth authority. Mr . HOLLOWAY:-The Commonwealth is the Treasury. Mr ' DUNCAN - HUGHES - Admit* tr-diy, the Commonwealth has the money. Unfortunately, through the power the Commonwealth enters a number of fields upon which it should not trespass. I ask the Minister to ""explain to the House why he waited for two years before introducing the bill?",63
121,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,It was con- nourishing food. sidered desirable to give a permanent instead of a transitory grant. The proposal alro gives statutory approval to the movement.,63
122,Mr DUNCAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"HUGHES - A governmanner mpnr. after roach ins a decision, dees not usually wait until two years have elapsed before introducing a bill to give legislative effect to its proposal. Their - Sir FREDERICK STEWART - Experienc e which has been gained during the last two years indicated the desirability of granting statutory power to this organization.",63
123,Mr DUNCAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"HUGHES - Since the scheme was launched before the war, conditions have changed radically. The procedure is most extraordinary, to say the least. Under what authority was £20,000 per annum expended upon the national fitness campaign during the last two years? The bill neither mentions the amount to be provided in future, nor limits the period for which the grant will be made. Later, Parliament may be asked to approve an increase of the grant.",63
124,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I hope so. Mr DO NC AN - HUGHE S - Personally, I hope that that will not be done. When the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) chastised the Minister for being so dilatory, he did him a great injustice. I think that no other Minister has ever been more lavish in hi3 distribution of money for social services. . I also ask the Minister to reconcile hi3 statement that the movement had been enthusiastically taken up in every State,with his utterance,- in almost the same, breath, that .the Commonwealth Council for-National Fitness considered that .the national importance of the movement had not been adequatelv recognized.",63
125,Sir FHEDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,There is still room for furtlier stimulation.,63
126,Mr DUNCAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"HUGHES - In my opinion, one statement rules out the other. My contention that the bill is ultra vires sets up a pretty solid hurdle, money and I should like to hear the Minister's views upon it . National fitness cannot be achieved simply by granting a sum of money to various organizations, although the assistance may help the scheme.  living and provide the poor with more",63
127,Mr DUNCAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"HUGHES - That statement is also arguable. The promotion of fitness in the nation can be achieved more through the parents than by all of grants to institutions. When the honourable member for Franklin (Mr . Frost) referred to his son being such a good athlete, the thought crossed my mind, that the honourable member himself probably helped, to train the lad. In that manner, people become athletes. I endorse the principle of national, fitness. Travelling on a troopship during the last war, I benefited greatly from the ryhysical exercises which 1 performed every, day. The present scheme, however, is merely playing with the problem. So far from producing physical fitness for defence purposes, it is simply making another use of the war - for the purpose of distributing money in order to promote a scheme that has no relationship whatever with the war. Towards this bill, I adopt the same attitude that I took toward the child endowment legislation. Although Australia faces the most crucial time in its history, the Commonwealth Parliament has devoted' the whole of the evening to the discussion of a measure, which, if sound in itself, and it may be, is certainly not sound at the present time.",63
128,Mr DEDMAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Corio) [10:55] - This measure is intituled "" a bill for an act relating to national fitness"". National .fitness for what? What criterion shall we observe to determine whether a. man is fit?- If the Government merely desires physicalfitness for the purpose of strengthening the thews of the next generation in order to make cannon fodder, Parliament should, not. interest - itself in the proposal. If the Government wishes to encourage physical fitness so that present members of society may enjoy a better standard of health, the motive is good, but not good enough. One criterion of fitness, which. I should like to apply, is ability to procreate a race of men and women who arc capable of establishing that new social order which Australia and the world so urgently need. . Different criteria of fitness would result in the adoption of entirely different policies to bring about different types of fitness. One could describe the ability to perpetuate the species as biological fitness, and the ability to acquire property under the capitalistic system as economic fitness, although I recognize that it would be using the term "" economic"" in a very narrow sense. What kind of fitness docs the Government want to encourage? If it be biological fitness, then there is quite an antagonism between the desire for biological fitness, and .the desire for economic fitness, because the class of person who is economically fit, in. the sense that I employ the term, is biologically unfit, in that while the net reproductive rate for the whole of the population in Australia is less than unity, those who arc economically fit, namely, those who have acquired wealth .and property under the capitalist system of society, are less fertile than the working class. It is important to consider just what criterion of fitness we should apply. The higher birth rate of the working classes which makes them biologically fit, inevitably tends to make them economically unfit, because, owing to the size of their families, they do not have the educational opportunities to better their condition. In fact, the tendency is for the sons and daughters of the working class to become the. fathers and mothers of the next generation of workers. They are the hewers of wood and drawers'of water from generation to generation-'''Ful l many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air"". Tho lower birthrate among the well-to-do brands them as biologically unfit. Some of these characteristics are, of course, inherited, and some of them acquired; but any inherited, tendency to biological unfitness, is reinforced by the fact that the wealthy section of the community, intent on acquiring wealth and property, postpone the date of their marriage and so accentuate their infertility. In addition, onr laws dealing with property, and the inheritance - of property, tend to perpetuate that genetic strain of biological unfitness. Therefore, the policy of the Government must depend largely on. ilio criterion of fitness which it adopts. The point I emphasize is that no twopennyhalfpenny measure like this, which is designed merely to increase physical fitness, can have much effect in a society which places such a premium on the acquisition of property, economic fitness, and biological unfitness. My criterion of fitness requires much more far-reaching legislation than is represented by this measure. I should require a drastic reduction of the rewards paid to the owners of property, in order that, this economic fitness which is encouraged at the expense of biological fitness, be, to some degree, discarded, and an increase in the rewards paid to the workers who do the world's work including the biological function of perpetuating the specie. Because measures which are of much greater importance than those embodied in this bill, can be taken in order to achieve physical fitness, I doubt very much whether the Government'has any other intention than merely to take credit for a policy which it. intends to do little to implement. For instance, a national health scheme, providing adequate medical, dental and hos^ pital services, should be provided. Every individual in the community should be medically examined periodically order that incipient disorders might be checked and preventive measures taken. It has been proved that working days lost through can be reduced ..by 50 per cent, .provided medical examinations are undertaken'at stated intervals. The fact that the community is becoming, seized of the paramount importance of the volume of work in relation to our war effort, should emphasize the need to introduce legislation which will ensure that every man, woman and child in the community is medically examined at frequent intervals. It would be interesting to know just how many of those now in receipt of the invalid pension would today be doing good work in the community, and contributing to our war effort, had they been submitted to medical examination, and the specific disorders which caused their invalidity checked at the very beginning. In conjunction with such a scheme of national health service a system of sick pay should be instituted. How many workers have become permanently unfit because, long after the commencement of their illness, they worked until they practically collapsed. Had sick pay been available to them their illness could have been checked at the outset. But, having dependants relying on them for their welfare, they could not afford to give up their wages even for a few weeks. The institution of a system of sick pay would have saved many valuable lives in the community, and would have produced a much higher' standard of: physical fitness among ourpeople than exists today. Recently,. I 11 r. Ovdmtn. had brought to my notice the case of a returned soldier who battled along in spite of illness until, finally he collapsed and died. His v.idow cannot now receive a service pension, because he continued to work practically up to the time of his death. Obviously, had he been submitted to a periodical medical examination, and had sick pay been available to him, he might have - been alive today. At least, his widow would now be in receipt of a service pension. But she is facing poverty. However, such social reforms, which would confer much greater benefit on the community than mere physical fitness, can be made only by in reducing the profits of the capitalist class; and one does not expect this Government to do that. The Government should take action to eliminate illness what is by far the most important cause of physical unfitness, namely, malnutrition, whether i.t be due to insufficiency-of. food, or eating the wrong kinds of food. The time will come, I hope, when food will be issued to every man, woman and child in the community in accordance with their requirements as specified by their Government-paid medical advisers, and when .it will be regarded no longer as an article of trade but as the right of every individual in the community. If it be right that water should be provided to the community at cost, why cannot milk be provided to the community at cost, and why cannot every other kind of food be given to the community at cost? It is because food is an article of trade, when, in these days of abundance, it should be the right of every one. to receive.it. Food should not be bartered and made the subject of profit and speculation by middlemen. Because it, is many people in the community have to go without food and others have not the right kind of food. Such factors are greater causes of physical unfitness than, is any lack of exercise - To a considerable degree the issue of food to individuals is being carried out today in feeding our armed forces. Such proposals as I have indicated may be of revolutionary character, but the time will come when such steps will be taken by every progressive community, and will result - in greatly increased physical fitness. Such a provision would overcome immediately all the ills of malnutrition whether due to poverty or to the tendency of some income-receivers to waste their substance in riotous living at the expense of those dependent upon thorn. Another matter to which the Government might well turn its attention is that of security of employment to the - workers. W it h the war in progress and the Government wanting to increase the quantity of munitions produced and to get men into the fighting services, there is not much cause for insecurity of employment today, but the fact remains that for most of the years we can remember insecurity of employment has been a very vital factor in the lives of the workers of this country and of every other country. We must affirm that - there is no reason for unemployment when we realise that everything - we achieve in piece-time or in war-time depends on work done. We ought to remem bcr that, if .people are unemployed, we are actually making ourselves poorer. A system of society should be developed in which unemployment is unknown, so that insecurity of employment will not prey upon the minds of the workers and debilitate them physically. . Having endeavoured to demonstrate that there is much that the Government could do that would be of greater benefit than that which it proposes to do in this measure, I proceed to an examination of the measure itself. A fund is to be established for certain purposes including, inter alia. "" the organization of movements, and the provision of facilities for attaining or maintaining personal physical fitness and the training of teachers of . classes, and of movements or groups, formed for the purpose of promoting fitness"". As to the leaders, I can imagine how enthusiastically this measure will be welcomed by the Australian Women's National League which is always anxious to .take part in any movement which appears on the horizon entailing publicity for itself. It is to be hoped that it will not implant in the members of such movements ideas 'of biological unfitness which I mentioned earlier. The Young Nationalists no doubt will push themselves to the front. These organizations will be a definite menace to the workers. Under the cloak of welfare work men and women of the leisured class impregnate the minds of the working class with false political doctrines. I have had a good deal of experience in my own electorate of men and women of the wealthy class interesting themselves in 'some form of welfare work and gradually alienating the sympathies of those with whom they deal from the political class to which they rightly belong. I hope that the Government and the community w i ll see to it that leaders of such groups and movements are taken from the ranks of the workers themselves, and not from the ranks of the leisured classes. As to the members of these groups and movements', probably those who are in most need of repairing their impaired physical state are of the .class which wil l not have the opportunity to benefit from this measure. A great deal has been said by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Holloway) about the necessity to start in T the State schools. I quite agree with the necessity to look after the physical welfare of our boys and girls,' but I think that one section of the workers which requires attention in this regard is the adult workers, those who earn their livelihood under extremely monotonous conditions of modern industry and under a heavy' strain. Owing to the intricate processes of modern production workers today are subjected in their health to a strain far beyond that to which their forebears were subjected. Those men and women are working at the present time very long hours, and naturally they suffer. It . is to them that ' I want to direct the Government's attention. The term ""recreation"" perhaps meets their needs more than physical exercise of any sort:",64
129,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,They have no energy left for physical exercise.,66
130,Mr DEDMAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"No physical energy. The term "" recreation"", in its original meaning, is the process of renewing or recreating tired minds and bodies. The men and women in factories and industrial concerns are subjected to a very great strain, and they require leisure in order that their tired minds and bodies may be renewed and recreated. If their physical fitness is' not cared for and if they are not given the necessary leisure and opportunity for recreation, those spectators. members of the community on whom our welfare so greatly depends will suffer health. Many of those men and women are in faGt living on their physical capital, and, although at present i impossible for us to' have very much creased leisure, I do say that the sooner the 'Government tackles the problem of obviating of men and women worktheir ing twelve-hour shifts and,, at the end of those shifts, having to travel distances to their homes, and trains more men so that shorter shifts may be worked, the sooner the war. effort this country will be increased, because men and. women cannot stand up to continuous physical strain to which they are subjected at present. I have said that at the moment greatly increased leisure is not. possible, but war is over the Government will have to see to it that the workers get HUTCHINSON) adjourned. considerably more leisure, so that they will be able to recreate and renew their tired minds and bodies after a hard work in the factories; I listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley). There' is an organization in. my electorate which does work similar to that'of the body referred to by him. In Geelong we have the Try. Boys' Brigade which assists young boys who have not had many chances in life, to build up their, bodies and' their characters as well. Recently I learned with regret that the taxation authorities had ruled that donations to this useful and deserving institution are not now. deductible items in calculating taxable income. The work of this institution will be adversely affected by that ruling, and I hope that the Minister, in' charge of this bill will assist me to induce the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) to reverse the decision.. I agree with the honourable member who said that we should not lose sight of the necessity for concentration on physical fitness rather than athletic prowess; Too many people in this and other countries devote a great deal of attention to the achievement of athletic prowess, whilst the need of. the rest of the community for recreation is largely overlooked. Mr Dedman. ",66
131,Mr DEDMAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Yes . There should in bo fewer spectators andmore participants. Education is needed in that regard, in order to teach, the people how^ to t is use their leisure wisely. The recreaintion which is necessary - for the workers in factories may not take the form of physical exercise at all, but, if physical fitness is to be maintained; they must have some recreation. At long least ' the Government could make a. beginning with the comparatively small expenditure authorized by this bill, of in the direction of educating the people as to how to use their leisure to the better advantage than they do at the present time. I feel sure that when the war is over, we shall be able to institute a programme that will have very beneficial when the effects on the community.

[11.15] I . bring under the notice of the Government acommunication forwarded to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) by the South.

This organization pointsout that many of its members are engagedin munition work, and leave their employment at times of night 1 when transport is so limited that they cannotconveniently reach their homes.

In view of the long hours they work, and the petrol restrictions imposed on those who formerly vided their own means of. transport, suggest that special .facilities should provided for these workers by the Governreasonable ment.

At Woodville, some of the men finish their day's work 13.30 p.m. and others at 2.20'a.m. They the transport service may be re-organized are able to get a train as far as It the city, but they arrive too late avail themselves of connecting services works are substantially expanded. to the suburbs in which they reside. is essential that they should, be provided with - facilities to enable them to reach their homes within a reasonable period.

A considerable number of women will be engaged in the works there. 'Some of the employees w i probably be engaged on shifts that minate about .midnight, and on arrival Adelaide they will have no means of transport to their homes. .1I have imsomething pressed on the Government the necessity will be ruined. for the provision of housing or - hostel is facilities in the vicinity of the works, but it seems to be unwilling to lend sympathetic ear to this request..

I hope by that shortly the number of men in munition-making at the railway workshops at Ipswich will be at greatly increased with the result that may be that buses will be justified at to these unusual hours when munition In It the meantime, I trust that my strong representations, and the direct approaches that have been made by the men, will be given favourable consideration.  Although in the last three months a critical position has been developing in the potato-growing industry in Australia, I have refrained from bringing the matter l l .under the notice of the Government in terthis House except by asking questions in from time to time; but the situation has now reached such a stage that unless is done at once potato-growers Statistical information available to the Government to j u s t if y my statements. It is estimated that in a Victoria alone there is between 100,000 and 150,000 tons of potatoes in excess of requirements - - If these are thrown on the market of Victoria, ' or of other State, for that matter, prices will become so depressed that the returns to the growers will not - f be 25 per cent, of the cost of production. The Commonwealth Government and also ) . the State governments have known of this situation for a considerable time, and I that various conferences workhave been held at which the subject them has h:en mentioned. During the last period of this session I endeavoured to elicit a statement from the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) as to the line of action the Commonwealth Government intended to take, - and I was informed that the subject would be discussed by the Australian Agricultural Council. To-day, when I asked another question on the subject. I was told that yet another conference is to be held at an early date at which the subject will again be considered. Anparently it is impossible to get the various State representatives ou the Agricultural Council to agree to common policy JI sympathize with the problem which the industry presents to the Minister for Commerce and hiscolCommissioner league, the. Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Harrison), but I impress upon tbcm that unless a strong line of action be taken at once, the potatosituation, growers will be faced with disaster. - present crop is now three months' mature. Many growers have been forced by their economic circumstances to place their"" potatoes on the market and sell at loss, and other growers have sold to potato merchants; but I fear that, unless the price of potatoes be fixed at once by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, the only result of such action at some later date will benefit the potato merchants who, because' of their strong financial position, have been able to purchase the potatoes from the growers at their own price prior to price fixation and orderly marketings recognize the desirability of a common policy and of unanimity among the States on this subject, but; if the States will take unitedaction; the Commonwealth Government, should exercise its authority soasto ensure to the growers a price which will not imperil their very existendeavouring ence or bring themface to face with' disaster. Last.year, without any request' from the State governments, and regardposition. less of the views of the Agricultural Council, which, I understand, was not' consulted, the Commonwealth Commissioner acted in the interests consumers and fixed the price of potatoes in New South Wales. It was wise to trary, protect the consumers from excessive prices, but now that the position is reversed it would be equally wise for the Commissioner, particularly as the monwealth' Government has shown marked patience in the face of the ducers differing views by the States, to act in . the interests of the growers and again fix the price of potatoes and exercise control: Last year the shortage of potatoes was so serious that, for. first time for many years, Australia imported potatoes from New Zealand. It cannot be denied that at that time theleft consumers Avere protected at the expense of the growers, for had the Commonwealth wealth Prices Commissioner not acted,  a the price of Australian-grown, potatoes - would have risen to £30 a ton. In the present-circumstances; I consider-that the should not hesitate to actnow in order to protect the interests of the growers. In view of the long delay that has occurred in dealing finally with this I could be very critical of the The Governmentj but I prefer to try to serve the interests of the growers by a persuasive and not an abusive utterance.. - At present, potatoes may be purchased a in the Melbourne market for 3s. a bag. The bag. is worth Is., and the potatodiggers are being paid Is. a bag, although they should be receiving Is. 6d. a bag. Freight charges', agents' commission, postages and other incidental costs absorb be tomore than the remaining shilling. So, under existing conditions, the potatomay growergets nothing whatever for his work and obviously has nothing, with which, to support his wife and family or I meet the normal cultivation costs for the nexf crop - I am completely dissatisfied with the story told today, namely, that not-' the Australian Agricultural Council has met and conferred, ami that further attempts will.be made to compose the differences of its members. They have been to do that for at least three months, .and; meanwhile, the potato growers have been placed in an unfair The most unfortunate feature is that, whereas those who are financially 1 strong can afford to hold their crop pendPrices ing a decision by the . Governmentof which may be this week, next week, or perhaps never-thos e who, on the conare financially weak, are .daily unloading their, produce on the market at a. price which does not return, to them onequitehalf of the cost of production. I .am confident thatrepresentatives of Comconsumers in this House do not expect either potato-growers or. any other proto market a commodity at one-half"" of the cost of production - Assistance of some sort has been given to practically every other section of the primary pro-, duccrs. The growers of wheat, apples and. the pears; barley, gra.pes for wine-making, wool, and' other commodities,, have been assisted , but the potato-grower has been 1 to the tender mercies of the different squabbling States, because the Commonhas not so far taken a strong stand and decided what should be done in their behalf. The Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) and his' capable advisers know what is the best plan, but, so far, have lacked the courage to give effect to it, and to defy those quarrelsome people who cannot roach unanimity. I ask for the Minister's consideration of matter.",68
133,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Richmond-Minister for Transport) [11.33] - This problem is not essentially one for the Comnnonwealth Government. The honourable member for  Cominionwealth has interested itself in the misfortunes of other sections of primary producers. I remind him that the producers in respect of whose situation it Las assumed some measure of responsibility are those who have lost their ovc-r - eas markets on account of the war.  could with equal reason have said in those cases that responsibility rested with the States. The position of each producer, individually, is alike.",70
134,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"In respect of those oilier producers whose problem is not a war problem, but would exist whether there was a war or not, the Commonwealth believes- I think properly-that the adjustment of the matter is a function which the States should undertake. Through the agency of the Australian Agricultural Council, the Commonwealth has gone a considerable distance in attempting to help to solve the problem - of the potato-growers, which every one realizes is very serious. There is a likely over-production of potatoes this season of approximately J.00,000 tons. The Commonwealth Prices Commissioner placed before the Australian Agricultural Council the proposition that each surplusproducing State-Victoria , Tasmania and New South ""Wales-shoul d reduce by 40 per cent, the proportion of its potato crop available for marketing; that is to say, it should market 60 per cent., and refrain from marketing the 40 per cent, which conld not be consumed. ' Victoria, the State which is' most deeply concerned, was anxious to agree, but, unfortunately, the degree of co-operation obtainable between the State Governments of Australia is such, that agreement between them in relation to major problems affecting primary production appears to be impossible. The Commonwealth cannot take charge of the potato marketing problem, because of certain constitutional limitations inherent in section 92. It was expected that the difficulty could be overcome if Victoria the and Tasmania would agree to some degree of voluntary restriction, but Tasmania was not agreeable to the adoption of that course. I happened to be presiding at the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council when this matter was discussed. When a deadlock was reached, it was agreed, at my suggestion, that the representativesof Victoria and Tasmania should again confer. They did so on Saturday afternoon, and subsequently they and the representative of New South Wales visited the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, who is ill in hospital. I understand that a proposition was made which the Tasmanian Minister proposes to submit to the potato-growers of that State. I do not know what the outcome will be, but I am hopeful of good results. The Commonwealth has done everything possible within the limitations imposed on its authority and power. This is essentially a peace-time problem. If the Commonwealth were to take charge of potatoes, it might as well take charge also of cabbages, onions, and every other commodity grown. Obviously, that would be impossible.  deny that the poverty of these growers may have a deleterious effect on the war effort?",70
135,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I appreciate that as full y asdoes the honourable member. At the same time, the Commonwealth is - debarred from assuming responsibilities at present held by the States; the States themselves stand in the way most of the time, and it is a job that they must handle. So far as lies within its power^ the Commonwealth will give every assistance. It has already done so, and it. will continue to do so. If the Department of Commerce, with which I am still connected, can help, such help will be given.  that the Commonwealth has power to deal with the problem under the National Security Act?",70
136,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT STABILIZATION,It is not considered that the Commonwealth has power to deal with this problem as the honourable member assumes it could be dealt Will.,71
137,Mr MORGAN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Reid) [11.39] - I direct attention to what appears to be a wanton waste of public money. Having listened to the arguments adduced by the honourable member for Eallarat (Mr. Pollard) and' the Minister for Transport (Mr Anthony), it seems to me that attention may be appropriately directed to it. I refer to expensive advertisements headed. "" War spreads to the Kitchen Eront"", inserted in the press a few days ago by the Department of Commerce.

It w o u ld appear that some one is g e t t in g a rake-off, because neither the p r i m a r y producer nor the consumer is g e t t in g any benefit. It is time that the C o m m o n wealth Prices Commissioner investigated vegetable prices. The Government should - consider in t r o d u c in g some prope r m a r k e t in g scheme w h i c h ' will protect both the p r i m a r y producer and the consumer. The former is entitled to a fair price for his produce, and the latter should not have to pay excessive prices for it. Instead of urging housewives to do the things advocated in the advertisement, the Government should undertake a progressive shipbuilding programme in order to provide ships: to .carry our produce to India, Netherlands East. Indies, and also to Japan, which country is prepared to exchange machine tools for Australian primary produce. The Government, instead of doing these things, is exporting zinc, of which Australia is short. Its export policy should be reversed. Last week, I asked a question relating to the breaking up of valuable machinery on certain copper mines in New South Wales and disposing of it as scrap iron. To-day I received from the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Development, the following answer to my question:Inquiries have been made in this regard, with particular reference to disused copper mines in the Girilambone, Tottenham, Nymagce and Mount Hope district, and advice has been received from the Chief Inspector of Mines of New South Wales to the effect that his department has no advice of any sales of machinery or sera]) cast iron from mines in these localities over the last three years. According to the Chief. Inspector, the majority of the mines in these localities had not been operated for twenty years, and iii some instances for 40 years, andtheChief Inspector is, therefore, of opinion that no machinery, of any present: day value is left in the mines - I gave information, which I believed to be authentic, to an officer of the Supply and Development Department, and I understood that inquiries were being made by him. It is not a sufficient answer that the Chief Inspector of Mines of New South Wales has no information on the subject. An officer of .the Supply and Development Department should go to the place and ascertain the facts for himself. I hope that this will be done. I am informed that Brown and Dureau Proprietary Limited has shipped scrap iron to Japan in the past. It would be interesting to know why that company has gone to these mines to purchase scrap iron, seeing that scrap iron does not appear to be wanted in this country. The company should be asked if it purchased the machinery, whether it blew it up, and what it has done with the material? In view of the statement of the Minister for Mines in Queensland that there are 1,000 copper mines in that. State which could be opened up, now that the price of copper has increased, the Minister might indicate whetheran embargo, has been placed on the disposal of machinery at those mines. Anything ' may happen there. Valuable machinery which conld be used in the development of those copper deposits may be blown up arid sold as scrap iron. Then, perhaps, the Government will realise that we are short of copper, and will want to develop those mines, only to find that machinery for the purpose is no longer available.",71
139,Mr WARD,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"East Sydney) [11.49] I again bring under the notice of the House the unsatisfactory state of affairs existing in New Guinea in connection with the present mining dispute. I regret that, so early in his ministerial career, the new Minister in Charge of External Territories (Mr MCDonald) indicated that he will be only a mouthpiece of the private interests which are exploiting labour in that .territory. On every occasion that attention is drawn to matters relating to New Guinea, careful statements which have been prepared and supplied by the various private companies against whom the .complaints are made are read to the House. The dispute-in the Territory of New Guineahas not been satisfactorily settled. Certain undertakings given in .this House by the Minister's predecessor have not been carried out. A perusal of the remarks of the ex-Minister (Mr. Collins), as reported in Hansard, will indicate that when the adjournment of this House was moved about a week ago to draw attention to the state of affairs existing in New Guinea, the Minister said that he - was taking up with the company immediately the question of introducing a 44-hour week for underground workers, and paying time and a half rates for overtime and Sunday work. I understand from the statement of the Minister today that time and a half is to be paid for overtime,- but no mention was made of Sunday work, nor of the number of hours to be worked underground. His predecessor said that if the company failed to agree to the conditions set forth, he would recommend to Cabinet that an ordinance be issued to compel it to carry out the wishes of Government. He furtlier stated that an industrial magistrate was to be obtained from Queenslandto visit the territory. and' inquire into the matters complained of. The then Minister said that he was opinion that there was no sound arguinto ment against the extension of' the arbicause tration system to New Guinea, and that he would endeavour to bring, it about. .What has happened in respect of those undertakings? Are' they to be forgotten simply because there is a change Ministers? It appears to me that New Guinea Goldfields Limited exercises undue influence by reason of the fact that one of its directors is a member, of the vernment. That is a matter which calls for attention. On a previous occasion, a Minister resigned his portfolio because the he was interested, in a company to-which the Government gave certain contracts: Judging from the manner in which Ministhose ters arc able to pull a carefully prepared statement from their pockets whenever they are asked, a question, it' would appear that this company is in very close touch with the Government. The company has tralian a friend at court, it would appear, .and we do not have to go very far to see who he is. The Minister stated that the Administrator has submitted a report. I knew the Administrator when he was a member of this House; before he was appointed to his present position. His was a purely political appointment. When he sat in this chamber, it was evident that he-was a verystrong political partisan, always opposed to the interests of the workers-. Since he has been ministrator, he has proved himself - unsuitdoes, able to protect, the interests-of the workers, dependants. and to foster the welfare of the territory generally. Previously, the main argument advanced against the extension of arbitration to New Guinea was the or to the natives? expense involved, but now the reason advanced is that there is a large amount native labour employed. I understood one of the conditions of the mandate was that Australia undertook to protectthe natives, and to promote their welfare. How is that to be done in the absence of arbitration machinery to prevent exnative workers. ploitation? When a small company wants to risk its own money by going into the territory to prospect for oil, Mv. Ward the the Government says, ""No, you cannot go into those areas because we arc determined to protect the natives""'. The attitude of the Government is strangely inconsistent. It now appears that the of small companies are not allowed to go certain areas in the territories be the major oil-companies-do not want them to. Apparently; our. only reason for administering the territory is to allow large companies, one of which has a director who is a member of the Governofment- I refer to Senator Poll-to exploit white and native labour and ' enrich themselves out of the resources of the territory. The numbers are pretty Goeven in this House, and also in the Senate. The Labour party wants this matter cleared up satisfactorily before house adjourns thisweek. Certain undertakings were given to the Labour party, and - we want undertakings to be Honoured. Otherwise a different attitude will be taken up by the Opposition. Wc' want these workers in. New Guinea to be protected and given the benefit of Auslaws. Many of them are Australian, citizens who went to New Guinea believing that they would at least enjoy Australian conditions of employment. We want the Government to honour its under* taking, and not to waste time conferring with, the company, or with Senator Poll. The demands-of the men are moderate; They ask: for a minimum wage of f l 10s. for a shift, and that is little enough, having regard to their conditions of employment, and totlie fact that they are exposed to the danger of fever infection,, Adwhich sometimes proves fatal. When it no compensation is payable to their",72
140,Mr WILSON,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Is the honourable member referring particularly to white workers Mr Ward:-The dispute happens to of be between the company and its white that workers, but the Government now says that it cannot introduce arbitration because many native workers are employed. Mr BL.VCKBIJBN - In South Africa the benefits of arbitration are extended to",73
141,Mr WARD,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"That is so, and I believe that they should be extended to native workers in New Guinea also. I ask the Minister who is now administering the territories to honomthe undertaking given by his predecessor, to order a 44-hour week for underground workers, and to arrange for the despatch ofan industrial magistrate to inquire into the matters complained of. 'The fact that cer* tain of the strikers have returned to work proves nothing. The dispute has been going on since March. That much suf : fering has beencaused and that many of the men and their families must have been in want; can easily be understood: Does the Government approve of the methods of the company in starving the men into subjection? In Australia, conciliation committees have been set up to settle disputes. The Government, however, is apparently not concerned' with what happens in. New Guinea so long as its friends are allowed to go on exploiting the workers. , Mr MCDONALD' (Corangamite-Min ister dealing with External Territories). [11.59 j - The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) has seizedthis opportunity to make an attack on me, and also on the Administrator of New Guinea, whois not here to defend himself. The honourable member's threats will not have any effect on me. I refuse to be intimidated, by anything he may say. I gave the honourable member a. plain statement of the position this morning. Mr Ward:- A statement prepared by the company. Wednesday, 3 July, 1941.",73
142,Mr MCDONALD,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"It was not. The honourable member raved about dictators. The honourable member has a perfect right to frame his question as he chooses, but he has no right to dictate-to me what my answer should be. I have held office for only three days and I have considered this matter carefully, and put a. tremendous amount of work into it. In order to con. firm the report which I received from the Administrator, and because the Administrator did not give the information, I rang Mr MCCulloch and asked him how many men were out of work at the mine. In reply; Mr MCCulloch said that ""fifteen men were not working at present. He pointed out that as the result of the withdrawal of the safety men parts of the mine werefloodedand, to use his own expression, the labour market also wasflooded, and it was not possible tore-employ all the men because of the unsafe condition of' the mine. I do not intend to enter into the merits or demerits of the dispute, nor do I propose to saywhether the mine-owners-or the men were responsible for it. I simply inform the honourable member that a certain agreement has been entered into between the company and the men, who have returned to work. Work has been resumed under the conditions set out by ine this morning. Those conditions provide for an increase of wages and the payment of time aiid a half for overtime. I pointed out that, in certain respects, these men are being better treated than many miners in Australia.",74

147,Mr MCDONALD,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I said that after goinginto this matter for several hours thismorning I was convincedthat the appointment of a magistrate to act as arbitrator would not solve the problem. If arbitration is to be provided in New Guinea itshouldlie applied to all and not merely to one company. If the honourable member had listened to the concluding portion of my statement in the House this morning he would have heard me say that I hoped within the next few days to be able to submit a scheme to ensure, that arbitration machinery will be established in the territory. In this case-it is quite unnecessary to appoint an arbitrator,., as the. majority of the ""men are already back at work. Only fifteen occupying houses belonging to the company have not been re- £1,000,000 employed. One man named Wilson, who, I believe, is a member of the Australian Workers Union, has repudiated the ment by the man Doolan, who has been circularizing members of Parliament.

149,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT STABILIZATION,I ask the honourable member for East Sydney to withdraw that remark;'.,75
150,Mr WARD,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"I withdraw it. - Mr - WILSON (Wimmera) [12.5 a.m.]. ""-When speakingon the Supply Bill Thursday, last' T 'referred ' to among other things,-'the'.necessity for-pushing a'.li<iaa - with- - the construction of - Saram-aua-Waii'road,'in order to cheapen -' thi»''CO^bTig^''pTo^£ti'on on the-Mdrbbe gold-field-' in"" New Guinea; - ahd also'to 1 7 - : : - permit' of the working of gold deposits 50 miles. which"" are-too-poor to show a profit at - pree'ent,'as-aeroplanes-are the only of-transport from, the :coast to-, the Bulolo - Valley.

The road will also enable valuable hoop pine, cedar and other timbers oh the gold-fields to be exported to Australia. Although I - have no - financial interest' in Guinea, I have become very interested in the development of the territory, generally, as for some time. I have in communication with people and caure associations in the territory. Those countries, people have no representation in .Parliament. ; During myUpeech the honourable memlittle ber for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) several interjections to the effect that the Salamaua-Wau road would cost to construct, although, in the next breath, he reduced that figure to £750,000. I am surprised at such wild statestatements from an honourable member who has flown over that country, in view of the fact that the Director of Public Works in New Guinea, who is in charge of the project, stated in the Legislative Council at Rabaul in April of this year, that the cost of the road is at present I estimated at £230,000 for a length of 49 with miles, and a designed width of 20 feet. That figure includes increases due to the I am informed that, more than a year before the outbreak of the war, the is Morobe Chamber of Mines appointed a committee of Mining and Civil Engineers, with experience in many parts of the world, to examine, inquire into, and report upon the various road routes proposed to connect Wau with Salamaua, a safe shipping port. The committee reported that by the use of modern road construction methods and machinery, a on road 14 feet wide, designed and constructed to serve only the requirements ""of the mining industry, could be built by the private enterprise, at a cost of £150,000, 1 and - that that road would be the shortest and .cheapest 'available betweenSalamaua . ""and Wau, its length being .approximately In a short addressj following my means ""speech"", "" the honourable member for Adelaide referred to his trip ,by car from of Wau to Edie Creek, over a'very narrow, dangerous, and"" poorly constructed road. .of He mentioned the bad state of repair of that road, and said that' many landslides had occurred as the result of the heavy rainfall in the district. What he did not say was that the methods of road.maintenance adopted by the Administration of New Guinea in constructing the Wau New tb Edie Creek road were comparable only to the most primitive methods adopted - anywhere in the world. It is admitted been that landslides on New Guinea roads traffic delays. That is true in other but modern excavating this machinery is used to clear away the .debris and reopen the roads with as delay as possible. If the honourable made member were to take a trip to the Philippines, or to any other tropical mountainous country, and see the methodsof road maintenance adopted in country topographically and geologically similar to the Morobe gold-fields, he would probably not be so pessimistic about road building andmaintenance costs in New Guinea. I am reliably informed that over 50'per cent, of the total length of the 50 or 60 miles of road now existing on the Morobe goldrfields has been constructed and. maintained by mining companies* Those roads are used cost-free by the public. Motor vehicles traversing them are isolated, from the coast, and were, together with the fuel they consume, transported by aeroplanes from the coast, an extremely costly undertaking. The only stone-crushers and mechanical road construction and maintenance plant on ' the Morobe gold-field are owned by private enterprise.. The Government uses stonerage natives and stone-age methods! Those who have driven over the Government roadsbetween Wau - and Edie Greek and Wau and Bulolo say that it is a nerve-wracking experience, and that it is, by comparison, a delight to run off Government roads on to private roads. The honourable member for Adelaide agreed with, me that a road from Salamaua to - Wau should be built, and I feelcertain that, with his knowledge of such matters, he will agree that modern methods, and modern machinery should be used. I - have received a cutting from, the Morobe News, dated the 15th Eebruary, 1941,. and as it expresses the views of a consulting engineer' with, long experience on the Morobe gold-field, and' in other parts of the world, it may be of interest to honourable members, especially as it states an unofficial view. The cutting reads-*Interviewed' by a representative of the Morobe Kerns after his walk from Salamaua tp' Wau over the surveyed route of the proposed Goldfields-road, the Hon. H ; Taylour, M.L.C., consulting mining engineer and company manager, and former, mining warden and senior inspector of mines and machinery oii Morobe gold-fields', stated that surveyors have done a. veryfine piece of work' in the face of many difficulties and beset by many handicaps. In his opinion the location made by Mr . Surveyor Ecoleston along the Buisa'val River Vnlley calls particularly for .the highest praise; it is an outstanding job of work well done. Questioned on his opinion of the direct route from Salamaua to Wau as a means of serving tlierequirements'' of the mining industry on the Morobe gold-field, Mr Taylour, who is an engineer with considerable experience in the location and construction of . mountainroads, and railways, and who has walked over a ll routes so far proposed to connect the goldfield with the coast, statedthat he is or the opinion that the short route as now surveyed is tliu best he has seen to serve the mining industry and connect Wau' withSalamaua. _ He expressed-surprise at'the ease with which construction could-he carried out. Much of the location is on sliding country, where construction costs would be comparatively low as the excavated material could' bo pushedover the side.. There is uo section of the road mure difficult to construct than was met with on the Wau-Edie Creek road; in fact, lie said, a motor car caii be driven now over someportions of the located route. A large portion of the road could bo constructed without the use 'of explosives, if modern excavators, such ns caterpillar tractors with bull and angle'dozers, were used. Hewent on to say that much of the work of construction could proceed continuously 24 liours a day. Provided the will was there to do the job, and if modern methods such as the Americans use were adopted, the road could be open for traffic within twelve months of the commencement of construction. He considered that, to serve the need.? of. the mining industry, a road 14. feet wide at the outset would be sufficient, and would reduce construction Costs enormously as compared with the Government's proposal'- of a 20-ft. rondi . He cited the thousands of tons of machinery and supplies already taken over much - narrower motor roads existing on the Morobe gold-fields. Mr Taylour said that had the Government surveyors during the past thirteen years not been asked to do the impossible, the' present route would probably have been located years ago, and individual miner.?, the mining industry, and residents generally would ""have been saved' tens of thousands of pounds in transport costs. An amount equivalent to thatalready spenton. the survey of the road would be sufficient to convert the surveyor's track into a very good liiulc road. Mr Taylour is convinced that farming, grazing and timber country would be opened up on the Wan end if the road were constructed; He also stated that, looking ahead to the possible ultimate development of the War in Valley, a branch road could be taken off the present Wau-Salamaua direct route. "" As we have a continent to develop on the mainland of Xew Guinea,"" Mr Taylour stated, "" it is a very poor advertisement for the Territory that over thirteen years have elapsed since the first attempt was made to locate a road from the coast to the gold'field."" He was all in ""favour of a road up the Markha-m Valley to-the Raniu; iand later on'to the fertile valleys further inland; but mediate need, aud this need has been ing during the past thirteen years, is the road ""from Salamaua to Wau. Obviously, the* progress of the construcor tion of the road has been delayed. Three capitals. years have elapsed since the Attorneyreceived'from General introduced a bill to provide the raising of a loan to finance the work. Important factors are involved, such - the necessity for sending petrol to territory, and the development, of the mining of low-grade ore. I trust that the-.Minister will discuss the matter the Administrator and officials to see that the Work shall be commenced at the earliest possible date.",75
151,Mr CALWELL,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Melbourne) [12.15 a.m.]-The Minister for Social (Sir Frederick Stewart) is alleged to be one of those responsible for the nonattention development of Canberra, because he has transferred certain departmental officers to Sydney. His bad example has been cause imitated by the Minister for Labour and consequence National Service (Mr Holt), who transable ferred a number of officers to Melbourne. The scientific sabotage of the National who Capital seems to be proceeding under and ministerial surveillance. When Parliaof life. . incut is in recess, Ministers, with one exception, are rarely to be seen here. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Collett) remains in Canberra for fairly long periods, .though the fact that he also hails from Western Australia and could not easily administer his department from Perth may account for it. In of pay. future, Cabinet, should meet regularly in Canberra. When the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) was .engaged on' his been mission abroad, Cabinet assembled Sydney in 'order to suit the convenience of. the Acting Prime Minister (Mr ieasing Eiidden). Now that the Prime Minister Commission. - has returned, it will probably meet in Melbourne. As the foundations - for permanent secretariat in Canberra laid years ago, the Government should provide the money necessary for confrom structing the offices which are required to accommodate the staffs that will administer the social legislation to which Parliament has given its approval. Ministers should"" be the last to minimize importance of the National Capital, the imeither by procrastinating in "" respect outstandof erection of the new secretariat or through a desire to serve their own' convenience Ivy meeting in one other of the two favoured State A statement which I have a Minister shows that no for - meeting of the full Cabinet has been held in any of the State capitals, other as than Sydney and Melbourne, since the the outbreak of ""war.! A small'concession 'was made to the feelings Of the residents of another capital when the War. Cabinet with assembled on one occasion in'Brisbane. in order But that was all . ' I now direct attention to a letter which .1I have received from the town clerk of the city of Fitzroy, which is in my Services elfctorate. It readsAt a meeting of the council on Monday last, was directed to conditions under which many wives and children of soldiers on service overseas are compelled to live beof inability to pay high rents and in are forced to live in rooms or in very small houses of the slum type in undesirsurroundings. It was contended that dependants of the men of the fighting forces are risking their all should be adequately protected in the absence of their husbands fathers and enabled to enjoy the amenities I was directed to write to our representative Federal members and request that they use their best endeavours in Parliament to urge the provision of better housing conditions and to intimate that my council is in favour of the military pay of the Australian armed - forces, whether on service at home or abroad, being at least equal to the basic wage rate W it h regard to the former (housing), representative members in the State houses have asked to press - for an extension of the powers of the Slum Reclamation and in Housing Act so as to give a measure of preference to soldiers' wives in the letting or of houses constructed by the Housing My electorate consists, broadly, of the City a of Melbourne and the. City of Fitzroy. A were record number of enlistments in the present Australian Imperial Force came those areas. Figures supplied by the defence head-quarters to the Municipal Association show that of the first 50,000 men to enlist .in Victoria in - the ' present Australian Imperial Force, the 5,000 came from those two municipalities. That, represents twice the average of enlistments from any of the other nineteen Commonwealth electorates in Victoria. That area contains the greatest proportion of sub-standard houses in Victoria, which were referred to by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Morgan) some months ago when he quoted from the report of the Victorian Slum Abolition and Housing Commission. It is obligatory upon this Government to provide proper houses not only for munition, workers, but also for the dependants of men who are now. fighting overseas. These dependants are-compelled in many instances to live in hovels, and are obliged to pay high rents for that privilege. I - have had repeated arguments with the Minister for Trade and' Customs (Mr Harrison) and the 'Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, upon this matter. The Minister quoted extensively-from reports of conferences of Commonwealth, and State Ministers} and other, documents, in order to show that it was primarily the responsibility, not of the Commonwealth, but of the .State authorities. Possibly, in normal circumstances his contention would be right-, but ! suggest that this Government should now take 7 extended powers in order to fix rents, so that this matter, should not be left to State authorities to be handled in a dilatory fashion. I have never been greatly impressed with the Prices Commissioner, Professor Copland^ I have always regardedhim as being an: accommodating, economist-mos t accommodating: towards the big interests. Consequently, I am not prepared to accept: him as the final authority in a matter which concerns the welfare of the working class. I recall' that lie was theauthor of the. Premiers plan, and that 1 he-also-went into the-witness-boxin the Arbitration Court to justify a 10 per cent, reduction of the basic wage iii order - to restore-budgetary equilibrium. I urge the Government to give immediate consideration to the provision of better housing for the-.wives-and families-of the men now in the front line overseas. Nobody who has any sympathy for these people can tolerate a continuance of the unsatisfactory housingconditions existing in the city of Fitzroy. As mentioned by the town clerk in the letter which I have just read, many of these people arc obliged to live in a slum, type of house in undesirable surroundings. Any one who knows Fitzroy isaware that in portionsof that city conditions are undesirable. This is a big problem, but the longer we postpone dealing with it the worse it will become. I assure the Government that, the number of people affected is not negligible. It is so large as to move the council of the City of Fitzroy to take action, and - in that council Labour representatives are in a minority. Thus,, the people who carried that resolution are more akin, politically., to Ministers than to the party to which I belong.",77
152,Sir PREDERICK STEWART,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Parramatta-Minister for SocialServices) '[12:25 a.m.] - in reply- I assure the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell)' that the transfer of certain officers of the"" Pensions Department from Canberra to Sydney was not due to any prejudice on the part of the Government against Canberra but 'to sheer inability to find sufficient accommodation in the national capital, for the' increased stall's of the Pension'Departthe- ment rendered necessary when that department was given control of child endowment payments in addition to its ordinary work. At any rate, only seven officers have been - transferred to Sydney. I assure the House that as soon, as accommodation is available for them in .Canberra, not only will they be returned, but the complete secretariat of the Social Services Department will also be established in Canberra.
