2,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembledThe Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows: 1. Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year. 2. Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source. 3. The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the schedule fee. 4. The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are. discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, - uch as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases. 5. The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance. 6. Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available. We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered. by Mr Adams (from 352 citizens), Mr Anderson (from 132 citizens), Mr Beale (from 44 citizens), Mr Bradford (from 144 citizens), Mr Robert Brown (from 117 citizens), Mr Campbell (from 63 citizens), Mr Carlton (from 44 citizens), Mr Charles (from 44 citizens), Mr Chynoweth (from 391 citizens), Mr Cleary (from 230 citizens), Ms Crawford (fr-m 290 citizens), Ms Deahm (from 1,262 citizens), Mrs Easson (from 286 citizens), Mr Elliott (from 22 citizens), Ms Fatin (from 376 citizens), Mr Ferguson (from 624 citizens), Mr Filing (from 69 citizens), Mr Tim Fischer (from 336 citizens), Mr Fitzgibbon (from 154 citizens), Mr Forrest (from 390 citizens), Mr Gorman (from 166 citizens), Mr Halverson (from 132 citizens), Mr Haviland (from 66 citizens), Mr Hawker (from 318 citizens), Mr Hicks (from 46 citizens), Mr Holding (from 401 citizens), Mr Hollis (from 1,115 citizens), Mr Jenkins (from 632 citizens), Mr Barry Jones (from 705 citizens), Dr Kemp (from 285 citizens), Mr Langmore (from 88 citizens), Mr Lavarch (from 105 citizens), Mr Lindsay (from 67 citizens), Mr Lloyd (from 211 citizens), Mr Mack (from 694 citizens), Mr MACKellar (from 319 citizens), Mr MCLachlan (from 190 citizens), Ms Moylan (from 10 citizens), Mr O'Connor (from 518 citizens), Mr O'Keefe (from 641 citizens),     Mr Reid (from 110 citizens), Mr Reith (from 44 citizens), Mr Sawford (from 671 citizens), Mr Les Scott (from 341 citizens), Mr Sharp (from 44 citizens), Mr Simmons (from 403 citizens), Mr Slipper (from 128 citizens), Mr Somlyay (from 268 citizens), Mrs Sullivan (from 263 citizens), Mr Taylor (from 150 citizens), Mr Truss (from 173 citizens), Mr Wakelin (from 769 citizens), Mr Walker (from 220 citizens) and Mr Williams (from 117 citizens).

To the Honourable the Speaker,and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the Housethat with more than ten per cent of Australians unable to obtain useful, paid employment, the concepts of the level playing field and zero tariffs are rejected because they produce substantial losses and provide no benefits, despite wordy defence of them by economic rationalists. Your petitioners therefore urge the House to act tp ensure that Australia:maintains processing industries based on our well-established rural industries; retains protective tariffs while any other nation with which we trade uses such. or similar measures to provide for its own protection; prevents imports into Australia of goods or services subsidised, dumped or supported by any non-tariff measures; restores profitability for Australia's fanns and factories; and provides valuable developmental employment opportunities for all Australians needing them, particularly our youth. by Mr Bruce Scott (from 21 citizens).

Kingsford Smith Airport: Charges To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of rural New South Wales draws to the attention of the House the contents of the draft Prices Surveillance Authority report into the' Federal Airport Corporation's pricing of aeronautical and non-aeronautical activities. The draft report recommends changes to Tariffs landing and departure charges, in both peak and shoulder periods at Kingsford Smith Airport, which would have a significant effect on the payments required by regional airline aircraft. This would penalise all rural communities currently serviced by regional airlines whilst those who would benefit would be the overseas and interstate travellers. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House ensure that the Prices Surveillance Authority review its findings in relation to price charging at Kingsford-Smith Airport, and that a fair and just system be introduced to allow residents of rural New South Wales to enjoy the same facilities and opportunities to travel to Sydney by air as interstate and overseas travellers. by Mr Sinclair (from 124 citizens).

3,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled Clearer Commonwealth law: report of the inquiry into legislative drafting by the Commonwealth, together with minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",19
4,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to be able to speak today on the tabling of Clearer Commonwealth law, the report of the committee's inquiry into legislative drafting by the Commonwealth. The report is the result of an inquiry which has taken a little over a year to complete. The early, evidence gathering stages of the inquiry took place between July and December 1992 when the committee was chaired by the present Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). The work of the former committee has been of great assistance in preparing this report. I particularly thank the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), also a former member of the committee. In no small measure it was their interest and commitment which guided the early stages of the inquiry. The committee's inquiry arose from two points. The first related to concerns that many of the Commonwealth's laws are unnecessarily complex and that because of this complexity they are difficult to understand and costly to use. The second related to perceptions that there are ways not presently pursued to the full of drafting legislation in a more simple but no less precise manner. On the first point, we have concluded that many of our laws are indeed complex and difficult to understand. On the second point, we have concluded that there are ways of making our laws easier to understand and use. We believe it is vitally important that the government, in partnership with the parliament, take every step possible to improve the quality of our laws. It is simply unacceptable. that ordinary citizens find it near impossible to understand the obligations imposed, or the entitlements conferred, by legislation. If we as a community insist that ignorance of the law is no excuse, then we must produce laws that ordinary people are capable of understanding and acting upon. To do otherwise is to fail in an important social duty. The former Victorian Law Reform Commission estimated that the current confusing and complex state of our law is costing the community in excess of $100 million each year in administration and compliance costs. If the law were simplified and expressed more clearly, much of this cost could be avoided. Having said this, the committee acknowledges that there have been some dramatic Improvements in the quality of Commonwealth legislation in recent times. Both the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of Legislative Drafting have developed plain English styles of drafting which pay close attention to the language used in legislation and the way legislative schemes are structured. Commonwealth drafters have also developed some innovative aids to understanding, such as readers' guides,flow charts, rate calculators and examples in legislation. The drafters are to be commended for their efforts. Nevertheless, more can be done to make legislation easier to understand and use. The committee believes that improvements can be made at each stage of the legislative process. Improvements can be made in the way legislation is prepared, in the way parliament considers legislation and in the way legislation is published. The committee's report contains 46 recommendations aimed at making these improvements. In the time .J have available this morning I want to mention just a few of our recommendations-firstly, those in relation to parliament's role in considering legislation. The Senate's recent decision to impose a deadline of 1 October for the introduction of bills into the House has focused considerable public· attention on the role of parliament in scrutinising legislation. While it is quite inappropriate for one chamber to dictate the activities of the another, as the Senate is seeking to do, I do agree· with the sentiment that much can, and should, be done to improve the quality and effectiveness of parliamentary scrutiny of legislation. It seems to me that increasing the number of sitting days and requiring that legislation be introduced earlier are two obvious ways of allowing more time for the scrutiny of legislation. The first of the committee's specific proposals on this point is that every six months the government should prepare and publish an indicative calendar of activities for the parliament. The calc:mdar could indicate a proposed legislative timetable and allow set times for the consideration of particular bills. This would encourage more efficient use to be made of the time available for legislative scrutiny. The second proposal is that a minimum of 10 sitting days be required between the introduction and second reading of a bill. This would make more time available for the scmtiny of legislation than is usually available. Thirdly, more effective use should be made of parliamentary committees, particularly committees of the House, in the scm tiny of legislation and legislative proposals. If reforms such as these were made, more time would be available to scmtinise legislation and there would be no need for the Senate's 1 October deadline. The committee also considered the question of who should draft legislation. It was put to us that Commonwealth legislative drafting would be more effective if the government monopoly on drafting were broken and drafting work were contracted out to private lawyers. The committee disagreed with this proposition. The main reasons we disagreed were that conflicts of interest could arise if drafting work were contracted out; that. it would be difficult to control the quality of legislation drafted outside the government; and, finally, that on current costs it would be more than twice as expensive to have laws drafted by private lawyers. The cheapest of the consultants used by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel costs the equivalent of $345,000 per year, yet the annual cost of employing a top ranking Senior Executive Service drafter is $138,000. One of the innovations we propose is that legislation be tested before it comes into effect. This proposal arises from the proposition that the only way to know whether a piece of legislation is communicating its message effectively is to test it. In the committee's view, the most reliable way to test the readability of legislation is to ask a sample of people whether they can understand it-a comprehension test, if you like. Testing legislation offers the potential of considerable benefits. It will help ensure that legislation as clear as possible and it will help identify effective drafting techniques. The committee believes that the implementation of a testing program should be given high priority. The most significant stylistic change proposed in evidence to the committee was the suggestion that Commonwealth legislation be drafted in general principles. Advocates of general principles drafting say that law drafted in this style tends to be shorter, simpler, clearer and more intelligible. Those who oppose general principles drafting say that it would create uncertainty unless people resorted to the courts for interpretation, and that it would transfer power from the elected legislature to the unelected executive and judiciary. The committee believes that these concerns can be overstated, and that in many instances there are significant advantages to be gained from using a general principles style of drafting. Such a style would mean the law could be expressed far more briefly and that it would be far <easier for readers to understand and use. Of course, general principles drafting is not appropriate to all circumstances, and we acknowledge that black-letter law should be used where it is necessary or desirable to spell out detailed mles of law; but we do strongly urge the government to be more free in its use of general principles drafting. Although new Commonwealth legislation has become much easier to understand in recent years, many current laws predate the development of the Commonwealth's plain English style. A special effort will be needed to update existing legislation. In the committee's view, the' most effective way of improving the quality of existing legislation is to institute a systematic program of rewriting legislation. We recommend that the government should commit the resources necessary to rewrite legislation which is heavily used or affects many people and which is difficult to use. On these criteria, I believe that the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Corporations Law should be among the first rewritten. A rewriting program of this magnitude will require a major commitment of time and is resources from the government-it has been estimated that to rewrite the Income Tax Act alone could take 10 years-but the task is not impossible. Rewriting old legislation can be done successfully. The government need look no further than the Social Security Act, the sales tax laws and the Austudy regulations for examples of old law that has been successfully rewritten. Clearly the implementation of our recommendations will require more resources to be allocated to the drafting agencies. However, the committee is convinced that the potential benefits to the community of making clearer legislation far outweigh the costs of the additional resources needed to implement the recommendations. As I mentioned earlier, the social and economic costs· of not improving the quality of our laws are enormous. What is more, the costs will continue to escalate the longer the problem is ignored. I urge the government to focus its attention on the important task of making our laws easier to understand and use. I believe the adoption of our recommendations will go a long way towards producing clearer Commonwealth law. Finally, I acknowledge the work of the committee secretariat: the committee secretary, Grant Harrison; the research officer, Stephen Mattingley; and the administrative officers, Tracy Ambrose and Louise Carney. All made significant contributions to the inquiry and the report, and on behalf of the committee I thank them. On a personal note, I regard it as an honour and a privilege to have been elected chair of this committee. The experience and expertise of current members of the committee are exceptional and make it without peer in the current parliament. I thank members of the committee on both sides of the House for their contribution and I look forward to working with them in the future.",19
5,Mr WILLIAMS,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the tabling of the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I support the call by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), that the government should focus attention upon the report. Let me say at once, however, that I was not a member of the committee when most of the work resulting in the production of the report was done or when the report was drafted. In fact, although I was a committee member when the report was settled, I was not personally involved in the settlement. On that basis, I am free to say, as I do, that many of the recommendations I agree with but some I do not. Notwithstanding that, the report should be welcomed as a significant contribution to the study and the potential improvement of the legislative process. It is highly appropriate in my view that the committee should have acknowledged that clearer legislation does not start and end with the drafting process; it is not just the final bill which creates the problems identified by the committee. I mention that the committee's work did not involve examination of the constitutional role of parliament, but that subject has recently been studied by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation, and a report on constitutional issues regarding the role of parliament has just been finalised by that body. It may carry more weight if my comments were to come not from a perspective of a relatively new member of this House but from the perspective of one who has been closely involved for many years, in different capacities, with the making of laws,both Commonwealth and state. The perception I have had for many years is that the best way to have more comprehensible law is to have less of it. There is in my view an inadequate appreciation by both parliamentarians and the Public Service of the impact that new legislation has-in new legislation I include amending legislation-on those involved in the field of activity affected by the legislation. If a problem is perceived, from a Canberra point of view the easiest way of dealing with it may be to legislate. That really should be seen as the last resort and not the first resort. The impact of legislation can be seen by just focusing for a moment on one area identified by the chairman, corporations law, to see what has happened in that field. During the 1930s my father was undertaking a correspondence course to become an accountant and one of the subjects he studied was company law. He told me that in order to study for that examination he set about, and largely succeeded in, learning the then Western Australian companies act by heart. The prospect of doing that today is just inconceivable. When I went into legal practice, first as an articled clerk during the mid-1960s, the senior partner, who was then a very senior practitioner in Perth, complained to me about the impact that the introduction of the new uniform Companies Act had on his ability to practise in that field. He had spent most of his then 35 years in practice working with the 1943 Companies Act, which is the equivalent of the 1936 act in most other states. I did not fully comprehend the point he was making, but I did comprehend it in the early 1980s when the national companies legislation was introduced and the legislation I had spent most of my legal career with was eliminated and replaced by the companies code. Ten years later, the then Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), introduced another form of companies law, the Corporations Law. This is a veritable doorstop and has required the jettisoning by people such as the counterparts of the former senior partner of my firm and me of the knowledge we had acquired over many years. It needs to be pointed out that difficult pieces of legislation that intrude on ordinary activity are only worked out by the community over an extended period. The companies code was barely touched by the courts before it was replaced by the Corporations Law. Even in a field as important as the responsibilities of directors, the duties of directors, the first significant attention paid to those difficult provisions in the companies code by the High Court occurred. after the Corporations Law had been introduced. It was not even settled until that time as to whether the provisions of the companies code relating to the duties of directors were to be seen as a statement of civil law responsibilities that carried penalties or were to be seen as a newly invented criminal provision with all that that involved. It needs to be added, as has been pointed out by the chairman, that changes of the sort that were wrought in the 1960s by the uniform companies legislation, in the 1980s by the national companies legislation and in the 1990s by the Corporations Law have an enormous economic cost. Every small company from the plumber's trustee company to a large company such as BHP has to develop a system, has to develop forms, dealing with the obligations that go with it. The people involved in advising:-from tax advisers, accountants, solicitors, barristers, courts and commercial advisers· of a wide range of types-all have to acquire a knowledge and understanding of the provisions of the law. The economic cost of their having to restudy and relearn is immeasurable and, I am sure, is not taken into account in the figure mentioned by the honourable member for Banks. There is a difficulty, I perceive, in improving Commonwealth law which needs to be overcome but which is going to be difficult to achieve: that is, the attitude of the Public Service to the use of legislation. Many years ago I was engaged by the state government of Western Australia to draft some complementary revenue legislation to tie in with some Commonwealth legislation. I worked with an officer of a Commonwealth agency who was extremely knowledgeable in the field. In fact, he was the only person in the whole of Australia who seemed to know the ins and outs of the legislative field into which we were venturing. I was dismayed with the response I got when I queried how we could draft the provisions such that an ordinary suburban legal practitioner or an accountant would be able to understand them. My dismay was at the response I got, which was to suggest that they did not need to know because the agency would be able to tell them. I believe that that is an attitude that must be dispelled, if it is still present. Finally, I mention lobbyists. I have been in the role of a lobbyist, as have many people who belong to interest groups and organisations-professional, trade, and others. The experience I gained was that the legislative process becomes something of a snowball. Unless the lobbyist has access at the earliest stages and provides appropriate input at that stage, it is almost impossi1-:,l- for community input to be absorbed. The Lime demands on senior public servants and on ministers are such that these people are just not accessible after the legislation has started to take shape. (TIme expired)",22
6,Mr DUFFY,COMMITTEES,"I am in a position similar to that of the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), not having been part of the committee in the previous parliament, so I would-as did the chairman, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham)-thank the previous committee and the secretariat for the amount of work they did. For those three years, however, this matter was very much an issue which I had to examine, because it was a matter which was debated throughout that period. I do not really want to enter into a debate with the honourable member for Tangney over some of the matters he raised. I want to touch on a couple of the recommendations. However, with the greatest respect for the father of the honourable member for Tangney, I do not know whether good or bad legislation is judged on whether you know it off by heart or not. You may well know it by heart; whether you understand it is, of course, an entirely different issue. The point was made that the Corporations Law caused the honourable member for Tangney and some of his partners some difficulty in jettisoning some of the knowledge they had before. If the honourable member were to talk to the state attorneys and to my predecessor, he would find that my view is shared by all of them. We were not, of course, attempting necessarily to make life easier for practitioners in the drafting of legislation. There were many other considerations involved. There are two recommendations that I would like to touch upon. The first is recommendation 16, on the question of resources. One of the things that very much concerned me during the past three years was that there was a tendency-by implication, at least-to direct some of the criticism to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. The committee has been careful not to fall into that trap. The chairman, the honourable member for Banks, talked about the government needing to do something in this area, and that is the important issue. Parliamentary counsel will draft legislation as they are directed to by government. It is a matter for parliament and the government of the day, particularly the executive. That will not change unless pressure is put on the executive by the parliament. I have always felt that, whilst it was not always explicit, there was at times-by implication-a view expressed that it might have been the fault of parliamentary counsel that legislation was not drafted in a particular way. From my experience over the three years, I can indicate that that is nonsense. Counsel will always draft legislation as they are asked to draft legislation .. That is a matter for us, and not for them. On the question of resources, there is no doubt that, if legislation is to be dealt with more carefully in terms of drafting, it will be necessary to give more resources to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. In many ways, they would be the most under-resourced of all government bodies. I can assure this parliament that the numbers of hours which they work and the effort which they put in are absolutely enormous. The second recommendation, recommendation 26 on page 135, that I would like to touch upon deals with drafting styles. The committee did a good job by requiring the instruction to be that legislation be drafted in general principles, where appropriate; and by stating that the need to use black letter law in many circumstances is still necessary. That whole argument has been oversimplified by that some people. The classic example of it-and I think the honourable member for Tangney would agree with me in this-was the provisions on prospectuses within the corporations bill. That bill was drafted in general principles, yet people screamed blue murder that they could not understand it. Yet, once they got used to it, they did understand it. So I think that 'where appropriate' is the point that has to be noted in the committee's report. Overall I think that what the chairman of the committee said and what the honourable member for Tangney said is correct, that this is a report that should be welcomed. It is a balanced report that draws attention to many of the failings in the styles and drafting and the various problems that we have had in recent years. But it does that in a balanced way which I must say is more than can be said of some of the critics of the legislative procedures in the past. (Extension of time granted) I thank the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). The point that I was making in respect of the last recommendation, recommendation 26, was very much discussed in a conference which was held in this place in a committee room about the middle of last year or late the previous year. We had views put very strongly from some people, and the honourable member for Banks mentioned the Victorian Law Reform Commission in the opening to his speech. That body was represented at that conference and its spokesman was putting the plain English argument. Another person at that conference was Mr John Green of Freehills who is a great advocate of fuzzy law, as he refers to it. That is the same thing as the general principles referred to in this report. It was that sort of overstatement of the position to which I was referring. I am pleased that the right honourable member for New England has just given me that few more minutes to speak on that because I think it can be overstated. General principles will not give the solution in all legislative areas. The honourable member for Tangney mentioned the distinction between civil and criminal liability. If one looks at the corporations law I would have thought that, if directors are going to face criminal sanctions in some circumstances, one would have to be very careful of general principles where criminal liability may be incurred. People have to take the view that the committee has in those two words. It said 'where appropriate' we should move to general principles. Nobody is arguing about that. The problems and the cost of complex legislation are ones which cause enormous difficulties in the business community and to us here in parliament. But that said, that over-simplistic view which is put by some people including the Law Reform Commission in Victoria, and to some extent by Mr John Green, that one solves all the problems by moving to a particular style of drafting, is just not correct. There is a mix involved. There is a mix for certain types of legislation and I think that the committee has appreciated that. I think that it would have been interesting from the point of view of the committee if the right honourable member for New England had been on the committee in the previous parliament because he has been around this place a long while. I think he would agree with the committee's recommendation completely, that we do look at these problems but we look at them in a little less emotional way than has happened in the past three years where people have said that everything ought to be in plain English. The Victorian Law Reform Commission ought to have a look at the fact that a couple of its efforts at plain English drafting fell flat on . their face. The first one went to the full court of the Supreme Court of Victoria which said that it could not understand what it was talking about. So it is not as easy as some people make out. Finally, I again wish to take this public opportunity to compliment the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Counsel's office. That is in the report, it has been acknowledged. I think in Ian Turnbull, who is now retired, and Hillary Penfold, we as a government and as a parliament have two people-and those people working with them-who have served this parliament and the people of this country very well. Thank you.",24
7,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,"I would also like to say a few words on the tabling of the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Clearer Commonwealth law. I commend the present and past chairmen, the members of the committee and the staff of the committee for the work that has gone into the preparation of the report. In the five minutes I have it is going to be extraordinarily difficult to cover what I would like to cover. Therefore, I will not speak about each one of the recommendations of the report. The suggestion by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) that less law rather than more law facilitates clarity is an observation with which I agree totally. I want to refer to some statistics in this report which identify the fact that we spend an inordinate amount of time in debate and very little time in consideration of the detail of legislation. One of our problems is that in this place, which is so political,it is extraordinarily difficult to pursue in detail the legislation which has such an impact on the wider community. Another remark that I wish to identify with was that made by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) about the quality and application of members of the p!lrliamentary counsel team. The parliamentary counsel over the years have rendered extraordinarily wonderful service to the Parliament and sive governments. As a long-time chairman of the coalition cabinet legislation committee, I can testify to the accuracy of the remarks made by the honourable member for Holt. Drafting legislation is an extraordinarily difficult role, however. While we have attempted to pick it up in this report, let me state here that it is important that the departThe mental responsibility in drafting be understood. In the area of responses to queries and the continuing dialogue between departmental. officers and parliamentary counsel- too often the blame is passed on to parliamentary counsel when in fact it should lie with the department itself. It is also true that, in the development of legislation, so often there is a problem in the ideas which it is known need to be translated into legislation are not seen in their legislative form until too late. In this report we pick up the fact that, by the time it comes to the political scene, it is even later. As legislators we fail in our responsibility way in which we consider and deal with legislation. . I urge all those who at this time are looking at the procedures of this place to look at some of the graphs in the report showing the volume of work and the volume of legislation. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel comes out particularly well. If honourable members look at the graph on page 166 of the report, they will note that its performance generally has improved. There was a slight aberration in 1990, and I have no particular idea why, but I suspect that it might well have been for reasons unrelated to the quality of the team. The performance of the parliament can be seen in figure 4 on page 169. That graph shows the annual quantity of acts compared with parliamentary time spent considering bills. Honourable members will see that the volume of legislation is increasing while the amount of time spent dealing with legislation is doing the reverse. Figure 5 on page 170 also shows that parliamentary scrutiny of legislation is in decline. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances does an excellent job in identifying some of the failings in legislation, and we have reto succes- ferred to that in the report. But my concern is that we need to find a better means of looking at legislation and dealing with it. One of the recommendations suggests there should be a lO-day gap between the first reading of a bill and the resumption of the second reading debate. That would be ideal and I wish that it could be so. trouble, however, is in the proC({SS of government itself. The government needs to consider in advance what its program is. In the consideration of the budget, we have had dramatic day-today changes, with consequent legislative confusion, more drafting instructions and more work for the parliamentary counsel. But, above all, what is needed is an earlier determination of the legislative prothat gram, proper reference and proper consideration not only by the bureaucracy and the parliamentary counsel but by this place. Unless we conduct the legislative program in a better way we will not do justice as we should to that constituency that returns us in the here. (TIme expired)",25
8,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES," Mr Deputy Speaker, like other speakers I have a problem in dealing with the 214 pages of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Clearer Commonwealth law in the five minutes allocated to me. I would like, however, to congratulate the chairman of the committee. I do not know whether I am supposed to use the more politically correct term 'chair', but I have always understood that a chair is an inanimate object and one that is designed to be sat on, and I do not really think that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) could be described in either of those manners.",26
9,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEES,He is not a sweetheart; we know that.,27
10,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"He is certainly not; though he might have some charm, particularly to his own faction in the Labor Party. I must say that I think as chairman of our committee he is going to do a very good job. The chairman and the deputy chairman, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), together have created in our committee a very positive approach for this parliamentary term, and I believe that our committee will achieve much. Other speakers have referred to the fact there has been a change in the structure of the committee. That is natural, with a new parliament. I must say that as a new member of the committee I found it extraordinarily difficult, when we considered the evidence which was given to the previous committee, to pass a view on just what elements of that evidence should be accepted and what elements should be rejected; but I do understand that when elections intrude this is a problem not only for our committee but for others. I believe that in our report we have made it quite clear that the current members of the committee were not the members before whom the evidence was taken. We were singularly fortunate to have on our committee former ministers of the calibre of the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). I think the governmen,t and its cabinet is unfortunately not representa10 tive now of the Australian people, in that we have an ageing population and yet anyone over the age of 50 is apparently excluded from the cabinet. Having said that, I think that the cabinet's and the nation's loss is the gain of our committee. I can see the honourable member for Holt agreeing with me. He is not doing so in an audible way, but from the expression on his face I can see that he does not dissent from what I say. I mentioned previously that I have only a very short space of time-five minutes-and therefore I would like to touch on just three elements. I must say that I get a little disturbed from time to time over the requirement that we members of parliament have to be politically correct, and that all of the language we incorporate into .the legislation has to reflect modem attitudes. One word running all the way through this report is the word 'drafter'. I had never heard of a drafter prior to looking at the draft report. I do not really see what is wrong with the time-honoured and non-sexist term 'draftsman', but I am not going to waste very much of my five minutes talking about what appears to be a lost cause. I endorse entirely the comments of the that former Attorney-General in relation to the matter of black-letter law versus general principles law. I might even go a little further than the honourable member for Holt. Increasing requirements are being placed on people holding positions of responsibility; and at a time when those responsibilities, if not carried out properly, could result in gaol sentences, I get very worried when I find that more and more of our laws are going into general principles drafting and into fuzzy law. In my view, that is in effect a transference of responsibility from the legislature to the judiciary and possibly also to the executive, and I do not think that is healthy. Indeed, while the report on page 135 refers to general principles, it also stresses the need to use black-letter law, and I hope the government takes that on board. The other point that I would like to mention is recommendation 37, on page 172, where we refer to the importance of a minimum of days between the introduction and second reading of a bill. What we really need in this parliament is more time to debate legislation. We need the guillotine to be used less and, if the parliament sat more often and for a longer period, there would not be the need for the government to introduce the guillotine, which at the present time sees so many important and vital areas of legislation affecting the Australian people in effect forced prematurely through the House without adequate debate and as a result this place is treated as a sausage machine.",27
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Jeitkins)Order! It being 10.20 a.m., the time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Motion (by Mr Melham) proposed: That the House take note of the report.",28
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. . HARDSHIP IN RURAL AREAS Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by Mr Braithwaite: That the House: (l) acknowledges the extreme hardship now being faced by hundreds of farming and other families and individuals in rural and regional Australia as a result of falling, and in some cases disastrous, commodity prices, exacerbated by the spread of drought conditions in areas of Queensland and New South Wales; (2) considers that the availability of basic financial support to such families and individuals is restricted by assets tests which do not allow for the realities of the severe downturn in incomes for farmers and associated selfemployed persons; (3) calls on the Government to act on these matters as a matter of urgency; and (4) notes that the Government has removed the assets test for recipients of Farm Household Support and urges it to extend this liberalisation of the assets test to other areas to address the hardship faced by farming and other families and individuals in rural and regional Australia.",28
13,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"Wakefield) (10.21 a.m.}-I wish it were not necessary for me to rise in support of this fine motion from the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), but it is. If there is any area of poverty in Australia that is real, exacerbated and seemingly impossible to resolve, it is in rural Australia. I note the presence in the House of the honourable member for Dawson and the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) at the table, all of whom represent rural .electorates. In spite of their representation, largely because of commodity prices beyond the control of this House, the people in these electorates are the poor people of Australia. People would not know it. If they listen to this House at question time, if they listen to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who berates us as the people who know nothing about poverty, they would not be aware of the fact that in Australia, by any scale of income, real poverty is in regional Australia. But that is a fact. I have before me table 29B from a comparison of the 1991 census characteristics. That is a table of federal electorates ranked by proportion of families with incomes below $16,000. Of the 147 electorates represented in this parliament, the bottom 20 of them, with the exception of Port Adelaide, Brand, Page and Gilmore, are all represented by honourable members .on this side of the House. While I am not familiar with the geography of the electorate of Brand, it would certainly be true to say that, with.the exception of Port Adelaide and probably Brand, the bottom 20 electorates are all rural and regional electorates. So the poorest electorates in Australia are represented by people in opposition, by the honourable member for Dawson, the honourable member for Mallee, the honourable member for O'Connor and me. Sadly, all of these electorates are sitting on that scale. Mr Taylor-And Groom.",28
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Groom will not interject at all, especially out of his place.",28
15,Mr ANDREW,COMMITTEES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I accede to your ruling but I aclqlOwledge the presence of the honourable member for Groom and the fact that he also represents a regional electorate which has people living in it with incomes of under $16,000. The crippling fact about rural poverty is that these are the people whose cost of living is normally higher than that experienced by . people in other parts of Australia. These are the people who have to deny their children the sorts of facilities and opportunities that other people in other parts of Australia for granted; and these are the people whose poverty is hardest to address by either governwhat ment or opposition and hardest to recognise by the parliament. The motion of the honourable member Dawson is not a criticism o(the ment scheme as such. In fact, we in opposition would acknowledge that the rural adjustall ment scheme has been modified and that $175.5 million will go in rural assistance farming families around Australia. We freely acknowledge that J 1,500 farming families around Australia are currently receiving that sort of assistance. However, half of those 11,500 families are people in the wool industry; people who face an extended and difficult to resolve sales 'problem due to the current surplus of wool, particularly in our country. The government may take some comfort and say it has already addressed ,this problem, Every member of the opposition is familiar with the Gamaut iners quiry. The Garnaut inquiry indicates that there is no real relief in sight for ,three years. Our response is that the Gamaut inquiry on wool or the GATT arrangements represent on wheat cannot of themselves be an excuse for the government to be inactive. One of the things that the Garnalit inquiry, for example, reveals is that if the government were prepared to be active and imaginative in its approach to industrial relations, if it were weeks. prepareq, for example, to look at the minimum weight of each bale of wool, Ausand tralian wool growers could next year believed of a cost of $110 million, just by changing domeStic arrangements in Australia. But nothing happens. While it is fair to say that one of the major problems facing our grain growers is the problem of subsidised grain flooding into their markets from' Europe and from the that United States of America, that is, no excuse for inaction, on the w,ay in which we hanqle our grain, on the way in which, we load grain and on the way in which we address handling in our ports. His certainly no excuse for a budget that penalises ,every rural producised wine? er with a change in the current excise on fuel, ensuring that the cost of harvesting and take handling grain must go up. I am aware, of course, that on-farm excise is rebatable, but about the excise paid by every farmer on everything that comes onto the farm, on the cost of living in a rural community and on all for of the people who have to subsequently rural adjusthandle the grain off-farm. The government cannot claim to be doing it can for rural Australia in spite of the 'changes that have been made to RAS. The to plea by the honourable member for Dawson and the plea I support in these remarks is a plea for greater flexibility in the RAS. We are surrounded by constituents who are asset rich but cash poor; whose assets are effectively worthless because they are generating nothing for those constituents. Yet these assets are seen by the government as a reason to restrict the immediate assistance ,available to the people that we have to keep in rural Australia so that when the commodity prices tum, as inevitably they will, we will still have producin business able to fuel the export markets and generate the export income we so despeat least the next rately need. The honourable member for MaBee and I similar sorts of electorates. Not only do we represent wheat growers and wool growers who are directly affected by this motion but we represent horticulturists and viticulturists who are adversely affected by the action of this government in the last three Mr Deputy Speaker, my question to youthrough you to members of the governrement-would be: what evidence did you have of a rise in incomes available to anyone of the viticulturists in my electorate, or anyone of the grape growers in the, electorate of Mallee, in the electorate of Riverina-Darling or in the electorate of Hunter? What evidence did you have of improved income, for them would justify a rise in the tax on wine of 55 per cent? And how many members of the government are aware of what I might, at my our accommodating best, call an unintended the consequence of the government's policy: a rise of 110 per cent in the tax on de-alcoholHow, on any grounds, can the parliamentary secretary justify that? How can he claim to have a real concern for rural Australia while he deliberately continues to take action here in Australia, in the domestic scene, which makes it more difficult for our farmers? His action makes it difficult not only for our farmers to be exporters but for them to survive and remain in place, so that when commodity prices turn around they can be viable and once again make a real contribution to the primary products needed around the globe and to the export income that needs. to be generated in Australia.",28
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I appreciate that the honourable member for Wakefield was attempting to address his remarks through the chair, but on future occasions he should be careful not to involve the chair in a partial way in the debate.",30
17,Mr SIMMONS,COMMITTEES,"Cal are) (10.31 a.m.)Like the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the mover of this motion, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), I find it regrettable that we as members of parliament are debating a motion of this nature concerned with the decline in commodity prices and the severe drought that has affected rural and provincial Australia. Members of the opposition are putting forward motions that draw the House's attention to that situation and propose certain remedies. While in a partisan way we would have our differences about the nature of the remedies needed to solve this particular problem in rural and provincial Australia, I would acknowledge that there is a great deal of bipartiform sanship in the sense that we all sincerely acknowledge the great stress and the great traumas faced by many farming families today-and, indeed, by people living in rural . and provincial Australia who are not on farms. I think it is particularly instructive for members of this House to look at some of that important stati-tical information that the member for Wakefield drew to the House's attention. It is a very sad fact that there are many parts of rural and provincial Australia where incomes are extraordinary low vis-a-vis those in city electorates. That is reflected by the difficulties facing rural and provincial Australia at the present time, with a combination of drought and the downturn in commodity prices. None of that is really within the direct control' of members of either side of this House. We all acknowledge the stress that is placed on commodity prices by the actions of the European Community and by the actions of the United States in its export enhancement program. As a relatively small player in the total scene we are badly bruised by those particular processes. It is important, though, that we recognise that there are five million people who live outside the great metropolitan areas of Australia: Many of those are great contributors to our national wealth, whether they are members of farming families, whether they are involved in the extraction of minerals or whether they are contributing to the provision of services for people who live in t:Ural and provincial Australia. I was pleased that the honourable member for Wakefield did commend the government's announced improved rural adjustment scheme. People would be aware under the new RAS arrangements farmers may be eligible for interest subsidies of up to 50 per cent under so-called normal RAS to enhance farm productivity, or up to 100 per cent interest subsidies under the exceptional circumstances provision. It is interesting that since the introduction of the new rural adjustment scheme in excess of 5,000 approvals have been made, with the bulk of the support being provided in the of interest subsidies. On a regional basis, I understand that in New South Wales something of the order of 823 applications have been received from specialist wool growers under the exceptional circumstances provisions, which only began on 1 May this year. Of these, about 320 have been approved and 399 are pending, with about $4 million to $5 million distributed so far. Under the new rural adjustment scheme, there is a greater emphasis on grants for training to upgrade farm business and property management skills arid to assist with the cost of obtaining expert financial planning and other advice relating to farm business. By and large, I think there has been general bipartisan agreement amongst the states with the Commonwealth in relation to those new arrangements under RAS. In the recent budget, which has been subject to a degree of criticism, there have been a number of quite positive announcements made, also in a bipartisan way. I have mentioned RAS. We have had almost $407 million, over a period of four years, provided to rural Australia under that program. Interestingly too, the other aspect that is warmly welcomed by most honourable members of this House is the significant improvement for the national land care program. There is a greater coordination between the former programs operating under that national land care program, to the extent that it is now more than $105 million. With all the media attention given to some of the more trendy issues amongst our friends in the environmental movement, at least those rural members present in the House today would appreciate that the greatest single threat to environmental degradation in this country relates to soil degradation and related issues. It is not the sort of thing that necessarily the high profile publicity that many of us would like to see. We have also provided in this budget $4 million a year for rural families through the abolition of the assets test on the supplementary boarding allowances under the assistance for isolated children's scheme. Again this is a recognition of some of those special difficulties that are being faced by people in current circumstances through no fault of their own. It is something that would also be welcome . . Increased funds are being provided for rural counselling. All of us would like to see that figure lessening in one sense and that we did not have to provide for rural counselling. However, all of us recognise the reality of the position in rural and provincial Australia and that there will be a need for a continuing financial support for rural counselling services and that, indeed, is very welcome. The honourable member for Wakefield talked about the imposition, in the budget, of increases in the excise on fuel and, of course, as a rural member, I find myself with a certain degree of sympathy for that particular view. People who live in rural and provincial Australia, rarely, if ever, get the benefit of any discounting that takes place by the oil companies in metropolitan areas. I live in the central western New South Wales city of Bathurst and, as a result of the budget decision, the average price of leaded and unleaded fuel in that city is about 77c a litre. I know this would be somewhat less than some of my other colleagues on both sides of the House pay. If honourable members go to metropolitan areas of Sydney, they can easily find the price discounted-upwards of lOc, sometimes 15c-below that price. ,. It always seems to me to be an extraordinary attitude of oil companies that they are prepared to, in fact, provide discounts for high volume surges through their refineries to people who live in metropolitan areas, but they are not prepared to extend that same provision to people who live in rural and provincial Australia. To some extent, there is never rhyme nor reason to the retail pricing aspects of petrol and related products in this gets country: there do seem to be extraordinary variations. I am not sure whether there is any correlation between the fact that many of the oil or the petrol outlets are franchise operations of oil companies, as distinct from those which are still independently operated and are able to discount. I am sure this would make a difference to the overall retail pricing. Something that really gets up the nose of every person who drives a vehicle-leaded or unleaded-in rural and provincial Australia is the vast disparity that exists between prices where they happen to live in rural and provincial Australia and the prices where their colleagues and friends happen to live in city areas. While, as I said, I am less than happy with that decision, I am pleased that the government at least has modified it. I thought that the differential between leaded and unleaded petrol was going to be of the order of five cents and that was certainly not taking into account the difficulties that people were facing. There are a range of other issues that we could comment on that are part of this motion. They include the assets test and the farm household support scheme. But, by and large, this government has recognised the difficulties that people face through no fault of their own-through drought and the downturn in commodity prices. The social justice programs that have been the hallmark of this government over a period of 10 years have addressed many of those problems. There will always be criticisms, but I believe that fundamentally this government's record in rural and provincial Australia is second to none. This is demonstrated by the fact that this government is made up of members of the parliamentary Labor Party who represent the large-t country party in Australia. (Time expired)",30
18,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"""-The previous speakers to this motion in the earlier part of the debate, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) and the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), and now today the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), have reminded us of the government's provisions with respect to meeting the needs of rural Australia. We have heard about the amendments to the rural adjustment scheme, the facilitation of jobsearch for farmers and adjustments to Austudy, but I make the point that these issues really do not address the fundamental problem that confronts my rural constituents, and that is the cost of operating. It is not correct to hide behind the problems of our commodities and say that governments can do nothing about them. Governments can do something. This government has the control and the capacity to do something about the costs of operating. I want to address the issue of commodities. Most speakers have mentioned it but they have not been specific about it. In the last 30 years, the contribution to this nation's wealth from rural Australia has declined from 70 per cent of exports to 30 per cent. That is a great tragedy. Although this is made up somewhat by the increase in other exporting commodities in the mining area, I believe that we as Australians are missing an ideal opportunity to restore rural production to its former pre-eminence. In accordance with ABARE's latest official figures on specific commodities, across the board the crop price on average has decreased by 3.8 per cent in just 12 months. I mention specifically grain, 3.5 per cent; citrus, 25 per cent; livestock, 6.8 per cent; bananas, 27 per cent-no matter what the commodity is·, there has been an across the board reduction in just 12 months of 3.8 per cent. And yet ABARE's official figures indicate that the cost of producing these commodities has increased over 10 years by a mammoth 50 per cent, with an increase of only 17 per cent in what people earn from what they produce. This is the real issue that the government needs to address. Whilst we on this side of the House welcome the measures we have been reminded about, this government has an opportunity to reduce costs. Many of my constituents, despite their massive problems, still have an extremely positive attitude. I mentiol}. one of my constituents, Mr Rocky Lamattino, who is a carrot grower in the Wemen area. He is growing carrots under irrigation-700 acresand is investing millions of dollars in irrigation and in grading equipment for carrots. There is a challenge: to design one's own grading machine to grade carrots. Mr Lamattino has been working extremely hard to do what he has been challenged to do and all rural Australians are being challenged to do constantly, to capture the Asian market. He is producing carrots for juicing and currently is establishing a market in Japan. They are the sorts of challenges my constituents are rising to, and what they do not need are the dramatic increases in costs that we have seen in this government's budget. I think the government ought to get serious. It ought to respond to the sentiment that has been expressed by the honourable members for Richmond, Page and Calare and make a determined attack on the costs that primary producers face every day. Rural Australia is in decline, but in the next decade there is an opportunity to inspireit to meet the challenges that confront us, particularly as we look towards Asia. In 30 years, there has been a reduction in its contribution to the nation's wealth from 70 per cent to 30 per cent, but even at 30 per cent that is almost one-third of the nation's export wealth contributed by only 10 per cent of the population. I would like to challenge the government to be serious about the sentiments expressed by honourable members on the opposition benches and make a determined attack on reducing the costs of primary producers.",32
19,Mr SNOW,COMMITTEES,"I would like to support some of the concerns that have been raised by honourable members about rural hardship in Australia. I congratulate the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) on raising this very important subject, which is today an Australia-wide problem. There are areas that are not doing as badly as others, but I feel that I need to acknowledge, along with other opposition and government members, that there is hardship in rural Australia and that it has been worse than for quite a few years. I have just recently visited areas right throughout the electorate of Eden-Monaro and it has been interesting to balance the problems that are seen within the electorate with the problems that are perceived by the leaders of national organisations which have met with our policy committees in about 16 or 17 committee rooms around the parliament, dealing with important issues, including primary industry issues. We have seen the National Farmers Federation, we have seen leaders of industry, and I have personally called on the ACTU, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia. In my own electorate, it is quite apparent that the problems are as much in the towns as on the farms. When commodity prices drop, naturally this hits the towns. There are other industries as well. I think of Adaminaby, which is in the greatest depression of any of the areas in the electorate of Eden-Monaro. Adaminaby is suffering a lack of tourism due to the lack of snow:-snow with a small S-at Mount Selwyn. There is no snow at all, which has meant that there has not been very much business and the town is quite· depressed. Nimmitabel has fairly recently lost its purely through a commercial decision by Tablelands Sawmills. That has boosted Bombala's mill, but it has left Nimmitabel as a depressed area. Bombala, on the other hand, is showing promise with the increased business forecast for the pine mill there. The Tablelands mill is more solid, following consolidation of the mills by Tablelands, and I believe that responsible policies being pursued in the timber industry will make a great future for the Bombala area. In addition to that, the opening of the Cann Valley highway will give promise to Bombala. People may be surprised that the possibility of the armaments depot going to Eden is, according to my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), greater than local· people think. In fact, he has mentioned to me the strong opposition to the proposed move of the naval armaments depot from Sydney, a strong possibility of its going to Eden and the strong possibility of both Jervis Bay and Point Wilson in Victoria not winning the placement of the armaments depot. I believe there are four sites being considered. The other two are Eden and Gladstone. The timber industry is also showing promise. I call on the New South Wales Parliament to reject the Clover Moore bill which is going before that parliament and to accept a proposal which has gone from the Australian government to the New South Wales government. It is a proposal for agreement on a viable, sustainable timber industry. The towns of Queanbeyan and Braidwood, which are associated with tourism, the Public Service, heritage and local rural industries, are going fairly well. The town of Bega is going particularly well. It has a strong dairy industry and a growing number of overseas purchasers in the beef industry. I believe our electorate can have great access to the $42 million proposed for regional tourism by the federal government, including $10 million in ecotourism. There are some great opportunities in our electorate to take advantage of the tourism proposal that has been put in the recent budget. There are some great opportunities to link in with the important work that is already being done overseas sawmill in advertising by Paul Hogan and Greg Norman. There is now some very aware advertising all round the world. (TIme expired)",33
20,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"I am delighted to support this motion put before the house by my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and others on this side of the house. It is also a pleasure to hear some of the comments from others like the more reasonable honourable members opposite, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). I wait with bated breath to hear what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has to say. I am sure he will say it as it is. Our current rural crisis is undoubtedly a crisis of the greatest proportions for 50 years, with a range of unparalleled international commodity downturns now exacerbated by one of the worse droughts on record, particularly in Queensland. This feeds into provincial centres, such as Toowoomba in my electorate, where people who service rural producers are no longer able to generate reasonable incomes. Undeniably, we are seeing a drastic run-down in rural infrastructure, both on and off farms, compounded by the intransigence of this government in rural affairs. Let there be no doubt about it: we have what may be termed a national disaster on our hands, not only in terms of its geographic spread but also at the individual family farm level and in terms of the many millions of dollars likely to be lost to our export revenue. We need to avoid the blinkered vision and the belief that the problem is a minor cyclical one, and should realise the extent of its potential to threaten our social fabric and further degrade our national economic performance. As I look around the city of Toowoomba, what do I see? I see farm machinery dealers very much in the grips of the recessionsome long established dealerships closing their doors, others just managing to hang on. We see seed merchants struggling to make ends meet and we hear of plantings being down as much as 40 per cent. Toowoomba has one of the largest per capita boarding school enrolments in the nation. All schools are reporting to me a general downturn in enrolments, particularly in years 7 and 8, as a result of inadequate provision for isolated children. This is particularly in relation to the Austudy assets tests anomalies referred to by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). A very large degree of those who are supposedly assets rich are, of course, very much income poor. That honourable member and others have talked about poverty. Let there be no doubt about it; we have poverty in its deepest form, we do not just have hardship. I have been involved in fund-raising activities as a result of the drought. Recently we heard that in .Charlevillewhich is in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott)-there were about 40 families receiving fortnightly food parcels. That in itself is an indictment and a reflection of what is happening-or, more importantly, what is not happening-out there in rural Australia. Of course, what comes home to me, and should to everybody, is this: one lady who received her food parcel said, 'Thank you very much. Next time, I wonder if I could have a pair of boots so that my husband can work on the farm?'. To add the deepest insult to the irreversible injury for those in the rural sector, this 1993 budget is the worse budget there has ever been for those in rural and regional Australia, and it offers no net gain for exporters. In essence, I say to every honourable member in the House, and to those who are perhaps listening, that this government is washing its hands of those who are in a highly productive sector-at the moment, producing about 50 per cent of our export income-and washing its hands of those who live outside our capital cities. Let there be no doubt about it: the people of the rural sector are the forgotten people in this nation. This government, despite protestations about rural adjustment schemes and everything else, is doing very little indeed to make sure that the rural sector is sustainedand sustained it must be, in the national interest.

21,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEES,"In speaking in a debate such as this, one often has to ask oneself what it is for, because we come to this place and we pontificate. Very little of reality will flow from what we say here or from the tears which we shed, be they crocodile or otherwise. I have mentioned before in the House the words of Abraham Lincoln, who said that, if every city in the United States were destroyed by fire or any other means, the country would rebuild them; but that, if the country were ever laid waste, it would be taken over by weeds. If that was true of the United States then, it is even more true of Australia today. The real danger we have in Australia today is the growing dichotomy of rural and urban Australia. This used not to be so. Every country needs its myths, and we had myths in the past of the comradeship that existed in rural and regional Australia. The truth is, of course, that Australia has always been the most urban country in the world. One hundred years ago we were the most urban country in the world; today, we are even more so. But those myths were important, because of the comradeship that was there. I remember that, when I was a kid, everyone knew about the bush; and if Uncle Harry had not done his knee in, he would still be up there on the farm. But things have changed, and today the cities of Australia dominatethe sterile cities, the worse offenders being Melbourne and Sydney. The reality is that both major political parties in this House-in this context, one could ignore the National Party-are city based. Both parties know that they can win Melbourne and Sydney, and that it does not really matter about the rest of country. That idea is ultimately and inevitably reflected in policy. It is a policy that, in view, will destroy this country if it is not checked. In five minutes, you cannot develop this theme a great deal. One looks at the enormous earning capacity of the timber industry, and one must reflect that not one square inch of forest in this country has been devastated by the timber industry: it has been devastated in the past by incorrect farming, in the main. Today, we are getting on top of those environmental problems; but they are not the fault of the timber industry-an industry that has the capacity to earn a lot of money for Australia, either through exports or through import replacement. It is an industry that is highly environmentally friendly. Here I must pay tribute to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), who has done a very good job in representing that industry. I go on now to talk about wool. Woolapproached with a bit of commonsensecould be the biggest earner for Australia. This is important because wool is still Australia's most important single industry-not because it is the biggest, but because it is so diversified. Wool is the biggest small business in Australia. But what have we done with our wool? We have traded it as an agricultural product. If we are going to maximise the value of our wool, we must trade it as an industrial product-we must get into the processing of wool. I pay tribute to the initiatives taking place in Parkes and in Hamilton where Austops is setting up to provide custom facilities to wool growers so that they can convert their wool to tops and sell it in the market as tops, as an industrial fibre. This increases the value of wool enormously. And if we go on to take our wool to single white yam, and I would suggest that is about as far as Australia wants to go into downstream processing, certainly as far as we want to go with any sort of government assistance, we would increase the value of wool fivefold. It would become without a doubt Australia's premier product. It would create enormous job opportunities in the bush. When we talk about rural Austhe tralia we are not just talking about farmers; we are talking about country towns. The jobs my created in urban Australia are very much a product of what is generated outside the cities of this country. That is something that should be understood by all Australia. I just want to reiterate the initiative being taken by Austops. The initiative of the first Australian-owned company to offer these custom facilities to farmers is an attempt to re-establish wool as the premier small business of Australia. It can help to revitalise and repopulate urban Australia. If we do not assist this, if we do not grasp these opportunities, we are doomed. We will become a divided nation and we will be taken over for already we see amongst us, on both sides of this parliament, people advocating a multicultural philosophy which will divide this country.

23,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMERCIAL WHALING,"I move: That this House: (1) opposes proposals by countries, including Japan, Norway and Iceland, to pennit commercial whaling to resume; (2) maintains its opposition to all whaling and maintains its commitment to seeking worldwide protection of all cetaceans; , (3) recognises that commercial whaling activities are no longer required to meet essential human needs, that whaling methods continue to involve an unacceptable level of cruelty and that communities worldwide are increasingly recognising the non-consumptive value of whales; (4) supports the efforts made by the federal Government and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to oppose commercial whaling and to have all Southern Ocean waters south of 40 degrees south latitude declared a whale sanctuary; (5) recognises the International Whaling Commission as the appropriate international body for the conservation of all cetaceans and seeks the development of cooperative conservation measures for small cetacean species, particularly those subject to direct exploitation and significant incidental mortality; and (6) calls on the International Whaling Commission to investigate the impacts and management implications of whale watching and other lowconsumptive uses of whales. I was motivated to put this motion on whaling before the House today by a segment on the Foreign Correspondent television program on the ABC earlier this year which showed the slaughter of minke whales by Japanese fishermen. I am sure that anyone who saw that program was as horrified as I was by the terrible slaughter that was going on. Australia, unfortunately, does not have an ideal history when it comes to whaling. Many Australians may not realise that whaling was Australia's first major export industry providing much of the wealth of the then colony of New South Wales. Indeed, it was not until 1833 that wool displaced whale products in Australia as Australia:s chief source of export income. There were a number of ships which brought convicts to this country from England which returned with holds filled with oil and other whale products after delivering their human cargo. Following the ending of the monopoly of the East India Company over British trade and navigation in the Pacific and Indian oceans, whaling fleets from many nations kept the ports of Hobart and Sydney busy and quite prosperous. The products of sealing and whaling provided profits for local companies which were then invested in other activities. As a result of the damage to the ocean's ecosystem caused by this history of whaling, Australia is under a special obligation to end this barbaric practice. Sadly, our community was slow to recognise the damage caused to the environment by whaling. In fact, it was not until 1960 that the Whaling Act, which aimed to protect all cetaceans in Australian waters and allow only limited whaling under' permit, was actually passed. It took another 17 years for a government inquiry into whaling to recommend the banning of the importation of whale products,' As a result of the inquiry the last whaling station in Australia, at Cheynes Beach at Albany, Western Australia, was closed in 1978. The Whale Protection Act of 1980 officially ended whaling within Australia's 200-mile fishing zone while also extending the ban to the Australian Antarctic territory. However, in recent years the Australian government has been at the forefront of international efforts to end whaling, and rightly so. At the 45th annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in Japan in May this year, Australia reaffirmed its opposition to all commercial whaling and supported the worldwide protection of all whales and dolphins. In addition, the government reaffirmed Australia's support for the French proposal for a whale sanctuary in all the Southern Ocean south of 40 degrees. Fortunately, there was enough support for the meeting to continue the global moratorium put in place in 1985-86. Under this government, Australia has made it clear at international forums, including the International Whaling Commission, that it remains opposed to all forms of whaling. Other countries such as Norway and Japan have been equally adamant that whaling should resume. In February, Norway announced that it would kiII between 300 and 800 minke whales this year and sell the meat for human consumption. Norway's attitude to the whaling of minkes is extreme by any standard. In a letter to a Norwegian newspaper last year, Norway's then foreign minister called minke whales 'rats of the sea' which 'take fish from fishermen'. Japan is also committed to a policy supporting resumption of commercial whaling through the north Pacific and the north Atlantic. The Japanese fishery ministry has said that Japan could kiII 2,000 a year without risking the extinction of the species. The Japanese, of course, are very skilful at presenting arguments in, favour of whaling which, on the surface, appear to be valid and quite rational. They have gone as far as to attempt to characterise opposition to whaling as a form of cultural imperialism. The Japanese claim it is part of their country's culture to kill the minke whale and that western countries such as Australia have no right to impose our values on them. However, we should not allow the argument of tradition to be used as a defence for the slaughter of whales. To begin with, the widespread consumption of whale meat and blubber is a comparatively recent phenomenon, having been encouraged by the United States occupation force in Japan following the Second World War as a means of supplementing the Japanese diet. Even if the consumption of whale products in Japan could be characterised - as traditional, this would still not make such a practice acceptable. So, surely, one such global value is to ensure that the very real possibility of the extinction of a number of whale species posed by whaling in the past and the present does not occur. As part of its propaganda campaign, Japan's fisheries agency has been making some quite outlandish claims. In January this year, for instance, the agency launched a campaign in the Japanese media on the benefits of whale meat, even going as far as to claim that the meat helps cure diseases such as asthma and dermatitis. In an act of breathtaking insensitivity, the agency also organised a whale meat feast outside the venue of the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Tokyo in May this year, inviting delegates to attend. Not surprisingly, few delegates actually took up this invitation. One thing which the slick marketing campaign of the Japanese, Norwegians and Icelanders cannot gloss over is that whales have been hunted to the point of extinction. Figures show that in the 1930s there were an estimated 500,000 finwhales in the Antarctic waters. By 1989, a full 13 years after the harvesting of the whales stopped, there were only 2,000 left. Whaling nations like to claim that a controlled level of whaling can be maintained without seriously affecting the continued existence of the whale species. In particular, the Japanese claim that there are 700,000 minke whales in existence throughout the oceans of the world and that their proposed killing of 2,000 whales would have little effect on the overall population of the species. Such figures are open to question, of Course. Because of the migratory nature of the whale population, it is difficult to calculate the population of many species. In addition, because of our lack of knowledge of many whale species, it is difficult to calculate the effect that any level of killing will have on a given whale population. Indeed, the primary reason for the imposition of the worldwide moratorium in 1985 was that the formula which was used to calculate a sustainable level of whaling was found to be seriously flawed. If all whaling is ever to be allowed to start again, the world scientific community would need to be very confident about the formulas used to calculate sustainable whaling quotas, or face the real risk that whaling activity would lead to the extinction of whale species along with the devastating consequences such extinction would have for ocean ecosystems. Australia is at present participating in international surveys of whale populations in the southern oceans and in monitoring the recovery of endangered species such as the blue, fin and humpback whales. While Australia has taken action to protect all whales, dolphins and porpoises in Australian waters, the migratory nature of many whale species means that Australia cannot act in isolation, and we are dependent on international cooperation through the International Whaling Commission to protect them globally. Along these lines the Australian government has lent its support to a proposal of the French government to establish a sanctuary for all whales, dolphins and porpoises in all waters south of 40 degrees south. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his statement on the environment last December, Australia s Environment: a Natural Asset, reaffirmed the government's support for the proposal, which I am sure is supported by all Australians. The reason that the area south of 40 degrees south was selected as the site for the proposed sanctuary is that it covers the main summer feeding grounds for great whales in the Southern Hemisphere. Australia's support for the proposal was unfortunately not enough to ensure that it received the 75 per cent ty needed for it to be implemented by the International Whaling Commission at its annual meeting in May this year. However, despite this setback, I am sure that all honourable members will welcome the statement by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) that Australia will continue to lead the campaign to ensure that it is successful next year. By keeping the proposal alive, Australia can ensure that it is refined in order to secure support of enough countries to allow its implementation at the next meeting of the International Whaling Commission. The International Whaling Commission has agreed to have further work done on the sanctuary proposal. That is welcomed. In addition to the very sound environmental reasons for continuing the world ban on whaling, there are also economic reasons for Australia to continue supporting the ban. In the last few days, a white whale has appeared in the Hervey Bay region. That is quite remarkable. When I lived in Hervey Bay in the early 1970s, there were very few whales because whaling was still going on. Now whales are a major tourist attraction in that part of the world. I am sure that members from both sides of the House, and particularly the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), would welcome comments about that because these creatures should be protected. Anyone who has had the opportunity to participate in whale watching would welcome the events of the last few days. Australians should be very proud of the leading role played by this government. All Australians should also be very proud of the role that our minister for the environment has played in ensuring the continued protection of whales and dolphins. I believe that this motion before the House today will receive bipartisan support, and rightly so. This an issue that we can all work together on to ensure that Australia plays its correct role on the international stage to have whales protected. I commend the motion to the House.

24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL WHALING,Is the motion seconded? Mr Chynoweth-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,38
25,Mr NEHL,COMMERCIAL WHALING,"Cowper) (11.12 a.m.)Whaling is an abomination. It should be stopped totally throughout the world. It is for this reason that I strongly support the motion moved by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). The ban on whaling should certainly continue. The Japanese are currently the allowed to harvest some 300 minke whales annually in the Southern Ocean for so-called scientific purposes. It is interesting that most of those whales end up on Japanese dinner plates. So much for scientific research! One of the great memories of my life is . voyaging across the Southern Ocean to and from Antarctica with minke whales swimming alongside the ship. That was a great experience. On the way back from Mawson a couple of years ago, we saw an enormous pod of killer whales off the side of the ship. They were blowing as they travelled through the great Southern Ocean. These are magnificent animals. Another wonderful experience I have had was on the breakwater of the harbour at Coffs Harbour, where I live, where a humpback whale was travelling past, just a few metres away. Experiences like these make me believe that the ban should be enforced. Japan should stop whaling for minke whales and, certainly, Iceland and Norway should refrain from getting back into the act. Whales in the Southern Ocean are only just starting to recover after coming close to extinction earlier this century and last century. It will be 40 or 50 years before whale numbers are restored to those of pre-whaling days. It is alleged that there are 750,000 minke whales in the Southern Ocean. As the honourable member for Oxley said, it is very difficult to estimate how many there are. Nobody really knows. In case anyone thinks that 750,000 minke whales is a lot, in Australia there are l39 million sheep and 23.6 million cattle. That gives some idea of the size of the population. If those 750,000 minke whales were spread around the oceans of the world, that would not be a very large population at all. The estimate is that there are only 10,000 humpback whales in the world. Those whales migrate north from the Southern Ocean in winter. There are 10,000 to 12,000 finwhales, and no-one is sure of the number of blue whales, although the estimate is that there are about 14,000 worldwide. Those are really very small numbers. I would like to place a little bit of emphasis on the humpbacks, because each year now about 2,000 humpback whales travel up and down the east coast of Australia. I mentioned Coffs Harbour. They pass, normally, within three kilometres of where I live and one has the occasional opportunity, on one of the headlands or down on the breakwater, of seeing a whale go past very close-one of the great experiences of anybody's life. They feed in the Southern Ocean in summer and migrate north during winter, close to shore, to breed. Research by the University of Sydney shows that the rate of population increase for humpbacks in the Southern Ocean has been about 10 to 12 per cent since the 1980s. Before intensive whaling began in the 1950s, we had a population of 15,000 to 20,000 humpbacks along the east coast. When it stopped in 1963, there were only 200 left. That demonstrates quite clearly the value of having a total ban, as the numbers have come up. There were 200 to 300 in 1980 and it is now approaching 2,000, but that is still only 10 per cent of the original humpback whale population along the east coast of Australia. When we look at this further, right around the world, we find even more cause for concern. The southern right whales feed in Antarctic waters and breed off the Tasmanian coast. They do not follow a particular path, so it is very difficult to know exactly how many there are. They seem to be increasing but the estimates are that there are only 3,000 left in the southern oceans and only 1,000 in the north Atlantic. Again this emphasises the need for a total ban on whaling. When they have been heavily exploited-even last century, let alone this century-they have been very slow to recover. Perhaps one of the reasons for the slow recovery is that southern right whales breed more slowly than humpbacks, which breed every second year. The southern right whales breed only every third to fourth year. Another difficulty is that, while the perpetrators are unknown, there is some illegal killing of right whales. Blue whales were down to one per cent of their population when whaling finished. Humpbacks are doing well, the fins and blues are increasing, but the numbers are still very small. Humpback populations were reduced to one per cent of original numbers and are still only 10 per cent of what they had been. .It is not a commercial proposition to start whaling again. We know that Japan wants to extend it; we know that Norway wants to get back into it; we know that Iceland wants to get back into it. If whaling were to recommence, the numbers would be reduced almost to zero. Fortunately, right around the world, in most countries, the public perception of whaling has changed. It is an inhuman way of dealing with our fellow creatures. If we stop and look at the products that come from whales, we realise that there is now no need whatsoever to kill them for products. The whole perception has changed. There are plenty of alternatives to the products that used to come from them but one of the major problems we still have is that our Japanese friends like to eat them. They consider them a delicacy and a very desirable type of food. I would just like to take this opportunity suggest to Iceland and Norway that they should abandon their plans to come to the southern oceans and get stuck into whaling in our waters and in the waters around Antarctica. I strongly support the proposition for a whale sanctuary in waters south of 40 degrees south latitude and I urge all honourabJe members of this House to support that proposition fully. It is very important that we impose that sanctuary. The whales of the world are an asset for the whole of the world and they are beautiful creatures. They should be protected against exploitation. On that question of protection against exploitation, I want to briefly mention the whale watching industry. As I have already made clear, I certainly enjoy participating in whale watching, but we have to be very careful that this does not damage the whales. I note that the Queensland government is taking some steps to introduce some controls on whale watching. I think all state and territory governments in Australia should do the very same thing. While I would not want to deprive anybody of that wonderful experience of being close to a whale, it has to be done in a very careful and very sensitive manner. Any society that condones whaling should be condemned. It is a dreadfully cruel way of dealing with animals. Finally, I note that, in a closing speech to the International Whaling Commission, the Japanese delegate, Kazuo Shima, expressed strong displeasure with the persistent manoeuvring of anti-whaling nations to get a permanent worldwide ban on whaling. Shima, as deputy director of the fisheries agency, that Japan has been frustrated over the antiwhaling campaign and that its patience is being exhausted. I would like to say to Japan in general, and to their whaling industry in particular, that we express strong displeasure at Japan's continued killing of minke whales. We are frustrated at Japan's continued whaling, and our patience with Japan is exhausted. Whaling is an abomination and it should be stopped.",38
26,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMERCIAL WHALING,"I think this debate is very timely and topical. When I look around the galleries I see to that they are full of young people. It is these young people who will have to pressure the Japanese. To all of those young people in the galleries I say: fire off a letter to the Japanese embassy here in Australia and get things moving. I certainly agree with everything that has been said. Being one of the very few people who has had the opportunity to go to Antarctica and see the beauty of the whales, and the other creatures down there, I find it very pleasing to be able to speak on this issue. Many years ago I read a book called Whale Nation, written by Heathcote Williams. It explained how the world was sort of settled and how it was explored by our forebears, if you like, when looking for whales. It was one of the ways that South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and South America were opened up. It is a very interesting book. For those young people interested, if it is in the school library, get a copy of it and have a read. It is very important for everyone to read it. When I went to Antarctica I saw hundreds of minke whales and killer whales. However, in the seven weeks that I was down there, and while travelling to and from Antarctica, I did not see one southern right whale or one humpback whale. I saw a most striking sight when we flew into Mawson base. Off Mawson base, there was solid ice 30 miles out to sea. As we flew over it by helicopter, the ice actually cracked open so that it was like a river of clear water in between two huge sheets of ice. We saw a family of whales going up this river. They were going slowly in and out of the water. It is a sight that will said stay with me for the rest of my life. It was very impressi ve. We are talking now about the tourist potential of whaling. I was in Bundaberg recently, and I saw that the tourist operators there have put out quite a good brochure on whale watching. There is a huge industry in whale watching. On the New England coast of the United States, 1.5 million whale watchers annually are said to yield about $23 million in tourist revenue. There is not much money in eating them or killing them for so-called scientific purposes, but there is a lot in getting people to look at these very beautiful animals. There were nine nations whaling in 1980 and now there is one nation, Japan. However, I believe that Norway is starting again. Japan kills about 300 minke whales for so-called scientific work. We all know that that is just a complete lie. Norway has also started whaling again for so-called scientific work, so they will be joining the Japanese. France proposed a whale sanctuary, which was supported quite strongly by Australia. Our minister, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), said it was consistent with the view of most Australians that killing whales was repugnant and that therefore we should support this whale sanctuary. The minister is quite correct: it is repugnant and it is something that I would not have thought the Japanese would do. They have killed about 300 whales a year over five years, despite lots of protests. It has been estimated that the cost of killing these whales and processing them is about $16 million> However, whale meat can be purchased in Japan for hundreds of dollars per kilogram. I am certain that many dollars of profit are made out of this slaughter of this most beautiful of creatures. I have heard the noise that they make, I have seen them, and they certainly leave a lasting impression. I spoke to my daughter last night about this. I said I was going to talk about whales and she said, 'Why do we have to hunt and kill an animal to the verge of extinction? What is the matter with humans?'. I hope that this pressure that Australia puts on Japan and Norway and other nations that are looking to do this slaughter has some effect. I know that the resolution at the international whaling conference regarding a sanctuary was not passed but I believe Japan offered foreign aid to many nations which actually voted with them on this matter, and that, once again, is wrong and is bribery.  support this motion. Fifteen years ago Malcolm Fraser, the then Prime Minister, spoke for many when he said, 'Thousands of Ausof money tralians and men, women and children throughout the world have long felt deep concern about the activities of whalers'. He used those words when he established the inquiry that led to the abolition of whaling in Australia. Whales are not simply fish, they are mammals, and in many ways show a rare affinity and kinship with human species. Whales, and the related cetacea species of dolphins and porpoises, figure in the myths and legends of many races. In Japan,' Buddhist temples in some fishing communities erect tablets to the souls of the whales, and yet Japan hunts whales, and Norway and Iceland want to hunt these creatures. The Japanese have sought to overturn the International Whaling Qommission's moratorium on commercial kills. They exploit scientific whaling loopholes to slaughter these creatures and sell for hundreds of dollars per kilo the bright red, fat-marbled meat to Japanese diners, who consider it a delicacy. Some Japanese claim Western cultural imperialism, disguised as environmentalism, is destroying their traditional food culture. However, as the British Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society estimates that 19,000 people went whale watching in Japan last year, raising about £5 million of revenue, it appears that in 1993 more Japanese would rather watch whales than eat them. Japan claims the increasing number of minke whales inhibits the numbers of other whale species, but there is no proof of this. The increase is a testament to the success of the international whaling ban. The Norwegians are yet to accept it. Last year, Thorvald Stoltenberg, the then foreign minister, described minke whales as 'rats of the sea' which 'take fish from fishermen and from the whale species that are threatened', a view repeated by the fisheries minister, Jan Olsen, when he announced that Norway would kill between 300 and 800 minke whales in 1993. In 1993 there is no need for whale products. It has been clear since the end of the 1970s that substitutes exist. The vast majority of Australians believe whaling is cruel and unnecessary. The coalition parties, like the government, believe that commercial whaling is unacceptable. We support the French proposals for a whale sanctuary south of 40 degrees south latitude, and we do so proud of our own record. In 1962 the Menzies government representative at the Stockholm conference on the human environment supported a lO-year moratorium on the taking of whales. In 1978 Malcolm Fraser established the Frost inquiry into whales and whaling. His government subsequently introduced the Whale Protection Act, banning whaling in Australia's territorial waters in 1980. The Frost report urged the extension of the International Whaling Commission to cover the conservation of all cetacea. Frost recommended that Australia continue to be a member of the commission while observing: If the IWC had adopted a more prudent approach earlier in its history, whale stocks might now been sufficiently larger. As it is they have been excessively depleted. We must make sure that the commission now remains steadfast in its opposition to whaling and is never slow to react again. Today the IWC is well suited to investigating and monitoring the impact of whale watching and may even help countries such as Norway and Japan wake up to the value of whales. A British government study estimated that whale watching generated an income of £185 million worldwide in 1991. Whalers camped in my state of South Australia years before the first official settlers came. Now around 70,000 people visit the old whale base of Victor Harbour each winter in the hope of spotting one of these magnificent creatures. In 1993 we rejoice that once again we can see them off our beaches. Sir Sydney Frost wrote: Australia should oppose the continuance of whaling, both within Australia and also abroad. Whales are migratory animals and are the heritage of all nations. We have a national and international responsibility to preserve them for future generations. I support the motion.",40
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL WHALING,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA,42
28,Mr LANGMORE,EXECUTIVE PAY,"I move: That this House: (1) deplores the excessive and irresponsible increases in executive pay in recent years; . (2) calls on executives to adopt more restraint, in the interests of an equitable approach to controlling inflation and expanding employment; and (3) urges the Government to adopt policies which would penalise increases in executive pay faster than the growth of average weekly earnings. During the last 10 years one of the distinguishing features of the Australian economy has been wage restraint. That is very striking have because that 10 years covered the period of the accord-the period when there was close consultation between government and unions and business. That contributed enormously to the growth of employment that occurred during the 1980s. It was that wage restraint and the decline in real unit labour costs which was the principal contributing factor to the growth of employment that occurred in the period 1983 to 1989. It was also one of the very important contributing factors to the decline in the rate of inflation. We now of course have a very low inflation rate. It has been historically low during the last 30 years. That has been, in tum, the central feature for the improvement in Australia's competitiveness. Australia's competitiveness has improved by about 30 per cent during the last 10 years. That improvement has also been due to the decline in interest rates and the improvement in the exchange rate that followed that. But at the same time as we have had that quite remarkable level of wage restraint, we have had a high level of executive income growth. During the last 10 years award wages increased by about 56 per cent; average weekly earnings went up by 74 per cent; and the innation rate went up by 74 per cent-exactly the same increase as for average weekly earnings. But executive pay went up by 133 per cent. We had the best paid people in the community increasing their pay by more than twice as much as people on average weekly earnings. That is clearly unjust. In Australia we regard ourselves as being an egalitarian society, but executives have been, using their positions quite improperly, in terms of the impact on the distribution of income and in terms of the interests of the economy, to increase their own personal pay in ways quite out of line with those that were being experienced by the rest of the work force. In case it be thought that that was simply happening in the 1980s and that it had not happened during the recession, I point out that during the two years from June 1991 to June 1993 executive pay went up by 10 per cent while average weekly - earnings went up by just under seven per cent and award wages by even less. Again, during the depths of the recession, executives have been increasing their pay about twice as fast as wages have increased. That is very damaging, for two central reasons. It is quite unfair and it sends the wrong signals to the rest of the work force. is essential that there be general income restraint if we want employment to grow strongly again, but it is quite unreasonable expect wage earners to be restrained about their incomes, to accept increases that are only at the level of productivity and innation, while executives are increasing their pay by twice as much. That is not the only damage. Those executives are receiving enormous salaries. The average pay for chief executive officers of large companies is now about $350,000 a year. Many are getting closer to $1 million, but the average is about $350,000, which is more than 10 times average weekly earnings. That is one of the reasons why employment has not grown more strongly. If people at the top are getting very large pay increases and very large pay packets, there is less money available to employ additional people. There is a direct trade-off between the pay of senior executives and the number of people that those companies can employ. So it is very important that their pay be restrained, not only for demonstration reasons but also so that they are making a more direct contribution to growth of employment. There has been quite strong shareholder reaction against this situation. It is now an issue that is commonly raised at annual meetings of companies. There has been a lot of criticism of some of the larger increases in pay packets recently; for instance, for the chief executive officer of Westpac, for the chief executive officer of the AMP, and for numbers of others as well. I do not doubt that that strength of criticism amongst shareholders will increase. Members of the opposition might well argue that that would be enough and that it is not an appropriate issue for a government to involve itself in. But, for exactly the same reasons that they have to be concerned about wages, governments-have to be concerned about high levels of pay as well. Unless there is a generalised system of income restraint, it is impossible to argue for wage restraint. It is quite unfair for executives to be, in effect, abusing their powers and at the same time publicly arguing for restraint of wages. It is simply hypocritical. So it is very It important that they be demonstrating some restraint as well as expecting restraint from employees. There are ways in which there to could be indirect government intervention which would be effective. It is quite important for government leaders to use moral pressure to urge executives to restrain their pay but, as well as that, it would be quite feasible for the government to change the tax system so as to provide a strong incentive",42
29,Mr CADMAN,EXECUTIVE PAY,You have done the opposite in the budget.,43
30,Mr LANGMORE,EXECUTIVE PAY,"The government has not done anything about this issue except extend the fringe benefits tax, and that is a progressive measure, I am glad to say. What it could do is what President Clinton has done in the United States, and that is, in the collection of corporate tax, to remove the deductibility of executive salaries above some level as a cost of production. This is the way that would work: if it set an upper limit of, say, $150,000 or $200,000 as a reasonable top income level for senior executives, it would refuse executive salaries above that level as a cost of production in the calculation of corporate income tax, and that would put pressure on companies to restrain the incomes of their senior executives. The limit that has been set in the United States, I have to say, is a million dollars but, fortunately, we do not have many executives being paid at that level here. We do not have many companies that are the same size as those in the United States. Obviously, our senior executives are paid less, largely because the companies that they are managing are much smaller. I think it would be entirely appropriate for the government to adopt a policy like that not only to put moral pressure for restraint on senior executive pay packages but also to provide a direct tax incentive to restrain that pay. Without that restraint, it will not be morally feasible to expect members of the labour force to restrain their pay. That restraint, as I began by saying, has been quite remarkable during the last 10 years but it will not remain so in a decentralised system which relies on enterprise bargaining, unless there generalised income restraint. That is a necessary condition for growth of employment, for keeping the inflation rate down. I strongly urge the House to support this motion.",43
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXECUTIVE PAY,Is the motion seconded? Mr Tanner-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,44
32,Mr CADMAN,EXECUTIVE PAY,"I can understand the concerns of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) but the facts are quite different from what he stated. I will clearly demonstrate that over the last two years chief executive officers,executives of all types, have shown commendable wage restraint. I refer honourable members to an article in the Australian in February this year headed 'Tough times put damper on executive remuneration'. In that article, there ence to a study made by Cullen Egan Dell of all executives in Australia; That study indicates that the average increase for executive salaries over the calendar year 1992 was 3.2 per cent. AWE-average weekly earningsfor that period rose by 3.1 per cent. Therefore, the honourable member's concerns, I believe, are probably two years out of date. I am not being selective in picking out chief executive officers. If one refers to senior management, finance and administration, information technology, human resources, engineering and science, marketing and sales, production and supply, one will find that the average increase for 1992 was 3.1 per cent, exactly the same increase as for average weekly earnings. Mr Langmore-That is not so.",44
33,Mr CADMAN,EXECUTIVE PAY,"The honourable member for Fraser has to come forward with something better than the lO-year average that he has been quoting up to date. In looking at restraint we can go beyond 1992 to the prediction by Noble, Loundes, Cullen, Egan and Dell that in 1993 salaries for CEOs and for the range of top managers that I have outlined will increase by an average of 3.3 per cent and average weekly earnings will go up by 3.2 per cent. The honourable member for Fraser quite is fallaciously argued that there was a need for restraint. He said that he deplores irresponsibility and excessive increases in executive salaries. The fact is that such increases have not occurred over the last two years. I do not think anybody in this House would endorse greed or extraordinary claims for remuneration. Over the last two years the fact of the matter is that restraint has been shown, and one can use the whole scale of averages to prove that. There may be exceptional casesand the honourable member nominated one or two of those. The base salary in the executive service has become more and more related to performance; the requirement has become to deliver results or lose the job. The packages are not related to irrelevant factors such as some unjustified notion of who may be the best person to head an organisation. The packages is refer- are related to performance. Australia is leading the world in this regard. Over half the executive packages do relate to performance. I would have thought the honourable member for Fraser would have studied these matters before bringing them into the House and making exaggerated claims about excessive and irresponsible increases. The supporting information is not there. The training and development factors that were the key to executive packages previously have been replaced by performance management requirements. The larger firms are concentrating on things such as benchmarking and best practice in their selection of chief executive officers and they are implementing share plans as part of the payment packages. I would have thought the honourable member would be· endorsing those sorts of things, because his government consistently talks about the need for Australia to be globally placed and globally effective. The smaller firms, in payments and rewards for their chief executive officers and the executive managers, are concentrating on quality management and quality management techniques in their selection of senior staff. The honourable member for Fraser calls this process excessive and irresponsible. I would have thought that the restraint of an average of about 3.1 or 3.2 over the last two years was responsible. I do not think it is excessive. The types of requirements in packages are a responsible requirement, heading towards the type of nation that we want to see. All of these increases are exactly the same as the award increases and I do not understand the honourable member's argument. He calls for more restraint and yet his government's budget this year will kick inflation along from one per cent to 3.5 per cent. Inflationary factors are part of his motion, yet his own government is trebling the inflationary factors within Australia. One has only to refer to the budget papers to establish that. There is an inflationary factor built in by the very notion and philosophy of the honourable member's government, and his Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) used those words when introducing the budget. The prospect of expanding employment is another part of the motion. It seems to me that what the honourable member for Fraser is really arguing is that, if we take a salary of $350,000 and divide it by 10, we can employ 10 more people and sack the chief executive officer. I do not know that any organisation would agree. Even the Australian government would hardly say, 'We will get rid of the Prime Minister and we will have another 10 members of parliament instead of him'. That does not make sense. It does not make sense to sack the boss of West pac or of AMP and employ another 10 middle managers. That is not what Australia needs to be about. It is a spurious argument. That an increase of 10 people in an organisation the size of Westpac or the AMP would solve the employment problems is a crazy proposition. It has no basis in fact. Surely the honourable member is not seriously advancing that argument, but he seems to say that these extraordinarily high salaries should be dispensed with and, if we do that, it will improve the employment factors. Looking at the management levels within the private and public sector, coming down from the executive levels, it is very interesting to notice that, before tax payments in the private sector during 1992, the average private sector income for managers was $752 a week but in the public sector, for the same sort of person, the payment was $1,002 a week. So the Public Service is setting the pace in that management area. I refer honourable members to the ABS charts,· where they can pick out for themselves where the management scales favour the public sector. After tax, one only has to look at the ·private sector for that same group of people to find that the private sector after tax income for management is $544.50 and for the public sector, $675. The public sector is leading the way in the management area. If there is a call for restraint, maybe the honourable member for Fraser should have a look at some of the salaries received by his own constituents to see whether or not they are way ahead of what the private sector can afford to pay. In those management areas of the private sector, the actual take-home pay has fallen since 1990, whereas it has increased in the public sector. One may look at the figures in the ABS charts. One can have inflation adjusted over the period from 1992 right back to 1978. The charts are very clear. The honourable member also put the proposition that there should be some sort of penalties instigated by government. That is again saying that the budget does not realIy stand up to close scrutiny because, on close examination, it is a regressive budget. It does impact more on the low income earner than on the high income earner. The big gainers of this budget are high income earners. The tax scales, the wholesale sales tax, the petrol the excise on cigarettes and all the other measures that have been included impact on the low income earner far more than on the high incomeeatner. The high income earner is the big beneficiary. So it is another spurious argument to be suggesting penalties. Why do honourable members opposite not just adopt a principled approach as a government? A principled approach as a government is what is needed. If you look at the scale of international salary packages available, according to a publication of Towers Perrin, which is an int-rnationalIy recognised organisation, Austraha pays one of the lowest rates, scoring 19 out of 20 and 18 out of 20. In every instance, across a whole range of countries, Australia has one of the lowest rates for chief executive officers. If we are serious about getting into - n international market-and Westpac, for Instance, is one of the top 100 banks of the world-we are looking for one person in 100 worldwide. That is an international market, so are we going to deny the prospect of our becoming international by the way in which we approach these matters? That is the falseness and the craziness of the argument being presented today. (TIme expired) . Mr TANNER (Melbourne) (11.52 a.m.)-It IS good to see the newly emerging representatives of the lower paid and underprivileged in our society reverting to type in this discussion and defending the sometimes outrageous salaries that are paid to higher managerial people in this community. I would like to quote some facts to rebut some of the suggestions that have been made by the honourable member for MitchelI (Mr Cadman). The Cullen, Egan and Dell survey-and maybe he has misread the figuresshows that from 1983 to 1993 senior management earnings increased by 132 per cent, compared with average weekly earnings which increased by 74 per cent. From June 1991 to June 1993 senior management earnings increased by 10 per cent, whereas average weekly earnings increased by 6.9 per cent; from June 1992 to June 1993 senior management earnings increased by 3.9 per cent as compared with average weekly earntax, ings which increased by 2.6 per cent. So I suggest that that puts paid to some of the suggestions that the honourable member was making. It is also worth mentioning that the suggestions that he made with respect to comparisons between the public sector and the private sector would probably bear slightly closer examination. I could introduce the honourable member to private sector workers who bear the title 'manager', particularly in the Coles Myer organisation, who spend most of their time putting items on shelves and who get paid an awful lot less than $750 per week. I have no doubt that people such as those have been included in the statistics which he quotes. I would suggest to him that the base of those statistics would bear some close scrutiny and that a completely false outcome has been indicated by him in suggesting that managers in the public sector are more highly paid. As the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has indicated, over the past 10 years or so we have seen managerial salaries, particularly at the higher level, increase in the order of 11 per cent per annum. We now have an average of $350,000 per year, which is roughly 10 times average weekly earnings. To some extent, market forces across the Western world are fuelling this and, to this extent, I do agree with the honourable member for Mitchell that there is a broader international market at play here. That does not mean that we have to sit back, simply accept it and say, 'Good stuff! We want American wages for our senior executives and sweatshop South East Asian wages for our workers', which seems to be the implicit position of the Liberal Party on this issue. We also have a question of management power vis-a-vis the shareholders. It seems to be .a phenomenon across the world that, whatever sort of political system you have, those in power always manage to find a pretty good excuse to pay themselves fairly well. The fact is that the relative gap between the people at the top and the workers is widening and that major firms now say that wage costs are no longer a substantial problem in their competitiveness, in their ability to innovate and in their ability to generate new workplace reform. We have extraordinary situations such as major banks with enormous bad debt burdens from decisions made in the 1980s. Those burdens have left the shareholders with an extreme problem, but the banks are rewarding their senior executives with substantial pay increases. So although it is true that the performance pay has become more widespread· than in the past, there are plenty of instances of senior management in this country being rewarded for pretty ordinary performance. I have been a union official who has had a presence in many different companies and many different industries, and it is very instructive to see from the inside what happens in a lot of these companies. It is very interesting to see the contrasts. We often see gravy train merchants in management in Australian companies. They are sitting comfortably on $80;000 to $100,000 a year, with a car and various other perks. They are not innovating; they are simply swimming with the tide and having a good time. Often they are far too many in number and poorly trained: people who are simply bludging on the system. Then there are good companies. There are plenty of managers in companies who do make a very substantial contribution: people who are not on $1 million a year; people who are innovating; people who are making a major contribution. All too few of our companies in this country have top quality management, and it has got nothing to do with the level of remuneration that is being paid. In many instances it is excessive, as has been outlined by the honourable member for Fraser. I do not accept the notion that we will have an enormous brain drain if we get to a situation where our salaries for managers are substantially lower than other countries. The major problem that we need to address if we are worried about the quality of our management in this country is not the amount that managers are paid, it is the fact that most young people do not aspire to managerial positions. The best talent in our country is still heading to the professions-heading to what are ultimately unproductive activities such as the legal profession and things of that nature, and not aspiring to be managers. If the opposition is interested in improving the quality of managerial performance in this country, it could well be tackling the issue of management education, to get a better level of manager in Australia.

34,Ms MOYLAN,EXECUTIVE PAY,"This motion, replete with high-sounding sentiment, is short on reality. It is designed to give a warm inner glow to the true believers as they pay the price of the re-election of this government. On two levels, this motion parts company not only with economic sense but with the facts. It fails to recognise that private enterprise can only function if risk takers are attracted, ret.ained and rewarded. It also ignores the truth that under this Labor government the salaries of the whole range of managers and executives in the private sector have lagged well behind those of their public sector counterparts. Let me acquaint this government with the facts. During last year, senior executive salaries rose by 3.1 per cent while award wages rose by 3.2 per cent. Furthermore, executive research consultants have warned that Australian executives could earn up to 25 per cent more if they moved overseas. While Australia is in urgent need of leadership at all levels we are losing our managers, our engineers, our architects and other professionals to our nearest trading competitors: Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. This government appears unaware of the simple truth that life at the top of the corporate ladder is no sinecure. Those relatively few executives on massive salaries simply do not stay there for many years to enjoy them. The trend among corporate heads is for a shorter tenure, as they rise or fall on their their company's performance. Australian shareholders are astute, and capable of determining the value of those executives who earn profits for their company and for Australia. Once performance begins to slacken, redundancy beckons. Companies and their shareholders make business decisions. It is an experience remote from those like the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) who were nurtured in the bosom of the public sector. If this government were so stupid and irresponsible as to carry out the threat in the motion to penalise executive salary increases, we could look forward to an exodus of business talent coinciding with any recovery. When it comes to the real world of payment of all adult managerial employees under this Labor government, the facts tell their own story. Since ABS comparisons have been available-since 1986-the average remuneration in the public sector has consistently exceeded that of the private sector. In 1986 the comparisons were $741 and $516 a week respectively. In 1992 the public sector led the private sector by 25 per cent. Equally significant is the fact that, when recession hit after 1991, average increases in the private sector slowed to 2.5 per cent, then declined marginally. The public sector under this government has, however, been exempt from basic economic responsibility, with increases of 6.5 per cent in 1991 and 4.3 per cent in 1992. Where is the equity, and where are the Labor protests? Labor is not complaining about the 47 holders of public offices who, according to the Remuneration Tribunal, have salaries exceeding $100,000 per annum. It is not going to complain about such prime ministerial consultants as Dr Watson, given $87,000 a year by the Australian taxpayers to rewrite our history. Managerial salaries by industry group show that, out of 22 categories, two of the top ·five are public utilities and general public adminisThe tration. Only the resource sector, which creates so much national wealth, has a higher average executive and managerial salaries. There can be no greater hypocrisy for the Labor members than to accuse private indusor tries of adding to inflation. This government is at the forefront of creating inflationary policies. As the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) has already pointed out, the government's budget is inflationary in itself. The government has hit the wine industry with a 55 per cent tax hike, levied fueJ tax on the transport industry, and increased sales tax and government charges; and they can rise by anything up to 300 per cent. When is this government going to stop business bashing and realise that the leaders in the business community contribute real muscle, real sweat, real determination and real profits to carve out a future for themselves and for many other Australians?",47
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXECUTIVE PAY,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading,48
36,Mr HAWKER,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 to repeal that part which is covered by the Australian Design Rule 19/01, which deals with hard wiring of the lights on motorcycles when the engine is started. This ADR came in in March last year and applies to all new motorbikes sold from that time onwards. The reason for this bill is that the 'lights on' is not a major part of improving road safety or, indeed, motorcycle safety; and I will give six reasons why I believe that this should be repealed. The first is a lack of conclusive and compelling evidence to show that in fact there is any major benefit to motorcycle safety and motorcycle rider safety. second is the lack of proper consultation between users and the government. The third is that having compulsory lights on removes all rider discretion in regard to the use of a light. The fourth is that there are problems with determining accident liability for insurance purposes. The fifth is the stupidity of compulsory lights on for off-road use for bikes such as agricultural bikes which can be registered. The sixth is that it is an excuse for a government to avoid addressing wider safety issues with proper emphasis, particularly education and training for all drivers. On the first point of evidence, we have heard some very emotive and irrational sort of language from some members of the government in trying to explain and continue their argument as to why this hasty and iIIconsidered decision was taken in the first place. In fact, during a Senate committee hearing last year, Senator Collins said that any motorcyclist who does not tum his lights on is a mug and that there is nothing like picking up a crash helmet with a head inside it. I am sure he is right, but that is not the point. It is the rider who should be making the decision on whether or not to have the light on. Road safety is of vital importance and we all support moves to make motorcycle riding more safe, but the compulsory lights on is not the way to go. Better education and training of all road users, drivers and riders, will reduce accidents and reduce the road toll-not measures that were dreamed up in a minister's bunker, out of touch with reality. The government introduced this regulation without proper consultation, particularly with those on whom it impacts. The simple fact remains that the government cannot produce any Australian or overseas research which provides conclusive evidence that compulsory daytime lights on adds to road safety-no conclusive evidence that this will save lives. In fact, last year's inquiry into motorcycle safety in Victoria conducted by the social development committee, one which the then minister chose to ignore, in part recommended that: The Minister for Transport advise the Federal Government of the possible dangers inherent in specifying daytime running lights for motorcycles be hard-wired, and requests theythat is, the federal governmentdelay implementation of Australian Design Rule 19/01 until the report of the International Committee on Daytime Running Lights is available and its implications for Australia are examined. The social development committee further recommended that: The Minister for Transport advise the Federal Government that the light specifications included in Australian Design Rule 19/01 are inappropriate for Australian conditions. The committee's concluding recommendation was that: The use of daytime running lights for motorcycles remains voluntary. There is some Australian evidence-some compelling evidence, I would suggest-that shows that the government has got it wrong. If we look at the situation overseas, Italy recently reaffirmed legislation which allows the daytime use of lights for emergency vehicles and in adverse weather conditions. It does not, as I incorrectly stated last week, ban the daytime use of lights on all vehicles. The social development committee from the Victorian parliament concluded that overseas research was inconclusive at best but expressed its concerns that: There is no difference in the proportions of drivers involved in motorcycle-car and car-car accidents who fail to see the other vehicle. The report continued: Further, the positive effects of daytime running lights on detection distance and time, noticeability and gap acceptance or risk taking behaviour are genenilly greater for vehicles other than motorcycles. It went on to state: There is no justification for motorcycles only to have compulsory daytime running lights-and there has been no suggestion that all vehiclesthat is, cars and trucks and everything elseshould have compulsory daytime running lights. They are fairly strong statements, I would suggest, and ones that show quite strongly that there is no compelling evidence for compulsory lights on. Furthermore, the chairman of that parliamentary inquiry into motorcycle safety wrote in its May report: . . . it is estimated that in more than 60% of motorcycle casualty accidents . . . the fault with the car driver-not with the motorcycle rider. In other words, when we are looking at motorcycle safety the whole emphasis is being misdirected. Not only is there a lack of evidence for compulsory daytime lights on, but there is also strong evidence that the government's efforts to improve motorcycle safety are sadly misplaced. This leads me to a second point of consultation. Talk to experienced riders, talk to motorcycle rider instructors and they will all say the same thing: had they been consulted properly, and had they been listened to, the government would never have got into this position in the first place. Those people know the importance of being able to make a choice of turning on a light. I think it is simple common sense. What about a flasher light? Why do the emergency vehicles-the police, the fire brigade, the ambulance or aeroplanes-have flashing lights if there is not some sense in being able to turn the light on and off? Whatever way one looks at it, a bit of common sense will very quickly explain why they can do that; it is because it is a much more powerful way of drawing attention to their presence. It is interesting that when we talk about the other problem with lights on-the difficulty of judging speed and distance from an oncoming vehicle-the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is even quoted in Australian Motorcycle News in September 1992 as saying: The only claim which may have some validity is that the perception of distances could be slightly distorted. I would suggest that is a very major factor. If one looks at the reports that are collected after some of the accidents involving a car and a motorcycle one will often hear the drivers of the cars saying that they misjudged the distance between their vehicle and the motorcycle, particularly where the light was on. Clearly, in those cases it can have very serious consequences. I believe that this legislation provides an opportunity for the new Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) to repeal this design rule and correct a previous mistake. That lies brings me to the next point. By compulsorily having lights on there is an additional risk of the rider being imbued with a sense of false security. By taking the discretion away from the rider, we are taking away another opportunity for the rider to attract attention by flashing the lights. There are some other points that I will touch on very briefly. One is the question.of liability for an accident. If a motorcycle'S headlight is smashed in an accident, it is pretty hard to prove whether or not the light was on prior to that accident. Obviously, there could be claims and counterclaims, particularly if a globe had blown just prior to the accident. I have mentioned a number of times the nonsense about agricultural and off-road bikes which can be registered. They also now have to have the light wired 'on. It may light up the lives of the cows to have the farmers going around with their lights on but I do not think it helps them produce any more milk. I believe it is time for the government to repeal this decision. That is why I have put this private member's bill before the parliament. As the social development committee in Victoria found, there is no difference in the proportion of drivers involved in motorcyclecar and car-car accidents who fail to see the other vehicle; in other words, this action is misdirected. When it comes to road safety, and particularly motorcycle safety, we should be directing our efforts in other areas-most importantly in improving driver education and driver training and increasing the awareness of drivers of their responsibilities-rather than to this misdirected decision.

37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Ronaldson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,50
38,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"The Motor Vehicle Standards Amendment Bill is one of the silliest issues of concern to private members ever to come before the parliament. It is not only silly but, because of the implications of it and the dangers to those people who would otherwise benefit from this initiative, it is downright stupid. I know that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), when he was the shadow minister for land transport, took the opportunity to endear himself to a relatively small proportion of the total motorcycling community, but the rest of them-the 70 per cent of them-who now voluntary ride with their lights on are the ones who understand the stupidity of this arrangement and the position he adopted. I really thought he would have let the matter drop by now. The Australian design rule has been in place since 1 March last year. All new motorcycles sold since that day are required to be hard wired so that, when the engine is running, either the headlight on low beam or special daytime running lights will automatically come on. I want to congratulate the Federal Office of Road Safety, Peter Makeham and all the fellows and the women over there who worked with him in connection with this matter. From a relatively small proportion of the motorcycling community they have put up with lies, they have put up with distortions, they have put up with abuse, they have put up with personal vilification, in an attempt on their part to introduce a major initiative to save motorcyclists' lives. It Was part of a package that I worked out with the Federal Office of Road Safety, when I was minister, to improve the circumstances of motorcyclists. Contrary to those claims that were made by the honourable member for Wannon-who knows that they were without foundationthat total package cost about $225,000. It was the first major package of proposals ever introduced by any minister or any government to assist motorcycling. Most of the motorcyclists recognise that. Of that amount, $200,000 was designed to improve public education and motorcycle awareness programs, precisely the sort of thing that the honourable member for Wannon said had not been taking place. Of course it has been. That money has been applied for those purposes. There was an additional motorcycle safety research program. As far as rider training was concerned, we had the video promotions, including the first set-the Right Rider series-that had been developed by the Federal Office of Road Safety and they have been distributed around Australia to assist with rider training. As well, there was the development and promotion of a training core syllabus, but this was simply one element of a whole package of proposals. I think that quite genuinely some of those people have misunderstood the implications. Some of that small proportion of motorcyclists who represent motorcycling interests have commercial interests in motorcycling. They have their own vocational interests and they have their own income that they make from it. We are all involved in politics and we know that if there are no issues being raised then organisations fall apart; people need to be kept interestedand concerned-if there are no problems, create them. To a very large extent, on the part of some of them-not people like Peter Mount or Hal Caston-obviously personal interests have been involved. This was also part of a major lO-point road safety package which had been made available to the states, and which we were able to encourage the states to adopt, together an initial $110 million for black spots that eventually became $270 million, to clean up and correct in excess of 4,000 death spots on total the Australian road network. That program was also important to motorcyclists, because those crash and injury and death sites are, of course, particular points of vulnerability for motorcyclists. There were many other elements of that lO-point package which were of most immediate and direct assistance to motorcyclists. The fundamental point is that when motorcyclists are more visible they are safer. What the honourable member for Wannon says about the absence of evidence is just nonsense. If that is the Victorian social development report that the honourable member is holding up, he knows that that was unscientific, he knows the composition of the committee, he knows that to a very large extent it was a political report, and he knows it was ambiguous and contradictory. The honourable member referred to one of the elements of that, but he did not refer to the fact that it also suggested that the brightness of the lights should be improved. The honourable member does not refer to that, he refers to that sillyMr Hawker-There should be a choice.",50
39,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"The honourable million. member for Wannon has made himself look two-thirds ridiculous, he should not compound it-it is not funny. This issue involves about 50 having serious injuries and six deaths every year for motorcyclists. The parents who rear their to about 18 years of age and then have them injured or their lives taken on motorcyclesresulting as the Minister for Transport and Communica- $24 million. tions (Senator Collins) quite correctly said because he was involved in those special emergency services in the Northern TerriStates, tory-do not appreciate the sort of nonsense the honourable member has been going on introduced with. For God's sake let it drop, and do be so stupid! Running lights make motorcyclists more conspicuous. I urge motorists out on the road to look in the rear vision mirror and see many times they see motorcyclists without their headlights on-very often they merge into the grey. Motorists will see them when the motorcyclists have their headlights on full or low beam, or have the special daytime running lights in use since 1 ,March last year. Lights help other road users to see motorbeen cycles because they make the bikes more conspicuous, and if others know the motorourselves cyclists are there they are more likely to respond, there will be fewer crashes and, if there are fewer crashes, there are fewer injuries and deaths. I am impatient about this issue because I was the minister responsible at the time. If the , cal. lives of six young Australians are saved each year, and if there are 50 serious injuries prevented each year, then that makes it very worthwhile. I will tell honourable members about the risks to motorcyclists: last year there were 200 killed and most of them were under 25 years of age. They are kids that parents have reared, they get out onto the road on motornot cycles and other vehicle drivers often do see them. There were 3,000 motorcyclists seriously injured-about one serious crash for every 100 registered motorcycles, for God's sake. The rate of road deaths of motorcyclists almost 20 times higher than that of motor car drivers. The annual cost to society is $800 day. The available research indicates that of all motorcyclists now voluntarily ride with their lights on. It also indicates that lights on for the other one-third would, as I said before, save about six lives a year kids and about 50 serious injuries. The medical costs, lost earnings and property damage from those crashes amount to about Such a move is consistent with overseas practice. Twenty-three states of the United and Canada, Scandinavia, and most of continental Europe have it; Malaysia has just it, and Japan is going to introduce not it. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) knows that Italy's ban on daytime lights just slipped through. We have had direct personal contact with the Italian authhow orities, who acknowledge that it was a mistake; it is going to be reversed. It was motorcyclists in Italy who complained against that particular proposal coming through. The Victorian social development committee referred to some 'possible dangers' of lights being kept on. Those dangers have all dismissed by research, by scientific analysis, and by studies which we undertook when I was minister. That committee did support the continued voluntary use of lights, in its recommendation No.7. It recommended that brighter daytime lights be used, in recommendation No. 1(b). Its findings were subjective and, to a very large extent, politiThe Queensland road safety division said, in a letter to us in 1990, that Queensland strongly supported this proposition, based on research evidence to date and also on the high crash rate of motorcyclists. I hope this now finishes the issue. We will save six lives a year, and we will stop 50 serious injuries. The sooner we drop this stupidity, the better. It is providing any votes out there in the not community, because the community knows just how stupid this .is.",52
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned is and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting ThursAUSTRALIAN ARMY BAND, PERTH",52
41,Mr FILING,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"I move: That this House: (1) deplores the decision of the federal governgravely ment to disband the Australian Army Band, Perth; and (2) calls on the government, in making any changes to Australian Defence Force band deployment, to retain a full-time band in Western Australia. It is with a great deal of sadness that I, my Western Australian colleagues-in particular, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron), who is herein the chamber today and who is seconding the motion-and my constituents learned of the federal government's plan to reorganise the Australian Anny bands: a move which would see most Australian Anny bands cut from 50 personnel to 34, and the Perth and Adelaide ones completely disbanded. In a media release announcing the changes, the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, claimed: The Australian public have enjoyed the music of the Australian Army bands over a long period of time and this will continue into the future. This is not true for Western Australians, who have enjoyed the music of Australian Anny Band Perth since its formation at the Swan Anny Barracks in December 1949, because in the near future there will be no regular band in Perth for them to enjoy, unless the government changes its mind. Western Australians have been told that the Reserve Band will fill the large shoes of the Regular Anny Band members. The reality of this is that, with other jobs and only the weekends to spare, the reservists will often have little time to rehearse as a full complement, let alone to provide the same support for military, regal and vice-regal functions, or to tour the state to perfonn for schools and charities. Understandably, the outcry in Western Australia has been long and loud, with many people claiming that eastern states based decision making has again robbed Western Australians of a fair deal. I have received a number of letters from band members, reserve band members and non-band members who, quite simply, have at one time or another been touched by the special magic of the band and are adamant that it should be retained. Additionally, I have been contacted by former servicemen, .musical directors and training officers who are all dismayed by the move and who have vowed to fight tooth and nail to save the Australian Anny Band Perth. All of these people are cynical about the argument that the removal of the band will represent a genuine cost saving to the' government or to the taxpayer, and many have argued that they are content for these tax dollars to be spent on such a worthy activity as the Australian Anny Band. It is almost certain that more effective cost savings might have been achieved by streamlining the provision of band services to avoid duplication where the bands operate in close proximity to each other. That makes far more sense than scrapping the Australian Army Band, Perth altogether. This would seem a particularly logical step to take in the eastern states, which are serviced by any bands at Wagga Wagga, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra as well as other bands from the navy and the air force, and by police force bands. But neither Perth nor Adelaide has such an overlap. There have also been important discussions taking place within the band as to alternatives which could be put to the minister for his urgent consideration, in the hope that the band can be saved in some shape or fonn. The band has just completed its yearly tour of the north-west of Western Australia-a tour which brings delight to many people in that region, whose access to live entertainment and music is restricted by the tyranny of distance. I note that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is in the chamber. That tour took place to areas within his electorate. It would be usual procedure for the entire complement of 34 members to make this journey, especially when it might well ha-e been their last tour together. However, on thiS occasion just 18 members travelled, in the hope that they could prove to the minister that the band could be cut in half and still survive. And survive they did. The complement of 18 members went on parade in Karratha, supported a memorial service in Port Hedland and performed numerous school and public concerts with the consummate style for which they are well renowned. Furthermore, I have been informed by former band commander Brian Underwood that the trial was met with approval from the commander of Fifth Military District, Brigadier Nolan, and Major-General Murray Blake, of Land Command. If money and the Australian Army Band, Perth-albeit with a reduced complement of 18 musicians-can be saved by dissolving duplication, including some reserve bands, . and overhauling the bands of administrative and command structures in other states, I would strongly urge the minister to do all within his power to consider these matters. He should not underestimate the importance of the civilian role of the band, which allows public to see their tax dollars at work. The sheer volume of work undertaken by the band-more than 250 engagements per year in metropolitan and country areas of the state-is testimony to its popularity and ensures that the band is one of the best oiled public relations machines that the Defence Force could wish to have. Furthermore, as well as the band playing an important community or civilian role, the traditions and symbols of the band enhance the morale and identity of Defence Force personnel. Any suggestions that the Australian Army Band, Melbourne will make periodic visits to the state are laughable. Western Australians have learned from experience that many musicians and bands find it difficult to make the long haul across the Nullarbor, due to the high cost of transporting instruments, equipment and personnel. The people of Perth are not consoled by the minister's advice that army bands will continue to play for a long time. The bands in the eastern states are too far away to have the same kind of impact on the lives of Western Australians as the Australian Army Band, Perth has had. (TIme expired)",53

43,Mr CAMPBELL,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS,"The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) deserve to be commended for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. It is an important matter, not just for Western Australia but for the whole of Australia. If any part of Australia is diminished the total is diminished, and this will certainly diminish the quality of life for people in remote Western Australia. It is not generally recognised that the Australian Army Band, Perth provides an extremely important cultural service and as a public relations tool it is far better than the dollars that the military spends in any other way. I do not think there is much point in prethe vailing upon the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) because basically the minister does not know and the minister does not care. It is a small item in a very busy schedule. The blame must be sheeted home to the army. If the army had the will for this band to survive it would survive. It is the attitude amongst senior ranks of the army that I believe should be severely criticised. There are, of course, exceptions-there will always be exceptions-but there is no doubt that it is the will within the army that is the main source of this embarrassment. It is nonsense for the honourable member for Moore to talk about bands travelling from the eastern states. Frankly, if there were more hours in the day, the band in Western Australia could use far more than it does. It is a lie to suggest that the need is going to be met by bringing bands from the eastern states. It is another example of the peculiar structure of this nation, where decisions are made.",54

45,Mr HALVERSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Casey) (12.30 p.m.)The electorate I am proud to represent in this House covers much of the magnificent Yarra Valley area on the outskirts of Melbourne, an area which is nationally and internationally recognised as having some of the most outstanding winegrowing areas in Australia. Those who can identify and appreciate fine wines readily acknowledge the outstanding and unique qualities of Yarra Valley vintages. The history of winegrowing in the Yarra Valley is as interesting as it is impressive. Whilst the Barossa Valley and Margaret River regions can lay claim to a viticultural history dating back to the 1840s, the Yarra Valley has an even older heritage: a heritage that has undoubtedly been enhanced and enriched by the fact that from their earliest beginnings Yarra Valley winemakers have pursued and maintained an uncompromising attitude toward quality. The first vines were planted in the Yarra Valley in 1837. By the 1860s, when the vineyards of north-east Victoria were just being established and the Coonawarra had not even been thought of, wines from Victoria's Yarra Valley were already winning awards overseas and had established an enviable reputation in Paris and Bordeaux, Brussels and London. At the Melbourne international exhibition in 1881 St Huberts, one of the Yarra Valley's earliest established vineyards, received the grand prize awarded by the Emperor of Germany for the most meritorious exhibit, judged against all industries and products on display. By the 1890s there were 45 winegrowers in the Yarra Valley, and almost 1,000 acres under vines. St Huberts was Australia's biggest vineyard, producing 360,000 litres of wine. But soon everything was to change. By 1921 the last of the nineteenth century Yarra Valley vineyards had ceased commercial production. Although many people believe the industry was wiped out by phylloxera, this was not in fact the case. The Yarra Valley has never had phylloxera. The problems were economic, and resulted from a change in consumer preferences, with the sweeter, heavier, warmer climate wines becoming increasingly popular, to the detriment of the cool climate wines produced in the Yarra Valley. Thousands of acres of vines were pulled out, and much of the land was used for grazing purposes. For the next 40 or so years the area which had produced some of the best wines in Australia produced some of the best milk instead. But the Yarra Valley, with its almost perfect balance of climate and soils, is a 'natural' when it comes to producing premium "" wines; and by the mid-1960s the industry was ' fast re-establishing itself. It has never looked back. There are now 82 vineyards and 37 wineries in the Yarra Valley. It is the most rapidly growing fine wine area in Australia. Over the past few years, Yarra Valley wines have won many major awards for premium the quality table wines, both in Australia and overseas. The winemakers of the Yarra Valley have a firmly established and well deserved reputation for producing classic wine styles such as cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. More recently, the valley has been highly acclaimed for it pinots, and is now recognised as 'the' pinot noir region in Australia. In the 1993 Royal Melbourne Show, a 1991 Yarra Valley pihot noir from the Tarrawarra Vineyard, Yarra Glen, won the Wine Society trophy for the best dry red table wine in open classes, and a 1991 reserve cabernet sauvignon from Oakridge Estate, Seville, was awarded the Wine Pr!,<ss Club of Victoria trophy for the best Victorian dry red table wine. In addition to these two very significant trophies, Yarra Valley wines won four gold, six silver and 20 bronze medals. It i- not only the Yarra Valley winemakers who win so many prestigious industry awards. The Victorian Wines Show vineyard of the year award has just been - ,Ilounced, and the winners are grape growers Jack and Val Murray and their son Andrew of"" Fernhill Vineyard, Coldstream. In the Yarra Valley we not only know how best to make the wine, but how best to grow the grapes. The Yarra Valley region produces only premium quality table wines. The winegrowers of the Yarra Valley do not produce cheap wine or fortified wine, and could not even if they wanted to. The good Lord saw to that when he ordained the climatic conditions for the region. This is the major reason why the Yarra Valley will be hit harder than most other wine producing regions by this unfair, unreasonable and unacceptable hike in sales tax. The increase will have a greater impact on the price of premium wines than on their cheaper cousins; and the smaller enterprises, with their limited purchasing power and higher production costs, will have greater difficulty in absorbing the increase than their larger competitors. But let the Yarra Valley winegrowers speak for themselves. In response to the budget backhander, the following statement was issued by Mrs Christine Fyffe, the incoming president of the Yarra Valley Winegrowers Association, one of the industry'S strongest regional bodies in Australia. It reads: The Yarra Valley Winegrowers Association is appalled at the 55 per cent increase in the wine wholesale tax announced in the Federal Budget (from 20 per cent to 31 per cent). This discriminatory tax increase will depress the local market for premium wines. Small wineries and wineries just entering the market will be most severely affected and most premium wines will jump in price by at least $2 per bottle. All small producers have higher per bottle costs than mass production wineries. Products from the smaller wineries are aimed at a niche market that is very price sensitive. The Yarra Valley wineries have worked hard to become recognised as a premium wine growing area internationally; our competitive and sensitive domestic market is the main springboard for our overseas success. It provides the cash flow and opportunity for development of products and export markets. A reduction in domestic sales will result in wineries cutting back spending on planned vineyard development and expansion, creating fewer job opportunities in high unemployment country regions. To classify wine with beer and spirits is totally ridiculous when looking at the 'value adding' produced by the wine industry. The wine industry's contribution to the tourism industry is invaluable, the charm and diversification of its smaller wineries being the major draw card. Another Yarra Valley winegrower, in a letter sent to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), asked: Why have you savaged the emerging wine industry? The winegrower went on to point out: The wine industry, allied with the restaurant industry and the hospitality industry generally, is one of the few Australian industries which is making substantial inroads into the unemployment queues. Here in the Yarra Valley the wine industry employs directly about a thousand people and indirectly supports the transport industry, glass makers, agricultural suppliers, etc. The writer informed the Treasurer that he had recently spoken to a large group of young people from the hospitality schools in Melbourne. He went on: All were eager to do well in their courses and all looked forward with confidence to a job at the end of their training. Their chances of getting one will be diminished because of your ill advised slug on winemakers . . . restaurants will sell less wine, will become less profitable, will employ less staff, etc. The same with wineries. Why increase your training budget if you introduce a wine tax that destroys jobs? This claim is reinforced by the fact that as recently as last night one of Melbourne's leading restaurateurs observed that since the increase in sales tax was announced, bookings at his very popular establishment have decreased by 25 to 30 per cent. I understand that the Treasurer has not yet responded to this letter. Another significant impact of the increase in sales tax on wine is the uncertainty it has created. This problem has been raised in another letter I recently received from a leading Yarra Valley winegrower. He writes: The retail wine trade since Budget night has almost stopped purchasing wine until either the Sales Tax increase is overturned or confirmed. At the moment, retailers must pay 31 % Sales Tax. If the decision is overturned, this would be refunded, however, we are finding that retailers would rather wait until the matter is completely resolved. There is need to clarify this situation immediately. Of further concern is the fact that the premium end of the wine market is affected to a greater extent. Consumers will tend to buy the same amount of wine but at the cheaper end of the market. This will obviously have very serious repercussions for the Yarra Valley, which produces mainly premium wines. Ultimately the Government must receive less revenue as the premium end of the market is greatly reduced. As most of our export market depends on premium wines this will mean that the export drive, which has only just started to gain momentum will be seriously retarded Oust like the Prime Minister). It is a very real and inexcusable tragedy that the future of our winegrowing industry, truly one of Australia's growth industries in every sense of the word, is again being threatened by the imposition of this extraordinarily savage and discriminatory sales tax increase. May I suggest that anyone visiting or living in Victoria should make sure that they visit the Yarra Valley, or they will be missing out on a very special and rewarding experience. Sydneysiders will be particularly pleased to know that 14 Yarra Valley wineries will be proudly exhibiting their wares on 10 and 11 October at the Parkroyal, Darling Harbour. Take a tip from me: do not miss it. Aboriginal Land Rights",55
46,Mr SNOWDON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (12.40 p.m.)-This afternoon the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will be making public the government's initial response in terms of a proposed legislative framework to the Murray Islands case brought down by the High Court. It is not my intention to discuss what the Prime Minister might be saying this afternoon, but I do want to make some observations about the debate that has surrounded the issue of Mabo. The first observation I would like to make is that extreme views have been put on both sides of the debate, but what concerns me most is the attitude of people involved in development and those involved in some governments towards the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in land. I say that having worked with an Aboriginal organisation, namely, the Central Land Council in Alice Springs. I think I am probably the only member of this Parliament to have had that sort of experience and to have worked with Aboriginal people who have negotiated agreements with companies of all descriptions for development of their country. What has been disconcerting has been the deliberate campaign of misinformation, untruths, perhaps even deliberate deceit, on behalf of some about the intentions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander· people in regard to their land. In particular, this deceit has revolved around Aboriginal aspirations and Torres Strait Islander aspirations to control development of their land. In the case of the Northern Territory, where we have the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 in place, there are processes and procedures which are clearly defined to enable Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory to deal with people and companies who may want to have access to and develop parts of Aboriginal land. What is of concern has been, in this instance, the attitude of the Northern Territory government. This week the Northern Territory Chief Minister wrote to the Prime Minister in a letter dated 30 August. It was made public, incidentally, by the Northern Territory government as appears to be its normal procedure when corresponding with this government. It happens to have this process despite the fact that it opposes open government and does not have any review mechanisms for people within its own jurisdiction. When it corresponds with the Commonwealth, invariablyas has happened in this instance-the Chief Minister writes to the Prime Minister and then releases the letter in the form of a press release. I do not think that is an appropriate way for any government leader in this country to operate, to release correspondence for purposes other than those for which the correspondence has been written. In any event, he has done it. In the course of that letter on page 3 he said: As we have discussed before, the existing veto provisions in the Aboriginal Land Rights Act have meant a virtual freeze on mineral development on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. This resulted in the Northern Territory being unable to benefit from developments on Aboriginal land for the past 16 years. That statement is patently untrue. It is false. It is a lie. This is something which has been. asserted in correspondence between the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and the Prime Minister of this country, trying to influence this government over issues in relation to Aboriginal affairs. The most obvious fact which even the Northern Territory Chief Minister ought to be aware of is that the Northern Territory land rights act does not mention the word 'veto' once. There. is no provision in the Northern Territory land rights act for a veto. There are provisions which give Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory control over consent arrangements for access to their land but those consent arrangements are subject to a, national interest provision. It is worth pointing out that on not one occasion have those national interest provisions been used to override the view of Aboriginal people that consent not be given. On not one occasion have those consent provisions been overridden. So in the first instance we have a deliberate falsehood that even the Northern Territory Chief Minister ought to be aware of. If he is not then those who advise him are not advising him properly. There are no veto provisions in the Northern Territory land rights act. In relation to the second sentence of this particular paragraph on page 3 it says: This resulted in the Northern Territory being to benefit from development on Aboriginal land for the past 16 years. Again, that is a deliberate falsehood. Let me just point out the extent of that falsehood. I have here some information which relates to royalty payments and earnings off Aboriginal land by mining companies in the Northern Territory. Mining companies pay royalties to the Northern Territory government under the Mineral Royalty Act whether or not mining is on Aboriginal land. But 80 per cent of the value of mining in the Northern Territory comes off Aboriginal land. As well as the royalty which they must pay to the Northern Territory government, there is a statutory royalty which is paid to the Commonwealth when mining is on Aboriginal land. A statutory royalty equivalent is then paid by the Commonwealth back to Aboriginal interests for their purposes in the case of what is termed in the legislation as a statutory royalty equivalent. In addition to that, where Aboriginal interests have been able to negotiate arrangements with mining companies, they have been able to have negotiated royalty payments. In 1991-92, revenue going to the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account as a result of mining on Aboriginal land totalled $34 million. The value of mining production on Aboriginal land was $1 billion in the Northern Territory. Negotiated royalties in the Central Land Council area in 1991-92 were $2.2 million. So as well as the revenue which is produced as a result of the mining industry in the Northern Territory properly developing resources; and in all cases that I have observed in a very responsible manner, they have generated production values in 1991-92 of $1 billion off Aboriginal land. If the Northern Territory government says, as is does in this letter, that the Northern Territory community has been unable to benefit from the development of Aboriginal land, then that is not only a lie, it is an absurdity. It is an absolute nonsense. There are people in the mining industry who have taken a very responsible view about mining on Aboriginal land. There are a unable number of very important Australian companies which are involved in negotiating agreements with Aboriginal people. Four of those which are involved are North Flinders, Zapopan, Normandy Poseidon, and most recently, signing an agreement for exploration in the Tanami Desert in the central part of central Australia, was Sons of Gwalia looking for gold. These negotiations are taking place in the context of the existing provisions of the Northern Territory land rights act. It is wrong for ,the Northern Territory government, through its Chief Minister, to write letters to the Commonwealth government and portray in public views which are patently false. Any view of the facts demonstrates that they are false. To conclude, it is worthwhile reading some words from Mr Geoff Stuart from the Country Hour on 4 August 1993. He was talking about the question of Aboriginal land and the rights of Aboriginal landowners. In response to a question he said: I think it is a matter of land owners throughout Australia and access to minerals throughout Australia. I think it is not a matter of Aboriginals miners. It is a matter of land owners and miners. Different land owners have interests and therefore different rights. Aboriginal interests are different and therefore they should have different rights. AlI mining should have regard to its effect on landowners. Aboriginals have special interests so you should switch around from miners interests to Aboriginal interests. That is a very clear statement of understanding by a very responsible miner about the interests of Aboriginal Australians. (Time expired) Child Support Scheme",57
47,Mr ATKINSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak in today's grievance debate. I would like to bring to the attention of honourable members of the House the persistent dissatisfaction of many of my constituents over their dealings with the child support scheme. Whilst I acknowledge and welcome the inquiry by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues on the child support scheme, according to my constituents who are part of the scheme, it is long overdue. From my conversations with many constituents, who are both custodial and non-custodial parents, I am concerned that the Child Support Agency seems to be operating as an unguided missile, and that it is making decisions on people's lives without consideration of the facts and individual circumstances. In many cases, these constituents have not requested to become part of the scheme, but have been locked into the legal process once it has been instigated. It is obvious that there is a considerable amount of frustration amongst people involved in the scheme-a fact highlighted recently when the Joint Select Committee into Certain Family Law Issues conducted a hotline on 21 and 22 July of this year. A staggering 150,000 callers tried to get through on these two days. I would like to bring before the House a few examples of the problems encountered in dealing with the Child Support Agency which have been relayed to me by some of my constituents. My first example relates to a non-custodial parent. Although this constituent is operating through the legal system, I have serious concerns that he is not getting fair and treatment. The taxation department carried out a tax audit of his accounts and found that he made a tax loss for the financial year. Even though this loss was assessed by the tax department's own auditors-the same department responsible for the Child Support Agency-he was assessed by the Child Support Agency as having to pay exactly the same as when he had been making a profit. Owing to the way the system is established, he is required to go back to the court and appeal against this assessment. He has to provide a set of transcripts which, at a cost of $3,000, he cannot afford. As a consequence, he is unable to take action to reduce the amount of payment that currently exists. Because he has property, it has been seized and it is to be sold to repay amounts to satisfy the unfair judgment exercised by the Child Support Agency. The properties are rented, but they are mortgaged. A sale currently would not return any more than the mortgage payouts. All it does is leave this clil:mt with no alternative to bankruptcy. The second example relates to the situation of another non-custodial parent who remits $540 to the Child Support Agency per month. He advises that his ex-wife is about to purchase the family home and that she will be using his child support payments to repay the mortgage. Following an assessment by the Child Support Agency, and after allowing for tax, superannuation and rent, his fortnightly income is $361, compared with his ex-wife's income of $995. He has told me he is living close to the poverty line following the unfair assessment of his situation by the Child Support Agency. The third example relates to a custodial parent. This constituent has advised me that she has not had any maintenance paid to her since 1983. She started communications by both letter and telephone with the Child Support Agency in March 1991 and regularly kept the agency informed of her ex-husband's whereabouts. In spite of her constant contact with the agency, it was unable to track her husband down. She subsequently contacted a solicitor and then took the case to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. There are arrears of some $24,860.63. She has now been advised by the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office that the Child Support Agency will not attempt to collect the proceeds until sometime after June 1994, owing to the magnitude of the debt and its lack of funding to undertake such a case. Many of my constituents have voiced general concerns about the scheme and the agency. Firstly, communications from the Child Support Agency come in an easily identifiable eiwelope. When a letter is returned to the agency marked 'Not known at this address', this should not be taken as evidence that the person has actually left that address. However, I have a case where a constituent advised the Child Support Agency of his change of address, but his 85-year-old pensioner mother received communications from the agency, including a notice to provide certain information which stated that she would incur a maximum fine of $2,000 for non-compliance. Secondly, the rate for one child is 18 per cent, based on the taxable income of the noncustodial parent, who is allowed only $13,276 exempt income if he or she has a new partner and one child, while the custodial parent has over $32,063 exempt income. I find it difficult, on a comparison of the two situations of $13,276 and $32,063 exempt income, to accept that situation. Thirdly, if the non-custodial parent wishes to have a review carried out by the Child Support Agency, he or she must supply details of debts, amounts borrowed, reasons for borrowing, the amount paid out each week and to whom, and a list of the current debts, plus a list of assets following the same criteria. When it receives this, the Child Agency then photocopies the forms and sends them off to the custodial parent. This means that the custodial parent has a dossier of the current financial status of his or her ex-partindustries ner. Fourthly, the custodial parents have to wait for two months at the commencement of maintenance payments before funds are deposited in their bank accounts. If the dial parent is receiving a pension, he or she must advise the Department of Social Security of any maintenance received over $16.05 per week so that pensions can be altered accordingly. The lack of communications from the Child Support Agency and the holding back of payments for two months, combined with not being told that payments have ceased, means that custodial parents often find themselves not receiving a consistent amount of money and therefore, they experience considerable hardship in endeavouring to maintain their financial status. Fifthly, there is an obvious lack of coJ?munication between the Department of SocIal Security, the Australian Taxation Office and the Child Support Agency. Where a noncustodial parent changes employment, in spite of where he or she may relocate, the new employee tax form, which gives details of the tax file number and commencement date of employment, should be sufficient evidence for the tax department to ascertain his or her whereabouts. In conClusion, we pride ourselves on the rights and freedoms of people in this country. There are many flaws in the process of the Child Support Agency's system at the moment that need to be addressed. In the many cases that I have cited, I would like to see justice be seen to be done. Tariffs",59
48,Mr LINDSAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (1.00 p.m.)-An issue which is causing grave concern and uncertainty in both the business and farming sectors is the opposition's zero tariff policy contained in the Liberal and Support National parties' manifesto known as Fightback. The political dogma set out in Fightback pledges zero tariffs across the board. A zero tariff would affect not only such as passenger motor vehicle manufacturing but also agriculture based industries such as sugar, canned pineapples, dairy, processed meat and so on. In the Weekend Australian of 28 and 29 August, on custopage 26, a former Liberal member of the House of Represenfatives, Mr John Hyde, reported statements by the opposition shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), that Fightback still represents the policy of the coalition, with the exception of the GST. Fightback's zero tariff policy would have seen the end of the car industry and would have seen the end of the clothing, textile and footwear manufacturing industries in Australia. - ast year these industries employed approximately 140,000 people, an eighth of all employment in manufacturing. Last year these industries exported $1.8 billion worth of goods and, very importantly, provided goods to Australian consumers worth $13 billion. It is astonishing that the shadow Treasurer could find himself being reported in the Weekend Australian of 28 and 29 August reaffirming Fightback with its zero tariff policy, because it is only in July of last year that we had the huge furore between the opposition and the car makers of Australia with respect to the opposition's zero tariff policy. Let me just remind honourable members of some of the headlines in the newspapers in Australia about that particular debate. In the Canberra TImes of 20 July 1992 the headline was, 'Toyota ""gone"" if tariff zero'; in the Australian Financial Review of 26 August 1992, 'Hewson warned: tariff policy threatens Ford's investments'; the Australian newspaper of 19 September 1992, '60,000 jobs could go under Libs: Ford'; in the Canberra TImes of 30 March 1992, 'No tariffs means no new investment: Ford chief'; and so it goes on. The massive task of restructuring Australian manufacturing industry so as to achieve international competitiveness has required practical programs. This government has introduced a range of relatively low-cost industry programs in areas such as automobiles, . pharmaceuticals, telecommunications textiles, clothing and footwear informatioindustries, aerospace and ships: just to name a few. As well, a range of general industry measures such as investment incentives research and development incentives, export schemes and industry extension services have been provided, and these programs were to be savagely cut under Fightback. Long-term stability and predictability are required for sustained investment. The hon understands this. In a speech to the Federation of Automotive Parts Manufacturers earlier this year, he urged his colleagues to take that message on board and try to offer the stability so desperately needed by business. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Mayo, the shadow Treasurer, has other ideas. In July this year, in his role as roving diplomat manque for trade and economic policy, the honourable member for Mayo visited Ford headquarters in Detroit, Michigan. Unfortunately there is no public record of what transpir-d at the meeting between the honourable member for Mayo and Ford executives. However, the honourable member for Mayo did issue a media release dated 15 July 1993 where he opined: 'There is now a very real danger that Ford could cease manufacturing in Australia'. The media release went on to say: Although Mr Downer discussed the issue of tariffs with Ford executives, it was clear that the level of tariff protection in Australia and plans to reduce ta-iff prot-tion were not an over-riding consideration, particularly as Ford operates with just a 2.5 per cent tariff in the US. The shadow Treasurer believes that the in relevant measure of protection of the US car industry is a 2.5 per cent tariff. Obviously, the honourable gentleman has not heard of the voluntary restraint agreement that limits the Japanese share of the US auto market to 16.5 per cent. It would appear that he is also unaware that the share of the Australian market made up of Japanese imports is almost double that permitted in the United States. The Automotive Industry Authority has estimated that investment in new plant and equipment for the car industry will be worth -2 billion over the next three years, and this mvestment will assure our car industry of a future. This investment would not occur under the zero tariff regime of the Liberal and National parties. The shadow Treasurer was roundly and soundly rejected by Ford. In the Australian newspaper of 17 July 1993 the headline was 'Ford rejects closure claims'. The article led with this paragraph: Ford Australia has strongly rejected claims by Opposition spokesman on treasury matters, Mr Alexander Downer, that its United States parent considering closing the company's Broadmeadows plant in Melbourne. The statements by the shadow minister were dismissed by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) as dubious assertions and false accusations. Mr Ronaldson-I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe it is a convention of this place that, if one is going to tip a bucket on somebody, at least the other person is given the opportunity to be in the House. The honourable member for Herbert knows that the honourable member for Mayo cannot be here, and I think his remarks are inappropriate.",60
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Nehl)Order! There is no point of order. The honourable member will resume his seat.,62
50,Mr LINDSAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, after that inane and stupid interjection, I just want to say this: every country in the world would like to have a car industry such as that of Japan, earning billions of export dollars a year. If other nations thought that, by lowering tariffs, they could get a car industry such as that in Japan, they would do it. Building competitiveness in the auto industry is difficult. To a significant degree, it is determined by investment in new technology, new plant and new products. It is therefore essential that, while applying sensible pressure to increase cost competitiveness, at the same time there be continuing incentives for new investments. The expected growth in Australia of new auto industry investment of 19 per cent over the next three years is solid proof that the Keating government's policies are soundly based. I seek leave to table a document relating to the Australian car industry. Leave not granted.",62
51,Mr LINDSAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I have in my possession a document which shows that the Australian car industry has the lowest protection in Asia outside of Japan. For example, Korea, which has a larger car industry than Australia, applies a tariff of 55 per cent and curbs Japanese imports. Honourable members will be aware that, under the government's car plan, tariffs will drop to 15 per cent, consoliis dating Australia's position of having the most competitive car industry in Asia outside of Japan. It is not only the car industry that I am concerned about with respect to the impact that a zero tariff policy would have on that major employer in Australian industry. A zero tariff would also adversely affect the textile, clothing and footwear industries. For example, the president of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Council in August last year said: There is a good chance we will all disappear under the coalition's industry policy of zero tariffs. This is a major export industry in Australia. Over the next three years it is expected to generate income for Australia of over $500 million. The government is complementing a sensible tariff reduction plan with a practical, business like, successful set of measures to facilitate the restructuring of Australian industry. These measures have been supplemented by an excellent budget initiative. (TIme expired) Retirement Incomes  incomes are big news today. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have been forced to make yet another policy backdown, this time over the pensions income test. The exemption for shares purchased before last year's budget is a flawed compromise between an executive isolated by gross arrogance and caucus members scared of the revolt in their own electorates. The government's proposals are still discriminatory. They create two clear classes of pensioner share owners. The pensions income test should be removed completely. I was not here when the coalition supported the government's original measures last year. It was an incorrect decision. However, the coalition has realised its error and has worked hard to see the income test provisions removed. Now that we are so close to overturning this unfair policy, it will be ironic indeed if the government's incomplete proposals are passed with the support of the acquiescent Australian Democrats. These are not the retirement income issues I wish to speak about. Today I want to examine some of the matters facing my own generation. Few people of my age expect that we will see anything like the current age pension system when we are in our sixties. The young people of today-and the future governments they will elect and be part ofwill face an enormous burden providing health care and all the other necessary services as the baby boomers age. Pensions may be limited to only the desperately poor. More and more people are investing in superannuation funds and paying in moneys over and above the compulsory levy amounts. This is easy for older, more established people or the wealthy. However, there is a real dilemma for younger people who wish to follow the tradition and buy their own homes while providing for their retirement. Superannuation changes such as the government's removal of tax concessions for most superannuants have significantly reduced average income earners' ability to save for housing or whatever. Some economists question the Australian emphasis on home ownership and suggest that the amounts we invest in housing could be put into more productive areas. Housing experts suggest that we should examine the adoption of European style leasing laws that can provide for lifetime tenancies. While these important issues are being canvassed, they fail to answer the immediate dilemma: home ownership, in a time of strong housing affordability, is slipping from the reach of many Australians. The Liberal Party went into the last election with a policy designed to tackle this problem. Under our policy, young Australians under the age of 35 buying their first home would have been able to withdraw up to 75 per cent of their accumulated superannuation savings to put against the purchase price of a house. This amount was to be repaid to the superannuation fund over the remainder of their working lives. The government offered its predictable, disapproving platitudes, branding the scheme as socially inequitable and then, equally predictably, pinched it ed it in the accord mark 7. Point 8.10 of the accord mark 7 read: In addition, recognising that income and housing are equally required for a secure and comfortable retirement, the Government will permit part of the deposit on owner occupied dwellings to be funded from the home buyer's superannuation account. The Government will permit home buyers to draw whichever is the lesser of $10 000 or 75% of the vested benefit from their superannuation savings as a deposit on the purchase of their home. The scheme was not without its faults. It was not targeted. It was open to people of all ages. Most remarkable of all, there was no requirement for the money to be paid back into the superannuation fund, removing any link with retirement savings. Despite these reservations, it was clear that both the major parties had recognised the need for programs that allowed young people to save for their retirement without precluding them from home ownership. Both sides of politics realised that access to superannuation could prevent a decline in home ownership rates and greater dependency on public housing. The government's proposals could have been modified. The FitzGerald report into national savings hinted at some of the changes that could have been made. However, it looks as though the scheme has become just another election policy this government has little intention of implementing. Earlier this month the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said that the government will allow withdrawals but, to use its usual formula, only under limited conditions that are yet to be determined. We do not know what its final proposals will be, or when they will be available. The only thing we know is that the new policy is totally contradictory to the promises contained in the national housing policy. The government seems to feel it is under no compulsion to honour its election commitments. It seems to believe the electorate should be simply grateful that it was saved from a Liberal government. This sort of extraordinary boast can appeal only to the most myopic Labor Party support. It cheats the rest of the community and only further denigrates their opinion of this place and and incorporat- political processes. The differing super for homes policies of the major parties nail this furphy. The coalition went to the election with a responsible policy that specifically identified young people in need, gave them access to as much as 75 per cent of their super benefit for a deposit on a home, and required them to return the funds so, at their retirement, they could own their own homes and have reasonable superannuation. The government tried to trump this with a desperate and irresponsible bid in a deal with its union mates few people ever thought it would be around to implement. Now it cannot meet its commitments and the dilemma facing young Australians, especially those of limited means, goes unresolved. Under Labor, that dilemma, of course, is super or housing. Tourism': Wilderness areas",62
52,Mr HOLDING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"One of the significant aspects of our economy has been the development of tourism throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Given the size of this great island continent, there are a variety of aspects which attract international tourism. One of those is the Australian people themselves. The fact is that they are gregarious and outgoing. Another aspect is the attractions in our major capital cities, and they are all different. One of the more recent developments, impacting greatly on the economies of rural areas of Australia is, of course, the wilderness aspects of tourism. In the Northern Territory, there is a growing overseas attraction towards Kakadu and its beauties. This is also true for the Great Barrier Reef. Therefore, it is importfuture ant that, when we are thinking about tourism, we think about the attractions of the Australian environment. I, along with many other Australians and I believe many honourable members on both sides of this House, am concerned to read of the proposition that the wilderness areas at Starcke, on the Cape York Peninsula, were going to be advertised for sale internationally. What we are looking at is an area of over 200,000 hectares north of Cooktown. This was bought by its owner, Mr Quaid, at bargain basement prices, some 22 years ago. He is now seeking a price of $26.5 million. I wonder what would have happened if, some years ago, someone had bought areas like Wilsons Promontory, Carnarvon national gorge or Kakadu itself. No matter how they may have come into the control or the ownership of an individual, the reality is that these sorts of wilderness areas are essential to the whole fabric of Australia and there should be the preservation of important wilderness areas. If one looks at the concerns which have been very properly expressed by the Wilderness Society, Starckeis certainly an area which is critical. Apart from its natural beauty, it is critical for the fishing industry of Queensland; it is critical in terms of the potential that it has for the tourist industry. I believe this is an occasion where the Australian government must speak out quite clearly. I note with some pleasure that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has already indicated that the Foreign Investment Review Board will examine the proposed sale with a view to blocking it or ordering an environmental impact assessment on it. Having regard to the significance and importance of what has been proposed, the responsible minister, both at a state and federal level, should indicate to Mr Quaid quite clearly at the outset that this sale is not on. Indeed, if necessary the area ought to be compulsorily acquired, and Mr Quaid ought to be compensated. It is a delicate balance. If we as a nation are going to allow large tracts of Australia-areas that are of tremendous importance to the environment and to the of our tourist industry but that are an essential part of Australia's heritage-to be flogged off to any international buyer who wants to tum up with some dollars jingling in his pocket, then that is a situation which all Australians have to view with great concern. In recent times, our sense of national pride has been shown with regard to paintings which are relevant to our history and to the development of our art, where the minister for the arts has intervened to say, 'These are not for sale'. It is interesting to see that a VC, which is also very much part of Australia's heritage, was acquired by the RSL to the plaudits of the average Australian citizen and was placed where it belonged in our historic military museum. This is an issue that I believe raises concerns which have to be addressed on both sides of the House. There is a role for government. We are not entitled to take the view that because someone had some foresight and acquired large areas of wilderness years ago that therefore he and he alone is entitled to say, as the owner of the land, that it will be turned into a game park for international hunters or cleared for some other form of development. One of the problems that faces the tourist industry is that as areas such as Kakadu and Wilsons Promontory attract more visitors, the very presence of those· visitors often puts the thing that is most attractive at risk. It is a question of balance. We do not want to tum all our wilderness areas into golf courses or tennis courts. There are very important national and state issues involved, and I would urge both the federal minister and the relevant minister to enter into serious discussions with Mr Quaid. They should point out to him that if he wants to pursue this course, then as far as the Australian government is concernedand hopefully the Queensland government-it is a course which in Australia's national interest will not be allowed to take place. If he wants to seek compensation, that is a matter that has to be discussed, but we have to say that, in areas of great significance to Australia environmentally, particularly when they involve such large areas of land, no private entrepreneur is going to have the final say as to the future of these very historic and important parts of Australia. Queensland: Health Services",64
53,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In rising to speak on this grievance debate, I comment to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), that I agree with what he has said, because what is being done is putting at risk a very substantial and very important part of North Queensland rainforests. I also want to speak about the putting at risk of· other things in Queensland. I can say, as a Queenslander born and bred and still living there, that 20 to 30 years ago the proud 'cry of a Queenslander was that we could claim a completely free public hospital system and an ambulance service second to none within this country. Other people listening in this place would s&y that we probably sacrificed a few things to provide those services, but they were top class services well-known in Queensland. So today I grieve for the death of the free public hospital system, and I also grieve for an ambulance service under threat of collapsing under bureaucratic pressure and governmental neglect. All of this has occurred within the time frame and under the practices and policies of three Labor governments-the Hawke and the Keating governments in Canberra, and now the Goss government in Queensland. Once it could be said confidently that the uniform of a Queensland ambulance bearer reflected pride in the service, both by the bearer and the public. That uniform was a mark that one was being protected. Now the state bearer of that uniform does not know how long he or she will be continuing to wear it. Such is the morale within the ambulance service at the moment. In January 1991 a group of ambulance officers came to my office in Mackay. It included a. chap that I have a high respect for, Mr Noel Fatnowna. He is a highly respected bearer who served a lifetime in the service of the Mackay ambulance; he is a descendant of the South Sea Islanders. He is a volunteer for that service who raised funds from the community for it. The. members of the group spoke to me in terms of trying to maintain and retain the service that they had given to the Mackay community over many years. They wanted to save it from the politieal and bureaucratic scavengers that they feared would interfere with it. . The Mackay region at that stage was an independent service which was not associated with others in Queensland. It was held together by the willing subscriptions of 26,000 families and individuals within that area. The group that came to see me was trying to keep the ambulance service as it had been instead of its passing to a central authority. I think they understood that there would always be some changes in the service but they thought the change proposed at that time was too great to be able to assimilate. They did have reason to worry and draw my attention to the problem; I understood it myself at the time. The basic problem was the desperate drive by the Queensland government to change the service to one of professionalism versus the voluntarism which had been in place. This change to professionalism has changed adversely the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade. What has happened? What we find is that the volunteers on the management committee have lost local control to Brisbane. They have now either resigned or they are irrelevant. Further, we find that centralisation has meant that distress calls are made often, not .to the basic centre of concern but to a central area where the local geography is not known. I have here an interesting instruction which indicates that if a person is ringing in an emergency and the location is difficult to find, service. would they please arrange for someone to direct the ambulance crew. In the old days that was not necessary. People· knew the local area; they knew where to go; they never had the foul-ups that are happening now. I understand that on one occasion an ambulance was dispatched· from one of the western areas to a site, but in actual fact they were trying to get an ambulance to an urban area. There was a whole process of delay. Now there are no voluntary funds locally available. This is because $1 million in cash reserves were forcibly removed from the Mackay region and taken to Brisbane to be combined with $44 million of funds coming in from other centres. All these had been voluntarily collected. The scandal of last year indicated that this $44 million had vanished; it had been wasted; it is no longer there. In fact, a fundraising group in the Bundaberg area found that money that was raised locally for a new ambulance was taken away to pay the salary of a professional added to the staff outside the state of Queensland. No wonder the local fundraising has dried up! The funds we were relying on the state to provide are not available in the amounts that are required. This has led to a massive demoralisation of the ambulance service. As we look at this problem that has faced us, what we see in the future is a system where the user-pays principle will be brought into account. That will restrict the service and not expand it, because people will not be prepared to pay the user charges. I have a list here which says that in view of the emergency in the cash deficit a family is going to be asked to up the current rate from $66 to $78 on an annual subscription. Just within the last 12 months that fee had been $48; it is now $78. But the real hit comes for those people who are non-subscribers. On one occasion at the beginning of the year a chap came to me from New South Wales. He had to be hospitalised in Proserpine and taken by ambulance to Mackay for an emergency procedure .. Even though he had taken out a subscription to the service as he was being hospitalised, a charge of $960 was rendered to him. I am trying to keep up income support to him as another However, for non-subscribers, ambulance transport for the first 24 kilometres or less will go from $116 to $250; more than twice the amount. Each kilometre thereafter will go from $2.90 to $8.35, and the list goes on. The cost for the aerial ambulance goes from $1:60 to $4.30, and the minimum fee goes from $116 to $200. We know that on occasions when fees are raised the service is restricted. On top of this we will have the increase of another 5c per litre· on the running costs, which is a substantial charge emanating from this government. We are now told that ambulance cars will only be used as a last resort. That requires a doctor's certification. If that is not available, one expects that the person then has to make his way to the hospital or to the place of emergency by cab. Cabs are being used more and more instead of the ambulance service. These changes have all occurred over the last one or two years. In this time, the commissioner has been sacked. The messenger has been knocked off, but instead of sacking the commissioner, what is desperately called for is the sacking of the previous minister in charge of police and emergency services, Mr Mackenroth, and the present minister, Mr Braddy, for the manner in which this is being handled. This is another deterioration in the service caused by centralised control by a group of academics who have never dirtied their hands in the physical aspects of the service. They do not know what is happening out there in the outer regions. These academics, working out of universities, working in conjunction with the government in Brisbane, are entirely out of touch. They cannot make real decisions, and the criteria they are setting will not work. Not only the ambulance services, but also the health services are in crisis. In the last two or three years Queensland has been divided into 13 health regions. Each region has overspent its budget to the extent that normal procedures were not available for periods within the year because they had to meet a budget strategy. That added to the queues and the waiting lists for non-elective surgery. In Mackay, I understand the overrun was some $700,000 to $800,000. I do not know what is going to happen there in the new year. Education services are also under threat from the budget that will be delivered in Queensland tonight. I have already mentioned health services. Rail services throughout Queensland are being cut, at the risk of leaving country people without the services they require, either personally or for freight. (1ime expired) Kennett Government",65
54,Mr TANNER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Melbourne) (1.34 p.m.)Over the last few days in this House we have been subjected to a torrent of entreaties from the opposition benches with respect to the supposed regressive impact of the current federal budget and the allegedly savage effect that this will have on low income earners and poorer people in our community. I am new to this House, so perhaps I will be forgiven for wondering who in this place is the real champion of the poor and the underprivileged. Have the members of the Liberal and National parties changed their spots? Are the once proud representatives of the ruling class now the representatives of the Australian working class and the underprivileged and poor in the community? Are there dozens of squatters and business tycoons in the Melbourne Club choking on their port? Fortunately, in Victoria we have a practical living example of what a Liberal government in office actually means for working class people, for ordinary people, for lower income people. We have the experience of the Kennett government. The false rhetoric of the opposition in this place during the past few days is put into very stark relief by the actions of the Kennett government in Victoria. I would just like to refer today to a few of those actions and to indicate to the House that these sorts of actions by this government are having an impact on lower income earning Victorians that dwarfs any possible regressive impact by the current federal government on people. There are ministry of housing estates in my electorate where there are very substantial numbers of people Uving who, overwhelmingly,are low income earners. They have had to put up with rent increases of up to $25 per week with no increases in wages, and in some instances as the result of the Kennett government's policies, effective reductions in wages. There have been substantial increases in glls and electricity prices and major reductions .in cleaning. There are ministry of housing estates where the residents are saying that they are becoming a pigsty because not enough cleaning hours are allocated to perform. even the basic aspects of cleaning. Maintenance is being seriously reduced as well. Those people are being very seriously affected by the actions of the Kennett state government and they are the true low income earners in the community- They are the people who know what a Liberal government actually means. Then we have the $100 poll tax-the tax that applies equally to millionaires and pensioners. A millionaire in Toorak pays $100; a company actually pays $67 because it can write it off on its tax; a pensioner living in Brunswiek pays $100. We have the infamous industrial relations laws introduced by the state government, the sign-or-else contracts. Those contracts exist; I have seen them happening. I have seen workers effectively forced to sign contracts that mean they have their sick leave reduced; they have things like compassionate leavethe ability to get leave and go off to their mother's funeral and stuff like that-elimin­ ated; they have relatively meagre award redundancy provisions removed; and they have clauses im;erted that effectively allow the employer to vary their rate of pay up or down unilaterally. There stands the Liberal Party's concern for the lower paid; there stands the Liberal Party's concern for the Qrdinary workers and the underprivileged in the community.· We look at things like Workcare or, in. its new guise in Victoria, Workcover, where substantial numbers of injured workers have been knocked off benefits after an arbitrary period and just left to rot. We look at some of the actions in the public sector of this governsurvive ment, retrenching loyal school cleaners, for example. They are people who as well as doing the cleaning for many years have performed a variety of functions such as maintenance and other activities. They have been literally thrown onto the scrap heap by this state Liberal government. They are the classic low income earners-the sort of people that honourable members are coming in here crying crocodile tears about in relation to the budget. It is absolute hypocrisy. This what a Liberal government in practice actually means for low income earners. I would suggest to the House that, if people would like an illustration of what the means for people in low income Australia, they should come to Victoria and see it in practice. They will see what it really means and the sort of devastating impact it is actualtwilight ly having on ordinary Victorian working people.",67
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Wine Tax,68
56,Mr HICKS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am here to speak in concern about the impost of a wine tax, particularly for those people I represent in the Riverina. As we know, in 1984, after saying in the election before that there would not be a wine tax, the federal government put on a 10 per centtax; in 1986 it went up to 20 per cent; now. it. is up to 31 per cent which is, in effect, a 55 per cent increase. The people this is going to affect mainly live in the riverland in South Australia, in . Mildura in Victoria and in the MIA that I represent in New South Walt;:s. It is estimated that 10 per cent of producers will go out of business because of this tax. The question I want to ask is: how can the Treasurer attack this industry which is doing so well despite the present federal government? To have a government like we have and to be able to these days is a miracle, but the government still believes it has to attack this industry. One of the major strengths of our wine industry has been its ability to provide good quality wine at a reason-ble price. The thing that concerns me greatly, among all the other concerns that have been expressed, is imports of good quality wines at a cheaper price. Of course, this is going to add to the headaches is our growers and our wineries will face. The people in my electorate in the wine industry and throughout the area, because it will affect all of them, are asking how they can compete with these overseas wines when coalition the government-'-(TIme expired) Keating Government",68
57,Mr EVANS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"As I sat in the zone at question time this week, I was reminded of that great Broadway show Oliver, the story about the underprivileged child, which is so relevant in the last weeks of the two budgets. Imagine recasting the story based upon some of the characters in this place. Do you remember Fagin, that demented megalomaniac, hunched over, hands in pockets, playing doggo, singing that song, 'I've gotta pick a pocket or two'. What sort of casting would it be if we asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to play that role? What . about the cast singing that song when Oliver came and asked for some more food and they said, 'Don't ask for more if you know what's in store.'? That has to be the backbench of the caucus last Monday when they said to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), 'Don't ask for more if you know what's in store'. Then, of course, what about the Artful Dodger, that recreant, that craven against his own gang? That really has to be played by the Treasurer. And do honourable members remember. that song 'Consider yourself our mate, consider yourself part of the furniture.'? All I can say is that the Treasurer will only get some mates when he becomes part of the backbench furniture. Kennett Government",68
58,Mr CHYNOWETH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to speak, about that Victorian dictator named Jeffrey Gibb Kennett. One only has to lookattoday's Herald-Sun newspaper, which is not very good at looking after the ALP's interests, to see that schools down. Recently a school was closed down in our area. I do not know how many are left, but over 60 per cent of the kids from one school in Victoria have actually quit. All those kids who were transferred to another school have gone. The headline on the next page is, 'Mothers march over kinder cuts'. This is the sort of thing that is going on. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans) mentioned Oliver; he ought to come to Victoria and he will see a lot of those kids wandering around the streets now, begging for food. That is from Jeffrey Gibb Kennett, from what he is doing there. He has put a $100 impost on everyone. A millionaire pays $100; the poorest person in Victoria pays $100. Why has he done it? Because he is a dictator. He is one of the three Ks-there is Kennett, there is Kroger and there is the next leader of the National Party, Katter. One can imagine those three coming together in this place. That is what Jeffrey is all about, he is trying to raise his profile because there is no-one here who can run the Liberal Party. He wants to run it. He wants to implement the policies that he has got in Victoria all over Australia, and honourable members opposite would back him because they are not game enough to stand up to the right wing of their own party. They should have enough guts to stand up to these takeover merchants. In 1989 I gave a speech in relation to the right wing taking over, and they have.

I want to quote one person: If we cannot make 4 per cent growth a year, the whole lot of us ought to give it away. That was on 31 March and, of course, that was our Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Since then we have seen the budget predict a growth of 2.75 per cent, a level that is far too low to reduce the overall level of unemployment in Australia. Unemployment is the number one scourge of Australia today and we have, in the Prime Minister's own words, an admission of incompetence and failure. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) should resign. He has presided over the worse bout of unemployment seen in this country .since the Great Depression. (Time expired) Senator Bishop M::r CHYNOWETH (Dunkley)-I am not going to mention Jeffrey Gibb Kennett.

Bronwyn Bishop! Not the Liberal Party-and not us, of course. She is all the time trying to get to the leadership position. We have Kennett, Kroger, and Katter-and now we have Bishop.

I am certain there would be some honourable members in the National Party who would do it. If I were there, I would. (TIme expired) Wine Tax",70
65,Ms MOYLAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) is absolutely right when he says that the most pressing need in this country is to get industry going again and to get jobs. Even the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) recognised that fact in his budget paper, although he has the gall to claim that the budget will promote sustainable industry and jobs in Australia. Why then does the government persist in its punitive 55 per cent tax increase on the wine industry, the paradigm of successful small business? For a tax gain of $79 million, $445 million in investment will be lost. New investment will be it jeopardised, and many of the 15,000 jobs in the industry will be put at risk. This quality export industry, which helps keep Australia afloat, is being taxed at three times the rate of its main overseas competitors in the United States and France. This government taxes excellence to death. If this government persists in its destructive folly, then justice must be sought in another place. It is a blow, not only against the wine industry but against business in general, and against our prospects for a general recovery. Labour Market Programs",70
66,Mr HORNE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"One of the most positive features of this budget is the increase in funding for labour market programs. I know that there are many cynics, in both this parliament and!n the community, who regard these as a means of keeping the unemployment figures down, and who think that the courses are only mickey mouse ones, anyway. I have been involved in those courses personally, both as a teacher of the long-term unemployed on get skilled and jobtrain courses, and as the shire president of a council which took on a group of trainees under a jobskill scheme. A number of local government authorities in my electorate have been involved in these programs, and I can testify personally to their success. Maitland City Council has been to the fore in my electorate, in acting as a broker and offering a variety of courses involving many skills. Participants have learned welding, concreting, machinery maintenance, horticulture-to name just a few-as well as literacy and numeracy skills. I believe that the great variety of workplace venues and skiJIed personnel that local governments can offer makes them an ideal place for labour market programs. The federal government should explore ways in which local councils can become major trainers for long-term unemployed people. Wine Tax",70
67,Ms WORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is all very well for my colleague opposite, the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home), to talk about how important jobs and training are. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) quite rightly said that jobs now and jobs in the future were what he was aiming for in the budget. Sadly, that of course is not what one finds when one examines the budget further. I rise to talk particularly today about the impact that the increase in the wine tax will have on employment in my state and in my electorate. The 55 per cent increase in sales tax is abigtax grab on an industry that has survived and prospered despite our economic misfortunes. When we look at what is going to happen, we see that there will be jobs lost not only the industry, but also in tourism and in all retail outlets: restaurants, hotels, and bottle shops. How do we know that there will be a loss of jobs? It has all happened before. In 1986 this government increased tax on wine from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. The result was a loss of $200 million per annum in sales; a loss of 9,000 hectares of potential vines; a loss of 1,000 potential jobs in vineyards and another 1,000 potential jobs in the wineries. In a much healthier climate than the present one, at least 2,000 jobs were lost. Now the wine industry has been slugged again during an economic downturn. It will happen again. Labor is destroying the jobs of Australian workers. (Time expired). Committee Reports: Government Responses",70
68,Mr JENKINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to make comments today which go to the relationship between members of this chamber and executive government. On the first day of the budget session, a schedule of government responses to reports by House of Representatives committees and joint committees was tabled in this House. Of the 69 reports listed on the schedule, one did not require a response and 18 had indications of being answered, but none of the 68 requiring responses had been responded to within the specified time of three months. This is not good enough, given the hard work that is done by committees of this parliament. It is an aspect of the work of parliamentarians who are not members of the executive which gives us an input to making comment on policy matters· and making comment on administration. I urge the responsible ministers to make appropriate responses to those reports. I urge the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), when he gives an outline of progress towards responses, not to use words such as, 'Response is still under consideration and will be provided in due course', as was stated in relation to reports of, for example, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration-of which you were chairman, Mr Speaker, and of which within I was a member-in the 35th Parliament.

This budget confirms that. We have a Prime Minister of this nation who stands in this chamber unable to look this side of the House in the eye when responding to questions seeking answers on behalf of desperate Australians. I want to make a strong protest, as other speakers have done, on behalf of constituents in my electorate-grape growers. These are grape growers who have responded to a challenge that has been foisted upon them by the sledgehammer of tariff protection removal. What have they done? They have responded and bolstered an industry in wine, being able accordingly to take advantage of a 17 per cent increase in their price. What do they have now, after investing thousands and thousands of their hard-earned dollars, even borrowing the money, in new . investment with new varieties? The government shifts the goalposts, not before the football is kicked but halfway through its flight. This government has demonstrated an ineptness in everything it touches. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) overestimated the feeling of Australians in respect of the flag. An enormous number of people-of which I am included-are proud of their flag. He has overestimated the feeling of strength behind our constitutional monarchy. Now he has bungled the budget. (TIme expired) Taxation: Pensioners' Shares",71
70,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to raise today a massive bungle for the government, made particularly by the nation's Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). I refer to the tax that he has imposed on the unrealised capital gains on shares held by pensioners. It has been an absolute debacle right from the outset, ever since the Treasurer introduced this measure. Many pensioners have already panicked as a result of this and have sold their shares. With all good intentions, people purchased shares to look after their own future and to take care of themselves in their old age, but they have been panicked by this government, by this unnecessary move to try to tax them on unrealised capital gains on these shares. What the Treasurer of this nation has done is an absolute disgrace, and he should resign. He has admitted this bungle; members of his own party have admitted this bungle. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) have admitted now that the Treasurer of this nation has bungled yet again. He should resign. Wine Tax",72
71,Mr HARRY WOODS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I have listened to a couple of speakers from the opposition going on about the wine industry. I have been involved in the hotel industry most of my life. The wine industry has gone from a very small industry to a large industry. It now exports more product than we use in Australia and it will continue to do that. It is a vibrant, strong industry. The idea that honourable members opposite have put to us that the wine industry should continue in a privileged position as far as tax goes against other sectors of the alcohol industry, namely, the beer industry and the spirit industry, is beyond belief. They are saying that there should be special deals for special groups in special industries. That just does not make sense. Honourable. members opposite are saying cut this and cut that, but all that does is cut out all of the other services that we can provide by raising taxes. Nobody should pay taxes, if we are to take them at their word. It is absolutely ridiculous. We are the lowest taxed country in the world. The wine industry will continue to grow and it will continue to do well. The opposition would be better off looking at its own policies. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said the other day, the opposition is simply becoming oppositionist. (TIme expired) Budget 1993-94",72
72,Mrs SULLIVAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has given some very confusing answers this week to questions on the issue of who is going to be better off or worse off under this budget. In response to a question from me on Tuesday, about whether certain people would be worse off and about when he will resign, the Treasurer said: If the penalty for getting things wrong were to resign, the honourable member ought to right now, because what she has said is wrong. We will be releasing later today some preliminary analysis which has been undertaken by Treasury on this revised package. With all the qualifications that we need to make about these household distribution analyses, 90 per cent of full-time wage and salary earner household types on average will be shown to be better off. Yesterday the Treasurer received a number of questions about the outcome of this analysis. He told the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) that there were a number of revenue and positive things that had not been modelled into it. He said that we did not like the result because it does not prove our case. The Treasurer also said: Their case is that people are worse off. Prismod does not prove that case. What it does prove is that there are a lot of ordinary Australians who will be better off. When I asked him a question in relation to the statistics for unleaded petrol, he said: The opposition is fascinated by models-is it Prismod or Statax?-as if these models had some magical precision about them. They do not have any magical precision and I do not intend to them with any particular precision. That contradicted what he had earlier said. When the honourable member for Pearce (Ms Moylan) asked him a question about tax collections, he said that what we were saying was rubbish and that 'what Prismod does demonstrate is where the benefits1go'. (Time expired) Election Result",72
73,Mr SIMMONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Some time ago the Australian Electoral Commission provided some very interesting statistics relating to the last election. The last election may be a while ago, as far as a lot of the people in the opposition are concerned, but I want to say that the people of Calare topped the nation in making their vote count at the recent federal election. And I might also say that they exercised their usual degree of intelligence in returning, yet again, a Labor member. Lates-. figures from the Australian Electoral Commission show that of the 73,570 votes cast at some 95 polling booths throughout the division of Cal are, only 1,350 of those votes were informal. This means that only 1.8 per cent of the votes cast in Calare were informal. This is the lowest figure of the 147 electoral divisions throughout Australia. It shows that the people of Calare, like so many other electorates that returned government members, had very definite opinions about the election and the result that they wanted to see. People were clearly determined to make their vote count and this is reflected in the very small number of informal votes cast. It is an indication, of course, of their continuing intelligence in supporting Labor members, as they have over the last five elections.",73
74,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2.00 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106A, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Budget 1993-94",73
75,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the evidence given by his department to the Senate Estimates Committee last night that well over half of Australian households could imbue actually be worse off as a result of the budget. Why has the Treasurer been so deliberately misleading Australians by claiming that 90 per cent of Australians will be better off?,73
76,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did watch some of the evidence that was being given to the Senate committee last night by the Treasury, mainly by the Secretary to the Treasury. If the Leader of the Opposition is interested in some of the technicalities of these models, with all of the flaws which have been acknowledged, I simply refer him 'to the transcript of last night's Senate committee. Aboriginal Land Title",73
77,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House how the government intends to proceed with legi-lation in response to the High Court's Mabo decision? Can he also say how the Commonwealth's response will take account of the interests of the economy as well as provide justice to indigenous Australians? Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I draw your attention to the standing orders as they relate to the fact that questions cannot be asked requesting ministers-that includes, I think, the Prime Minister-to announce policy during question time. This is a straight request and I ask that the question be ruled out of order.",73
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question was not to policy, and I am sure that the Prime Minister would be aware in any answer he gives that he should not announce government policy.",73
79,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today the government . has released a detailed outline of its proposed legislation, which will resolve the uncertainties created. by Mabo while ensuring that native title is recognised and treated with fairness and justice. I have today written to premiers and chief ministers giving them a copy of the draft legislation and inviting them to respond in ways which they think can make the final proposals to the bill more positive in terms of the dual aims which the government has set for the legislation-that is, justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in relation to rights granted by the highest court in the land, the High Court, and the integrity of our land management system as one of the essential foundations of the economy. They are the two competing imperatives which the legislation seeks to meet. For six quite intensive months now, the government has gone through the lines of logic and principle in seeking to put together a body of administrative law to handle the decision taken by the High Court which says that Aboriginal traditional customs and titles will be a source of the common law and that within our common law Aboriginal custom and title will be recognised. We have brought together an ungrudging and unambiguous recognition of native title in Australian common law; a fair, rigorous and efficient means'of determining who has native title; where and what the key attributes of that title are in particular cases; a just and workable regime under which dealings in land can go on and which provide clear processes with which our vital land based industries can operate; full security for people holding of interest in land provided by governments in the past at no cost to them; and fair compensation for any extinguishment or impairment of native title. I believe these key principles will produce for us a bill which will be easily the fairest and inost decent piece of Aboriginal land law in Australia, and one that will also advance the national economic interest. We have given ourselves a chance to deal with a problem which has been there for 200 years, and we can make a material advance in the question of reconciliation between Aboriginal and nonAboriginal Australians. The bill has all of the right balances .between development and the imperatives of development-mining exploration, pastoral and tourism-and, on the other hand, the right of Aboriginal people to be asked whether a ,development can go ahead. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is a very important matter. Clearly the Prime Minister is quoting from the formal statement released a couple of hours before ,the House resumed. He is, at the first moment of the House sitting, announcing the policy and legislative guidelines arising froin that statement. It is so important that I ask again that you order him to make a formal prime ministerial statement so that there can be a response after question time.",73
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Leader 'of the National Party would know, the opportunities to make ministerial statements are there as part of the standing orders. If the opportunity to make a ministerial statement is available to ministers, I am sure they will avail themselves of it. There is no power available to the Speaker to order such a course. The Prime Minister is in order, as he is outlining procedure in respect of this matter. Mr Tim Fischer-Given the importance of the matter, he should make a prime ministerial statement.",74
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the National Party.,74
82,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Also in the draft is the option for the states to come back to the Commonwealth with particular institutional arrangements which they might believe better grants serve the states, but which meet the Commonwealth's principles. So, we are not saying to the states, 'This is a fait accompli which you have to accept'. Part of the bill is a mechanism for the states to actually come back and propose adaptatibns to their institutions which they believe can better serve the interests of land management and justice fOf Aboriginal people, while still meeting the Commonwealth principles. "". ' This is late in the piece, but again I make the offer to the Leader of the Opposition: if he wants to get on' board, now is the time. Instead of not having any policy about the prospective issue of native title-that is, the dealing in it or the awarding of it, Of in having economic lise over native title land; in having his policy confined only to the retrospective issues-he has a chance nOw with this legIslation to join some· of his colleague premiers in the conservative states in looking at this piece of legislation, and coming back. This piece of draft legislation is a balanced response to the issues of justice for Aboriginal and Islander people and the economic imperatives of sensible land management to the national economy. It has been the subject of the most intensive effort on the part of ministers and officials over the last six months; of unprecedented consultation with interest groups such as the Aboriginal and Islander community, the mining industry, agriculturalists, the tourism industry and others-and naturally with the states and their officials. The result is, I think, a piece of draft which will become a piece of law that this government will be very, very proud of. It is one which will stand the test of time and will be able to deal with the vexed question of native title to land. In so dealing with it, will deal with this long-running problem of a basis of reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Obfuscation by the coalition parties in the federal parliament on this issue must come to an end, and now there is a draft bill. I am quite happy to let the Leader of the Opposition have it and see whether he can, on this occasion, rise above the pettiness of coalition politics and do something decent in the national interest. Pensioner S-areholdings",74
83,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Now that the government has been forced to amend its iniquitous pension share policy, is the Treasurer going to compensate all those pensioners who sold their shares on the advice of the honourable member for Bowman, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security? Given that the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has branded the government's policy as inequitable, will the government now abandon this pernicious measure entirely?",75
84,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think whenever we talk about this shares measure there is one cruCial point that has to be stated at the outset. This measure was passed into legislation in December last year, and it passed through the Senate. Why did it pass through the Senate? It was bec.ause all opposition coalition tors voted for the measure. Now they come in here and get on their high horse about what an iniquitous thing this is. This would not be law if coalition senators had not all, to a person, voted for it. They should bear that in mind for a start. I am sure that the Prime Minister would say that they have more front than Mark Foys on this issue. Ever since then, of course, we have had the opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Berowra, getting on his high horse and, rather portentously I thought, he has announced on a number of occasions that he was going to hound me and hound the law government to reverse this measure which his lot voted for in the first place. When I hear this reference to people hounding people, I am inevitably led back to the old Elvis Presley song Hound Dog, the one that starts it off, 'He ain't nothin' but a hound dog'. The last two lines are particularly aptMr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Standing order 145 relates to relevance. This is an attempt at humour that the minister is trying to bring to a very serious issue for pensioners and their rights. I do not think he should be making jokes about this. What is more, if he is going to make jokes, he should make them good ones.",75
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat.,75
86,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I wish to take a point of order. Mr Thckey-Quote the standing order.",75
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! With respect to the point of order raised by the honourable member for O'Connor, the Minister for Social Security will come to the specifics of the answer. Is there a further point of order?",75
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point of order goes to the presentation of a point of order under the standing order that the honourable member raised. Mr Thckey-Tell us the number.,75
89,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A point of order in this place is made in the context of the strict technical detail of it. Every time the honourable memsena- ber for O'Connor stands in this place he editorialises and debates, and that is against the standing orders. Further to that point of order, so far I have counted the honourable member for O'Connor's interjections in the course of question time here. There have been 19 of them. I wonder when the honourable member for O'Connor wi\l be called to order on that?",75
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! With respect to the point of order raised by the Leader of the House, it is perfectly correct that honourable members, when rising and seeking the call to raise a point of order, are required to express it in a particular way. To this point in time there has been some tolerance, but that privilege is not to be abused. I have ruled on the point of order.",76
91,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I was just going to draw attention to the final two lines of that immortal song,76
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. The minister will come to the answer.,76
93,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,'He ain't never caught a rabbit and he ain't no friend of mine'.,76
94,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, cut it out; answer the question!",76
95,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To return to the substance of the question, the honourable member for Moncrieff made reference to the Senate committee report. I have had an opportunity to read the Senate committee report. Quite frankly, I have to say that it is a pretty weak piece of analysis. Apart from anything else, it actually raises the question of whether we should even be trying to bring to account the question of accrued capital growth. Quite frankly, if we do not bring to account accrued capital growth in the pensions income test, we will be opening a gigantic loophole that over the years will see the haemorrhaging of hundreds of millions of dollars. I might contrast the position of the opposition and what was said in that Senate committee report with a statement by Norah MCGuire, the national Secretary of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation-the peak organisation for pensioners in this country-on radio this morning. She said: The Government have to close this loophole in the legislation so that the people who actually need help with pensions, with whatever, that they could get it. Because don't forget there's only a certain size to the cake. That is a wise and sensible exposition of the issue and it is a total contrast to the naked political opportunism that We have seen exhibited by the opposition. As all honourable members would know, the government has announced a number of major changes to the effect of this measure. The fact is we are making it a purely prospective measure; there will be no retrospectivity. It will be applied only in respect of shares purchased after 18 August last year', when the budget announcement was made. That exempts the overwhelming majority of pensioners from the effect of it and it certainly takes care of concerns raised by a number of caucus members about the situation of people who have held shares for a go()d many years. The discussions we had with caucus yesterday were highly constructive. On the basis of those discussions, we will be making a change to the measure which preserves the basic intent-and that is to close off a potentially enormous loophole-while at the same time trying to minimise anxiety amongst many people, a great many of whose shareholdings are too small for them to be significantly affected in any case. The changes that the government has announced certainly satisfied my colleagues in the parliamentary Labor Party. They certainly satisfy reasonable pensioners and the Pensioners and Superannuants Federation. The coalition is just playing a disgraceful, opportunistic game. As to people selling shares, what we have said all along about people's decisions to sell or not sell shares is that pepple should be making decisions about the structure of their investment portfolio not on the basis of any particular advantages that they might derive through the pensions incomes test, but on the basis of an appropriately balanced portfolio based on the intrinsic merits of the different kinds of investments. Contrary to all the nonsense we have heard about this measure producing a flight from the share market, there is simply no evidence of that. In fact, since the measure was announced in last year's budget, the number of pensioners declaring ownership of shares has increased substantially. Mr Thckey-Of course, because they did not know about it.",76
96,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What do you mean, they did not know?",77
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will not respond to interjections.,77
98,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There has been the most noisy public campaign one could ever imagine from the network of financial advisers and others with a vested interest. That is nonsense. I saw in the transcript of a radio interview this morning that the Leader of the Opposition went on about the 'meanness' of this measure that he voted for, that his people voted for...:....the terrible meanness of it. the same person; is this Mr Nice Guy who is going to lop $10 billion off outlays and do enormous harm to' a great many people at the bottom in terms of income and wealth? The hypocrisy is absolutely staggering. These protestations of concern from the opposition should be treated with the contempt they deserve.",77
99,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Minister for Finance aware of calls for large-scale cuts to government outlays? What would be the implication of such cuts for the poor and low income earners?,77
100,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of calls for it considerable reduction in the size of the public sector fro,m various conservative commentators, from some business lobbies and, of course, from the opposition. All this is somewhat surprising in the context that has been made clear in recent times. We have virtually the smallest public sector in the OECO and we have taxes at the lowest level of any country in the OECO. But what is being said, however, is that being the lowest in the OECO is not good enough; that what we ha\fe to do is match our Asian neighbours who have a much smaller public sector and lower tax levels than we do. In fact, following the One Nation package and this budget, we will be quite competitive with our Asian neighbours in respect Of business taxation. That is a deliberate decision by us in respect of business taxation. But that is said to be not good enough by the opposition and others who say that we should be matching our Asian neighbours in respect of the total tax levels, not just in relation to business taxes. The shadow Treasurer has been waxiQg lyrical about this in recent times, putting out press statements and making speeches about the importance of reducing our tax levels to those of our Asian neighbours, not just to the lowest among OECO nations. He issued a press statement on 13 August in which he said that the level of taxation in Australia is far too high; that we should be substantially reducing taxes. That statement was made after Is this he had been analysing our level of tax compared with Asian countries. In a speech to the press.club a week or so ago, he pointed out, as evidence of what we should be doing, that our Commonwealth. tax reven-e was 22.2 per cent of GOP compared with 16.3 per cent in South Korea and 19 1h per cent in Malaysia. Apparently, the opposition is saying that we should have a tax level, Public Sector and presumably a public sector, more-or l{1sS of the size found in Malaysia or So-th Korea. That means that we would have to cut tax-s, and hence government outlays, in the region of thr-e to six per cent of GOP-that is, by $12 billion to $24 billion. That is the implication of what the shadow Treasurer is saying around the country. . This is truly amazing stuff. It goes way beyond Fightback. It puts Fightback in the shade. The opposition obviously thinks that it wimped it with Fightback but it is really going to go for it next time. Maybe next time it will cut it 21h times the level in Fightback by going for a $24 billion cut. The implications of cuts in government programs of that order would be absolutely stupendous. We would not be looking at minor cutbacks to, or even substantial surgery on, programs; we would be looking at total abolition of programs left, right and centre. Taking unemployment benefits as an example, to implement this kind of policy, which would give us South Korean tax levels, presumably we would then have a South Korean type welfare system. ' What does South Korea do about unemployment benefits? In Fightback, the .Opposition said it would knock them off after nine months. Things are much tougher than that in South Korea. There are no unemployment benefits in South Korea, nor are there in most other Asian countries. As far as assistance to families is concerned, we spend about $5 1/2 billion a year in payments to families, the bulk of which goes to low income families. Does anyone think that they make those sorts of payments in South Korea? Does anyone think that they make them in Malaysia or anywhere else in the Asian region? There are no such payments in the Asian region. This enormous area of transfer payments to families, particularly to low income families, disappears with the introduction of South Korean or Asian levels of taxation. We have an amazing situation here. We have an opposition alleging in the course of this budget debate and post-budget argument that there has been some terrible imposition on low income earners-which we have proved is not the case. Then, at the same time as criticising some minor decisions which might have had some adverse effect on low income earners when taken in isolation, the opposition is pursuing an overall policy in relation to taxation and outlays which would mean total devastation of programs which are of enormous benefit to families and low income earners in this country; Obviously, the position of the opposition at present is a position of enormous hypocrisy. On each individual issue that comes up, it says, 'This is terrible. Look what you are doing to low income earners. Look what you are doing to the poor. Look what you are doing to average Australians'. Why? Because we are making a cut to a program of minuscule dimensions. . At the same time, the opposition is pursuing a policy where it is saying, 'Let's go out there and cut taxes by $24 billion-cut outlays by $24 billion', while pretending in the process that no-one will get hurt. In reality, the result of a policy of that kind would be an enormous impact on the poor and low income earners of this country. The opposition is guilty of pursuing a course of mammoth hypocrisy. Unemployment",77
101,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will recall his budget claim: The primary objective of this Budget is jobs. How does the Treasurer reconcile this objective with the statement by the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures that almost 30,000 job opportunities will be lost Australia-wide as a result of his budget mark I-or, for that matter, mark 2 or mark 3? Why is his budget costing Australians jobs?",78
102,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-,-It is intriguing that even when the leadership and deputy leadership of the Liberal Party are changed, those opposite still revert to their same bad habits of running down the country. It is all they have ever wanted to do. Now, in their post-budget mentality, they have linked this with a scarifying degree of political and financial irresponsibility as well. What this budget has been firmly hinged on is providing a stimulus to the economy at a time when it is neededa stimulus which is opposed by those opposite-and at the same time creating over the years ahead an environm-nt which is more conducive to investment. Maybe the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not recognise it, but what the Liberal Party policy stands for is: to hell with the deficit. Those opposite would see higher deficits in the years ahead and higher interest rates as a result. They should go back to the New South Wales Employers Federation or the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures and ask themMr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145, which relates to relevance. The question was specifically related to the statement from the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures regarding the loss of 30,000 jobs around Australia. The Treasurer has not addressed that matter in his answer to this question. I would ask you to get him to get back to the question or sit down.",78
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Treasurer is addressing the question of economic growth and its employment consequences. The Treasurer is in order.,78
104,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite should ask those people whom they want to bring forward in defence of themselves today what the consequences would be of a two percent rise in interest rates which would almost certainly flow from the policies which the Leader of the Opposition is advocating. The Leader of the Opposition, who once used to pride himself as being a paragon of fiscal responsibility, now says, 'To hell with the deficit; let it blowout' - with consequences inevitably for higher interest rates. What would that mean for a person with a $50,000 mortgage? A two per cent increase would be $27 extra a month. What would it mean to a small business with a three-year loan of $1oo,000? It' would mean a $96 a month increase in terms of the costs imposed on that small business. This budget is predicated on the fact that there will be growth in employment through the year of 100,000 jobs throughout Australia. But it will not stop there, because we are creating a climate-and this is the central, overriding objective of the budget-in which business investment will occur because we have created an environment not only of lower tax ratesMr Evans interjecting",79
105,Mr SPE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,KER-I warn the honourable member for Cowan.,79
106,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"but also one which will have sustainable lower interest rates and sustainable lower levels of inflation. These are all the objectives which the opposition used to pretend it was interested in, but now it has simply descended into the pit of political opportunism. This is the leader who leads his party by walking backwards. He is not a leader; he is nothing but a laggard. Tax Cuts",79
107,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Prime Minister tell the House how many Australians will benefit from the proposed tax cuts by the government.,79
108,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After yesterday's question time, when the opposition was squirming on the subject of opposing tax cuts for middle income earners, I decided to find out exactly how many people they are seeking to deprive of the $8a week tax cuts. The answer is 2 11z million taxpayers. Of course, that is only taxpayers. If one includes dependants and children, one finds that it is a very large slice of the Australian population. These people would have been disadvantaged by opposition on the part of the coalition to these tax cuts for middle Australians because they would have been denied increases of somewhere between $8 and $10 a week. The Treasurer is right when talking about the spoiling attitudes of the opposition. It has gone from the sort of detail of the Fightback document toAn incident having occurred in the galleryMrKEATING-I have a pen for them any time they want to line up.

118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition!,80
119,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, putting the Leader of the Opposition in order would not go astray either. We have gone from this kind of detail from the opposition to straight, unprincipled opposition against all measures of the government, in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. As we said yesterday, we had a question offered earlier by the-what is her electorate again-honourable member for Moncrieff. Her colleagues voted for the motion in the Senate and in here. We have had that sort of hypocrisy. Now we will have from the Leader of the Opposition absolutely oppositionist tactics-tawdry, oppositionist tactics. There is no sense of responsibility about the measures. The opposition is seeking to undermine the government's budget on its revenue and, in so doing, is also seeking to deny tax cuts for middle income Australians. If the Leader of the Opposition thinks he can conduct himself this way in a three-year parliamentary cycle with this kind of tawdry opportunism and lack of principle, then he will find that the going gets a lot rougher. In the last election, the government had been in office ten years. It went into the election coming from a recession with a million unemployed clocked up in the course of the campaign, and the Liberal Party still could not beat the government. It would only take somebody who possesses the political incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition to pull that off. I warn him and his party",80

If the Leader of the Opposition thinks that this sort of lowbrow oppositionist approach to everything is the sort of flip to the flop of this sort of thing, then he can think again. If he wants to employ that, he will not have to worry about his margin with me; it will stretch out to infinity very quickly as he peels off like the Mars probe into the outer galaxy. He should take heed of the warning, unless the rest of the opposition are more Machiavellian than I think they are-egging him on knowing that he is not going to last. Budget 1993-94",80
124,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Notwithstanding the claims of the Prime· Minister and the Treasurer to the contrary, most observers are of the opinion that the budget is regressive and unpopular. Does the reaction of Labor Party members indicate a widening gulf between the rank and file and the inner sanctum of the cabinet? Can the Prime Minister explain to the House how it is that he and the Treasurer could produce a budget so unpopular with the rank and file of the parliamentary party, the true believers and the ACTU? Finally, does the Prime Minister accept the proposition that this was a budget designed to appease financial markets and that, as Kenneth Davidson argued in the Age last Saturday, the Commonwealth has abdicated its responsibility for unemployment?",80
125,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will always take questions from people who are interested in the Labor movement, who are loyal to the Labor movement, and we will take the veracity of those questions on board. But we do not take them from people who have stood against Labor candidates, who try to down us in our seats and who put the key principle of the Labor movement asunder-a lack of loyalty to the Labor Party and the movement. The honourable member has views about social policy which are somewhat sympathetic to members on this side. Obviously, I do not berate him for that. But he is not for quoting to me, the ACTU, the Caucus or the true believers when he stood quite happily and saw his name lined up against a Labor Party member on the ballot paper. In our terms, that marks him right down. Having said that, let me make this point: over the 10 years of its time in office this government has focused on those who have been low paid and disadvantaged'Dr Kemp interjecting",80
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I warn the honourable member for Goldstein. Mr KEATING...,..to the point, as I indicated yesterday, where a process worker-.,.that is, someone on the base rate of a full income, on the bottom of the metals award, with two children-picked up an increase in disposable income of 15 per cent. Does anybody think that would have happened under a coalition government? Remember, the opposition opposed every wage increase all these years. Let us take the single income family with two children on three-quarters of average weekly earnings, somebody on about $26,000 or $27,000 a year. That is a real increase of 18.7 per cent. I do not apologise for saying that we have dealt with these people first. We have dealt with this category of taxpayers first. We spent the first eight or nine years dealing with the family allowance supplement, supplementary payments for low paid workers, rent assistance and all the other things which have gone to these people-Austudy, which has helped them to educate their children. Giving tax cuts to people on average weekly earnings and just above average weekly earnings is not, I think, regressive, but thing which is entirely reasonable. Then there are all of the other measures which the government has introduced in the course of the budget: the home child-care allowance, which pays $30 a week to the dependent spouse at home looking after dependants; the generalised child-care rebate, and the many other measures which lead Treasury in its model to the conclusion that there are no detriments, but benefits for low income people in the budget. There are benefits right through the income scale because of the operation of tax cuts which come in before average weekly earnings and go up to $50,000. So there are further changes in the budget. The government is committed to its promises such as the dental scheme for beneficiaries and card holders, which is an important social change, as is the generalised child-care rebate. The government is proud of those things. We kept our word and introduced them in the budget and, at the same time, we introduced decent tax cuts for low income people. Mr Downer having entered the chamber",81
127,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here is Shirley Temple. I am always glad to see him back. I know of and accept the honourable member's concerns for people on lower incomes, but he should not reel off in a question to me anything about the true believers or the party faithful. He made a fink of himself by opposing them in the last election and the by-election before that. There are remedies. He can always apply to come back, but it is a big question whether we would ever have him. Business Investment",81
128,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. What is the role of business investment spending in securing sustainable employment growth in Australia over the decade ahead? What steps is the government tflking to encourage the necessary level of business investment spending?,81
129,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Corinella for his question. The way to achieve sustainable and substantial growth in employment will be through growth in world competitive production and world competitive businesses within this country. someThe structural reforms which are proceeding will mean that plant and equipment will have to be used more efficiently. We want to see a greater level of investment than we have seen in recent times to ensure that greater capacity can produce more and employ more people in the process. A very important part of what we are achieving is that more of the investment will come from Australia's own national savings. The government has taken a number of steps with, the objective of achieving this outcome. The' first was the announcement before the election of a reduction in the company rate of tax from 39 to 33 per cent. I note in passing that the opposition apparently is stilI wedded to the idea that company tax should be at the rate of 42 per centcompared with our rate of 33 per cent. How competitive does it think Australia can be under that regime? The government did not' leave it there. We introduced a temporary general investment allowance on top of the accelerated depreciation deductions and the development allowance. The development allowance provides additional concessions on the depreciation of plant and equipment for particular projects over the years ahead. It is designeci to encourage investqlentin both plant and equipment and to achieve it in a way which is consistent with structural change and .micro-economic improvement. As mentioned on earlier occasions, we received 500 applications worth in excess of $100 billion for the development allowance. The authority which administers the allowance has produced its fourth quarterly report, which I have released today. That report reveals that in the last quarter 50 projects to a value of $12 billion were approved for registration under the development allowance arrangements. This is a fourfold increase in the rate of registrations for the March 'quarter. As at the end of June, there were a further 239 applications being evaluated actively by the authority. . Of these new approvals, 80 per cent of the projects registered were in the manufacturing and mining area. Those two sectors accounted for 70 per cent of the capital value of projects. This is over $8 billion worth of investment registered for those areas of mining and manufacturing. I think this does portend well for Australia in terms of future investment in projects both large scale and small scaleprojects which will enhance not only employment opportunities but also Australia's export performance. I just refer to the most recent balance of payments figures for July where we saw a 25 per cent increase in the exports of elaborately transformed manufactures in the three months to July of this year compared with the same period of last year. These are things which Australia can be proud of-the fact we are now making these kinds of sophisticated manufactured goods and finding markets for them beyond our shores in some of the most cQtr.petitive markets in the. world. This is a great compliment to Australian business, and a great compliment to Australian working men and women who are getting behind this objective of exporting more as a means of employing more Australians. I just contrast that with the attitude of the opposition, which is totally negative in this respect; it is always running down the country, always knocking Australian firms, always knocking Australian workers, and now, on top of all that irresponsibility, it has added the additional layer of fiscal irresponsibility where it has now' become the high deficit, high interest rate party which is totally inimical to the interests of Australian industryMr Tim Fischer-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The coalition has had just three questions in the course of this 45-minute question time due, to a large extent, to the length of answers by the ministers, and ministerial statements masquerading as answers. I ask that you, Mr Speaker, cause the Treasurer to draw ·his answer to it close. I think he might well now have done soMr SPEAKE:R-I think so. Mr Tim Fischer-but I ask that you also rule on the generality of that particular matter, the length of ministerial answers .",81
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Leader of the National Party would know-I made comments in this place some time ago about this-the responsibility for taking action with regard to the length of answers, and indeed even the question of relevance which has been raised from time to time in this place, falls to the members, through the Standing Committee on Procedure, for this parliament to act upon. Reports have been presented to the government on this particular issue. It therefore is incumbent upon the government of the day to respond to those reports.",82

135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order!,83
136,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have. a question for you, because today, as you would be aware, I approached the dispatch box and obtained the call on a point. of order. In my latest c<?py of the standing orders, standing order 99 states: Upon a question of order being raised, the Member called to order shall resume his seat, and, after question of order has been stated to the Speaker by the Member rising to the question of order, the Speaker shall give his ruling thereon. In light of the fact that today the Prime Minister did not resume his seat, and in fact continued to speak, I ask you: has any change occurred in standing order 99 of which I am not aware that caused me, and not the Prime Minister, to be warned in this situation? Mr Speaker-In respect of your question, the short answer is no. On a number of occasions today when people were taking points of order at the dispatch box, again the standing orders, strictly speakirig, were infringed. I respectfully submit that both sides of the parliament know the standing orders and they should adhere to them.",83
137,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Standing order 55 states: When a Member is speaking, no Member may converse aloud or make any noise or disturbance to interrupt him. In the course of question time, the honourable member for O'Connor interrupted 106 times. I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether that is or is not disorderly. Motion Mr SPEAKER-I am pleased that the Leader of the House has drawn the attention of all honourable members to the standing order and its number. Might I suggest that in the period of the break between now and next Monday, when we resume, everybody, from both sides of the House, read it. Personal References to Members Government Policy Announcements",83
138,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, during question time today a number of references were made to individuals. I want to draw your attention and the House's attention to standing orders 76, 77 and 78, which require you to intervene and members not to use words or imply improper motives or to make personal reflections on members. I suggest to you that the nature and character of many of the answers to questions are quite contrary to what these standing orders require. While I understand that in the heat of the debate and in the hype of some of the emotions that might run words escape which should not, Mr the Speaker, I suggest to you that the answers and the content generally have moved far more towards personal abuse, which is contrary to what the standing orders state is, acceptable. Mr Speaker, I also draw your attention to standing order 144 and to the difficulties we have had on two occasions this week with respect to the announcement of government policy. The first occasion was by the Minister for Justice. The second occasion was today by the Prime Minister. On those two occasions a major statement of policy was made during a very long answer in this place. Mr Speaker, while I understand the limitations to .which you have referred about the recommendations of the procedure committee, you know that absolute authority in this place rests in your hands. I suggest to you that it would be appropriate if it were possibleMr Downer-Simon, when did you first become aware of the wine tax? Mr Crean-Come over here and we'll discuss it over a glass of chardonnay.",83
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! I do not think the right honourable member for New England needs the help that he is getting at· the moment. He is doing very nicely himself.,84
140,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I suggest it would be appropriate if you required ministers who wished to advise the Australian electorate on matters of significant moment that they pay tribute to this place and make those policy statements in here but, whether they make them after question time or by way of the introduction of legislation, they do it in such a way that there can be reasonable debate. Mr SPEAKER"":""""The right honourable member for New England has made a number of points which I think go to several issues that have been discussed here this afternoon and to points of order that have been raised in relation to the standing orders. Many Speakers from time to time have been placed in a similar situation, as the right honourable member pointed out, when robust debate, particularly in question time, is occurring and it is often very difficult to hear all particular words that raise offence. Where generaIly that is the case, Speakers have responded accordingly and asked for words to be withdrawn. Certainly that is what I have proposed and in fact acted on when I have heard what has been said. I take the point that the overall standard of behaviour in this chamber rests with all honourable members and with a knowledge of the standing orders. Clearly, if the right honourable member for New England is requiring that a strict and formal interpretation of the letter of every standing order is adhered to by the chair, that is something which I am prepared to entertain. In the interests of getting this House operational some tolerance is given. His points are well made, and I ask honourable members to reflect upon them. Mr Rocher- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. In the ruling which you have just given-and I do not wish to canvass it-you referred to the nature of debate in the context of question time. I think that is where part of the problem lies, in that it is not a debate. This side of the parliament does not get a chance to argue the rubbish that is doled out every day by that mob over there.",84
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The honourable member's point is well made. It was not my intention to refer to debate in question time, but rather in a broader sense within the parliament. Question . time obviously is controlled by the standing orders, where questions are asked and answers are to be given. I certainly would hope that ministers do reflect upon the length of the answers that are being given at present. NA",84

146,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In the course of question time, which for some of the time. I was watching on television in my office, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) made the amazing assertion that I supported a reductibn in government spending in the vicinity of $24 billion. He based this on a press release that I put out on 13 August 1993 comparing Australia's economic performance with that of East Asia. I said in the press release: As this reportwhich is a report on that comparative performanceclearly illustrates, it is a simple fact that Australian commerce and industry are not given a ""fair go"" by Mr Keating's high taxes and irresponsible economic management. It is a very good point. I then went on to say: Of course, with its much more sophisticated welfare system, government spending as a proportion of GDP is inevitably higher than in Asia. Why did the minister not make that point? Why did he not tell people when he was telling this monstrous untruth?",84

170,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,Papers are tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the papers will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and Hansard. The schedule read as followsMedical Research Endowment Act-National Health and Medical Research Council-Report for 1992. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the following Medical Research Endowment Act---':National Health and Medical Research Council-Report for 1992. Debate (on motion by Mr Sinclair) adjourned. NA,86
171,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I move: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Monday, 6 September 1993 at 3.00 p.m. The reason why the government requests this of the House is that, as honourable members would be aware, we have a very distinguished visitor visiting at that time and it is the intention to ensure that the state luncheon is conducted in a reasonably civilised fashion. For that reason we seek to have the House come back at 3 o'clock. Mr - INCLAIR (New England-Acting Manager of Opposition Business) (3.03 p.m.)-The opposition does not object to this motion on the basis that the House will presumably go ahead with the normal proceedings at 3 p.m., and there will be a question time. I ask the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) to confirm that that is so. On that basis, the opposition accepts and understands the motion. and supports it.",86
172,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I cannot confirm that that is the case. The issue of question time will be a matter for determination at that time. It is not a matter to be determined at this point.,86
173,Mr SINCLAIR,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"If it is true that there is no guarantee that there will be a question time, I do not think the coalition could accept the announcement by the Leader of the House. There is every reason for a person who is in control of himself and of this House to be able to program at least a weekend ahead. This is Thursday. At this stage I would have thought it was quite predictable that there would be quite a bit of legislation. Already the government has taken action to deny the opposition access to matters of public importance and we now cannot move for the suspension of standing orders. There is absolutely no basis on which the opposition can accept a postponement of the sitting of the House-albeit that we have a very distinpaper: guished visitor whom we would all like to meet and to whom we would like to give proper recognition-if the government cannot agree that there should be a normal question time. . The people of Australia need to understand that today during question time, as the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) identified, we had in fact three questions. If we put them down as taking about a minute each, it means that the time available for any comment on major policy issues has been reduced to about three minutes a day. That is appalling. It is a totally inadequate amount of time. As I mentioned in a point of order that I raised with you, Mr Speaker, today the government made a major policy announcement on the Mabo decision of the High Court. That is a fundamental policy decision affecting federal relationships within Australia, affecting land title, affecting development, affecting export income, affecting Aboriginal Australians-affecting all Australians-and we have had no time to even talk about it. Now we are told that on Monday it does not seem as though it will be possible to have a question time. Again I put to the Leader of the House that, surely to goodness, he can plan ahead so that there will be at least threequestion quarters of an hour available-from 3 o'clock to 3.45-for question time, and we can then proceed to government business. If that undertaking is given, I will be quite happy to support the motion.If it is not, then I advise the Leader of the House and the government that the ,opposition is' not prepared to accept the postpo,nement sought.",86
174,Mr LIEBERMAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to support the Acting Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Sinclair) on this occasion. As I understand the position, the government is saying that it does, not 'yet know whether it can agree to question time taking place on Monday. It seems to me that it is impossible and wrong for the House to accept the motion of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). I suggest that this matter be set aside until suth time as he can inform the House of his government's proposals. If the Leader of the House is allowed to get away with this, he will be able to circumvent almost everything in this place. I suggest that the proper procedure is for him to either withdraw or defer putting his motion until he can report to the House whether the government wishes to curtail question time. It is impossible for the coalition to accept the treatment that is being meted out now. We should be guaranteed question time and the House should be given an explanation as to why the Leader of the House cann<?t provide an answer to us now.",87
175,Mr SLIPPER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The remarks, of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) when questioned by ,the Acting Manager of Opposition Business, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), in relation to whether we were to have a question time on Monday indicate to me that he was really giving us a code for 'no question time'. In this country we have a government which has been proven to be the government of the true deceivers. Indeed, the Leader of the House, whom I respect greatly, has come in here, and declined to give a guarantee that we will have a question time. If we are to have a democracy, if we are to keep the government on the ropes-as indeed we have this week-we have a right to a time. It is clear that both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)-who should resign-are in real trouble. They are running scared, they are frightened, and they will use any means to avoid accountability to the Australian people. The government has refused to guarantee that the opposition will have a question time on Monday. I think the suggestion by my colleague the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) that this question should be deferred until the Leader of the House can give us a definitive answer is the right way to go. As the right honourable member for New England mentioned, it is entirely reasonable that the House should resume an hour later on Monday, provided that we have a-question time. I ask the Leader of the House to consider very seriously deferring the putting of this motion so that he can tell us whether we will have a question time; whether the government will observe at least one convention of parliamentary government, thereby permitting the opposition to put, serious questions about matters of great moment to the government of the day. ' Mr TUCKEY (O'Connor) (3.10 p.m.)-It was only a week or so ago that we had the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in here bemoaning the denigration of this chamber. There is nothing more fundamental to this chamber than question time. It is recognised by everybody, I thought, bar the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who on one occasion in this place told us that question time was a privilege extended to the oarliament by the executive-something wr.kh his own side of politics has disagreed with to some degree. After all the times I have ridiculed the backbench members of the Labor party for the way they have been denigrated by their executive in question time, I was a bit interested to see the Leader of the House reported as promising those members in caucus the other day that they might be able to write their own questions for once. The Leader of the House has been in government for 10 years and, all of a sudden, he is in a position where he will give his backbench members the chance to write and ask a few questions in the interests of the people who put their trust in those backbench members at election time. It has not happened yet, as all those backbenchers know. They are still .there trotting out those poorly written ministerial questions. If the government feels obliged to honour diplomatic commitments and entertain an important dignitary, that is fine-it is a reason which has been used in the past to delay the opening of parliament-but it is the first time. I have ever heard this motion come before the parliament where there is no guarantee that the first action that will occur when the parliament does sit is the commencement of question time. We know why. This government used to boast under its previous leader that it had as much question time as possible. In fact, the government used to delight in question time as an opportunity to deal with the opposition. All of a sudden, the opposition has all the running because, notwithstanding that we are getting down to only three questions in one sitting, the simple fact is that those questions are penetrating and the ministers' answers, long as they are, all try to create furphies. Today we had the Prime Minister trotting out yesterday's argument which was totally discredited in the press, totally discredited in the media, today. The media just did not believe him. The media ,know very well that, when it comes to our attempts as an opposition to defeat the fuel taxes, the sales tax, iniquitous retrospective tax on leave and the iniquitous tax on wine that will destroy jobs by the thousands in both Liberal and Labor electorates, the Prime Minister tries to turn that into something and claim that we are trying to remove the tax cutS. Yesterday, when I wandered around the press gallery, the two things that the press gallery was conscious of that made the Prime Minister's statement and logic juvenile were that, firstly, out of his own mouth he had said that his' budget deficit act, which is under a considerable constitution question, could be amended; and, secondly, everybody was aware that if he allows his budget deficit act to be rolled he will still be stuck with l-a-w, he will still be stuck with the first piece of legislation he wrote. In fact, in a general sense, although they will wait a little longer, most taxpayers will be better off with that bit of l-a-w. The Prime Minister's second attempt to stand up here at question time and paint the scenario did not convince the press gallery. At least that attempt was a little more moderate today. The Leader of the House did not have to pull on the coat of the Prime Minister every now and again to try to cool him down. What did the press say? 'You have to be able to control yourself before you can control your Treasurer'. We saw the raving and ranting that has been going on in question time. We saw the total abuse of question time today. Why? Because the Government is frightened. Mr Crean-Oh, you should talk; look at you!",87
176,Mr TUCKEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"We will give ministers their tum. We will ask the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), 'What do you know about the budget, Simon?'. The minister did not know about wool. He did not know the government was going to increase the wool tax, he did not know the government was going to put on a wine tax, and he is running around the countryside saying to his constituency, 'It wasn't my fault; don't blame me'. He is some sort of minister to let that that happen. He is irrelevant if he did not know that was going on-and he did not know. The minister for primary industries did not know that the wine industry would be devastated, the wool industry would be devastated, that fuel tax would be imposed on distillate, and all the rest. It is necessary, of course, to move an amendment to this particular motion. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House, at its rising, subject to rhere being not less than a 45 minute question time, adjourn until Monday, 6 September 1993, at 3 p.m ....",88
177,Mr SHARP,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to second the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). It is a very important point that he is trying to make-the same important point that was put earlier by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinc1air)-that the people of Australia elected us to represent them in their parliament, a parliament born of democracy. Over the last few weeks here in Canberra, we have seen democracy being denied to the people of Australia. The opposition is being denied the right to speak on behalf of all the people that we represent. Today, we had a total of three questions in question time. As the right honourable member for New England pointed out, that means that the whole of the opposition's views and the whole of its debate are limited to a total of three minutes. At the same time, over the course of 45 minutes, the government stood berating us with personal abuse, denigrating us and even-as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did with one of his remarks-the people in the gallery. The amendment moved by the honourable member for O'Connor is absolutely and utterly essential, because if the amendment is not carried there will be no opportunity for an opposing view or different thought to be put in the parliament when it resumes next week. If that is the case, the people of Australia are right to ask themselves, 'What has happened to our democracy? Where is the voice of opposition?' . The opposition is no longer given the right to have a matter of importance debated in the House. That was knocked off this week. We no longer have the right to show our dissent in the form of a censure motion or by suspension of standing orders. As a result, the voice of the opposition has been strangled. Unless we support this amendment and the parliament votes for it, I am afraid to say that people in Australia will quite rightly believe, as that gentleman in the gallery did this afternoonMr Thckey-There were 10 of them.",89
178,Mr SHARP,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"As other people in the gallery today and others yesterday believe, this parliament has become a farce and the Prime Minister, the person who is supposed to represent all of Australia's. interests, is solely interested in representing his own narrow interests. They are not even the interests of the Labor Party any more, as illustrated by the attack made by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on their own caucus colleagues at the economic committee of the caucus last Monday night. What this parliament is rapidly becoming is not the voice of the people, not the symbol of democracy that this nation deserves to have, should have and needs to have; it is becoming a symbol of the Prime Minister's self-interest. He is denying us the right to a voice. Indeed, he is denying the opposition the right to do such things as move a censure motion, such as the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) gave notice of on Tuesday. The honourable member for Mayo gave the following notice: That this House censures the Treasurer for bringing down a Budget of betrayal and unfairness that: (1) hits poor and low income Australians the hardest; (2) totally fails to address Australia's underlying economic problems of unemployment, debt, deficits and savings; (3) even with its most recent changes, hits Australians with a massive tax slug that makes them worse off; (4) makes a total mockery of the Budget-making processes; and (5) has resulted in the Treasurer losing the confidence of his own party and the trust and . confidence of the Australian community. That is the sort of view, the sort of debate, that this government is trying to strangle. I believe those views have a right to be heard. If this government is going to try to deny those views being expressed, then it should be judged by the Australian people for what it is: a government totally out of touch with the ordinary Australian; a government that is doing harm :to all Australians' through its budget process; and a government that has at heart not the interests of everybody, but the interests of itself. Indeed, I second the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for O'Connor in the hope that tl:le Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), will agree with the views that have been expressed by members on this side of the House and, ensure that parliamentary democracy works, and it can only ,work,with an opposition that has a voice. If ment is not carried, then the opposition will not have a voice, the people of Australia will not be served properly by their parliament or government, and democracy in Australia will be a much worse-off .institution. I urge the Leader of the House and members on both sides to support the amendment moved by' the honourable member for O'Connor. By so doing, we will be standing up for democracy and the rights of ordinary Australians to have opposing views expressed in the parliament that is supposed to ,represent them.",89
179,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,We are having a question time. We are not wasting any more. time here. I will move that the question be put. Mr Andrew-You are using your numbers.,90
180,Mr BEAZLEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I will use the numbers. We will get on with the business. The fact is that, unlike the situation that existed between 1976 and 1982 when 10 per cent of the days went, without question times, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) takes these things, and the opportunity he has to discuss the issues the day in question time, very seriously. There will be a question time, despite the fact that the normal hour for question time will have been eliminated on Monday. There will be a question time now at 3 o'clock. However, were this amendment to be put, the House would be in a position where it would be voting down this proposition. Of course, that would be an unfortunate thing for this House to have to do.",90
181,Mr TUCKEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I seek leave to withdraw my amendment in light of the advice we have just received from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). Leave granted.,90
182,Mr TUCKEY,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,I formally. withdraw my amendment and I invite my seconder to support me in light of the statement just made by the Leader of the House.,90
183,Mr SHARP,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I second the withdrawal of the amendment and say that I am thankful that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has decided to allow for a question time.

186,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,I present the second report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. Public Accounts Committee Report,90
187,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,by leaw-I present the following Finance minutes on of reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts: Finance minute on report 324Commonwealth support for private sector investment in research and deve1opmentVolume 2 of a report on research and development; and Finance minute on report 325-the Midford Paramount case' and related matters. I seek leave of the House to make a statement in connection with the minutes. Leave granted.,90
188,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"I wish to make a few brief comments in relation to the report by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts on the Midford Paramount case. The Finance minute I have just tabled presents responses by the Australian Customs Service and other agencies to the committee's 129 recommendations on matters of administration. The government is yet to respond to the five recommendations of a policy nature in the report, and I would like to comment on the first recommendation in the Midford report. It states: That the defendants in the Midford Case and be compensated for their unrecovered material and legal costs. In response to this recommendation, the Prime Minister(Mr Keating) established an interdepartmental committee, or IDC, to assess the , amount of compensation payable. The IDC has yet to finalise its deliberations. The committee is aware that one of the compensation claimants has become gravely ill as a result of his participation in the Midford inquiry. His state of health is worsening as he waits for the outcome of theIDC process. On behalf of the committee, I wish to express our serious concern that the IDC should complete its assessment as soon as possible. I urge the government to act quickly in considering the issue of compensation to all concerned. There is a pressing need for justice to be done.",91
189,Mr MACKELLAR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I notice that this matter was not included on the blue. I do not know how this situation came about, but I raise it because this matter is of significant importance, as the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) has demonstrated. It does not give the opposition a chance to respond to the brief statement that the honourable member has made. It is a matter of such significance that it would be good if you, Mr Deputy Speaker, could, firstly, investigate as to why the matter did not appear on the blue and the let the House know and, secondly, make sure that such a thing does not happen again.",91
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Jenkins)As the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) would realise, the blue is a guide. The Clerk was given late advice. We can try to find out for the honourable member the circumstances in which this matter has been brought forward. Perhaps the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) is in a position to explain to the House, and I give him indulgence to do so.",91
191,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am not sure why this matter was not included on the blue. It came before our committee yesterday, and members of the opposition on that committee are well aware of our concern as I have raised here. I thought it was appropriothers ate to add that today. I am not sure why it was not included on the blue, but it was as a result of yesterday that I tabled these minutes today. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1993-94 Second Reading Debate resumed from 31 August, on motion by Mr Dawkins: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Dr Wooldridge had moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes: (1) the likelihood offoreshadowed amendments to the Budget; (2) the vacillations and confusion about the Budget; (3) the pernicious impact on low income Australians; (4) the failure to reduce unemployment; and (5) the continuing abrogation of responsibilities towards the long-term unemployed"".",91
192,Mr HORNE,COMMITTEES,"Paterson) (3.28 p.m.)......:..1t gives me a· great deal of pleasure to support Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94. This budget represents the difference between a government that has an economic plan for the future of this country and an opposition that, in its state of post-GST depression, is devoid of any feasible, constructive comment. I believe that this budget will work and that it will bring renewed prosperity and employment growth. But it is important to consider the position of the opposition in relation to this budget. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has stated that he will oppose it at every place he can, and we are seeing the unprecedented use of the Senate to oppose government policy. Some fear 1975 revisited; some say that he would not be so stupid. But we must question the lengths to which the opposition is driven. While the budget was being formulated, the Leader of the Opposition was demanding the government honour its tax cuts. The government has honoured them, and now the Leader of the Opposition is opposing them. (Quorum formed) I find it interesting, after putting up with half an hour of the opposition trying to determine the relevance of this place, that it continually calls for quorums to deny members of the government the opportunity to speak. That is the policy of the opposition and I guess it will continue. Before I was rudely interrupted,· I asked, 'What is the position of the Leader of the Opposition?'. The· answer is simple: the opposition just does not want this budget to work. It will work because the labor government will make it work. The signs of economic recovery are already evident and this budget quite correctly is the proper mediumterm strategy. It is seen by economic observers as the stimulus to propel our industrial base, our commerce and our work force into the 21st century so that Australia will be in the most competitive trading position that it has ever experienced. A budget is only part of the economic strategy of a government. Changes have been brought about over the past decade by a succession of Labor governments and this budget is an integral part of those changes. The restructuring of Australian industry was planned; it did not just happen. It is a positive response to the policies of this side of the House. There is no opposition input whatever. The Button car plan was denigrated by the opposition as a disaster. The results are that we are selling cars to Europe and South-East Asia and we are selling motors to Germany. Who would have dreamed a decade ago that our beleaguered iron and stciel industry would now be exporting steel to ·California? In my own electorate of Paterson we have the biggest aluminium smelter in the Southern Hemisphere, and only this year an international consortium had enough confidence to open a third pipeline at an investment of over $650 million. In spite of the depressed world prices for commodities output has exceeded expectations. Many industries tell us that the Australian economy is successfully restructuring and how well it is performing. Our concentration on exports is yielding dividends. The budget builds on those initiatives. The opposition has claimed that the budget will hurt families but this ignores the independent studies showing that 90 per cent of all workers will be better off. The opposition has ignored the fact that interest rates have made homes more affordable than at any time in the past 20 years. The boom in home building, one of our greatest private employers, is a result of our government's policies. In my electorate, towns such as Maitland, Nelson Bay, Raymond Terrace and the areas of the Great Lakes are enjoying a surge in growth that brings about added services and jobs. We have not heard from the opposition about the effect of reduced interest rates on business, especially on the cost of leasing expensive plant and equipment, so necessary to the manufacturing and transport industries. The opposition conveniently has ignored the cuts in company tax that will allow our very diverse industrial base to reinvest. The Leader of the Opposition claims that he will set up Senate committees to listen to people. He had better listen to the business community about how it welcomes the fiscal policies of the Labor government. In fact, listening seems to be a newfound virtue in the Leader of the Opposition. I bet he wishes he had listened to the people about the GST. As with any budget, we could always wish for more. Much of my electorate is rural-and rural Australia is hurting even though our country happens to be the lowest taxed country in the OECD. Investment in infrastructure is sorely needed. Under our current system of accounting, investment in infrastructure increases the deficit. I do not believe it should be so. Such investment should be seen for what it is-an investment. Roads and railways are permanent assets. They will not only make rural Australia competitive but their construction will provide jobs in country areas for many years. But this budget is about not only establishing· long-term economic security but also delivering on its election promises to continue to build on reforms, so all Australians can know true social justice. These were the promises I campaigned on and these are the promises I am proud to see honoured. My electorate is typical of many semi rural areas. It has a higher number of young families than the national average, more aged people and more people renting from government authorities. All these people, from time to time, need access to the highest standards of medical care-yet the proportion of hospital and nursing home beds, hostel places, general practitioners and child care places are below the state and national averages. That is why I particularly commend the health care and family measures in this budget. They are inspiring in their vision and scope. Our Medicare system is strongly supported by the people of my electorate. It is no wonder that we are the envy of the Western world. Now Australians can look forward to a comprehensive health care package, to improved services and cut hospital waiting times. I am also particularly pleased that our government has responded to community demands and retained optometry benefits. I applaud the fact that this budget will see more than 200,000 superannuants able to buy their medicines at concessional rates, and the doubling of palliative care funding will ensure that terminally ill patients can be cared for a comfortable and pain free environment. Some $278 million has been allocated for a new dental health program to give low income Australians access to better dental services. The proposal to develop a public patient hospital charter, funding to help hospitals and other organisations adopt best practices in workplace reform and $30 million for the national women's health program and health services to be set up for homeless youth are just some of the more innovative measures of this budget. This budget will also provide for our aged. I am particularly pleased by the increase in the number of community aged care packages which will provide hostel level care in people's homes. It is essential that our elderly citizens have quality, affordable residential care which respects their rights and dignity when they are no longer able to support themselves. In this International Year of the Family, it is especiillly pleasing to see this budget committing funds for new policy initiatives for Australian families. The young families in my electorate are going to be delighted with the provision of extra childcare places, for long day care, family day care and after-school care. These are things that the opposition continues to ignore. The new home child-care allowance is fulfilling an election promise, and it is a recognition that many women choose to stay at home to care for their children. The level of unemployment in this country is unacceptably high, and obviously will remain so until we have the economic growth that this budget will deliver. This budget has to balance the demands of economic rationalism with fundamental social justice. We do not have to tell the people in my electorate or any other electorate that times are tough, that recovery is going to be slow. They do not want easy handouts at the expense of long term gains; they are willing to share the load. But they expect that the most needy and the most disadvantaged will be supported. That is why I ask the House to support the social security budget. It will provide additional help for unemin ployed people with an increase in the newstart allowance and the mature age allowance for those over 60 who are facing difficulties in the current labour market. But let us just look at the positive measures to assist the unemployed. The budget will fund over half a million places in labour market programs. Having worked as a coordinator. of these programs at Maitland college of TAFE, and having personal knowledge of the skillshare programs in my electorate and the Hunter Valley Training Co., I can testify to the wonderful success of these programs not only in terms of job outcomes but also in the development of self-confidence of many trainees who, after completing such a course, go on to further education. One of the most significant initiatives regional innovation for employment projects. Local communities will be able to explore ways to create employment opportunities in their own region for their own people. This is an exciting challenge which I believe caring and sensitive communities all over Australia will welcome. But, while we must provide help for long-tenn unemployed, improved services for disadvantaged young and homeless people and security and stability for our older people, we must also play an active role in job creation. This budget will help smalIer and medium manufacturing finns, such as those in my electorate in the Hunter ValIey, to find export markets through the National Industry Extension Service, export access and a network of one-stop shops for information on government assistance. My electorate also has important timber, dairying, cattle and agriculture industries. I strongly support the allocation of $406.8 for the rural adjustment scheme, $22.6 million for the agribusiness development program and $1.3 million for the clean food export program. The Hunter will be a winner from this budget. It is an area of fantastic potential like many regions in Australia, is poised on the threshold of a new and exciting future. Tourists also come to my electorate for the beautiful beaches, lakes, wilderness areas and, of course, for the fine Hunter wines. I am certainly concerned about the wholesale sales tax on wine. However, I would point out that this industry is closely related to the tourism industry, and this budget recognises that tourism is a major generator of jobs. I am giving notice now that I will be seeking a significant funding under the regional tourism development program for the constituents of Paterson and, indeed, all of the Hunter region. This budget is the result of community response. I thank wannly the people in my electorate who took the time to phone and to write to me about this budget and the people I spoke to personally on the street and at meetings I attended. I was pleased to take to caucus the modifications they saw necessary. That was no sign of weakness: that was a sign of the strength of the Australian Labor Party. . The increased rebate for low income earners, is the the reduction in the differential between leaded and unleaded fuel, eye tests under Medicare, the retrospective taxing of long service leave payments and, since last night, the paper profits on shares to be removed from pensioners incomes are innovations that were brought about by listening to people. Let me remind the House that under this government there are now more people receiving not only pensions but higher pensions in real tenns than at any time in the history of this nation. That has been brought about under 10 years of Labor government. I believe this budget deserves the support of the whole House, and of the Senate too, because it is a blueprint for economic growth and social democracy. .",91
193,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES, Mr Speaker,94
194,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,This will be a great speech.,94
195,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"I thank the honourable member. On 17 August this year, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) brought down probably one·of the most disliked and horrible budgets in living memory. The reaction that spread across Australia as a result was unprecedentand, ed. I remind the House that that budget was brought down against the background of 10 years of economic mismanagement and of an election that was won by the government lying to the Australian people and using surrogates such as the trade union movement-which I see kicked in several million dollars in that campaign-which also lied to the Australian people. It is clear now that the government has lost control of the parliamentary agenda. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) does not know whether he is coming or going; we have had one of the deputy speakers already suspended from the House for calling a frivolous quorum; we have had a caucus in open revolt against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer; and there have been daily stories of frantic and dismayed backbenchers arguing against the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister swearing back at them and abusing them. More and more detail of that is coming out. One e;'(ampIe is that on the AM program on ABC radio of 31 August John Shovel an said: The devil makes work for idle hands and while Prime Minister Keating courted the Democrats his backbench had plenty of time to plot. They laid their trap and into it walked an unsuspecting Paul Keating and his Treas).lrer John Dawkins. The meeting of the Caucus economic committee was designed .to smootQ the path prior to the day's Caucus meeting--:-a bid by Mr Keating and Mr Dawkins to head 6ff an ugly confrontation. Instead they were ambushed. MPs poured through the doors of the committee meeting. As many as sixty MPs turned out with 40 taking the opportunity to bucket the Budget and Presidential style of the Keating Government. The attendance was impressive-more than a usual tum out for a full Caucus meeting. MPs couldn't wait any longer and the Prime Minister was pinned to his seat as one appointment with the Democrats leader went by, followed by another and another",94
196,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,He should have been pinned there longer.,95
197,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"Exactly. It continued: Stunned MPs last night described the meeting as amazing, unprecedented, wild, the most significant Caucus meeting in a couple of decades, and a number of others said never has a Prime Minister and Treasurer been so hU!11i1iated. Russ Gorman, a NSW right wing MP. said JQhn Dawkins and Finance Minister, Ralph WilIis were tired and a spell on the backbench wouldn't hurt. One of the Prime Minister's strongest SUPportlfrs, Gary Punch, convenor of Mr Keating's own faction and a Parliamentary Secretary, was involved in heated exchanges when he told Mr Keating and Mr . Dawkins don't try and pass the problems of the Budget onto the Caucus. It is you people at the end of the table. For three hours Caucus flexed its muscle and Paul Keating, the man Senator Graham Richardson described as having more power in the Labor Party than Bob Hawke ever drc<amed of, was powerless. That is pretty heavy stuff by any standard. That.. has been going on for some time now. Others have also bagged the budget. The President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, said that he could not defend the indefensible. The head union serang in New South Wales, Michael Easson, said that the budget was an act of bastardry. The public has given it a unanimous thumbs down. It seems to me there are only two people in Australia who really support it-the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The Prime Minister has become an unedifying spectacle. He has been going' feral in question time this week., Some people are rechristening question time lying time. We have had a lot of blustering, abusing and defying of the chair. The Prime Minister has full been very agitated and only yesterday the Leader of the House, had to take a couple of long points of order so that the Prime Minister could regather his temper. The Prime Minister has been rolled in cabinet on Mabo. The stance he took on the Wik claim was coloured because of his personal animosity towards Premier Goss and, I venture to say, his misunderstanding of what the Wik claim was really about. Apart from that, he has been rolled by Senator Kernot on the budget. He has. been rolled by caucus in open defiance, as I have said, and I guess he is about to be rolled again by the Greens over the weekend.",95
198,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,What about industrial relations?,95
199,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"Yes, industrial relations too is another back-off area. It seems that the Prime Minister is losing status and authority daily. ' He is obviously becoming uneasy in the chamber. He is defying conyentions; he is gagging debate. If we cast our minds back to the Thursday after the budget when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) gave his reply, the Prime Minister petulantly refused to be in the chamber. That may seem a trivial point to some, but in the week after the budget when parliament was not sitting ' and I was going around my electorate I was staggered at the number of times that was raised with me in speaking to constituents. Mr Braithwaite-His nose is growing longer, too.",95
200,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"--':'His nose is growing longer. He is becoming known as Pinocchio. We have parliamentary draftsmen in this place. I feel sorry for them; they do not know what sort of legislation to d-aw up because the government does not know yet. The government is asking them, it seems; to do unconstitutional things: to put more than one tax in one bill in complete defiance of the constitution. Today in this country we have a situation of high farce, unprecedented chaos, open r-voIt amongst the caucus and a Prime Minister. who is losing control. The Prime Minister is clearly feeling the pressure. What can we say about the Treasurer? He seems to be lost in the job. It is in many ways clearly beyond him. He is resorting to long, monotonous dirges in question time, becoming an embarrassment, I would say, even to his own party. One day he is in here assuring us that there will be no changes, that these are fixed forever, and the next day he is preaching the virtues of the changes that he opposed only the day before. Surely the Labor Party is not so bert-ft of talent that it cannot get a better Treasurer than the one that occupies the position now. We have budget mark 2-the KernotKeating budget. Presumably tomorrow, or early next week, it will be mark 3-the Chamarette-Margetts-Keating budget. Who knows-perhaps it will be the HarradineKeating mark4 budget after that. I think people should understand what the Democrats have agreed to support. They have agreed to support a massive increase in sales tax right across the board. That is on a bar of soap, toilet paper,. toothpaste, a refrigeratora whatever one buys will go up compliments of the Democrats. The Democrats have also agreed to $1,400 million extra in fuel tax every year from 1996-97.",95
201,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,How much?,96
202,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"A massive amount of money-$1,400 million-will be ripped off country people and everybody in Australia who uses transport in one form or another, and that is everybody. They have also agreed to a massive and retrospective increase in tax on the lump sum annual leave component, and that is hitting constituents in my electorate.",96
203,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,"Aren't ,they supposed to represent the poor people?",96
204,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"One would think so, but I think they have lost sight of their original goal when Don Chipp used to lead them. They have been bought off by an extra $1 a week tax rebate to those earning less than $23,000. The low income earners have been truly sold out in this country. Leaded fuel will go up 7c a litre, unleaded fuel will go up 5c a litre and diesel will go. up 5c a litre. I calculate the cost to the average country person who just uses a car will be about $500 a year. It is the freight industry in particular that is really hit with these fuel increases. It is devastating to the industry. As the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who is at the table, pointed out to me the other day, the freight costs alone will add an extra $3 a week to the average family's grocery bill. What will $1 a week extra rebate do to compensate for that? Very little indeed. It will cost farmers hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a year more, particularly if they have stock transported to market and things such as that. The shipping industry, which is S9 vital to country people in the Parkes electorate, will be hit for six; The fuel oil excise, which stands now at 5.441c a litre,has already risen to 8.441c a litre, a 55 per cent increase. If one says quickly '3c a litre', it does not sound like much, but there are 1,065 litres of oil in tonne of fuel. The average coastal ship-45 are plying our coast at the moment-uses about 25 tdnries of oil a day. So that is already an increase in cost to those ships of $800 a day, just under $300,000 a year. By August next year, that will go up another 2c a litre. That is a 92 per cent increase within 12 months and an extra $1,000 a day to run those ships-$360,000 a year. Only two days after the budget was brought down on Thursday, 19 August, the Shipping Industry Reform Authority and the Maritime Union of Australia, along with the shipowners, finally negotiated a decrease in shipping berths in Australia. This had been going on for months, if not years. They got it down by an average of 2 1h berths from 20 1h berths per ship to just under 18. That allows 111 berths to be put off in Australia on our coastal shipping route. At $110,000 per berth-that is what it costs the shipowner-that is a considerable saving of about $270,000 per ship per year. Two days before this agreement was concluded the government put on a tax that would increase the costs of every coastal ship in Australia by $360,000 a year-in other words, a net loss of $90,000 per ship. How will we ever have a coastal shipping industry in this country when there is this sort of nonsense penalising Australian business? A ship taking sugar from, say, Mackay to Freemantle and that is paying this 92 per cent increase in excise has to compete with a foreign ship taking sugar from Thailand to Fremantle and paying no excise whatsoever.",96
205,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,It puts Australian sugar at risk.,97
206,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"It is putting Australian sugar at risk, putting Australian coastal shipping at risk and making Australian industry uncompetitive. I think it is an absolute scandal to put on taxes which make industries less competitive and, in the end, cost jobs and penalise the productive sector. The fuel increases also have an impact on local government. An average size local government which uses a lot of fuel and pays the excise on that fuel will be penalised to the tune of $15,000 or $20,000, by my rough calculations. On top of that, we have the diesel fuel rebate fiddle. The government is trumpeting that it has not touched this. It has put on what it calls a one per cent administration charge, which will take an extra $10 million of rebate away from the $1,000 million that is rebated every year to the mining and farming industry. It turns out that the administration fees to run this scheme work out at only about $5 million or $6 million. So this is not an administration charge; this is twice the cost of the administration-in other words, a blatant new tax. I think government officials have actually admitted that as such. The rebate will be adjusted annually, even though the excise is adjusted upwards for inflation every six months. So there is another fiddle there. That costs the mining and farming industry an extra $19 million or $20 million. So they have lost out there again. There is a three-year limit on retrospective claims and a few other little things like that. This impacts not only on farmers and miners-heavens above, surely we need these people in Australia-but also on things such as residential homes, hospitals, nursing homes and aged persons accommodation homes, which get a rebate of 6c a litre on the fuel that they use. That is now to go up and it will impact on them to the tune of $500,000 or $600,000 a year. So this government, it seems, is missing out on no-one at all in the taxes that it has put on. One of the most iniquitous things in the budget was the cut in road funding. There has been little or no mention of this in the newspapers, with all the other high farce going on. This government is winding back federal road funding by 37.4 per cent this coming year, and another 20 plus per cent in the following year-a decrease of more than 50 per cent in federal road funding in a period of two years. This would not have happened under the previous minister who was forced to step down; he would not have allowed this to happen. I cannot even think of the name of the present minister-someone might have to remind me. This is totally iniquitous. To sling a few shillings to the states in an untied way, and say that this makes up for it, is a total deception and betrayal of the Australian people. This is going to impact greatly on roads in Australia at a time when they are falling apart. I wonder if government members have raised this particular point in caucus. They have been raising other things, like optometry being taken out of Medicare and petrol prices going up, but have they raised the question of road funding? This impacts on country people and all Australian people probably more than any other issue. Mr Braithwaite-You'd think that Bob Brown would have raised it.",97
207,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"I am sure he probably would have, knowing his track record in the past. Look at what the government has done with sales tax-:the hidden consumption tax. Sales tax has increased by one per cent on virtually everything. On the various levels it has increased from 10 per cent to 11 per cent, 20 per cent to 21 per cent, 30 per cent to 31 per cent, and so on. An increase of one per cent on 10 per cent is a 10 per cent increase in sales tax. That increase goes on to cars, fridges, ice creams, dog food, orange juicejust name it. That may seem a minor increase, but I a call from a computer program writer who said he has 700 programs written out for people who sell car spare parts. Because car spare parts in this industry hilVe been locked in at 20 per cent since time immemorial, has actually hard-coated, to use the industry terminology, this 20 per cent on those 700 programs. Now he has to recall all those programs and rewrite each one of them individually at a cost of about $100 a throw. What a massive impost on a very small Act business that employs two or three people! This is just one example of how fiddling the sales tax laws is penalising business. Before the election the Prime Minister said, 'What I am promisingl-note the word 'promising'-'is not to put up tax'.' For heavens sake! I was fascinated with the terms. analysis of the budget by Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald. He said that if the tax increases go through, this government collect 50 per cent more tax than the coalition would have ever collected under its GST package. Of course, that was because we were abolishing seven taxes and increasing one. This government railed against us every in public, but it is now betraying the Australtum. Ian people. The government lied to the people in a barefaced manner, and it has collected 50 per cent more tax. That is absolutely unbelievable.",97
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The parliamentary secretary has asked that that comment be withdrawn. think it would be in the best interests debate if the honourable member withdrew particularly in the light of the recent rulings by the Speaker.,98
209,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,"I will withdraw, but I also remind the House that the Prime Minister said, 'What I am promising is not to put tax'. What did the government do with wine? It increased the sales tax on wine by 55 per cent. The industry has calculated that this will mean that 31 million litres less wine will sold in Australia.

211,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill 1993-94. The position I adopt in connection with' the budget is one of general I support for its overall structure. Presumably of the most honourable members will take the it, opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the budget. Apart from the particular concerns expressed by the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home) and the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), up t\:ley both made some general observations about the budget. But, let me say that both of them cannot be right. If my money were to be placed on either of them as far as their generbe al observations were concerned, it would be placed on the position and the judgment that to has been adopted by the honourable member for Paterson. I think the honourable member made some very clear, succinct, valuable objective judgments about the general paramenormous eters of the budget. Every budget that any government brings forward will be necessarily a mixed bag of details. I doubt whether there would be person in the parliament, including the Treaswas urer (Mr Dawkins), who would be able to look at the budget and say that on every matter of dlf'tail he or she was perfectly happy. Of course, that is not the case. We them. have to .examine the budget as a whole and realise that the budget is a package of propofor sals. We have to examine whether or not the whole package is coherent, whether it balanced, whether it is well structured, whethfamilies, er it is purposeful, and whether it is likely achieve the general macro objectives which have been set by the Treasurer, by cabinet and by the government generally. To my mind, the budget will do that. I say years. that with a very clear mind concerning some of the very serious reservations that I had-and which I still have-about some this details of the budget, some of the reservations that I have about the appropriateness of it a total package, and some of the constraints to which we have subjected ourselves. It important that we examine the positive eleopposition, ments of the Australian economy which created the context in which the budget prepared. The first thing we need to do is realise that Australia now enjoys the lowest innation rate for 30 years. That is an achievement of significant importance in itself. Every time have a high level of innation, we literally steal the savings of Australian people Australian families. We do it just as effectivebudget ly as if we were to go and rip it out of their pockets and rip it right out of their bank accounts. That is innation. This government has been able to achieve the lowest level of innation for 30 years-a remarkable achieveoped ment! As honourable members know, that is an especially remarkable achievement when we consider that when we came to government 1983 we inherited double digit innation and double digit unemployment. It has really been a dual achievement which has been unheraldance. and ed in Australia. It took a government of incompetence to create a situation of the kind with which we had to deal, and over the last 10 years we have dealt with it. To a very large extent, the decision that was any made by the Australian people on 13 March made in the light of what they knew this government had achieved. Of course, they had reservations. We all have reservations; members from both sides of the parliament share But we have had the lowest innation rate 30 years. We have also had the lowest interest rates for 20 years. That is important is to those people who have to borrowsmall business people, investors and to farmers:... - for any number of reasons. I have not yet heard one member of the National Party of Australia give the government credit for achieving the lowest interest rates for 20 Last year we had the highest growth rate of have any country in the OECD-2,4 per cent. In current year, the forecast is that Australia will share with the United States the highest as growth rate of any of the member countries of the OECD-2.6 per cent. I am sure that is no-one will deny, not even members of the that toa very large extent that higher growth rate has been initiated by was deliberate policies of this government. There has been discretionary investment, government expenditure, of $2 billion arising from the One Nation statement last year-$2 very . billion worth of new public sector we infrastructural investment designed to underpin imd strengthen the base for private sector and performance in Australia. In this year's there is another stimulatory element equal to another $2 billion. So, within a matter of two years in a period of retarded growth and high unemployment-despite the fact that we outstripped the rest of thedevelworld-this government has been responsible· for injecting into the economy stimulation equal to about $4 billion. 1 think we need to keep in mind that we in should compare ourselves with other countries. It is important that we make this comparison. It gives a measure of our performWhen I said that Australia will share a 2.6 per cent growth rate with the United States, putting us at the top of the OECD countries this year, we should keep.in mind as well that negative growth will be experienced this year by France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. All of those cquntries will record negative growth. As I indicated, the budget itself provides continuation of the stimulation which this government has been concerned about ensuring for the economy to make sure that we are able to give expression to what the Treasurer said quite correctly when, in introducing the budget, he delivered his second reading speech. He said that the chief concern of thination at the present time is jobs and the chief concern of that budget is jQbs. It is a stimulatory budget which will itself create jobs. But, in addition to that, it is providing for an overall deficit of about $16 billion. Of course, that includes very significant investment in Australia's infrastructure. That will be important not only for the continued progress, efficiency and effectiyeness of the public sector, but also as a contribution by the national government towards the capacity of the private sector to respond to the new opportunities which will be made available. Some of those opportunities were referred to very eloquently by my colleague the honourable member for Paterson. , A number of observations have been made about the tax commitments that were given prior to the last election. Let me say, first all, that those commitments to reduce taxeswith a total cost to government revenue of about $8 million-were made at that time on the basis of the best information and the best economic forecasts available. I do not think anyone would suggest that forecasts are infallible at any time; of course they are not. But those commitments that were given prior to the last election were made in good faith. The circumstances changed. The forecast of a rate of economic growth which would have been sufficient to increase government revenue, fiscal drag, to a sufficient extent to make· it possible for us to reduce tax rates did not eventuate. It was not realised. It is not a measure of weakness on a government's part when it re-examines commitments; it is a measure of its strength. That is what this government did. I have had no reservations about the delay in those tax cuts. On an objective basis, those proposed tax cuts should have been abandoned and the revenue which was to result from them should then have been redirected a to lower income families and lower income earners in Australia. That is \\4IIat we should have done. Of course, any budget, any government policy, is always a response not only to economic circumstances but also to social and political circumstances and to questions of equity and regional development. That is the way it should be. But then we find examples of governments, when they do respond in sensible, coherent and sensiti.ve ways, being accused of either repudiating undertakings or commitments that were given or of being weak. That is all part.of political play; part of the political interchange. Australian people need to understand that, to a very large extent, it consists of rhetoric-political rhetoric for political purposes. As I say, that is quite legitimate. Fortunately, we live in an economic and political community in which those opportunities are available to us. As far as the proposed tax cuts are concerned, I make the personal observation that equity is not improved, income is not redistributed and benefit is not given to low income earners by cutting taxes. For example, of if we cut any tax rate, the people who are below the tax free threshold-the lowest income earners in the whole community-get nothing. The provision of those tax cuts would not have benefited the people with an income of up to $20,700 a year. For people earning about $30,000-average weekly earnings-the benefit would have been about $400 a year. But for a higher income earner, including the Bob Browns of the world, the benefit would have been $1,200 a year. That is why I say that, objectively, economically, socially and in terms of equity, I would not have opposed the abandonment of the tax cuts. But the government chose to honour the commitment it made to the Australian people. Before the last election the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that those tax cuts would be provided, and the Prime Minister was determined that they would be. lt is to his credit, of course, that he has sought to maintain the integrity of his position. Quite clearly, the government has indicated a degree of Oexibility and responsiveness to Australia's national concerns in the way in which it has approached all of these problems. lt li-tens, it hears and it responds, The claim has been made that there is a need to stimulate demand following that budget, and of course there is. I still subscribe to the Keynesian belief that the reason why production, employment and incomes are deficient is that demand is deficient. When the private sector is not contributing to demand growth-to the maintenance of demand at a sufficient level to guarantee that the economy operates at a reasonable level of performance-that is one of the reasons why we have governments. It is necessary then for governments to step in and take up the slack to provide for those inadequacies within the private sector itself. That is what a mixed economy is all about. That is why for 200 years the labour movement has been of the opinion that it is necessary for us to get access to governments. It is in places like this..., - in all the social democratcent ic countries around the world; the liberal democracies-that people have an opportunity to inOuence the general nature of economic performance and social equity. I also want to make a special mention in this context to the fact that, for the first time in the history of this Commonwealth, budget surpluses were provided for during the 1980s. It has been very easy for governments to spend money which they extracted from taxpayers through tax and other forms of revenue raising. It is very easy for governments to spend money that they do not have because they can borrow it and then those loans, those debts, become a burden on the national community. It is very difficult for governments, with all of the diverse pressures placed upon them, to budget for surpluses. It has never happened before. This government budgeted for a surplus during the 1980s on four consecutive occasions. The cumulative surplus for those four years was $18,000 million. That is what economic management is all about. When there is growth, the opportunity should be taken to bank the surpluses. Only this government has done that. When there is a recession-as there is at present-with unemployment and low production, advantage should be taken of the surpluses that have been banked. They should be brought out, spent and reinjected back into the economy. That is what we are doing. That is what my friend the honourable member for Paterson was referring to when he made special mention of the coherence, the balance and the structure of this particular budget. There are some negative elements at present. I take no comfort, nor does any government member, in the fact that we have a high rate of unemployment. This Labor Party was not formed, not founded and has not persisted as the longest living political party in Australia-the first workers' party in the history of the world-to win governments, to preside over and to manage high levels of unemployment. We take no comfort in that. That is the reason we are attempting to respond to the high levels of unemployment. Almost one million people are unemployed. Eleven per of the work force, 400,000, are long-term unemployed and have been unemployed for over 12 months; 200,000 have been unemployed for over two years. We take no comfort in that, nor would we ever. We need to examine the adequacy of the structure of our economy and the way in which governments respond to the performance of the private sector and the general parameters which have made it possible for this situation to prevail. We need to examine those parameters, see where the weaknesses are, and be a little more discretionary and, to the extent that is necessary, more interventionist. That is what government is all about. We hear this nonsense all the time that one of the objective moral aims should be small government. It becomes a cliche. It is nonsense. We are not concerned about small government but effective government. We are not concerned about low taxation but the efficient raising of revenue, the sensible spending of revenue-making sure that programs right across government, right across the public sector, are equitable, well managed, sensible and will achieve the objectives that have been set. If those programs do that, this concept, this cliche about small government, becomes the nonsense that it quite clearly is. From today there is no way we will ever win back the lost production that· those one million people caused-it is lost forever. An unemployment rate of about 10 per cent, based on 10 per cent of wages and salaries across the whole economy, would have to represent a loss to production, income and human material welfare, of around $25,000 million every year. That is what we lose because those people do not have jobs. We will never win it back. That possible production, that enormous haemorrhaging of our economic capacity, is lost to us forever. That represents, for every man, woman and child, $1,500 a year. To a young family with a couple of kids it represents about $6,000 a year. So the government has been responding to that question. That is one of the reasons budget is expansionary. It is one reason we have tried to inject this stimulation. We want to bring unemployment down; we want employment to continue to grow. A large proportion of employment growth at present is dependent on the expansion of public sector expenditure. We have made a commitment to seek to achieve growth of 500,000 jobs over the next few years. The last time we made a similar commitment, we exceeded it. The problem is that it is possible over that same period that the labour force, or the possible labour force, will grow by a greater number. It is possible that the numbers of unemployed will grow at the same time that we are creating 500,000 new jobs. From time to time issues attract our attention. The chief problem is the current account deficit. Australia's standard is dependent to a very large extent on the productive capacity of the rest of the world because, in order to finance that current account deficit, we have to go into debt to other countries. That represents a continuing burden on the Australian community. It means that our capacity to use our own resources to benefit this and future generations is impeded. It also feeds into that foreign debt, which represents a continuing burden on the Australian people. (Time expired)",98
212,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"The last sentences of the speech by the honoUrable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) were right. Why he did not talk more about the truth of our economy throughout his speech, I will never know. For the last three days I have been trying to move a censure motion against the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) for the damage that he has done to this country since 17 August, when he brought down his budget. On the three occasions I have tried to move this motion, I have been denied the right as a member of this parliament to bring on a debate with the Treasurer about his budget. Not once since the budget was brought down by the Treasurer has he been prepared to debate me, as the shadow Treasurer, on this issue. Each time on the night of the budget I was in a television studio doing an interview, the the Treasurer would wait until I left so he could not debate me. Every time. I appeared, he scurried away, frightened to debate me on a budget that he was clearly ashamed of. When we have given the Treasurer opportunity after opportunity to debate the budget in this parliament, he has refused to do so. On one occasion the government agreed to a matter of public importance. On that occasion the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) put up the case, if we could call it a case, for the Labor Party. But the Treasurer was nowhere to be seen. That is a measure of the contempt in which the Treasurer and his friend and colleague, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), hold this parliament, this institution-an institution which represents the interests of all voting Australians. That is the contempt in which they hold the representatives of the Australian people and, therefore, by extension, the contempt in which they hold the whole country. I want to make a few comments today-I have been waiting to make them in this House for the last two weeks-about the way the government has behaved since the budget was first brought down. Honourable members will remember that, when the budget was being framed, the Treasurer's staff were scurrying around the press gallery, briefing journalists that this was going to be the Treasurer's first budget-his own. That was the story he got the media to write. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will remember that. That story was in the newspapers everywhere. The Prime Minister had basiCally been responsible for last year's budget, but this year it was going to be the Treasurer's very own budget. While that was not true, the fact is that the Treasurer did have a very substantial hand in it. The two of them-the Treasurer and the Prime Minister-disappeared into the Prime Minister's office and put together this miserable document of betrayal without consulting any of their colleagues in the Labor Party caucus, or for that matter the Labor Party cabinet. With all due respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, you were not consulted in the process of putting the budget together, nor was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) who is sitting at the table-he knew absolutely nothing about it at all. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister cobbled this document of betrayal together in each other's offices without consulting any of their colleagues. Take, for example, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), the minister responsible for the wine industry. When did he find out that the Labor government was going to increase the tax on wine by 55 per cent? It was at six o'clock on the evening of 17 August, the night the budget was brought down. That was when the minister for primary industries discovered that the wine tax was going to be increased by 55 per cent, decimating some of the wineries in my own state of South Australia and, indeed, in the electorate of Kingston. I hasten to add that, when I represented the wineries in what is now the electorate of Kingston, we had a much lower level of wine tax than has been imposed by the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney) in the last two weeks. The budget started off in a very nasty way, being concocted by two gentlemen in the Prime Minister's office without any consultation with their colleagues. This document of betrayal ripped up the Labor Party's election promises, ripped up its programs, ripped up the commitments it had made to the Australian people and chucked them in the bin. In effect, the Labor Party w-s saying to the Australian people, 'You voted for us-thanks very much-now buzz off. We are not interested in you anymore. We have duped you. We do not want to hear from you for another three years when you vote for us again'. That was a gross act of betrayal of the people of this country, and it will be remembered, not just for the next couple of years in the lead-up to the next election but for generations. It will be remembered that the man who boycotted Jack Lang's funeral was the same man who, when he became Prime Minister, betrayed the people of this country. Not only was it a budget of betrayal, but we also know that it was regressive in its impact. The rhetoric of the Labor Party has been, 'We will look after the poor and low income Australians'. The reality is that, over the 10 years that Labor has been in power, the lowest 10 per cent of income earners-what economists call the poorest decile-have seen living standards decline by 10 per cent. At the same time, the rich have become richer. The richest 10 per cent have become very much richer in the last 10 years of Labor government, but the poorest 10 per cent have become 10 per cent poorer in the same period, and that comes from a party that claims",102
213,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,That is not true.,103
214,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,The parliamentary secretary would know about truth in the Labor Party. We will come to its lack of truth in a minute. But that comes from a political party that claims to represent low income people. Dr Theophanous interjecting,103
215,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"The Labor Party betrays low income people. It did it when Scullin was in power, when people were put out of work. It did it with Chifley when he was in power, when it tried to nationalise the banks and wreck the economy. It betrayed them when Whitlam was in power by wrecking the economy. It has betrayed them again, the people it professes to represent. Its selfrighteous rhetoric about low income people is the greatest amount of humbug to which this country has ever been subjected. What happened after its damaging, regressive, hypocritical budget was given the thumbs down by the Australian people? The government thought there was going to be trouble in the Senate, so it decided it would cheat by jamming together all the tax increase measures into one bill. By jamming them together, it tried to stop the representatives the Australian people from amending the bill so that the worse excesses of the budget could be stopped. It resorted to constitutional shonkiness. Either the bill is amended-as the Prime Minister, a week ago, claimed it could beor, since it is a bill that imposes a number of new taxes, it is declared unconstitutional. The government can take its pick: either it is amended or it goes to the High Court where it will be struck down. Then the government will be back to draft No. 5 or 6 of this miserable budget of betrayal. The first act. was to try to distort in a shonky way the constitution-the people's document-so that the government could sneak through these pernicious measures. The second act unfolded when the government became concerned that the bill might not be constitutional. It decided to play tough. It said, 'This document is not negotiable. We are going to get tough. We will not negotiate'. The Prime Minister said that. Meanwhile, the Treasurer ran around the cou!ltry delivering his budget sales pitch, saymg over and over again that it was not negotiable. A week or so ago, he said this: ... the Budget (is) not a negotiating instrument and the Senate is going to have to confront it that basis. Ho-hum. What a long week it has been since the Treasurer said: ... it's a package, you can't just lop bits off. - en he said that, was he telling the truth? DId he know that he was telling an untruth or did he believe what he was saying at the time? Who. would know? The mistake of a strategy to persuade the Senate through fear and by threat was compounded a week or so ago when the govem-ent did something that was deeply reprehensl?l-. On Tuesday of last week, certain mmlsters-the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), the Assistant Treasurer, an- others-went around the press gallery trymg .to talk up a financial market crisis. They tried to talk up a money market crisis so that there would be a run on the Australian dollar. The bond markets would then react of adversely and the Labor Party could blame the opposition and the minor parties in the Senate for creating a money market crisis. Not only is that shameful, but it is unpatriotic. Never before has a government done that in this country, and I hope that I never see a government do it again. That was the most unpatriotic and despicable way to behave. When their game was sprung, those ministers quickly abandoned the strategy, realising that in the end it would do them very great political damage, and that is, of course, all they really worry about. All of these strategies have been tried and have failed. So then the government had to try to strike deals with the Democrats and the Greens. The way in which that was done is very interesting. On Sunday night, the Prime Minister got his staff-I think it was Mr Turnbull-to run around the press gallery and tell the media that the budget was going to be changed, that draft No.2 of this non-negotiable budget was coming up because of fruitful and constructive discussions with the Democrats. The Democrats were bought off for a couple of bob; they were bought off for $1 a week for low income Australians. That was okay by them. They were prepared to go on along with regressive increases in sales tax and petrol tax while the government flicked a dollar coin across to the poor. The Democrats thought that was pretty generous and they were prepared to buy that deal-that shoddy, shoddy deal. That was the first deal, and the government thought it had got away with it. The interjectors across the table interject in a confected way now but they should have heard the interjections in the caucus meeting at the beginning of the week. They should have heard the language that was used to describe the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The people in the gallery would blush if I used some of those words. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would probably eject me from the House if I used those words. I will not use such language in this place. Indeed, I hope people believe that I very seldom, if ever, use that language. I do use it occasionally, but it is very seldom. The fact is that the caucus revolt was not only a substantial revolt against an admission that this was a pernicious and regressive budget, but also it was a revolt against the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Consider the members of the caucus who said it was about time that the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance took a spell on the back bench and had a rest. Consider those who thought even the Prime Minister might do with a spell on the back bench. They are Labor members. I can agree with. Mr Taylor-Particularly Mr Gorman.",103
216,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"Quite right; the honourable member for Greenway was very colourful, as were many of the others. I am sure parliamentary secretary, the honourable member for Calwell, who is in the chamber, also had a good deal to say about the Treasurattitude er and the Prime Minister. After all, voted for the Prime Minister-which I expect is to his credit-unlike his colleague sitting beside him, the honourable member for Kingston. So there was a caucus revolt and the damningMr Bilney-He wants to raise a point of order.",105
217,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"It is obviously not to his credit then, if he did. Did the parliamentary secretary vote for Mr Keating as Prime Minister? Goodness me, I have always thought better of him than that! We know the honourable member for Kingston did, but we thought the parliamentary secretary had more to him than that. Fancy that; what a hideous admission! I hope the people of Calwell hear more about it. Since this document of betrayal has been brought down, there has been an attempt to deceive people by saying that the budget would not be negotiable. There has been an attempt to manipulate money markets to make sure that the Senate will be spooked into accepting this regressive and nasty budget in to to. There have been some initial negotiations with the Democrats. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer forgot they had a caucus, so they forgot to have any negotiations with the caucus. Then there were negotiations with the caucus. We are now up to draft 3 of the budget, and still tnere is the matter of the Greens, so we wait to see what comes out of the negotiations which at 5 o'clock, in 20 minutes time, will take place between the Treasurer and the Greens. Throughout this process, one thing has been very interesting: the way that the Labor Party, and in particular the Prime Minister, have been trying once more to manipulate public opinion and to get the public to believe two things: firstly, that this budget is not regressive, that the unions are wrong, that the coalition is wrong, that all of the state premiers-Liberal, Labor or National-are wrong, that in fact 82 per cent of Australians are all wrong and that this budget is not an impost the on the poor. Secondly, they tried to beat up a story-one of the greatest confections I have ever come across in politics-about the of the coalition to this budget, and I he never will come to that in a moment. As far as the regressivity of the budget is concerned, the Treasurer produced something called the Prismod model results that the Treasury produced on the regressivity or otherwise of the budget. In putting together the assumptions, an absolutely critical fact is that he decided it would be better not to mention what is sometimes called bracket creep, which is the effect of inOation on taxation, over the next three years. He decided not to build that in. He said, 'That was too difficult'. Yet, when the government used Prismod to model Fightback, guess what? It built in bracket creep. This is manipulating public opinion; this is what gets served up to the public week in and week out from the dispatch box. It put bracket creep into the assumptions for modelling Fightback and said, 'Look how awfully regressive and terrible it is'. But when it came to its own budget, it decided not to do it. That is fraudulent; that is intellectually deceitful. That is so dishonest it surprises me that the press gallery does not give the Labor Party a bigger hammering than it does for doing that type of deceitful thing. What is more, everybody knows one of the more controversial aspects of this budget is that leaded fuel prices are now going to be higher than unleaded fuel prices. Why does that matter? Because low income people disproportionately use more leaded fuel because they have earlier model cars. That is obvious; everybody accepts that. Were the increases in the price of leaded fuel built the Treasurer's and the Prime Minister's model? No, they decided conveniently to leave them out. No wonder both the honourable member for Kingston and the honourable member for Calwell bow their heads in shame. They decided to leave them out. Those opposite leave out bracket creep, they leave out a $4 billion increase in income tax on ordinary Australians over the next three years or so, and they leave out the impact of increasing the price of leaded fuel over and above the increase in the unleaded fuel price and say, 'Well, it is not really too bad, this budget'. Even despite that, the model shows that the highest income people, the rich, are the big winners in the budget. Having tried to manipulate-to use the words of the Prime Minister's economic adviser-public opinion through economic models, those opposite have now, in the last couple of days, decided to come into this parliament and make claim after claim about the coalition. No matter how much we deny it, they will keep making claims until some people in Australia are silly enough to believe them. One of their claims is that the coalition is opposed to the reductions in income tax. That is manifestly untrue and they know it is untrue. The Treasurer has never made that claim, by the way, which is interesting, but the Prime Minister, the great deceiver, the man who has totally betrayed this country, stands at the dispatch box and says, 'The coalition is opposed to the reductions in income tax'. He knows damned well that is not true. They also claim we are in favour of a higher budget deficit, yet we have repeatedly said we are not. On another occasion, the Minister for Finance claimed we were in favour of a $24 billion cut in spending. This is a government which has lost direction, and it has done more than that it has lost integrity. It has no integrity, no sense of decency, no sense of standards and is utterly exhausted after 10 failed years. (Time expired)",105

Opposition members-Ha, hal",106
219,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"Those opposite can laugh after having been thrashed at the election on 13 March that every political scientist thought they were going to win. The reality is that they have learnt nothing. This was shown very clearly at their recent national council meeting where there was not even an attempt to move away from the dramatic right-wing, extremist New Right policies which remain the foundation of this party. How remarkable it must be to anyone who has studied philosophy to have the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), ideologically extreme right wing, come in here and lecture people about social justice. What is the New Right view of social justice? I will tell honourable members what ·it is. The idea before the election was to impose a 15 per cent indirect tax on everything that anyone bought. That was its idea of social justice. I will tell honourable members about social justice. The opposition's idea of social justice was to cut $10,000 million off the budget. Those opposite then have the impertinence to say, 'Oh, the current budget is regressive'. The honourable member for Mayo has been abusing everybody for the last 20 minutes about how the current budget is supposedly regressive. What would have been regressive had the opposition won the election? What would have been more regressive than cutting $10,000 million off the budget? There would not have been an adjustment to be made; there would have been $2,000 million cut from Medicare. Do honourable members know what that would have meant? It would have meant the total destruction of the health System of this country; that would have been regressive. The opposition would have made huge cuts to all programs that assist the poor and the unemployed. That is what it would have done. What did the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) say last year when talking to welfare organisations? He is the only leader of an opposition in the Western world who has suggested that the states should get out of administering welfare totally and give it to voluntary agencies such as the Salvation Army; and he still remains the Leader of the Opposition. . Anyone else in the Western world would have been laughed out of court and told, 'Look, sir. Retire because the extreme Right policies of Thatcher and Reagan have gone out. They are ancient history. They are no longer relevant'. Instead, what happened? These parties, the Liberal and National parties, went to the election last year with the same program-slightly adjusted here and there-with which they had gone to the people for the previous four elections, and they lost. The fact of the matter is that they have learned nothing from that, and they come here to try to attackMr Downer-Defend your budget.",106
220,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,I will get around to defending the budget at an appropriate time. Mr Downer-Defend your budget.,107
221,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member for Mayo wishes to interject all the time because he keeps making all of these miserable comments about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), about the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), and about the government in general. All he does is abuse, and that has become the whole level of debate from the opposition parties in recent time. Not only he abuse the government, but he also abused the Democrats and the Greens parties. Mr Downer-I did not abuse them.",107
222,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member for Mayo says that he did not abuse them. He called them petty. He said that they had sold out for a dollar. Mr Downer-The Democrats, not the Greens.",107
223,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"What is he saying? Quite frankly, the man denies his own words. People were in the gallery and they heard what he said about the Democrats and the other parties. Of course, anyone who is as ideologically hopeless as he and the members of the opposition are does not understand something very important. That is why the budget will get through the Senate. The changes that are being made to the budget are not concessions to the Liberal Party. They are not concessions to the Right. They are concessions to people who are concerned with social justice, such as the Democrats and the Greens. They are not concessions to these fanatics from the New Right who are trying to pretend that they support the poor. Mr Bitney interjecting",107
224,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"As the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs said, they marginaIise themselves, and now they attack the Democrats who talk to the government. They did not do deals; they talked to the government about their concerns.",107
225,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,You were doing deals.,107
226,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"I ask the honourable member for Fairfax to repeat outside the House what he said about deals, and we will see how far he gets. He is very good at coming in and putting up abuse here, but when he goes outside the House, where he can be hit with a lawsuit, we will see what he has to say about deals. There were no deals. All that occurred was that the concerns of the Democrats were taken into account, as have the concerns of other people. The most extraordinary thing that the honourable member for Mayo had to say was did that there is something wrong with the democratic process of the caucus. We are to be attacked because there was a discussion with caucus about concerns arising from the budget. The members of caucus-who are people who were elected by the Australian people to form the majority party-went out into the community and brought back concerns. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer listened to those concerns. Do honourable members think the honourable member for Mayo or the Leader of the Opposition is giving credit to the Prime Minister or the Treasurer for listening to those concerns? The answer is they gave no credit whatsoevernone. The Leader of the Opposition got up here, attacked the budget and demanded changes. When certain changes were made because of concerns raised, what. happened? He got up and he further attacked the Prime Minister. This is the sort of nonsense and lack of mortality that exists on the other side in relation to this matter. Those attacks will be irrelevant because, as I say, ideologically they are over to the extreme Right. The people with concerns to whom we are talking belong to our democratic caucus, the Democrats and the Greens. We are taking those concerns into account, and that is why this budget will pass notwithstanding the bloody-mindedness of opposition members in suggesting that they will block everything. The honourable member for Mayo decided to argue that the opposition is in favour of the tax cuts. Listen to this: opposition members want the tax cuts. They do not want an increase in the budget deficit and they do not want any increases in indirect taxes. Do those opposite know what that means? Only Houdini could have all those things together. I will tell those opposite the Houdini trick the government has pulled off. We have the lowest taxation regime in the Western. world and, in addition to that, we have one of the best social justice structures in the Western world. That is the Houdini trick that has been the work of this government over 10 years. When the opposition gets the wisdom to be able to get that sort of balance in its pol icies, only then will it be able to say something. Opposition members think that it was easy to achieve all of those social justice programs-every one of which they opposed, by the way. Then what happened? When we put those programs into place, what did those opposite say? They said, 'That's irresponsible. You can't give thismoney to the poor. You can't give the family assistance supplement. You can't give all this money out-we have to cut these programs'. This was said in 1987, in 1990 and in 1993. Then, after all that, the fact is that we not only managed that but we also managed to reduce taxation. Now what do we have? We have the honourable member for Mayo saying that of course the opposition members support the tax cuts. But they also want a budget deficit of $16 billion. They do not want a budget deficit of $19 million to pay for those tax cuts. So what are they suggesting? Are they suggesting that the money will somehow be produced from thin air? The reality is that opposition members had a choice in terms of targeting these tax cuts. The choice was made on the basis of a difficult balance, and that difficult balance was one which took into account the concerns of a whole range of people. When there were some problems created, what did the government do? The honourable member for Mayo attacks the Treasurer for saying that changes would not be made to the budget. So what? He made that comment but he was also _man enough to change his view when he saw the concerns of the community. The Leader of the Opposition said that Fightback would never be changed, and in the end the opposition went with Fightback to the election and it got done. This is the point that opposition members do not understand. I want to now tum to some of the positive things in the budget. But let me just say that the honourable member for Mayo has accused the media of not getting stuck into the Labor Party enough. The reality is that, because of the concerns and difficulties, the positive measures of the budget have been lost. ",107
227,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member for Forrest says that there were not any. He says that because he would not know anything about social justice, just like the rest of those opposite. The fact of the matter is that there is $30 a week for each child for each family for child care; This is one of the most important child-care changes in Australian history, and it has been lost. Nobody talks about it. Why? Because the budget has been attacked by the opposition. So what has happened to one of the most important social justice /measures-namely, the child care measures? Every family with a child is supposed to get $30 a week. But what has happened to that? The honourable member for Mayo, who complains about the 3c increase in the price of petrol, says nothing about the fact that poor families are going to be given a child-care rebate. What about that? Of course he talks about the model budget. He says that the budget is regressive. Has the child-care rebate been taken into account in his assessment? Of course not, because if we take into account what we have done in the area of child care and in a number of other areas we will see that the budget is not regressive. The budget, for a large proportion of the population, is in fact progressive in its benefit. Mt Pyne-You do not believe that for a minute.",108
228,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"I am referring to the budget. As it has been amended it is progressive for the majority of the people. A budget cannot be progressive foreveryone. If members of the opposition do not accept that, they should look- . ",109
229,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"Here is the genius who knows all about progressive budgets. He is another member of the New Right who wanted to cut $10,000 million from the budget. What an extraordinary phenomenon we have with people like him telling us about social justice. The other positive measure in the budget is the dental scheme. For the first time, ers and people from low income backgrounds will have free dental care. Is that a regressive measure? It certainly is not. It is a very positive measure in favour of the poor. But that has been ignored by the media and the opposition parties in their gross attack on the budget because they failed to look at the positive measures.",109
230,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,Tell us about optometry.,109
231,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member for Fairfax asks about optometry. I will tell him about optometry. The optometry measure was universally recognised as a mistake. We can· admit to concerns and mistakes, but we know that the opposition never admits to any concerns or mistakes because it has not changed its policies for five elections. Mr Bilney- We are smarter.",109
232,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"We are also smarter, as the minister says. We take into account people's concerns",109
233,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"Why did you not do that before the budget, then?",109
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The honourable member for Moore will cease interjecting or I will deal with him.,109
235,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member for Moore might like to know that in my portfolio responsibility I received a large . number of submissions on this issue which I discussed with. my Caucus colleagues. What has happened is that the measure has now been reversed. Does the opposition think a similar thing would have happened with its party if it were in government? It cannot even change its policies in opposition-never mind in government. The opposition suggests that the reversal of the measure was some dramatic mistake. It was not a dramatic mistake; we recognised the concerns of people and we took them into account. That is the difference in terms of social justice between the Australian Labor Party, with its democratic tradition, and the opposition, which is only concerned with an ideologically fixed position-the New Right pension- position and all that that entails. The situation is that the opposition has now dropped the GST - the huge tax it wanted to impose on everybody-but it still holds on to the same old policies. We have heard nothing new from those opposite. Nothing was offered by way of new policies by the Leader of the Opposition in his address-in-reply to the budget speech. At the Liberal council meeting held recently nothing was done even to try to move the party to a moderate position. There was the spectacle of the former Liberal Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, saying that the Liberal Party has been taken over by extreme far right people and will never win an election unless it moves to a moderate position. Mr Leo MCLeay-That is pretty good for Malcolm Fraser.",109
236,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"This is pretty good for Malcolm Fraser, says the honourable member. If Malcolm Fraser says this, we can imagine how far to the right those opposite have moved. What happened to poor Malcolm Fraser? He was virtually thrown out of the meeting because he had the audacity to say that the Liberal Party ought to move to a more moderate position and ought to reexamine its policies in the light of a fifth electoral loss. We heard the ranting and raving from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), pretending that he is somehow concerned about the poor and about low income earners when the reality is that for 10 years all the opposition has done has been to advocate policies against the poor and low income earners. Every time we have brought in a policy to help them the opposition has opposed it. We now have the situation of it pretending that it has somehow found some grace in this budget. The difficult measures in this budget have been changed because of community concerns. The budget as a whole is based on a responsible economic strategy intended to achieve the reduction of the budget deficit over a number of years. That is an important matter. When the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Leader of the Opposition, at least he was concerned about the budget deficit. Now the opposition is telling us that it would sustain the tax but somehow would reduce the budget deficit. By what means would it do that? There are no means to do that and it knows that. As the Prime Minister said, the opposition either has a $3 billion hole in its figuring or it is suggesting that the budget deficit should be $19 billion. As it knows, in terms of investment, industry development and the general direction of the economy, we. cannot have such a huge budget deficit. . It was therefore necessary to do something about the budget deficit but to do it in a responsible way-not to cut it dramatically by $10 billion, as the opposition suggested it would do had it been in government, or to cut out the whole health and welfare scheme, as would have been the case if the opposition had been elected, but rather to do something responsible to ensure the budget deficit is reduced over a number of years while at the same time providing for the unemployed, low income earners and ordinary Australians. And that is what the budget is intended to do. Now that the budget has been changed and community concerns have been taken into account, it is time for the opposition to develop its own policies which it intends to put to the people instead of this negative talk. and attacks on the nation and the government.  budget is bad for business. First, there was the recession we had to have. Then, just when small manufacturers and the sectors like the wine industry were starting to make some headway again, they have been penalised for their' success. This budget's iII-considered tax measures mean business inputs will rise, competitiveness will fall and Australia will be further behind than ever. I do not think business was expecting to come off scot-free. We might recall the story of Sweeney Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street, who used to tum his clients into meat pies. Lots of business people must now be looking on the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) as the Sweeney Todd of Canberra, metaphorically speaking. We know dam well he will give a short back and sides, but the cut throat comes as a real surprise. Actually, when we consider the governcuts ment's usual flexibility with the truth, we would probably find it surprising that this budget actually does admit how bad it expects the results for business to be. The budget forecast for the 1993-94 financial year shows that total business investment is expected to be just one-quarter of a per cent above what it was in 1989-90. The government probably expects everyone to be pleased that business investment will finally move into positive figures. After all, business investment dropped by 15.3 per cent in 1991-92 and in the financial year just past it was still 3.8 per cent below the 1989-90 level. I tum now to private consumption, one of the other forecasts in the budget papers. Growth in private consumption was 2.4 per cent in 1991-92, and 2.5 per cent in 1992-93. The forecast for 1993-94 has private consumption expected to grow by just 2.25 per cent, showing that the government does not expect any improvement in consumer confidence. The government's pessimism on this front would seem to be justified when we remember that the Westpac-Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research index of consumer confidence for June fell by 9.5 per cent. The June fall alone wiped out all gains made since the March election. The forecast for household savings is just as grim, with growth of just 4.75 per cent expected in the 1993-94 financial year. This is lower growth than in the past two financial years. According to the FitzGerald report on national savings, our savings level has been lower only during national emergencies such as the two world wars and the Great Depression. The Treasurer in his budget speech said: This budget sets us on a prudent path, leading to lower government deficits and higher national saving. Is this just another case of bringing home the porkies? What about real GDP growth? The government, after a little well-publicised tweeting by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has produced a forecast of 23/4 per cent for the 1993-94 year-up from actual growth of 2.6 per cent in 1992-93. We all know that the Treasurer, who has been deserted by his own party over this budget, expected growth to be around 2.5 per cent-which is even lower than we have had in the past year. It is widely acknowledged that we need growth of around four per cent to even start making inroads into unemployment. Where does the Prime Minister imagine the extra growth will come from? In his budget speech, the Treasurer said that Australia must position itself to take advantage of strong world growth. He said that policy would have to play its part in improving the competitive position of our export industries 'especially through low inflation'. Yet the budget forecasts show that inflation is expected to average 3 1/4 per cent this financial year. How are higher taxes, higher fuel costs and higher inflation supposed to improve the competitive position of our export industries? This budget paper admits that any recovery, at least as far as business investment activities are concerned, will be a non-event. This would have to be one of the least confident and least honest budgets in Australia's history. This was the time that the newly elected government should have been taking the tough decisions, showing it had a vision for the future by giving us a good shake-up in the budget. Instead, this government showed it did not have the energy, drive or vision to do that. The Prime Minister, who once promised us a touch of excitement, resorted to his old tactic of hitting the soft targets and covering up such injustice by lashing out with personal abuse. . The government had a mandate, however dubious, to lead. But it was so worried about its opponents that it piled more burdens onto lower income earners and business rather than taking a decent look at our tax system and bringing in real reforms. Perhaps the Prime Minister and Treasurer were unusually worried about an electoral backlash from ordinary people feeling they had been conned. It is . ironic that their backbenchers have heavied them into backing away from some of these extra taxes. This government is bankrupt of ideas and bereft of vision. Less than six months into its current term of office, it looks tired and inept. The most obvious element the government missed in its budget measures on industry was a vision for the future. This is not to say that some of the industry measures did not have merit; the moves to develop a first shop network and a backup business link computer service were positive. I hope this means there will be a real attempt to rationalise the more than 120 federal and state assistance programs available to help narrow the gap between the availability of programs and their take-up by industry. One of the great faults with the existing of programs is that many are the result of politicians and bureaucrats coming up with an idea and saying, 'Hey, wouldn't this be a good idea?'. It would be far better for the government to seek out industry initiatives and back them. It would get the programs industry wants and needs, not the programs government thinks industry should have. r welcome the $12.5 million in extra funding for the.national industry extension service and the $8 million over three years for the export access scheme. These programs are proving their merit and are a step in the right direction. However, at the same time the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) apparently ticked this budget measure-which robs business to pay Paul. The immediate 3c a litre increase in excise on petroleum products hits businessespecially manufacturers-by increasing costs on both inputs and outputs. Those hardest hit are manufacturers in regional centres. This government. pays lip service to regional development, then whacks regional manufacturers with massive extra costs. Why would we put $4 million, over two years, into an inquiry into Darwin's usefulness as Australia's gateway to Asia, when the extra fuel costs contained in the budget go a long way towards making anything sent to Darwin uncompetitive? If nothing else, it shows how badly thought through this petrol tax slug isr suspect it was not thought through at all. Changes to the diesel fuel rebate are absurd and damaging. Mining and agriculture are still critical areas in our economy despite this Labor government's historic apathy for these sectors. They have been slugged with an administration fee of one per cent so they can claim the diesel fuel rebate. This is a Clayton's cut: the government applies an administration fee so it can cut the amount of rebate while pretending not to cut it at all. It is hardly any wonder that one manufacturing representative's weary response was along the lines: 'You almost get used to battering away and then getting stung with more input costs'. His description was far more colourful than that, but honourable raft members will get the drift of it. This manufacturing spokesman also noted the impact that lack of business confidence was having on job creation. He went on t,o say that business people he knew cared about their staff. He said, 'They don't like taking on someone and then having to put them off a month or so later'. That gets to the heart of what is wrong and dishonest about this budget. The Treasurer launched this budget mess with the words, 'The primary objective of this budget is jobs'. r ask: where are the jobs? Will they come from the quarter per cent rise in business investment, or from the 21/4 per cent rise in private consumption or from the feeble increase in household savings ratios? What about the expected 3 1/4 per cent inflation rate? Earlier, r accused this government-especially in this budget - of being bereft of vision. The Treasurer's grand solution to the manufacturing and trading woes is the MCKinsey report into emerging exporters. This report, I am sure, is a worthwhile and excellently produced document, but for the Treasurer and the rest of the government to have used it blatantly for so many months as though it were the saviour of Australia's export industry is beyond the pale. The report really says that there are neady 7,000 small to medium sized companies which could export; but only 700 are exporting. Those 700 are succeeding in spite of, not because of, government. The government is not nearly as keen to wave around the detailed and well-researched Agribusiness and processed food development in South East Asia report by INSTATE for the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. Perhaps the government is not as keen to wave it around as much as the MCKinsey report because this report says: Far from improving its international ranking as an exporter, Australia is at risk of slipping into the status of becoming a significant processed food importing nation. The report also says that policies based on old-fashioned concepts of static comparative advantage are doomed to failure. Any assumption that South-East Asia's high growth rate will automatically result in spin-offs for Australia is wrong on two counts. First, the report finds that high growth does not mean that South-East Asia will become less selfsufficient in the provision of food. The region is doing well in providing its own food requirements. The report says: It would be naive, and a dangerous extension of 'cargo cult' mentality, to assume that traditional Australian agricultural export commodities will enjoy effortless growth from South East Asian prosperity. , The second reason that assumes we wi1l get an automatic spin-off is wrong; there is little or no reason for South-East Asian countries to buy here, rather than elsewhere. The report says it is likely that Australia's highly subsidised commodity competitors, especially the US, EC and Canada, wi1l capture the lion's share of South-East Asian business. The government might say, 'Okay, we're working on that. We are looking at this clean and green approach to let Asian markets know that food produced in Australia is of reliable quality'. That is fine, but the agribusiness report finds the clean and green idea too simplistic and that we need attractive and highly recognisable brand names. We need a targeted approach to the South-East Asian agribusiness chain rather than a generic approach of questionable value. My recent trip to Taiwan to look at manufacturing and service sectors there confirm this approach. From my observations, the Taiwanese have been very focused and recognise the need to develop market-leading brands to spearhead their push into neighbouring countries. Like Australia, Taiwan is finding that high labour costs are driving more labour intensive industries offshore. Taiwan is no longer a cheap country in which to manufacture and, like Australia, Taiwan is focusing on increasing its value added exports. It is focusing on the high value, elaborately transformed manufactures market and is encouraging international companies to make Taiwan their centre for research and development. Taiwan will be a major competitor to Australia in our efforts to export to Asia, and Taiwan has the advantage of location. I note the Treasurer's fondness for quoting an OECD report which says that Australia is the lowest taxed country in the 'developed' world. Australia has to compete with countries such as Taiwan and Korea, and I suspect the Treasurer would not feel quite so comfortable comparing our tax rates with theirs. Returning to the agribusiness report, another aspect the government probably does not want to know about is finding that, if we assume Australia's technological expertise is greater than that of South-East Asia, we are probably wrong. Joint ventures with major Western countries have resulted in many Asian countries being right at the forefront of technological advances. Yet this government has encouraged Australians to think, 'We'll be right, mate. Asia is growing fast and it will save our bacon'. In fact, I note that this is sti1l the line being taken by this government. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) launched the agribusiness report on the Gold Coast on 9 July this year, but it seems clear he either did not read it properly or chose to overlook the less palatable findings contained in it. I say that because only last week, on Monday, 23 August, he issued a press release containing this cheery message: ... it was important that Australian food industries capitalise on the opportunities in a rapidly growing Asian food market, which is estimated to be worth $200 billion in the year 2000. There it is again-'No worries, mate, she'll be right'. Of course, we do not want to make people think it is a waste of time and energy trying to export at all to South-East Asia. . Instead of propagating unachievable fantasies, we should encourage would be exporters to take a realistic view of Asian markets so that our industries realise just what it is that they need to do to capture a slice of those markets. Let me give honourable members an example of how unsophisticated market intelligence can lead to a disaster for Australian industry. By the mid-1980s, China was our third biggest market for wool. But the financial squeeze introduced by the Chinese government in September 1988 cut back domestic demand for woollen textiles and Chinese textile mills virtually stopped buying domestically produced wool. Rather than risk a backlash from domestic wool producers, the Chinese government restricted the importation of wool, intending to force the mills to buy the domestic product rather than the Australian one. The price of Australian wool fell through the floor, and the rest, as they say, is history. We need to become not only educated about market potential but also familiar with the politics and cultures of the Asian markets we seek to capture. Part of that reality is that most of our Asian neighbours fully intend to be self-sufficient. The agribusiness report notes that Australia would be naive to assume these highly targeted policies to discourage imports will be abandoned. The report states: This should ring alarm bells for any countries like Australia relying on a stand alone export policy penetration of Asian markets. Developing a vision for Australia as a successful exporter requires more than just tinkering at the edges with a few, relatively minor, if well-intentioned, budget measures. The agribusiness report says that Australia finds itself in the declining· position it is in because of factors such as a misdirection of Australian investment during the 1980s, a failure to lift national savings and the traditional agricultural structures such as statutory marketing authorities and a farm gate mentality, meaning Australia stagnated rather than developed its agrifood business. The Hilmer report into national competition policy notes that the traditional agricultural arrangements are 'often grossly inefficient, and effectively tax users and consumers'. Professor Hilmer's committee makes a number of recommendations about deregulation of these traditional arrangements in the national interest. The coalition has long recognised that a shake-up of competition policy is crucial to lifting some of the barriers to manufacturing success, and I look forward to government action on this report. The budget delivered by Treasurer Dawkins on 17 August has further depressed businesses and consumers already weary from trying to battle their way out of the worse recession in 60 years. It is a nasty, gloomy piece of work from a government which has shown itself to be creative only where the truth is concerned. It penalises those who can least afford it and offers little in the way of hope for business and industry. This is a tired and inept government, and it is a ham-fisted budget. I call on honourable members to give it the condemnation it deserves.",110
237,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMITTEES,"In addressing my remarks on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94, it is my intention to look to the future. I will be relating my comments on the 1993-94 budget to that end. We have been listening to a lot of discussion and debate about the past. I think it is time we started to look to the future. Every budget produced over the last 10 years has been structured by Labor governments to for enhance Australia's opportunities in a changing world economy. Australia ,has been transformed during this period. We were an inward looking economy, protected by tariffs in the manufacturing sector. We were reliant on the mining and rural sectors to generate export income. Let us look at what we have today. We have a modem economy poised to take advantage of the new economic opportunities for long-term investment. Let me detail the main economic parameters on which real long-term opportunities can be realised. We have not seen these parameters since back in the fifties and sixties. They are stable government and a stable democracy and confidence in economic management. Both are important ingredients when large investors, looking 20 and 30 years out, seek to move large amounts of capital from one part of the world economy and place it in a different area. We have those two ingredients. Another very important ingredient is low and stable inflation projections. We have that ingredient. We have a competitive and stable currency. We have low and stable interest rates. Once again, we are to the fore with a trained and skilled work force. We have a work force willing and ready to embrace change. Investors now realise that Australia-our Australia-can deliver all of the economic parameters that they require for making long-term investment decisions. This has been a major achievement of Labor governments which have set out to develop this solid base. Today the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) detailed to the House the number and type of registrations received by the Development Allowance Authority for the period 1 April 1993 to 30 June 1993. A total of 50 projects were registered during this quarter, bringing the total of projects registered to 65. These 50 projects, in the quarter alone, have a total capital of nearly $12 billion. Nearly 80 per cent of the projects registered to date are in the manufacturing and mining sectors. To listen to some of the speeches from our opponents in this House, one would think there was still doom and gloom. They are not looking forward, but I can assure honourable members that many parts of Australia are, certainly those dealing in the real economic world. While recognising that economic conditions are right for investment, I have some concerns as to whether the community at large realises how important it is for regions of Australia to go out and win that investment. We are now in a world economy and we are competing with others for that investment. The question we as Australians now need to ask ourselves is: what should we be doing to maximise the golden opportunities now before us as a nation? This budget, which we are discussing this evening, cannot be taken in isolation from the previous budgets introduced during the four terms of the Hawke government. The economic strategy commenced when previous Labor governments, under Prime Minister Hawke and the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), first set out by having a community economic summit. Shortly after that, major decisions were made which set Australia on a course which charted the waters of the international marke,t price. There is no gping back. We are in this now for the long haul. . I will detail to the House what we, the people of the electorate of MCMillan, are doing in response to the econQmic challenge before the community. First, I need to provide some background on how the economic strategy of successive Labor governments has forever changed the economic structure of the electorate of MCMillan. We clearly fall into three separate economic regions. On the fringe of my electorate at the western end in the shire of Pakenham, the outskirts of Melbourne are causing growth problems as well as providing green site opportunities for private investors. In the central region the successful restructure of the dairy· industry under successive value Labor governments, and in particular under the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), is bringing prosperity and stability, which has silenced even our most ardent critics. The dairy industry is supported by a strong and viable beef production industry. The potato industry is another performing at satisfactory levels. In the eastern end of the electorate we have the power industry of Victoria, based in the Latrobe valley. This is the region which is facing the real coalface of structural changepardon the pun. This is where the main action on structural change and economic development is taking place at the regional level. I am confident that the private sector will respond, and is responding, to the economic parameters in the natural growth areas of Australia. I am not so confident that this is, or will be, the case in areas which nourished and attracted investment during the Menzies era of the 1950s and 1960s and which today require special attention-'-a complete refurbishment in many cases. We in our region have recognised that opportunity knocks and have taken action to try to attract. those industries which will prosper if our assets and aspirations are combined with the long-term strategies of potential investment companies. In the electorate of MCMillan I have established a task force of senior CEOs, with the main objective to act as an intelligence unit to seek out economic development opportunities. Our charter is to provide information to our local region on economic opportunities and to provide to the proponents of those development opportunities our region's strategy for the next 20 or 30 years. We are attempting to be positive and do away with this negative doom and gloom approach that has permeated so much of Australia at present. To this end, we are now, through our local government structures, moving quickly to develop a strategy plan detailing our assets and aspirations. We realise in our region that it will be a partnership between federal, state and local governments as to how our economy will develop in the future. As a major move in this process, the Latrobe valley region produced and delivered a very impressive expo to Canberra in budget week. The expo was held in the main committee room. There were people from embassies, departments and ministers' offices, as well as advisers-as many people as we could attract. This was the first step in seeking out appropriate national and international opportunities. It is not our intention to chase rabbits down every burrow. We intend to match our assets with those investors who are seeking to produce in Australia and export to Asia in particular. We will also target companies which need to restructure to more environmentally suitable production sites in order to compete against imports and develop export opportunities. Several years ago there was a large investment in our region by the Japanese. The Japanese government spent some $800 million in the Latrobe valley region developing a process to convert brown coal to oil. The Japanese were looking to the future. They realise that it is not an economical proposition today, but it did not stop them from spending some $800 million on research and development. In doing so, they developed a process for waste water management which is of world standard and which we have possession of. There is in excess of $20 million worth of equipment of a very modern nature. It is in the centre of a greenfields area in which companies-anywhere in Australia, or even overseas-might want to establish an industry because the disposal of waste water and the reprocessing of waste water materials is a problem where they exist at present, or where they may be considering expanding to take advantage of the opportunities. We are out to seek and attract those industries to our area. Governments can best assist in this process and add to the positive economic parameters which have been established by a full evaluation of the infrastructures already available in regions of Australia which were developed during the Menzies era of the 1950s and 1960s. In this budget there is a range of measures across several departments which address this need for infrastructure evaluation. These measures are to be commended; The government's regional development strategy stands to benefit from a $2.1 million boost in spending outlined in the budget. An amount of up to $1.25 million has been allocated for a major study into factors affecting business investment in the nation's regions. A study will be undertaken by consultants and the government will call for expressions of interest immediately. The study will complement tQe Commonwealth's task force on regional development, chaired by ACTU Secretary Bill Kelty, which is currently investigating how the regions themselves can best contribute to Australia's economic prosperity. This will also run in conjunction with the Industry Commission report into impediments to investment in regions of Australia. From the visit to the Gippsland region, which was held in my electorate at Churchill at the Gippsland site at the Monash University, I can tell honourable members that there is an enormous interest in the regions providing to the government their opinions and ideas on what can be done. I am sure that we will get from the people of Australia the sorts of answers that we require in order to take advantage of our very stable economic situation. The report of the task force and the industry study will provide the basis for new government approaches to revitalising and stimulating economic and social development across Australia. It is strange to hear speeches from our opponents on the conservative side of politics where they. seem to have . lost the plot. They have lost confidence that the private sector can generate the investment that is required to revitalise Australia. That is not the case. It was not the case in the past, and it is something they will need to get back to before they will have any credibility with the Australian public. Our budget measures demonstrate. the government's determination to pursue every means possible to enhance the private sector's investment in Australia's economic and industry development prospects. Jobs will not appear by the waving of some magic wand. We need to blend policies for new growth areas with policies designed to restructure and redevelop opportunities in old growth areas. It is of interest to note that in Victoria yesterday the Melbourne Herald-Sun has decided to use the columns of its daily for a 'Victoria: Go for it!' campaign. It gives me some hope to think that perhaps there are signs that organisations such as the HeraldSun and the Age can no longer ignore the evidence that successive Labor government budgets have created the correct parameters for investment and that it is time to end the doom and gloom. It is time for investors and industry to respond, and they are doing that. The editorial in the Herald-Sun under 'Victoria: Go for it!' states: For too long Victorians have been complaining about what might have been instead of embracing what could be. lt continues: As the dominant source of news and information in the state we have an obligation to lead the way. I hope it does. I commend the Herald-Sun for this apparent change in direction, bearing in mind that we will always find a fair bit of the material in the paper still running negative lines. What a pity it was that just two months ago the Herald-Sun joined with the Age in inflicting great damage on the Latrobe Valley region in reporting what was a genuine story about past mistakes by industry with the use of asbestos. They embellished that story with incorrect, totally untrue and flamboyant material which was totally unrelated to the main story. When regions of Australia are out in the world competing for industry-as they are today-it is an absolute disgrace to see two important newspapers in our major cities treating a country region in the way they treated the Latrobe Valley. There is no walking away from the issue of asbestosis and the damage that has been caused by it, but that is not the case that I am arguing here. It needs to be highlighted, but in highlighting that story they did a dreadful injustice to a very, very important region of the state of Victoria. The Herald-Sun is today talking about our greatest assetVictoria: Go for it! I hope that it will get back to the point and really - go for it', return to the Latrobe Valley and give us a story and a response that the area really deserves. The Herald-Sun needs to realise that times have changed. The Latrobe Valley and its long-term corporate citizens-the SEC and APM-have restructured, and continue to do so at a greater and more urgent pace. New corporate identities such as Siemens, Mission Energy, Fluer Daniels, Simon Carves, Transfield and Gippsland Aeronautics have become part of our community. These national and international companies obviously believe that the economic parameters are correct for investment. I would point.out to those who have done this damage that the Latrobe Valley has cleaner air than Melbourne. It has cleaner water than Melbourne. It has a country lifestyle with a city base. It has a skiIled work force. It needs investment which. is complementary to its assets. In the Latrobe Valley we recognise that in the international economic market large investment opportunities are always a possibility if the economic opportunities are sound and the parameters are correct. We believe that the economic parameters are sound, that they are correct, and that the money markets recognise this fact, even if some of our so called leaders-particularly those on the opposition benches-appear to ignore it. They ignore it at their own peril if they ever wish to get the support of the Australian people. Labor governments, for all their faults, have not lost sight of the main game, and this budget is further proof of that undeniable fact. It is time for others to. do the same. I would like to comment on a few of the definitions of a region. I am chairman of the Labor Party caucus committee on regional development. There has been great debate on what we call a region. For me it is quite clear. I believe that Australia will be developed in the future by private enterprise. I have no doubt that it will be private enterprise that will generate the jobs. Governments have a role to play along with those developments. We have a particular problem with those areas that developed in the 1950s and 1960s. They were developed behind our tariff walls, where industry did not have to compete, and they were very complacent in looking forward to the future. When we compare our production with that of some of our Japanese investors, we have been left behind. But now we do have those opportunities, and governments have a role to play along with private enterprise. One of the tragedies in my area is that the restructuring of the SEC, which was a government enterprise, has certainly worked as far as the industry side of it is concerned, but it has completely ignored a major area of importance to the people-and that is housing. We have two cities, Morwell and Moe, close to each other-virtually suburbs such as we have in Canberra. A lot of the housing was built by government, and 80 per cent of that housing has been sold to the workers. Today those houses are valued between $35,000 and $50,000. They are situated in an area that has 2,300 badly neglected government houses. They are all part of the SEC restructure, and they are an integral part of what we are looking at in regional development. As the government is looking at regional development around Australia, I will be urging upon it that if private enterprise can it, then by all means give it the encouragement. But where it requires government intervention-and the area certainly requires that-'-we have a responsibility to rebuild, to refurbish and to do the right thing by the workers of this nation who have put their life savings into buying those properties. We cannot walk away and create the ghettos that have been created in some areas of the United States. We cannot walk away and completely rebuild on green sites. We have distinctive features in the Latrobe Valley. Why should we be delivering power and gas miles and miles from our area at the same price, when we can have it right nextdoor and provide it to industry to redevelop our area? I make this plea in this parliament tonight because I believe it is the last key that the government needs to make economic strategies right, to have the parameters in place and to make it really work. I commend the budget and the efforts that have been made in it to see that these industry policies are in place and really push us down that path.",114
238,Mr MCGAURAN,COMMITTEES,"Whilst I found much to disagree with in the contribution by the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham), I enthusiasti. cally endorse his comments regarding the Latrobe Valley. As one who grew up in the area, and who enjoys representing a neighbouring electorate, the Latrobe Valley is a much underestimated and, indeed, undiscovered part of Australia. The honourable member for MCMillan was perfectly correct in explaining the hardship that has come about from structural readjustment of the area's major industriesspecifically the State Electricity Commission of Victoria and Australian Paper Mills-and the efforts by so many involved in representative and voluntary capacities to bring about new industries and to give new employment opportunities. I wish the honourable member for MCMillan well as he confronts that very daunting challenge. There is no doubt that anything he, in his capacity as chairman of the caucus committee for regional development, can do to assist our depressed regional do areas will receive support from this side of the House. However, I must disagree with the honourable member's judgment of the budget. I take quite a different view of the budget, mostly because I believe that the most fundamental requirement for the management of a nation's affairs is responsible government. I do not believe for a moment that we have seen that requirement met by the Labor Party. One of the most accepted and undisputed conventions of our parliamentary system is that elected government delivers stable and orderly government. But, in its handling of the budget process, this government-and particularly the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)-has dumped that tradition. In no other area is it more important for the government to demonstrate its leadership and lay down a consistent policy in economic management. The community of the business world-domestic and international investment and financial houses-needs to be able to read a government to adjust its conduct accordingly and move down predictable channels. It might not like the policies of the government of the day, but above all else it demands stability and predicability. But, against every 'expectation of what a good government has to do, the Treasurer has thrown the budgetary process up in the air. What we now have is a federal budget mark 2, with mark 3 only hou-s or days away. Consequently, since 17 August-the date of the official launch of the budgetthere has been a process of negotiations, trade-offs, reassessments, refigurings, rewritings and internal Labor Party brawls involving the caucus and the Labor movement. At any time. I expect the Treasurer to make a public announcement about budget mark 3. Let us hope that we finally get the real thing, along with a new set of budget papers with program performance statements as well. I cannot recall a government ever before having to virtually withdraw its whole budget from the marketplace. It is a sort of political duct recall. It is an unprecedented retreat by government, especially one that should be in the full flush of re-election mode. Actually, my memory does stretch back to the controversy at the time of the Fraser coalition government in 1979 or thereabouts when that government was pilloried for adjusting a tax measure which affected the incomes of newspaper boys. It was a significant issue because the governmelJt had to finetune a budget measure soon after it had been announced. It was unheard of at that time. But here today we are looking at a budget process which has been completely blown out of the water. Here we are, with the Treasurer having to rejig the major thrust of the budget and redo the numbers again. I am not sure how the Treasurer will redo those figures. On the petrol backdown, between $200 million and $300 million will be lost from the unleaded petrol price rise, and that is not factored in until February 1995. So just how will the Treasurer explain the gaping hole in his figures that has now arisen? No doubt he will tell us, as he always does when in a comer, that it will be covered by future growth-just like everything in One Nation was to be covered by future growth in international demand. Maybe he will just say he has underestimated the Reserve Bank's earnings. When in doubt, the Treasurer says, 'Keep your fingers crossed and just change the numbers'. . This is all a sad but accurate commentary on what the Labor government has done to the public policy process in this country over the past decade. We are not so shocked about any of this as once we might have been; we are getting used to seeing the policy process abused and manipulated. As we look back in time, we should look at how the process has been corrupted and its integrity whittled away. We should look at how the government and this Treasurer have systematically tom up the community'S expectations of what level of public administration it can expect from the government it elects. The Treasurer will never recover from this. His credibility in the business sector here and proabroad has been shredded. No Treasurer can rewrite a budget a week or so after its delivery and be expected to retain even a modicum of regard, esteem or respect in the eyes of the financial sector. As a result, Australia cannot any longer be seen as a nation with a stable public policy process. It is a country where everything is up for grabs, where there is a government which not only rewrites the nation's history but rewrites its own economic settings as well. The government itself has no idea where it is going. We have seen the internal turmoil and drama of the past few days when the caucus, for once, actually found the spine which is supposed to run up its back and challenged the Prime Mip=.'ter (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer to change some of the most odious parts of the budget. Nonetheless, people need to remember that some of the worse features of the increased taxation remain within the budget, at least at this stage, unless we in the coalition parties can convince two more senators to join us to defeat the tax increases. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you remember the Treasurer's spin on budget night? This was the 'quality' budget; this was the budget which would 'commence a new era in public finance'. With these standards as his benchmarks, what can we expect next from the Treasurer? Maybe this has been a quality backdown; a new era in flexible public administration. I remember the Treasurer early in the piece that the budget was nonnegotiable. So much for the pathetic attempt to use the muscle of office to talk tough. We alI remember the phrase, do we not, from the Treasurer, 'I'm not in the mood for negotiating'. The Treasurer is having some pretty dramatic mood swings of late. He is now in the mood for anything that will save his political hide and that of the government. I am not saying that the budget should not have been changed; it should have. It was universalIy condemned. There was no consultation with the community and no consultation even with other ministers. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) knows only to welI that there was no proper consultation. After all, he was the one who found out a short time before the official delivery of the budget that there would be an increase in taxation on wine as well as an increase in the wool tax. It is remarkable, it not, that a member of cabinet and a minister in charge of a major portfolio does not even know of the two most significant tax hikes in that portfolio that could implemented at this time in the two industries in question. The community has drawn the line with the government. It is simply not prepared to be manipulated and deceived as it has been in the past. It is not prepared to cop the smarmy spin of the Treasurer in place of honest communication. The budget deserved to be returned to sender. Blit perhaps the Treasurer's performance should not be singled out unfairly. He is just suffering from what every other member of the government is suffering-a crisis in public administration. The budget debacle comes on top of policy failures. On every front it has wrecked primary policy initiatives and offended key constituencies. On Mabo, the Prime Minister has run the resources industry, the most fundamentally important sector of the Australian economy, around in circles for month after month. He has sent conflicting messages to Aboriginal communities every day. He has disaffected every relevant interest in Australia on Mabo, and shattered high hopes for a genuine nationtelling the public al consensus. If people cannot recall One Nation, they should try remembering the federal government's 33 principles on Mabo. This was another one of those policy landmarks the government laid down that was spun from fairy floss, as they say. All of this happened for the same reason that the budget is in pieces-because the Prime Minister thought he could use public policy to extend his own interests and to impose his own flawed judgment on the community. Again, on the federal government's response to the High Court's Mabo decision, we should look at the record of the Prime Minister's statements since about April. We will find that they bear no consistency; that they are replete with backdown after backdown. It has been a policy running around in circles and then turning in on itself. The Prime Minister thought he could dominate the is debate, set the terms and run on rhetoric. But being Prime Minister is not that simple, and it requires a measure of leadership and respect for others that the current Prime Minister possibly be simply does not possess. On the crucial area of labour market reform where the Prime Minister and the Treasurer know that it is absolutely imperative to capture real productivity gains, they have backtracked and openly capitulated in the face of the union movement. That one is on a par with the budget backdown. I feel some sympathy for the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, for I very much fear-indeed I am convinced from newspaper reports over the last few days-that he is being prepared to be the fall guy. It will not be the Prime Minister or the Treasurer who will risk their reputations by having gone weak at the knees in the face of concerted ACTU pressure; it will be their old friend the Minister for Industrial Relations. I have a fair deal of sympathy for him. Nonetheless, he has made plenty of others his fall guys in previous years, particularly in another life in another parliament, so perhaps it is only a very minor, passing, fleeting moment of sympathy. The government went head-to-head with the union movement in an attempt to embrace the coalition's concerns about deficiencies in labour market flexibility to extend productivity based enterprise agreements to the non-union sector-about 75 per cent of the private labour market. The government knows only too well that this is a crucial policy challenge, as do employers and employees. It required breaking the union-public sector minority monopoly over so-called workplace agreements. That policy vehicle is a smoking chassis lying on the side of the road. The debacles are everywhere-pay TV, spending undertakings, tax undertakings, Medicare undertakings, child allowance and pension undertakings. This is what the government has finally come down to: after 10 years in office all it has learned is how to better deceive the public. But this time it has been caught out, and the community does not intend to forget. The Prime Minister today launched, in some detail, the government's proposals for legislation in response to the Mabo judgment. It is not the drafting instructions or the legislation itself, but it does give us an indication of the government's approach to the many aspects of this difficult and complex issue. The government has failed to respond to the High Court's decision on Mabo. The government's failure is another example of the failure of the public policy process under the Prime Minister. The court's decision demanded a comprehensive, unequivocal, clearly stated policy position which put the High Court's judgment firmly in the setting of the national interest. This is what governments are meant to do; this is their principal responsibility as office holders. But, instead of this, the Prime Minister has dragged the community into a long period of confusion, division and confrontation. And this has not been without dangerous long-term consequences, either. The Prime Minister's mishandling of the Mabo judgment has corroded the nation's international standing, put at risk the financial health of the nation and damaged the federal system of government. He has allowed the investment community to spiral off into uncertainty, pushed the resource sector in front of a landslide of doubt about security of title and personally abused just about every individual and every organisation which has had a point of view that did not blindly support his own. Australians are coming to realise that the government's conduct on Mabo is indicative of its approach to government under the Prime Minister. Whenever an issue arises in which the national interest is at stake the Prime Minister will grab hold of it and abuse it for his own personal political purposes. This is what the Mabo mess we are trying to clear up is all about. Mabo presented the community and the public policy process with a challenge of great complexity and significance. No-one doubts that. These things do arise from out of the national experience and from time to time governments have to confront them. But what that requires-and this is where the government failed so terminally-is a steady hand in policy judgment and a high level of political maturity; that is, when issues of the scale of Mabo arise, they require the qualities of leadership to address them. Issues such as Mabo always threaten to tear at the national interest and, consequently, they cannot be exploited for political purposes. Simply too much is at stake-and much more than the short-term political standing of a Prime Minister or a floundering federal government. These are passing concerns by comparison and I even think there are honourable members on the other side of the House that realise the truth of this. You see, once a government cannot identify or separate its own political agenda from an issue of genuine national concern then the public administration process in this country is in very real jeopardy. That is what happened over' Mabo. The Prime Minister was handed the issue with all its attendant heavy national responsibilities. And what did he do? He misused it in a failed effort to enhance his private political stocks, to drive out the of his predecessor and to grab control of the Left faction within his government. Mabo was not a challenge in public administration and policy to the Prime Minister. It was just another issue to twist for his own purposes. This is the benchmark for personal integrity and leadership the Prime Minister brings to his office. Of course, in all of'this the Prime Minister has struck out at the community itself for becoming so absorbed in and anxious with the indecision on the part of the federal government. There are not too many groups he has not offended or mocked over the course of the last few months for daring to question the policy black hole in which he has dropped the Mabo judgment. If too many people were talking on Mabo matters, it was a sign of the desperate need for leadership from the government. But to the Prime Minister it was a form of insolence that they spoke at all, and their motives were always impugned. The Aboriginal groups that met at Eva Valley some weeks ago and who asked just what kind of Prime Minister we had were slammed down as lacking genuine leadership-as ironical an accusation as one will ever get. But they had every right to question the processes, if any, which have governed the policy development on the Mabo judgment. They knew that they had been let down by the Prime Minister and betrayed by promises which could never be kept and by expectations which could never be met. The Aboriginal community may find a lot of our actions hard to fathom; but none more so than the incapacity to speak honestly and the tendency to mislead. Duplicity is not a character Aborigines appreciate at all well, and when they see it in the Prime Minister they have a right to say what they think. Moreover, the spate of Aboriginal Mabo and Mabo related land claims which have caused such anxiety to the community are not simply misguided or malicious. They flow from the chaos the Prime Minister has created over the government's response to the Mabo decision. Of course, the Prime Minister would deny any such confusion. He would put any suggestion like that down to scaremongering. But legacy how many voices can be wrong on Mabo? How many individuals and organisations have to speak out in dissent before the Prime Minister or someone else in the government sounds the alarm? He believes the Aborigines at Eva Valley were wrong; the Australian Mining Industry Council has been wrong; the Premier of Queensland is wrong, just as are the other state premiers; CRA is exaggerating its concerns; Mitsui and Co., one of Japan's biggest investors in Australia, is off track; Chase Manhattan Bank is very clearly wrong; Peter Barnett of Pasminco is wrong; the British investment house, James Capel and Co., is misled when it says there is confusion over Mabo; and the list goes on and on. The Prime Minister's leadership is lacking. He is unable to inspire his government. This is the image the community is presented with when the government has to tough out a hard issue challenging the national interest. Sadly for the nation, the Prime Minister fails each and every one of these major national interest tests.",118
239,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"It is always a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) in these debates. I am pleased to learn from him that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will grab control of the Left faction of the Australian Labor Party. I am sure my colleagues in that faction will be pleased, and I am sure that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), who is at the table, will be interested in that. The honourable member also posed the question of how many voices can be wrong on Mabo. I do not know, but I do know that the voice of the honourable member is most certainly wrong on Mabo. I am pleased to finally have the opportunity to speak in this appropriation debate. I was due to speak late on Tuesday evening but I was denied the opportunity because of a slight mathematical error. So I now take the opportunity to speak and, in doing so, support the motion and reject the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge). Given all of the media speculation that this budget has receivedMr MCGauran-It is more than speculation.",122
240,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"All of the speculation has been interesting reading. It is surprising that so little attention has been directed to the issue of unemployment. I would also suggest that, had the situation in the other place been a little different, there would not have been as much speculation on the outcome of this budget as there has been. But, as the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said in his budget speech, the greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians. Too many are now out of work, too many have been out of work for too long, and the primary object of the budget is jobs. But would one believe this by reading the media? As usual, they have focused on a couple of negatives in the budget. As I said, had it not been for the difficulties in the other place, budget would have been treated as a one-day wonder by the media. The target for the 1993-94 budget is jobsmore jobs for more Australians. And the only way to get those jobs is through economic growth. This budget sets the scene for economic growth. The budget contains measures to ensure economic growth is achieved. Another pleasing aspect contained in the budget is this government's commitment to regional development. Coming from one of the great regions of Australia, the IIIawarra, I know how important it is to get the regions moving once more. In my own electorate, in about 1983, the steel industry was employing 23,000 people. Today, with rationalisation, that industry employs a little over 7,000 people but is producing more steel. Many jobs have been lost in the coal industry also, and there are now only half the jobs in the coal industry that there once were. For all the jobs lost in the steel and coal industries, there is a multiplier effect in the community, particularly with other jobs being lost as well. It is important for· us to come up with initiatives to get these regions moving once more. The government is doing this. It has established a caucus committee on regional development, chaired by the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham). I am pleased to be a member of that committee. The government has also set up another committee to look at regional development in Australia and the two committees will work in tandem. For too long regions have seen themselves in isolation from each other. In the IIlawarra region, for example, we appreciate that our future economic development and prosperity is not only tied to the IIIawarra itself but also to the surrounding regions. The western suburbs of Sydney are of vital importance to the development of theIllawarra, especially with the establishment of the Badgerys Creek airport. I take a slightly different view from that of some of my colleagues about 8adgerys Creek. I believe that Badgerys Creek will not replace this Kingsford Smith as a passenger airport. Kingsford Smith, with a parallel runway, will have the capacity to deal with passenger air traffic until 2015 or 2020. If we are really going to be the clever country and be competitive with our Asian neighbours, what we need at Badgerys Creek is a proper international cargo airport. It is essential that we have that. If the government cannot or will not fund that, then we will have to go to the private sector and invite it to put its money where its mouth is, The private sector has been very critical of governments in the past and one of the criticisms I have of industry in this country is that it always wants the government to lead. We could have a proper international cargo airport at Badgerys Creek. It could be profitable and, with the movement westward of so many industries, it would be a viable proposition. It will not replace Kingsford Smith airport. One of the great benefits of Kingsford Smith, from an international perspective, is its proximity to Sydney. As offensive as it might be to honourable members from other states, research shows that international passengers want to come in through Sydney. Sydney will remain the gateway to Australia through Kingsford Smith. However, while Badgerys Creek can be and should be an international cargo airport, another aspect that could be developed is the operation of charter flights. That is an area that we have not exploited nearly enough in Australia. If the government cannot or will not fund the Badgerys Creek project, it should be put to private enterprise. With the growth of manufacturing industries moving to the west, it is inevitable that Badgerys Creek will become essential as an international freight airport. Since that area of the western suburbs will be linked to the IIIawarra by both road and rail, it is essential that the Maldon-Dombarton rail link be completed. Other areas around the IIIawarra, such as the Southern Highlands and the central west, could use the port of Kembla as an export port for a whole range of products, such as wool from the Goulburn area, hides, and wheat. In all these areas we can and should develop the value adding aspect. In Australia, we have a history of shipping out raw materials. We have always been very good at growing things and then shipping them out of the country but we have been very bad at taking the next step of value adding which is so essential and so profitable. Forthe IIIawarra to achieve this, as well as the Maldon-Dombarton rail link, we will need a replacement road for the dangerous and totally inadequate Macquarie Pass. Someone mentioned earlier the former life in another parliament of the Minister for Industrial Relations who is at the table. I well remember the many representations I made to him about a road called Caloola Pass. I wanted that to replace the Macquarie Pass road. I still believe that is essential if the IIIawarra is its rightful place as one of the great regions of Australia. It is no longer appropriate for regions to act in isolation or even to think in isolation. For a regional strategy to be successful it must encompass much more than one region. I also believe that in this country, linked to the regions, we should have an integrated transport network. We should have a land, road, rail, air and shipping transport system. While on the subject of shipping, I take this opportunity to say that honourable members on this side of the House will fight to retain cabotage. I am amazed by the opposition's determination to open up the Australian coastline to the rust buckets of the world. Last year in this parliament we tabled a report called Ships of shame which highlighted the condition of some of the ships that are trading around the world. These ships really .are shameful. Not only are they a danger to the lives of the seafarers who go to sea in them, but they are also a great danger to the Australian coastline. Imagine the pollution that would be caused if one of these ships went down inside the Great Barrier Reef. I was listening when the honourable member for Gippsland was lecturing us, as the opposition always is, about reforms. No industry in Australia has had more reforms over the last few years than the transport industry. One has only to look at what is being achieved. Because of the reduced number of people working on our ships we are now internationally competitive. The same applies to the waterfront. I have heard constant criticism of the operation of the waterfront. Some people seem to take the view that if the waterside workers were taken out, lined up against a wall and shot, all the problems on the waterfront would be solved. The Maritime Union of Australia, the old Waterside Workers Federation, has gone through tremendous reforms in the last few years. There are still some problems on the waterfront but they do not lie with the union; in the main, they lie with the users of the waterfront. They lie with the mishmash of hours of operation on the waterfront, the mishmash of deliveries, and to take the mishmash of different opening hours. More reform is needed on the waterfront, reform that does not lie with the Maritime Union of Australia but with the users of the waterfront. The opposition amazes me with its criticism of the government for listening to the concerns of the community and of its own backbench. I wonder why the opposition is so upset by the government listening to the people of Australia. The government is always accused of not listening but when it does listen and takes note of what people say, it is criticised again. Honourable members on both sides of this parliament stand up and make great speeches whenever we have a budget. I have seen 10 or 11 budgets brought down in this parliament and I am aware of budgets brought down. in other parliaments. I am yet to see anywhere in Australia or anywhere in the world a budget brought down that causes people to go dancing in the streets with joy. That does not happen with budgets. Budgets are difficult documents to frame and they contain tough decisions, but they are decisions that must be taken. I tell the populists who think that every budget should cause people to dance in the street that I am yet to see a budget that has caused people to do that. I very strongly support the changes recently announced in relation to the budget. I am not as concerned as many of my colleagues are regarding the differential between leaded and unleaded petrol. In an ideal world, which we do not live in, I would not want to see petrol prices go up, but they have gone up. I represent the Port Kembla region and we suffer from a real lead problem there. We have lead in the air and lead is getting into the blood children. In fairness, I must admit it is not lead from vehicle emissions but from some of the industry around Port Kembla. But over the last few years I have almost lost count of the number of reports I have read, not only reports produced in Australia but reports from overseas, about lead in the air and its impact on young people. This Saturday at 9 o'clock, as is the case the first Saturday of every month, I will attend a pollution meeting in Port Kembla. Again, one of the main topics will be lead: lead in the air, the impact it is having on the health of the young people in that area and what we and the local community are doing to alleviate that. There is absolutely no doubt that it does have a very serious impact and there is absolutely no question, for the sake of our children's health, that we have to get leaded petrol out of the system. I support the government reversing its decision in regard to Medicare rebates for eye tests. I have always been a great supporter of Medicare. I indicated that support very strongly during the last election campaign. My own personal view was that, by taking the eye tests away from Medicare, we were actually making an attack on Medicare and I regretted that very much. So I am pleased that the decision has been reversed. Indeed, I am pleased about the decision to reverse the retrospectivity of tax on unused long service leave. I have never been in favour of retrospectivity. People make their arrangements based on the current law. We may think it is a wrong law, we may think it is unfair, we may think all sorts of things about it, but if people make their decisions in good faith based on that law, I do not think that any government of any persuasion should go back retrospectively five, 10 or 15 years. It is not cricket. The law should apply from this moment, so that people know that from the time we announce the decision in the budget, it will be there. People can make adjustments and arrangements for that. We should not say to them, 'With regard to that decision you made five or 10 years ago, we're now going to tax you on it'. That is not fair, that is not cricket, of and I am pleased that the government has changed that decision. I also welcome the tourist initiatives announced in this budget. Tourism has been one of the growth industries in Australia. Why should it not be when we in this country have so much to offer to others? The sign of a good government is its ability to listen and, where appropriate, change. The on opposition makes all sorts of speeches about the government changing its decisions. I think that, instead of showing a sign of weakness, this shows a sign of strength. We went back to our electorates last week, we were given the message, we brought it back to Canberra and we expressed that message. With all credit to the government, it took note of what the backbench was saying and, where appropriate, changed. Everything that the people are asking for has not been changed, but I think the key elements are there. Let me warn the opposition, as one who was slightly critical of some aspects of the budget, that we have drawn the line in the sand. We will stand and defend the budget because we think it is a good budget, we think it contains the measures to offer economic recovery to this country. It is a budget that will bririg jobs to this country. We will defend it, and the people of Australia will thank us for it. Debate (on motion by Mr Somlyay) adjourned.",123
241,Unknown,COMMITTEES,"Sitting suspended from 6.24 to 8.00 p.m. (Quorum formed) TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993 Cognate bills: CUSTOMS TARIFF (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993 EXCISE TARIFF (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 August, on motion by Mr Gear: That the bill be now read a second time.",126
242,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"I thank honourable members of the Labor Party for coming into hear my remarks, because they are particularly important to the Labor Party. The bills before the House tonight, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill, are the bills of betrayal; the bills that will cost 50,000 jobs; the bills that are in total breach of the Australian Labor Party's election commitments; and the bills which are grossly regressive and which will propose a disproportionate burden on low income Australians. It is worth the House recalling that during the six months leading up to the election campaign, both the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) argued over and over again that they would not put up taxes. These bills put up taxes. On 19 November the Prime Minister told the ABC Lateline program: What I'm promising is not to put up tax. On 16 September last year the Treasurer said: I emphasise that this will be achieved without resort to any new taxes. On another occasion he said: We will not increase the overall burden of tax. On 19 August the Treasurer said: The point is that the tax cuts can be funded without any new tax ... During the Labor Party's policy launch the Prime Minister said: No big new taxes. If this country's political system were to be based on that type of deceit, then it is not surprising that there is now widespread cynicism all over Australia about the Labor Party and, in particular, about the Prime Minister. Those who have condemned the tax increases in these bills are not just members of the coalition, are not just members of the official opposition, and are not just the minor parties in the upper house and other sectional interest groups around Australia. There are many honourable members of the Labor Party itself who have condemned these bills. If this parliament worked in a truly democraticway, if this parliament really had genuine integrity, then those honourable members of the Labor Party who supported the opposition's detennined opposition to many of the measures in these bills would cross the floor and join us. I hope that those honourable members will reflect on that. I hope that they will put the interests of the country and, in particular, of low income Australians before the interests of party politics. I fear they will not. I am pessimistic about it. I appeal to honourable members of the parliamentary Labor Party in this House and in another place-or at least those honourable members of the Labor Party who agree with people such as Premier Arnold of· South Australia, Premier Goss of Queensland, and the Treasurer of Queensland, Mr De Lacy and those other old comrades of the Labor Party who have condemned these bills-to cross the floor and join the coalition in opposing the most obnoxious aspects of this legislation. Before I talk in detail about this legislation, I want to focus, in particular, on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, which is arguably the most pernicious of the bills before the House. I say arguably because there is no doubt that the increases in petrol tax are extraordinarily regressive, and that they will do great damage to this country's economic interests. There is a debate about whether the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill is constitutional if passed by the Senate and by this House and if it becomes an act of parliament. We have had advice from two distinguished Queen's Counsel and informal advice from others that this legislation is quite unconstitutional. The legislation, if it is enacted, contravenes section 55 of the constitution. If honourable members of this parliament wish to support this legislation-and they include not just honourable members of the Labor Party but also members of the Australian Democrats as well-it is very likely they are supporting legislation which is unconstitutional. The Prime Minister has been claiming at the dispatch box that the coalition would not be able to amend thi& legislation. If we cannot amend this legislation in the Senate, then that proves beyond any doubt that the legislation is unconstitutional and in contravention of section 55 of the constitution. It is unconstitutional if the legislation cannot be amended because it involves imposing taxation which, in tum, can be interpreted as meaning the . imposition of tax increases or new taxes. This bill clearly does not deal importantly and consistently with section 53 of the constitution. It does not deal with only one subject of taxation. Why is it that the Labor Party has entangled itself in this constitutional issue? The reason is that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are trying once more to be too smart by half. They think, by trying to ram these measures through in one bill, that they can somehow persuade or-more than that-trap the Senate into supporting the whole bill by ensuring that it is unable to amend the bill. That is the plan. But that plan founders because if that is shown to be true-if it is shown that the Senate cannot amend the bills-then the bill, once it is enacted, will be unconstitutional. How will that affect the Australian Labor Party's latest draft of the budget? Mr Horne-Let us worry about that.",126
243,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"No doubt these bills will be amended by the Labor Party in the future. The honourable member may be delighted with these bills. Whatever his electorate is, I am sure he will be very happy to go back to it and explain to the 80,000 or so people there what progressive and constructive measures these increases in sales tax and fuel excise are. Whoever you may be, you. might find it a very interesting exercise. But whatever your reaction, judging by the reaction of your colleagues in the caucus meeting earlier this week, they are not with you, mate. You are on your own. They do not like these bills because their constituents do not like them. Their constituents are Australians who feel deceived and betrayed by these bills that the Labor Party has introduced into this House and which will be supported by the Australian Democrats. Mr Baldwin interjectingMrDOWNER-The Minister for Social Security is another one who indulges in this sort of unctuous self-righteousness-the great champion of the disadvantaged. London to a brick, the minister will vote in favour of these measures-of course he will; blindly-even though he was not consulted when they were put together. Already this bill has been referred to a Senate committee and I believe the government would be very unwise-to put it as kindly as I can-to proceed with this. I turn now to the impact of many of the different provisions in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, but at the end I will come back to the question of the fuel excise. First of all, this is the bill that amends the income tax cuts that were promised in the One Nation statement and which the Prime Minister, on 19 February this year, stood up at the National Press Club here in Canberra and said were law-'l-a-w, law'. They were the two tranches of tax cuts which were to be introduced on 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996. Where are those two tranches of tax cuts now? One tranche has been brought forward in this legislation, the other tranche has been cast off to oblivion. That makes up approximately two-thirds of the tax cuts that were promised by the Prime Minister in the One Nation statement. The promise was repeated over and over again during the election campaign. His whole credibility rests on these tax cuts, and two-thirds of them have been cast off into the wilderness. The Prime Minister puts the novel proposition to this House that if the whole of this bill were defeated-it is a hypothetical proposition-those who defeated it would be opposing the tax cuts. Mr Horne-Too right.",127
244,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"Nonsense. You do not have the intellect to grasp the point. That is why you will sit there for two years and then you will be gone. You will just go off in a puff of smoke, pal. We will never see you again. If this legislation is defeated,. the first tranche of tax cuts will come in seven months later but the second tranche of tax cuts, which the government is confining to the wilderness, will be cast off altogether instead of two-thirds of the tax cuts being delivered by 1 January 1996. Even, hypothetically, if the whole of the bill were defeated-I do not believe it will be-the Australian people would still get tax cuts. So let us not have the humbug from the honourable member for Blaxland any longer. Even the members of the press gallery most biased in favour of the honourable member for Blaxland as Prime Minister-and there are not many of them any moreMr Jull-Laura Tingle.",128
245,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"Almost all of them. They can see through this particular charade; this line of argument. So I think when the honourable members opposite vote, as they surely will, with great enthusiasm for this bill they will do so knowing in their hearts that they are perpetrating an act of shame. But perhaps they know no shame. Perhaps just winning an election with deceit is more important than being decent. That is what this legislation decent to defraud people in the way they have been defrauded. Mr Leo MCLeay-You would know all about decency.",128
246,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"I db not want to be drawn into a debate with you about those sorts of issues, but it is very tempting; The second aspect of this legislationMr Leo MCLeay interjecting",128
247,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"You used to be the speaker, you would think you would know something about orderly behaviour. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have listened with interest to some of the things that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has said. Earlier today his colleagues took a number",128
248,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Order! What is your point of order? Mr Leo MCLeay-Earlier today the honourable member's colleagues took a number of points of order about calling members by their titles. I heard him refer earlier to my colleagues as 'pal'. They are not 'pals', they are honourable members of this House and he should use their titles.",128
249,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,You used to be the speaker of this place once.,128
250,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! Resume your seat. Mr Leo MCLeay-They have also raised the point about abusive language towards honourable members. The honourable member for Mayo has just been involved in a diatribe against the Prime Minister. If those opposite want those standards to be dealt with they should lead by example themselves.,128
251,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Honourable members are aware of the standing orders in respect of addressing honourable members in this place and I suggest that on those occasions they refer to them by their electorates or their titles.,128
252,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,I did. The fact is that the former discredited speaker ought to try to take,128
253,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! I ask you to is about. It is not withdraw that.,128
254,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,I withdraw. The second measure in these bills is the massive increase in tax on lump sums from accrued long service leave and annual leave. We understand from the newspapers and from a press release. that has been put out by the Prime MinisterMr Horne-It's gone.,129
255,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"It has gone, has it? In the latest draft of the budget, the government is not going to proceed with the increase in tax on lump sums from accrued long service leave but it is going to proceed with the increase in tax on lump sums from accrued annual leave and it is going to do so retrospectively. No wonder my mailbox has been filled with letters from people writing to me about this pernicious measure-people from the military and the police who have shown great dedication and have been unable to take the sort of leave that perhaps some other sections of the community can take, but who have had the security of knowing that they would have this nest egg when they retired. It is just snatched away from them. I would like to foreshadow to the House that the coalition will be moving an amendment to these clauses of the bill to have them deleted so that that tax is not increased. Thirdly, this bill imposes company tax on credit unions. There is an economic argument that there should be a level playing field in the financial sector. Mr Speaker, you would know a lot about this. There is no reason why the credit unions, building societies and banks should not all be exposed to a similar tax regime. I am sure, Mr Speaker, that privately at another time you would correct me if I were wrong. The well named Martin committee inquiry into banking-of which I was also occasionally a member-concluded that the exemption from company tax for credit unions should remain. That was the view of the Labor Party in the lead-up to the election. The credit unions, naturally enough, feel somewhat miffed when, having believed that a measure like this would not be imposed, it is suddenly dragged out and imposed on those credit unions after the election of the Labor Party. It is not going to break the credit unions-I am not pretending that. I am not exaggerating the impact of it. But it is a measure which was thought up at the very last minute. There was no consultation with the cabinet and there was no consultation with the caucus. It was just put into the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill in order to raise a bit-not a lot-of extra money. The government deceived the credit unions. It told them that it would not remove the exemption. Then came the election which it won-and it did so. Whatever they think of state Labor govemments-;-there are only a couple left and the second last one will be extinguished in a few months-what will they think of the federal Labor Party and its leader, the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, deceiving them in that way? The fourth measure is the increase in fringe benefits tax which is imposed in two different ways. In general terms its base is extended. It is all very well to launch yet another taxation attack on business, the high rollers and so on. I am sure that receives much applause in the Labor Party-but at the end of the day businesses are not going to comfortably absorb these costs; they will pass then on. Everybody in the House knows that. Even members of the Labor Party, who seem quite inept about money and finance, would know that business will pass on the costs in the form of higher prices. Who pays the higher prices? Mr Thckey-Plus a margin.",129
256,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,Yes. Mr Horne interjecting,129
257,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The honourable member for Paterson will cease interjecting.,129
258,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"We have learnt that he is the honourable member for Paterson-so we have learnt something tonight. But he will not be here long if he behaves like that for the next two years. I do not know his name; but he is noisy. Businesses will pass the costs on in the form of higher prices which will be paid by consumers-and disproportionately by low income consumers. That does not matter to the Labor Party; but it ought to think through it. The measure, ultimately, will do two things: it will be regressive, falling disproportionately on low income earners; and secondly, it will make our businesses a little less competitive than they are now, so they will have less capacity to employ people. My colleague the shadow minister for tourism, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), will later say a great deal more about the second aspect of the tax-and will move an amendment to the second reading of the bill-which is that fringe benefits tax is imposed on business travel. The coalition in another place will move to refer this matter to a Senate committee. We hope to have the support of the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine in that process. This evening I wrote to them urging them to support that. Those opposite ask: does it matter? Yes, it does. Mr Ruddock-It is about jobs.",129
259,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"As my colleague the shadow minister for social security says, it is about jobs. There is something like $10 billion of investment-the honourable member for Fadden will know about this-waiting to go into high-level tourist development which, as the Australian Hotels Association has pointed out, will be threatened by this measure. That translates into something like 10,000 jobs. How many more jobs will be lost if Australia loses the important convention market and businesses hold their conventions in the cheaper offshore environment, goodness only knows. The first sentence of the budget speech says that the budget is about jobs. It is almost the definition of irony that the budget speech by the Treasurer imposed a tax like this on businesses and on the hotel and convention industries. It will threaten investment and cost jobs. Where is the logic and common sense in doing this? I know that a lot of honourable members on the other side of the House agree with me. I hope their colleagues in the other place will have the courage to cross the floor and ensure that this matter is referred to a Senate committee. The fifth measure is the increase in sales tax. There is nobody in this country who is economically literate-excluding honourable members opposite who support this measure-including people in the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office, and just about every business and economic consultant and professional or academic economist in Australia, who does not know that our sales tax system is a shambles. It imposes costs on business and, according to the Treasury, adds something like $2 billion a year to the cost of our exports. It is not a great idea to do that when the budget figures predict an $18 billion balance of payments deficit for this financial year. Those opposite have increased sales tax in a way that is manifestly regressive-although they argued that the GST, as an indirect tax, was regressive. Having won the election, they increased the rate of sales tax. They say they are against regressive sales taxes but, instead of abolishing them-we were sure they would not do that, and they did not say they would-they increased it. Where is the decency and common sense in increasing the cost of our exports and doing business in Australia and imposing a disproportionate burden on low income Australians? We will give a prize to any member of the Labor Party who can point out during this debate how this measure has common sense. I want to hear all those opposite, one after the other, defending this matter. But they will not. All they do is make childish speeches about how awful the coalition is-with the 'yahoo, suck' sort of stuff from the Prime Ministerand about how we will destroy the world. But I guarantee, London to a brick, that not one member opposite will fiercely defend this measure. We will move amendments at the committ- stage to oppose this regressive, job destroying measure. The sixth measure is the 55 per cent increase in the sales tax on wine. That affects my electorate of Mayo which has a number of progressive wineries. I refer in particular to the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies report, released by the Labor Premier of South Australia, Mr Arnold. I would like to hear those opposite interject and abuse him. He has an election coming up-so I ask them to get stuck into him. This perfectly objective, academic report shows that this measure will lead to a 13 per cent decline in the demand for wine and increase the cost per litre of wine by 16 per cent. In the electorate of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), in the Riverland, which is an area of South Australia which has really struggled very hard to survive in the last 10 years-""Mr Leo MCLeay-Where is he?",130
260,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"Where is the Treasurer? He never comes to listen to debates on his pernicious and vicious measures. This measure will cost 140 jobs in the riverland. It does not matter to the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay). He sits at the back and reads a magazine. Who cares about jobs in the Riverland? It is the last thing he would worry about. He has never thought about jobs in the Riverland-only about jobs in the right wing faction of the ALP. The measure will take $380 million out of the wine industry over the next four years. Mr Leo MCLeay-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am appalled by the honourable member's statement. I have been very interested in jobs in the Riverland. To attack me in this way is disgraceful.",131
261,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! There is no point of order.,131
262,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"Members of the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party have glass jaws. They love to dish it out but when it comes back they hate it. This measure will cut the heart out of the weakest state in Australia. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I raised a legitimate point of order. Must I be attacked by the honourable member as soon as I sit down?",131
263,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! There is no point of order.,131
264,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"South Australia has had it tough enough under Labor over the last 10 years, after Bannon and Arnold broke the State Bank. On one of the very few successful industries those opposite have whacked a 55 per cent increase in sales tax. That really is rich coming from the Labor Party. It will bury the Labor Party at the upcoming state election .. In the little time. I have left in this debate want to refer very quickly to the increase in fuel tax. The disproportionate increase in the tax on leaded fuel is highly regressive. The deal done with the Democrats does very little to reduce its regressive impact; it is still regressive. This measure will add costs to coastal shipping of $800 per ship per day, or $360,000 per ship per year. How will that make us more competitive? It will increase the cost of semi-trailers on the road by $6,000 a year. How will that make us more competitive? It will increase the cost of Australian National railways by $4.2 million; New South Wales railways by $9.1 million, and Vicrail by $2 112 million. How will that help Australia? How does that create jobs? How will that make us more internationally competitive? It will increase the burden of tax on agriculture, forestry and food by $290 million a year. The coalition will oppose this measure with all its might. If the Democrats and others are prepared to join the Labor Party in letting this measure through, they will pay a very high political price. The Liberal-National coalition is standing up against increased sales tax and fuel tax-these regressive, job destroying measures. Labor is proposing them; the Democrats are supporting them, and we hope that the Greens will not do likewise. In conclusion, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for including in this bill measures which subject the accrued leave entitlements of Australian workers to a savage retrospective tax, which place the future of Australia's wine industry in jeopardy, and which unnecessarily increase the burden of indirect taxation on the whole Australian community"". This is a miserable measure. The budget speech of the Treasurer, as I mentioned earlier, began with the words 'This is a budget about jobs'. This bill, and the accompanying bills increasing excise, are measures about destroying jobs; they are measures about imposing disproportionate burdens on low income Australians who have been the predominant victims of the Piime Minister's I self-induced recession. I would have thought that ultimately the Labor Party would hang its head in shame over these measures. The Prime Minister boycotted Jack Lang's funeral. I do not think that is widely known, but he did. Jack Lang would be spinning in his grave as the Labor government introduces these sorts of vicious measures. In conclusion, a lot of Labor members, the handful who ever bother to come into the House-the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) and the honourable member for Watson, those two in particular, not so much the others-think it is funny to impose an additional burden on low income Australians, and they think it is funny to increase costs on Australian business. I think that is despicable. (Time expired)",131
265,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Is the amendment seconded? Mr JulI-1 second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,132
266,Mr SWAN,COMMITTEES,"I support the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. This is a piece of legislation which is critical to our long-term economic future. It is critical to capacity to create jobs. It is critical to our capacity to export more and it will make this country, in the long term, more economically competitive in the world environment. Listening to the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) I was puzzled. I did not know whether I was listening to someone who was out of The Young Ones or whether I was listening to the Dan Quayle of the Liberal Party. The opposition does not have a program; it does not have a deficit reduction program; it does not have a long-term plan; and it does not have any plans of a policy nature to fund our budgetary requirements, to create jobs in the long term and to make us more economically competitive. The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill is directed at ensuring equitable outcomes and sustainable growth in the long term. First, it recognises that there are no magic wandsjust the hard grind to becoming more productive, exporting more, creating jobs, and funding important social welfare measures. It also recognises the need for fairness and the need to give tax cuts to lower and middle income earners. The most important objective of this bill is to build on the stimulus already provided in the One Nation statement and the Investing in the nation statement. It provides an additional stimulus of around $2 billion which will further generate growth and jobs in the economy. Secondly, the bill provides for a mediumterm strategy for reducing the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That is essential to ensure that our economical fundamentals are correct so that we can create more long term jobs in the private sector. Let us have a look for a moment at some of those economic fundamentals which are absolutely essential for creating those long-term jobs in the private sector. We now have the lowest interest rates for 20 years. We have restored the profit share. There has been a cut in the corporate rate of tax from 46 per cent to 33 per cent. We have abolished double taxation of equity income through the introduction of dividend imputation and we have introduced a host of general investment allowances, development allowances, and accelerated our depreciation. In essence, in recent years this country has become much more productivesomething like 30 per cent more productive since the early 1980s. We have a long-term strategy directed at generating jobs in the private sector. I find it absolutely amazing that those opposite can speak in this House when they have no long term plan on the revenue or spending side of the budget. We also have a plan to make this country fairer. That is represented in two respects through this bill. First, it is represented in the income tax cuts. They are targeted at lower to middle income earners; there can be no doubt about that. The contempt that the opposition has for lower and middle income earners is shown by the fact that it intends to block those tax cuts in the Senate. With these tax cuts people earning between $20,000 and $38,000 a year will now pay 34c in the dollar on each marginal dollar of income compared with 38c in the dollar. I do not know what those opposite regard as a middle or low income earner, but if someone is earning $22,000 a year and paying 38c in the dollar on each additional dollar of income, that is far too high. It is amazing that members of the Liberal Party can say in this House, day in and day out, that they are going to block those tax cuts. What they are talking about is taking tax , cuts away from ordinary people-from tradesmen, from plumbers, from carpenters, from nurses, from all sorts of ordinary workers who are dependent on those tax cuts. They have not had a wage increase in recent years and they have made a sacrifice for the long-term economic benefit of this country. They deserve some relief through a rearrangement of the tax scales. This is a measure, therefore, that is long overdue. Someone on average weekly earnings will get a tax cut of about $8 a week. As I said before, these people deserve the tax cuts. They have shown enormous restraint. What do they get from the opposition? They get contempt-contempt for the fact that the government is setting about rearranging the income tax structure in a fair and equitable way. What do those opposite intend to do? They intend to simply block those cuts in the Senate. What is the alternative that the opposition is putting forward? The measures contained in this bill, along with previous budgets, will give this government the capacity to meet some fundamental objectives and to meet its essential election promises. In addition to tax cuts of $8 to $10 a week for people on average weekly earnings, the revenue from this bill will give the government the capacity to fund the home child-care allowance from September next year, when we will replace the dependent spouse rebate with a home child-care allowance that will provide up to $30 a week for a carer in the home. In addition to that, the revenue measures this bill will enable us to fund the child-care cash rebate of 30 per cent of claimable expenses. It will also enable us to fund extra money for people on newstart allowances to the tune of $6 per fortnight. It will enable us to fund very substantial labour market programs-something like $1.3 billion of labour market programs-which will assist up to 500,000 people this year. That is a very substantial commitment. The revenue measures in this bill will also enable us to target emerging exporters and provide additional assistance to those exporters to generate further exports and further jobs for this country. The purpose behind the deficit reduction bill is to generate jobs, to fund the generation of those jobs and to fund essential social programs. This bill brings about a long-term change in our economic outlook because it faces the problems in the long term. It supports workers and families and it provides the framework for growth. What do we get from the opposition? What is its alternative? The alternative that we got this evening from the honourable member for Mayo was a bit like the Dan Quayle solutions under Reaganomics. The opposition says, 'We must cut expenditure, and if we do not cut expenditure just let the deficit blowout'. What do opposition members say about what they will do about the deficit? We had some sense of that listening to the honourable member for Mayo in recent times. In a press release that he put out on 13 August, the honourable member for _Mayo said: ... he will have to accept the fact that the level of taxation in Australia is far too high ... Instead of increasing taxes ... Mr Keating should substantially reduce taxes. The opposition is essentially saying that there the should be drastic cuts in public expenditure. Let us look at the sorts of cuts in public expenditure that the opposition is proposing. The honourable member for Mayo is saying that we should reduce our spending and taxation levels comparable to those achieved in some Asian nations. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said today, to do that we would need cuts in revenue somewhere in between $11 billion and $20 billion. So the honourable member for Mayo and other members of the opposition are saying that public expenditure should be cut to the tune of $11 billion to $20 billion. What items in the budget would come within that framework? If the opposition were to cut expenditure by somewhere between $11 billion and $20 billion, what items would go? I suppose it could abolish age pensions altogether. That is something like $11 billion. If it did not want to use the knife that harshly, it could knock off $2 billion in family payments or an additional $3.5 billion in additional family payments; or perhaps it could knock off $7.8 billion in unemployment benefits. We will get an idea of the opposition's priorities in the area of expenditure cuts if we go back to Fightback. Do honourable members remember Fightback-the plan that was put forward at the last election? We know from Fightback that the opposition was going to cut people off unemployment benefits after nine months, hack into labour market programs, abolish the CES and emasculate Medicare. We know all those things. When opposition members come into this House and have the hide to talk about the lack of genuineness in the government's proposals they should at least come in with some sensible alternatives. All they have said, through their senior economic spokesman, is that they will cut spending. They will not raise taxes; they will cut spending. If they are going to cut spending and bring it down to Asian levels, they will do it to the tune of $11 billion to $20 billion. The opposition will rip the heart out of the social safety net in this country, be it in health care, in labour market programs or in assistance to families. So when opposition members go out and talk about the budget in the electorates around this country, could they please tell the people that that is their alternaregressive tive? Could they please tell the people that they will not support the tax cuts and will knock $8 out of the wage of the average worker; that they will take away the family allowance; and that they will take away the additional family payment for low income workers? Could they please tell the unemployed that they will not be eligible for unemployment benefits; that they will abolish the CES; and that they will take an axe to the social welfare safety net in this country which is so essential to our continuance as a cohesive society? Opposition members should tell them that, but they should not come in here and pretend that they have some concern for families; they do not. All they want to do is slash spending. It is also worth having a look at what this government has done for those people in the community that the opposition is now pretending to represent. I got a real shock this evening when I discovered that the honourable member for Mayo knows the word regressive. That was a shock coming on top of Fightback, because if there has ever been a document produced in this country that is regressive it is Fightback. The opposition proposed to put a flat tax on all of the essentials of life-be it clothing, food, water, power or gas-and it comes in here and describes our proposals as regressive. What a joke! When opposition members go out into their electorates to campaign against this budget the people will remember what the alternative to this budget is: a flat tax on all of the essentials of life. That is why they voted for us and not for the opposition. They will continue to vote for us because this budget is built on notions of a progressive tax system. Despite all the opposition's bleating about how regressive one individual item in this budget is, this is a very progressive bill and a very progressive budget, and it can be seen on the outlays side of the budget as well as on the revenue side. Let us have a look at what Labor has done while in government for low income earners, the people that the opposition has now discovered, the ones that it thinks are affected by means in this bill. The real income of a sole parent with two children has increased under Labor by 29 per cent. Between 1975 and 1983 under the coalition it decreased by 3.8 per cent. We know the opposition's record on the regressive approach to low income earners and beneficiaries; it is there for everyone to see. Opposition members should tell the people that when they go out to explain their opposition to this budget. What about a pensioner couple with two children? Under the coalition their real income dropped by 2.2 per cent, but under Labor it has increased by 24 per cent. So Labor has a fine record in providing progressive measures to enhance the position of lower income beneficiaries, lower income workers and middle income workers. The opposition does not. The hypocrisy of the honourable member for Mayo when he talks about jobs is wh-re I think the real hollowness of the opposition is exposed. The honourable member for Mayo issued a press release on 25 July. In that press release he said: It is beyond comprehension how indirect tax increases would create one single job. That is dead right, which is why we went through the last election campaign with the slogan, 'Jobs, not GST'. The fact of the matter is that the alternative taxation proposals that the opposition relied upon in the last election campaign, and will rely on in the future, are flat taxes like the GST which cannot produce jobs. Contrast the opposition's approach of nat taxation and spending cuts with that of the government. This budget has a $2 billion stimulus. That will create jobs. This government has dropped the corporate tax rate to encourage more investment in the private sector. That will create jobs. This government has raised revenue to spend it on measures to facilitate extra exports, particularly amongst new and emerging exporters in the manufacturing sector. That will create jobs. The whole program of this government is dedicated to job creation in the long term, because we have a commitment to industry and an industry policy. That contrasts markedly with the opposition's economic policy, which simply has two arms: to hack into spending and hack into wages. On top of that, it wants to bring in massive indirect taxes across the board, across the necessities of life, and tax the out of the business sector and private individuals. That is the contrast. We can quite easily and credibly hold our heads up and go out into our electorates and defend this bill and this budget because they deliver justice to workers through income tax cuts and justice to families through assistance for children, be it through the home child-care allowance or through the rebates for child care. We can do that easily because it is a very substantial package for families whilst at the same time the arrangements on the business side facilitate additional investment. But what can the opposition do? It cannot go out with a program at all because it does not have one, except to say that it will slash spending. So every time the opposition is campaigning around this country in the next few months, complaining about an increase in the petrol excise or one or two other measures in this budget, we will be putting the acid on the Liberals and Nationals and saying, 'Well, what program we are delivering will you cut out?'. The opposition is not going to fund it. It has no plans to increase taxes; it is just going to cut spending. Which one is the opposition going to abolish? Will it be the home child-care allowance or the cash rebates for child care? We know that the opposition is not going to support the income tax cuts. The comparison is clear and very stark. The opposition does not have an economic policy; the government does. The opposition does not have a plan; the government does. The opposition simply has no desire to put together a vision for this country. For the opposition to come into the House and complain about taxation, after putting up a $27 billion tax proposal at the last election, is absolutely incredible and without credibility in the electorate. I have no problem campaigning on this bill and on this budget in my electorate, because it delivers justice to families and it will deliver jobs in the long term. It is not easy to argue the hollow nature of the proposals being put forward by those opposite. The opposition is continually talking about how this government is a high tax government, but figures released recently by the DECO give the lie to that assertion. Accordhell ing to those figures, Australia is now the lowest taxed country in the DECO. The publication from the DECO, relying on 1990 figures, shows that Australia's ratio fell from 30.8 per cent to 29.2 per cent while the United States ratio rose from 29.5 per cent to 29.8 per cent. The overall weighted ratio for the DECO was 38.7 per cent. So, in international terms, this is not a highly taxed country. This government is making the best out of available revenue sourceS, targeting its spending and delivering the fairest and most efficient result to the Australian community.",132
267,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"If the 1993 budget is a betrayal, as it is, then the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill is set to be the principal instrument of that betrayal. The legislation is an affront to the trust the Australian people put in Labor at the time of the last federal election, and those opposite know it. They do not say it in public, but they do know it in their own hearts. The bill is such an affront to the people of Australia that the government has felt obliged to dress it up as something it is not-namely, a deficit reduction bill-in order to obtain some semblance of political dignity. Mr Jull-A badly named title.",136
268,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"Totally inappropriate. The fact is that this is a taxation increase bill, and simple. The bill cobbles together a large number of the government's taxation proposals into one bill, designed to facilitate their passage through the Senate. It is a matter of record that this tactic has so far failed in that it has not stopped the Senate anticipating changes to aspects of the legislation and forcing the government into making some fundamental changes to its original budget proposals. It has also raised the question as to whether the legislation, as it is presently before us, is constitutional in terms of section 55 of the constitution because of the way in which it imposes more than one additional tax burden in the one piece of legislation. There are at least two reputable legal opinions in circulation which indicate that this legislation may indeed be unconstitutional. Needless to say, the bill has absolutely nothing to do with reducing the budget deficit, as the government would have us believe. The bill, taken on its own, actually increases the size of the budget deficit over the next three years-that is, the life of this parliament and the life of this government. The so-called deficit reduction legislation comes from a Labor government that has significantly increased the budget deficit for 1993-94 over the budget outcome for last year-1992-93. It comes from a government that has very little prospect of achieving its deficit reduction target of one per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97, on any current indications. The changes the government has made to its original budget proposals will increase the deficit in 1996-97 by $380 million. The budget deficit for 1996-97 will now rise to 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product instead of the 1.1 per cent forecast in the budget papers. The government that just over one year ago was proposing to 1ncrease the budget to surplus over the next three years is now promising to deliver a budget deficit in 199697 of nearly $6 billion. This figure is based on some very optimistic growth figures-even more optimistic than the now discredited One Nation growth forecasts-and so we should be mindful of taking even this figure very seriously. The pure government has no basis on which to start calling its taxation legislation a deficit reduction bill when it has not even begun to address the chronic budget imbalance that the very same government has inflicted upon this country for years. It is a sad state of affairs when this parliament cannot even give the tax legislation it is asked to pass an honest descriptive title. It is bad enough that the contents of the bill are the product of political deception on a grand scale, without the name of the legislation itself also being designed to deceive the people who will be penalised by it. If Labor were required to call this bill the 'Taxation Deficit Increase Bill', then the government's legislation would be exposed for what it is-a tax slug that does nothing to alleviate this country's economic or fiscal problems. Indeed, the bill, along with the rest of the government's budget matters, greatly compounds these problems already inflicted by Labor over 10 years of incompetence. Labor can hardly call this a deficit reduction bill since the bill has no such effect. The bill increases a wide range of taxes, completely contrary to the mandate given to Labor by the people at the federal election earlier this year. These measures are part of the several billion dollars in additional tax revenue the government will be collecting over the next four years as a result of this budget. The bill takes away most of the personal income tax cuts that were promised to the Australian people in Labor's One Nation statement ahead of the last election. The l-a-w-Iaw-tax cuts have gone AWOL, absent without leave, under this government. What is more, l-a-w now comes to mean 'lie and win'. Whilst the first round of tax cuts is brought forward, the second round is deferred under this legislation until some indefinite point in the future. The bill does not just take away the personal income tax cuts that were promised to the Australian people at the last election, it takes away from the parliament the right to legislate as to when that second round of tax cuts will occur, since the bill provides for the second round to be implemented by regulation at the government's convenience. The bill will allow Labor to sit on those cuts and implement them at a time when it is most politically advantageous for the government-that is, if it is ever to implement them at all. If the government is genuine about the proposed second round cuts, it should implement them from a set date that is enshrined in legislation. Then our phoney Prime Minister could go out and again say, 'The tax cuts are enshrined in law, I-a-w', but by that time it will be well known that I-a-w stands for 'lie and win'. Otherwise, we can only assume that the tax cuts are a sham that will never be delivered unless it suits the government. Legislation is not just an attack on the pockets of Australians; it is also an attack on the parliament's right to determine the implementation of tax law. Labor has gone to great lengths in an attempt to bludgeon the Senate and the opposition into passing its legislation. It has accused the coalition of advocating a larger budget deficit when this bill itself is about increasing the size of the overall deficit and when the coalition already has on the public record a program to reduce the deficit. Labor has even gone so far as to engineer a money market crisis over the legislation in an attempt to scare the Australian Democrats and others into falling in with the government's budget tax measures. These actions on the part of Labor are indicative of its desperaSenate. tion in trying to get these tax increases through the Senate. It is the l-a-w-'lie and win' - technique. The government has no respect for the checks and balances inherent in our federal system of government. It has little appreciation of the need to negotiate and to seek compromise with the Senate. The government's preferred approach is to bludgeon the Senate and minor parties into submission. It was only when these ham-fisted tactics seemingly failed that Labor entered into serious negotiations with some senators. In the end, however, it was a caucus mutiny over the inequities of the budget that will do the most to determine the ultimate form of the legislation-and 'mutiny' is the right word. The Prime Minister reminds me of that character in the Caine Mutiny-and the honourable member for Fadden e Mr Jull) tax knows the one I am talking about-Captain Queeg. He is there in all his glory. The only thing missing with our Prime Minister these days are the ball bearings-as the honourable member will remember-rolling around in his fingers. He is stressed out because he lacks his power nap in the afternoon. Caucus has been up there interrupting his little afternoon sojourn on the settee; no more power naps for the Prime Minister. Mr Jull-His eyes were rolling around yesterday.",136
269,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"Yes, they roll back, do they not? The Labor Party caucus has effectively confirmed the criticisms of the opposition which we have been making from the outset of the government's budget by demanding that key features of it be overturned. Never before in the history of this government has caucus so decisively repudiated the actions of the executive, in loose terms, but specifically the spaced-out Treasurer e Mr Dawkins) and the stressed-out Prime Minister who, combined, have managed to lock out an army of Australian jobless. Unfortunately, this entire episode from budget mark 1 through to this legislation has ended in a shabby deal being done with the Australian Democrats to get most of the government's budget tax nasties through the The Democrats, of course, will be aiding and abetting the government in introducing higher wholesale sales taxes, increases in petrol taxes and increases in the taxes on lump sum annual leave accruals. It appearS that the entire budget has been designed as though it were some sort of ambit claim to allow the Democrats to claim a victory over the government without really changing the substance of what the government is about to do. This is further indicated by the fact that Labor claims that its overall budget strategy is still intact. This is after the deals with Democrats: the government claims it is still intact. The Democrats must realise that this is no victory over the government; it is the same blow against Australians that the government originally conspired to produce, but with a few concessions to the minor parties to make them feel in some way useful to the democratic process. Instead, the minor parties are exposed as being completely ineffectual when confronted by a government prepared to give them a hollow victory. The Democrats obviously do not care about the implications of the measures they are now supporting for growth, employment, inflation and interest rates, and the consequences for the standard of living of all Australians. The government's justifications for its tax measures continue to strain credulity. Labor continues to regale us with figures by which it tries to suggest that Australia is a low tax country. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan), trotted it out dutifully as if on cue from our spaced-out Treasurer. The most recent of these figures are the 1991 OECD revenue statistics which suggest that Australia now has the lowest ratio of total tax revenue to gross domestic product in the world. The first thing that should be said about these figures is that they are as much a reflection of the increase in the total tax take of other countries as of an improvement in our situation. The ratio of total tax revenue to GOP in the United States and Turkey has risen, as has the un weighted OECD average figure in the most recent statistics. Australia's ratio also fell slightly, to put us at the of the list in terms of total tax revenue to GOP. More to the point, however, is the irrelevance of OECD comparisons for these purposes. OECD statistics allow us to compare ourselves to other industrialised countries which may have many of the same economic problems as Australia. They do not, however, provide an appropriate benchmark against which we should be measuring our performance. Virtually every OECD country that we might care to name would consider it desirable to reduce its total tax take. Indeed, many the of them, such as the more chroniC social democracies of western Europe, have bloated public sectors and truly frightening tax levels that present huge problems for those countries. We should not be patting ourselves on the back for beating some of the worse performing countries in the world in the global tax stakes. Instead, we should be thinking in terms of an appropriate tax level for Australia, and what this means in terms of our international competitiveness. The only way to do this is to work out what our spending requirements are and then levy the taxes accordingly, preferably in the same financial year in which the proposed expenditure is to take place. No-one who seriously examines Labor's spending programs today would suggest that all, or even most, of that money is well spent. Yet we are a long way from raising all the funds through the tax system that the Commonwealth spends in any given year. Instead, we borrow large sums of money to make up the difference, and defer the necessary taxes until some later period to be picked up by future generations of young people going through university, high school, primary school, preschool and probably by those not yet born. If we are not spending well the money we raise now and, by extension, the money we will have to raise in the future, then our current levels of taxation are too high, regardless of what the rest of the world might be doing. The same could be said of most countries that have unsustainably large public sectors as we have here in Australia. If we bottom cannot justify additional Commonwealth spending, then we certainly cannot justify increased Commonwealth taxes, no matter how small our tax take compared to other countries, OECD or otherwise. If we look at the total outlays of all governments in Australia and the rest of the DECO, then we find a negligible difference between the two. In 1992-93, total outlays of general governvariety ment in Australia amounted to nearly 40 per cent of gross domestic product. In the DECO for the same period they averaged 41.2 per cent. These figures also compare unfavourably to the situation in 1968-69, when government outlays in Australia amounted to only 26.3 per cent of GOP, but were nearly 32 per cent in the DECO. In other words, the gap between Australia and the DECO has narrowed significantly so as to be negligible on the expenditure side. Getting back to revenue figures, a far more interesting comparison than that with the DECO is with the taxation performance of countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The of taxation in Australia is generally twice as high as the tax levels to be found in the countries of the east Asian region. region with which we will increasingly want to trade and compete in the years ahead. No matter what the reason, that is the fact and that is what we have to address. And yet we continue to compare our performance with the sclerotic economies of the western European social democracies, many of which are ditching social democratic policies as quickly as they can. This is entirely at odds with the government's stated objective of increasing the.level of our economic integration with the Asia Pacific region. This highlights the fact that Labor is being highly selective in its use of taxation statistics. It is reaching for any numbers it can find to put a good light on its own performance, no matter how inconsistent this approach may be in terms of the government's broader policy objectives. Labor puts so much store in these figures, simply because it has so very little else to cling on to in justifying its record and performance in office. The government's DECO comparisons also ignore the cost of the government's total tax take it imposes on the rest of the economy. To measure the total tax take is one thing. It is quite another to look at the compliance and collection costs imposed on the economy by the taxes that we do impose. The compliance and collection costs of the of taxes levied by the Commonwealth are generally acknowledged throughout the world to be higher than those found in comparable countries, with the possible exception of the United States of America. In addition, there are economic costs associated with the distortionary effects of many of our taxes that are also not revealed by the figures giving the total tax take as a proportion of the GOP. It is well known that Australia has a highly inefficient and expensive tax system in all these respects. In addressing the 11th national convention of the Taxation Institute of Australia earlier this year, Sir Harry Gibbs delivered a damning indictment of the state of the level tax system in this country. Among other things, he said that the state of tax law in this country 'reflects no credit on the society This is the which tolerates it'. Labor wants to lull Australians into a false sense of security as to the status of the tax system in this country. It wants to convince us that we should tolerate an ever increasing burden of tax to underpin the government's extravagance and incompetence. That is what this bill and the government's rhetoric is all about. This legislation reflects no credit on any of us, but least of all the government and the Australian Democrats. (Time expired)",137
270,Mr JOHNS,COMMITTEES,"So much for the sermon. It is time we had some explanation of the meaning of deficit reduction. But first I will need to address the amendment moved by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). In some instances the allegations are incorrect entirely and, in others, they make very little difference at all to the substance of deficit reduction, which is one of the key elements of the 1993-94 budget. The amendment states, in part: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for including in this bill measureS which subject the accrued leave entitlements of Australian workers to a savage retrospective tax ... This needs to be clarified. 1\vo forms of leave have been discussed in the last couple of weeks: holiday pay and how that is to be taxed and long service leave. We have changed the nature of the taxation which we were to impose on long service leave. The honourable member for Mayo suggested that we would wipe our new tax treatment of that leave entirely. That is not so. We have simply changed the tax to a prospective tax of long service leave entitlement. On the question of accrued holiday leave, those taxes remain unchanged as announced in the budget originally. Let me make'it clear that most workers will accrue no more than about eight weeks of holiday leave throughout their entire working life. That is what is written in most awards. Holiday leave cannot be accrued endlessly. We are talking about some increase in the tax over maybe eight weeks of leave. On top of that, any increase in tax can be avoided by leave simply being taken at the end of one's working life. The government would like workers to take their leave. There was a time when superannuation was not readily available to the Australian worker and it was a very sensible idea to build up a nest egg of unused leave of whatever form, .vhich in a sense would become the worker's retirement benefit. That is less important today as we, this government, have begun to provide superannuation as a form of retirement income for workers. So the notion that leave of whatever nature needs to be accrued anyway has somewhat passed us by. We are keen that workers use their leave. They can avoid any increase in taxation. For the benefit of the honourable member for Mayo, we have simply changed the incidence of taxation of long service leave. The amendment says that the taxation on Australia's wine industry will place the industry in jeopardy. We are increasing a domestic wholesale sales tax on wine to bring it into line with beer and spirits. As a lover of Australian wine, I can assure the House that it might tum me off wine for a couple of weeks-maybe a month or two-but not much longer than that. There may be a shortterm, insignificant impact on the consumption of wine in Australia-but not much-and almost no impact on the export of wine because· these taxes do not affect the cost of exported wine. Big deal. This is not going to affect the future of the wine industry in Australia. The amendment also talks about the unnecessary increase in the burden of indirect taxation. It is true that we are seeking to raise some $3 billion in extra taxation by means of indirect taxation. But that pales into insignificance when we compare it with the opposition's plan to introduce a GST to raise in excess of $20,000 million from the Australian public. We are raising comparatively little and returning more than that amount by way of tax cuts. That disposes of the views put by the honourable member for Mayo. Let me return to those people who regard the budget as an important step in controlling government expenditures and returning the government's own deficit to a minor amount over a four-year period. I will refer to statements made by Ian Salmon, the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Panel of the Business Council of Australia and also the Managing Director of the AMP Society. Honourable members might expect him to be critical of a Labor government's budget, but that is not so. On behalf of the Business Council of Australia he is saying that he recognised the difficulty of the economic . circumstances in which our budget was framed-notably, high levels of unemployment, modest growth in the domestic economy and an uncertain world outlook. But all of these things underline the need to provide a stimulus for growth. Mr Salmon said: In such circumstances we welcome the Government's confirmation of its commitment to longer term deficit control as expressed by its intention to return the Commonwealth budget deficit to around one per cent of GDPin 1996-97. Quite simply, this will mean that budget outlays will have to be reduced by over $9 billion over the next three years and the public sector will need to contribute to national saving to assist economic growth to be stronger and more sustainable than it is at present. Well done, Ian Salmon. He is right; that is what we seek to achieve. There were two principal pillars of our budget. Firstly, we had to frame a budget that delivered the things that we promised the Australian public in the recent election campaign. Those things have been delivered almost completely in full. Set out in a document called Building on strength: government action on election commitments, which was tabled at the time of the budget, are something like 100 commitments fulfilled by the budget. Obviously, there was money that we had to spend because we promised that we would. The most obvious form of expenditure was the tax cuts which we promised the Australian public. Secondly, we clearly promised that we would reduce the government's deficit to a smaller proportion-one per cent of gross domestic product-by 1996-97. Resting on those twin pillars, and between those two commitments, was the need to raise some revenue on the way through, but that was nothing in comparison to the magnitude of revenue that had to be raised by the opposition under a GST regimen. That was the starting point for the budget. Even if the opposition had been elected, it would have had to face all its commitments on expenditure, as well as meeting the need to reduce the government's deficit-the government's call on Australia's savings or the savings of foreigners if we were to borrow abroad. Most people would agree with us that that is a decent and sensible thing to do. Certainly, Ian Salmon agrees that is a decent and sensible thing to do. I promised my electorate three things at time of the election. The first was that we would give them a tax cut but without introducing a GST. The second, which was specific to my electorate, was that men over 60 years of age who are chronically unemployed could get access to the aged pension system. We have announced and will deliver on that. The third promise was that women caring for children at home would be paid an allowance for looking after those children. All those election promises have been delivered but in addition we have taken a much broader stance to demonstrate that the government has a responsibility to help the entire economy and to ensure that it can produce jobs over the next four years. That is the bit that the opposition has left out during the kerfuffle that has taken place over the last week and a half. A government can stimulate an economy in the short term. It can borrow and spend some money, as we did under the One Nation statement of 18 months to two years ago, and as we are going to do in the short term later this year by delivering tax cuts. However, it cannot be done forever. There is a time and a place for the government to provide a stimulus to the economy. It cannot be done forever or we would go broke. It is as simple as that. We have promised a short-term stimulus to keep the economy moving but we have also promised to withdraw that stimulus over the course of four years in order to get out of the way of the industries-the AMPs and others-that produce jobs in Australia. They are the ones who will produce jobs that are sustainable and will remain in Australia. Mr Sharp-What about small business?",139
271,Mr JOHNS,COMMITTEES,"That includes small business as well. If, in order to pay for servIces, the government is competing for funds at the same time business is, then we bid up the price of that money; we bid up the price of borrowing. Our figures show that we will not be bidding up the price of borrowing and that, in fact, it is a good time for business to borrow and expand. We are getting out of their way but we are not doing it at such a the rate that we would defeat the very purpose of the budget, which is to help stimulate private sector jobs. Between these twin pillars-the promises of the budget on one hand and the responsibility of reducing the deficit on the other-we have produced a budget which, in the last days, has gone through minor variations, the magnitude of which is about one per cent of the budget. Beaut! There was a response to some anger in the electorate but the changes are absolutely unimportant to the basic pillars upon which we seek to build this budget. I want to say something now about the tactics of the opposition. Had the opposition been faced with the same external constraints of world economic growth, the same internal problems, the same sort of government owned deficit, and the same trading deficit that the nation carries-all of those problems would have been exactly the same for the opposition-it would have produced tax cuts and it would have increased indirect taxation by larger amounts. Its strategy would have been similar-brutally different but similarto ours. So why is it that the opposition would choose to oppose all of our tax measures in the upper house? The opposition parties have done that because they are cranky, because they are bad losers and because they are grizzlers. They are sore losers. That is why the tactics of the opposition in the Senate are so difficult to understand. It is not that our policies are wrong; it is that the opposition is really dirty about losing the last election. I have received a lot of mail in my electorate in the last few days. A lot of people have been cranky about some of the things we have done. But the sort of mail that really gets up my nose is the kind that starts, 'I have voted Labor all my life'. Bulldust! One or two of them will be genuine Labor voters who are not all that happy, although when we start to get the message of the budget across they will come back. There is no problem there. The rest are Liberal voters who are disaffected. Believe me, I can tell from the addresses that they are Liberal voters who are so cranky about getting done at the last election that they tell big lies and write, 'I have voted Labor all my life'. They have not, they never have, and they hoped like crazy that they could knock us off last time so they could do what they thought were decent things with the economy. Thanlc goodness they did not get their chance. At the end of the day, and if it had any sense, the opposition would have had to produce a similar deficit to ours. In other words, it would have had to allow the government to withdraw from the game bit by bit to let the private sector take over. The trouble that the sweetener in its would be budget was to be tax cuts which were essentially funded by massive cuts to government expenditure. I cannot get accurate figures-they seem to vary between $12 billion and $6 billion-but big money was involved and it would have required, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said in question time today, not just fiddling at some of the government's programs but a wholesale dismantling of government programs. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was running around last year, talking to the likes of the St Vincent de Paul Society, saying, 'Why don't you run the welfare system in Australia? Why don't we privatise it?'. He was really saying that he does not believe in the public sector's right to deliver the welfare state-the minimum benefits that those who are poor and unable to get a job deserve. Rather, he thought he would get an organisation like St Vincent de Paul to do it out of the goodness of its heart and he would pay it a couple of hundred million dollars to do it. That was a disgraceful effort. The Labor Party has learned over time that while there is no inherent right for a government to deliver an unlimited level of service to the Australian people, there is an inherent right to deliver a minimum acceptable level of service to the Australian people. Although the nations with which we now seem to compete-the Asian nations-might grow faster than Australia, they are only 10 years away from establishing a middle class who will want the same sorts of rights as Australians now have. They will want a safety net that says that if someone is disabled or unable to earn an income, they should be assisted by the state; if someone is unemployed, they should be assisted by the state; if someone is ill, their medical bills should be part paid for by the state. That is called progress; that is economic progress. In a mature, industrialised economy, Australians expect that. We are not going to ditch it. We may have a problem paying for it all on the way through, as we seek to recover or gain new markets for the sale of is our goods, but we are not going to abandon a very large proportion of those things which we seek as a right from the government sector. The Labor Party has learnt that we need to be efficient in the delivery of those services. If it means we have hired too many public servants in the past to deliver a government service, then it is sensible that we should have fewer public servants deliver those services; we agree. We have been putting the heat on the poor old public sector for 10 years. The Minister for Finance has been doing a lot of this work. We have produced a greater dividend in terms of the work output from the public sector. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said some days ago, 'Enough is enough'. We have reached a point now where we have no interest in reducing the level of services that should flow from the government-that is, all taxpayers-to some people who are unable to look after themselves. And enough is enough-we have come to a point where we agree that we deliver those services well and efficiently, but that we will not reduce the standard of living of Australians to that which is not enjoyed by a number of our nearest neighbours. Certainly, those countries are growing at a rate of knots, but they will soon produce greater expectations amongst their electorates, their people and their work force for some of the benefits which we have grown to enjoy. We should not forget the basics of this debate. At the end of the day, it is important that we do not make comparisons with either European economies, when we talk about the level of the welfare state, or Asian economies, when we talk about rates of growth. It is important that we believe, within our own experience and expectation, that we now run a more efficient public sector, such that we deliver the sorts of services that Australians are welcome to, but that we no 100lger, as we did 10 years ago, subsidise middle-class welfare. We do not allow the middle class any longer to write off a great number of expenses against their taxation; we simply do not allow it. We have reduced the enormous numbers of ways in which people could get access to the funds of taxpayers by writing items off or reducing their income tax. What is said in lieu of that is that we have a method of transfer payments so that if a person has a measurable need-a woman whose husband has left her so that she is in need of support, a disabled child who needs caring for at home, a person with a physical or mental disability that does not enable that person to work, or an unemployed person-he or she should be paid directly by the state on the basis of that need. When we have come under enormous pressure to deliver the services of the public sector, we have done so in a very targeted way. I am proud to support the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the budget. (TIme expired)",141
272,Mr SHARP,COMMITTEES,"We have just heard a very interesting speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns). He and the government are probably capable of convincing a family whose house has just burnt down that the event that has caused their house to bum down has really been the best thing that has ever happened to them in their lives. What the parliamentary secretary has said to us tonight is that what the government is doing is fantastic, there are no problems, apart from a few minor inconveniences, that this is a fantastic government bringing down a fantastic budget and everybody, bar a few masquerading Liberal Party people, is happy with the budget. The fact is that that is not true at all. This budget has made a lot of people unhappy. Indeed, the government's performance over the last few years, and more particularly in the last few months, has caused a lot of people to be totally outraged. If the parliamentary secretary thinks that those people who have written to him and said, 'I've voted Labor all my life but after this budget I'm never going to vote for you again' are Liberals masquerading as Labor Party supporters, let me just remind him of some of the comments of people whom I am sure have always voted Labor. Martin Ferguson, the President their of the ACTU, when asked to defend this budgetsaid, 'I won't defend the indefensible'. What about the comments of the Secretary of the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council, Michael Easson, whom I am sure voted Labor at the last election-it would be will most unusual and disloyal of him if he did not. He has probably voted Labor all his life. He said that the budget was an act of bastardry. These people are reflecting the views of a lot of other people. I happened to be listening to Tamworth radio 2TM. When asked to describe the budget, the ALP Tamworth branch spokesman, Mark Lyden, said it was unfair. Do government members want to hear the views of other people on the budget? Merle Mitchell, President of the Australian Council of Social Service, said that the income tax cuts for middle and high income people had been funded by increasing indirect taxes that would hit low income people hardest. Bishop Michael Challen, the Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, said that the new taxes on petrol and other goods would affect low income earners far more. Michael Phillips, the Secretary of the Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, is someone else who has probably voted Labor all his life. With regard to the budget, he said: I have been disillusioned with Labor over a number of months now and I have no faith in them as representatives of the working men and women. What the parliamentary secretary said-that everybody is really quite happy and the only complaints are coming from people masquerading as Labor Party voters who really have been lifelong Liberal Party voters-is simply untrue. The truth is that Labor Party voters, uncommitted voters and Liberal and National Party voters, are absolutely and utterly outraged at the way this government has brought down the budget. The reason is that the budget hurts the poorest the most. The sector of our society least able to afford to pay more is going to end up paying more. Even the Prismod study that was done by Treasury the other day indicates that the lowest end of our income sector will be paying more whilst the upper end of our income sector will be paying less. There are other studies which confirm that that is the case. That is the reason why so many people, be they Labor Party supporters or others, are so upset about this budget. If the parliamentary secretary's speech were correct, then the reports of the caucus economic committee's meeting on Monday night must have been made up by all the journalists who reported it. We heard of 60 people attending the caucus economic committee's meeting. They are hardly able to raise 20 people, normally. Sixty turned up and they gave the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) an ear bashing like no other Prime Minister or Treasurer has ever had. Indeed, people who attended that meeting will state that it was the most unprecedented meeting of a caucus committee they had ever seen. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer stayed there for 3 1h hours. Initially, they did not even want to attend. They only went because members of their own faction insisted that they be there. Indeed, it was their own faction that turned on them the most. I was fascinated to note a report in a newspaper attributed to our great friend the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) who, of course, is not known for being particularly vocal. Indeed, he is probably known for not saying much at all in this place. But when he does say something, he says it well. He said at that caucus economic committee meeting that it was quite clear that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were tired and they needed a little bit of a holiday on the backbench. I dare say the words of the honourable member for Greenway sum up the views of most Australians. We have seen in this chamber over the last couple of days people in the gallery expressing their views about the sorts of things that are happening. People have been yelling out at the Prime Minister. A gentleman in the gallery today called out that the Prime Minister was a traitor. Indeed, he even used a word that we are not allowed to use in the House to describe the veracity, the truth, of the things that the Prime Minister has been saying.",143
273,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,He wasn't lying either.,144
274,Mr SHARP,COMMITTEES,"The gentleman in the gallery was not lying. Perhaps others whom he was referring to were lying. That is typical of the views of ordinary Australians. It is interesting to note that the polling that is being doneconsistent with polling that has been done post-budget for a long time-indicates that this is the most unpopular budget that has been brought down in 15 or 20 years. It is also interesting to note that the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), was sacked for bringing down an unpopular budget. Yet the budget that was brought down in this House on 17 August is more unpopular than that which the honourable member for Werriwa introduced here two years ago. Mr Bruce Scott-Honest John.",144
275,Mr SHARP,COMMITTEES,"But honest John was given the sack because of his budget's poor acceptance in the community. If there was any equity or fairness in the way this government did things, it would get rid of the current Treasurer and perhaps install somebody else, such as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) who is sitting opposite me tonight. He is a man who I am sure would do a considerably better job. But either way, the members of the government are up to their usual trick of trying to wriggle out of the problem. They tell the people of Australia-here in the parliament, in the media and as they travel around the country-that things are really not as bad as they are, that all the promises they made before the election have not really been broken and that it would really have been a darned sight nastier had the opposition been elected to government. The other day the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who is the President of the ALP, said on ABC radio that one of the problems that this government had in framing the budget is that the people who were involved in framing it, such as those gentlemen sitting over there in the chamber tonight, are all from Canberra-the most isolated part of Australia. Indeed, it is part of the process to say, 'Really, it's not our fault. We are good people. We just happen to be getting advice from people who are isolated from reality'. It is all part of the game of trying to pass on blame to someone else. Anyone sitting in this parliament over the last few days would think the budget was all the opposition's fault and that the problems of Australia's economy today are all to be placed on the shoulders of Sir Robert Menzies, the former long-serving Prime Minister of Australia. But the people of Australia know the truth. That is why the polls indicate what they do. That is why the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns), who spoke before me tonight, is getting an avalanche of mail saying, 'I've voted Labor all my life and after this budget I'm not going to vote for Labor again'. That is why I am getting those sorts of comments. For the first time since entering this place nearly nine years ago I am getting people stopping me in the street-people I do not know from a bar of soap-saying, 'For goodness sake, can you blokes vote against this budget? Can you block supply or whatever? Do something to stop this thing that is going to do us so much hann from passing into law'. The reason they are saying that is that the budget is regressive; it hits the poorest hardest. In my electorate of Hume, which is a rural electorate, the budget hits country people probably harder than it hits city people. The people who live in Hume are, in the main, fairly poor. If honourable members look at that marvellous chart comparing federal electorates that my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has in his hands here tonight, they will see that the people I represent are amongst the poorest in Australia. Those people will find that this budget affects them more than their city cousins. The reason for that is that the price of fuel is going to go up dramatically. The increase in fuel excise is going to have a very detrimental effect on country people. In country areas we depend upon transport and we have to write a significant amount into transport costs. Those costs will go up significantly. The road transport forum told us last week that the price of the average basket of groceries that one buys every week will go up by about $3. That does not take into account any other cost increases that we will the have to bear. Cost increases, such as the $3 to $4 extra every time people go to fill up their tanks, will flow their way right through the cost of doing business in this country. Of course, it will also affect the prices that we get for the products that we send to market, because country people produce a lot of export commodities. Those export commodities have to be transported long distances to our ports and to our wharves. As a result of that, the net return that we get for those exports produced in country electorates such as the electorate of Hume will therefore be less. The other sad thing about the increased petrol excise is that the government has chosen to hit people who own old cars even harder again. As recently as 30 December last year-just before New Year's Eve-the government was going around denying that it was going to put a tax on leaded petrol. I refer to a joint statement by the then Minister for Land Transport, the honourable member for CharIton (Mr Robert Brown), and the then Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), on 30 December 1992. It states: The false belief that the government has been planning to penalise owners of older cars by selectively higher' petrol prices and registration charges or even by regulations. I am most concerned that thousands of owners and enthusiasts of older cars have been nervous and angry for no good reason. The statement goes on to say: Mr Brown said that the main consequence of forcing older cars off the road would be to disadvantage many low income families. Stich a move would deprive many ordinary citizens of their independent mobility and access to work, health care, education and cultural and recreational activities. Later on in the same statement, both ministers say: We state categorically that the Commonwealth government has no intention of discriminating against owners of earlier model motor cars. We have not been considering, and are not considering, any action to force these cars from the nation's roads. That was eight months ago. What has the government done? .",145
276,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,Another broken promise.,146
277,Mr SHARP,COMMITTEES,"It broke its promise by discriminating against older cars, by bringing in an increased tax on leaded petrol which is used by older cars. Sixty per cent of motorists drive cars that use leaded fuel. Most of them are poor, unemployed, old people or students. They are the ones that this government has gone out of its way to hit the hardest. They wilI now be paying 33 1hc in tax for every litre of fuel that they buy. When this lot came into government just over 10 years ago, the fuel tax was 6c a.litre. By the time the budget is implemented, the tax on leaded fuel will be 331!2C a litre. Of that 6c that was collected from the motorists at the petrol bowser in 1983, 4c of it went back to road improvements. Yet in this budget we see road funding cut by some $600 miIIion-down from $1,600 million to just over$1 Ooo million. In the forward estimates j for next year, if. my memory serves me correctly, there will be a further reduction to $813 million. Road funding will be cut in half over two years whilst fuel taxes on the motorist will be increased. So it tells a story. It will not only be country people but country industries and industries generally, that will be affected by this decision. I Was interested to tally up the effect it would have on the railway industry. In my electorate of Hume there are some very significant railway towns: Goulburn, Yass, Harden, Cootamundra and so forth. The increased tax on fuel will add an extra $9.1 miIIion to the operating expenses of the New South Wales State Rail Authority. Wh.at does that mean? The answer is: lost jobs. There will be less jobs because of higher costs-costs which are being imposed by: this government. Mr Bruce Scott., - On unprofitable railways.",146
278,Mr SHARP,COMMITTEES,"Indeed, on unprofitable railways. It will make them less and less profitable, which means that state governments 'will have to cut the level of staff more and more. The increases will not only affect New South Wales. In Victoria the cost of fuel for Victorian state rail has gone up by $2.5 million. a year; in We.stem Australia it will go up by $2 million a year, and for the Australian NationalRailway-the Commonwealth's own railway organisation-the cost of fuel will go up by $4.25 million. Yet the Treasurer, in his statement in here on 17 August, said that this is the decent budget and this is the budget that will make Australia more competitive. How can that be so, when costs are going up all the time? ' Fuel and transport costs impact on every aspect of the costs of production here in Australia. It is not just the railways. I mentioned how the cost of things are going up and about how regressive this budget is. It is interesting to note that the sales tax changes that this budget introduces will also be sive. When the sales tax changes are introduced by this government the cost of a luxury car such as a Volvo 850 GTL, which costs around $67,000 or $70,000, will go down $3,008. The cost of the family Commodore will increase by $175 when the sales tax changes are introduced, and a Ford Telstar will increase by $230. The ordinary person who drives a Commodore will pay more for his fuel and more for his car. If he is wealthy and can afford a flash Volvo, he will pay a lot less. Mr Bruce Scott-Imported.",146
279,Mr SHARP,COMMITTEES,"Indeed, it is imp<;>rted as well, so it does not help the Australian manufacturers or Australian jobs. It is quite extraas ordinary that this type of disparity is occurring from a government that says it represents the true believers. The true believers have their faith because of what has happened in this budget. People in the shipping industry have certainly lost their faith. I was fascinated to see the Seamen's Union of Australia take out significant as during the election campaign urging Australians to vote for Labor and to vote against the coalition because the coalition would do it so much harm; yet the Labor government has put up excise on fuel used by ships· to the point where. it will cost the average Australian owned ship an extra $360,000 a year to operate. In the same week that the budget came down, after months and indeed years of reform negotiations in the Australian shipping industry, the unions and the shipowners agreed to crewing reductions that would save 111 berths on Australian ships. The increased cost of fuel will add the equivalent cost of 146 berths to the ships that are Australian owned. After years of reform we get 111 berths off and then the government comes in and puts up the cost of fuel, which is the equivalent of putting an extra 146 berths on board ships. So Australian ships are now less competitive because of thi"" government's decision. The Treasurer comes into this House and expects us to believe that this budget will regresmake Australia more competitive. He must think we are mugs. We are not mugs. Neither is the seamen's union which lio doubt wishes it had not put its money into those as and, indeed, had not done so much ta support this government which has turned around and slapped it in the face with these types of increases. The wine industry in my electorate is so important. It is the fastest growing industry in my electorate at the moment. The Cowra district has some of the best wines now being produced in Australia. We have rapid growth and probably the greatest hope for employment growth in towns such as Cowra, Young, Murrumbateman, Harden and so forth. But the wine industry is being attacked in this budget well. The explanation of the parliamentary secretary does not deal with the truth of the situation. The truth is that, by putting the tax lost up on wine as much as it is, the industry'S ability to export will be hurt. It is exports that will generate the jobs that we need in country towns like Cowra. This budget hurts the poor. It is regressive. It hits country people more than it hits city people. It proves that this government during the election campaign deceived the people of Australia, and for that it deserves to be condemned. (TIme expired)",147
280,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"I support the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the deficit reduction strategy behind the bill. The House is aware of the changes that the government has made which will affect the bill. These were outlined earlier by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) in respect of the differential between leaded and unleaded petrol, the reinclusion of optometrist services for Medicare rebate, the removal of the retrospective aspects of the accumulated long service leave provisions and the increased rebate for low income earners. I welcome and support these measures. I welcome them as individual items, but I welcome them essentially because they do not affect the central budget or deficit reduction strategy which is reflected by the bill. There has been plenty of disaggregation in respect of the budget and the deficit reduction strategy. There has been much talk about eyes, petrol and leave, but I believe the key to this bill is to look at the whole. This bill ensures that the government meets its objectives of getting the deficit down to about one per cent of GOP by 1996-97. People will ask why that is so important. It is important to look at some of the current ingredients in our economy such as low inflation, low interest rates, higher productiviment ty, greater competitiveness than we have seen before-30 per cent more competitive than 10 years ago-low company tax rates and increased profit share, in which there has been a 12 per cent increase over the past year. If we are to ensure that those ingredients remain intact, it is essential that we get the budget deficit down. We also must have all the ingredients for investment and growth which will ensure that we achieve our long-term objective-to ensure that in this country we have long-term, stable and secure jobs-decent jobs for the working people of this country. We can achieve that only if we work in an environment where we have low inflation, low interest rates and high profit share. These are the important parameters which are understood by the markets and by the - nternational economic community. They know that we are the only government which in the postwar years has achieved a budget surplus. There have been four surpluses in the postwar years and they have all been achieved by this government. The long bond rate has hardly moved because the international community and the markets know this government understands what it is doing in terms of deficit reduction strategy and understands the importance of it. I refer in more detail to some of these ingredients. We have the lowest inflation rate in this country for 30 years and the lowest interest rates for about 20 years. Last time. I looked bank bills were at 4.75 per cent and housing rates were about 8 1/2 per cent. Mr Bruce Scott-Interest rates at record levels.",147
281,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"Exactly-record low levels. Record low inflation, record low interest rates, the lowest industrial disputation in 30 years-all the things that the opposition can never achieve. Company profit share is up by 12 per cent in the last year. The company tax rate is down to 33 per cent whereas the opposiHon would like to increase it to 42 per cent. It is important to provide an environment for business to invest and those incentives. to invest-accelerated depreciation allowance, development allowances, investallowance, dividend imputation, 150 per cent research and development concession and 1,000 productivity driven enterprise agreements established at the federal level are all in place. These factors all provide the environment for growth, investment and long term,' stable and secure jobs. We have had positive growth for the last eight quarters, and in the year to June growth has been 3.3 per cent. There have been 80,000 new jobs created since April. It is clear that we are on the right track. It will be a long, hard haul, but we will provide with the deficit reduction strategy the continuing environment to achieve that. When it is so important to have an environment in which business can flourish and invest I find it surprising that those on the other side want to punish business. We brought the company tax rate down to 33 per cent. Their commitment was to take it up to 42 per cent and load onto the whole community a 15 per cent goods and services tax, together with the inflationary surge that that would have provided. One aspect of the deficit reduction strategy is in the area of wholesale sales .tax. It is always important to keep this regime in context. In the last financial year the wholesale sales tax regime raised about $9 billion. Through the measures that the government is proposing in this legislation, in the 1993-94 financial year an additional half a billion dollars will be raised. Let us compare that with the goods and services tax of which the opposition was so proud in the run-up to the election. Mark 1 Fightback, goods and services tax, pre-Christmas, when those opposite thought it was a good idea to tax food and throw people off the dole after nine months, would have raised $27 billion. Mark 2 Fightback, goods and services tax mark 2, when those opposite looked at the opinion polls and decided they had better junk tax on the fresh food and keep the tax on the junk food, would have raised $24 billibn. So the monster goods and services tax of $24 billion is compared with the wholesale sales tax which raises $9 billion. The government's budgetary in-sures raise in the order of $3 billion and we give back $3.8 billi()fl by way of tax cuts. So we have a $3 billion revenue raising package, a minnow compared with the $24 billion or $27 billion GST monster. And we have crocodile tears from those opposite. We raise $3 billion and give back $3.8 billion. They were proposing to raise $24 billion with Fightback mark 2. Mr Bruce Scott-You are talking about the wrong budget.",148
282,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"I am talking about what the honourable member stands for. He either stands for that, or he stands for nothing. Those opposite were committed to a goods and services tax that would have raised $24 billion, to. slashing $10 billion to $12 billion from outlays, to throwing people off Medicare and to giving them $3.50 an hour to work. That is what they stood for. The first round of the $3.8 billion tax cuts will be brought forward by approximately seven months. I am bemused by why those opposite want to stop them. Why do they want to stop ordinary working people getting an extra $8 per week, providing a further $2 billion stimulus to the economy? I cannot understand why the opposition wants to punish workers and the Australian community by stopping the delivery of these tax cuts. When the opposition was last in power it handed out tax cuts with a fist full of dollars, only to take them back. On this occasion, it would prefer to stop the tax cuts before they are given. And that is all in the context of Australia being a low tax country. We have the lowest level of tax in the industrialised world. We are the lowest taxed OECD country and we have lower tax overall than last year. The tax raised by this budget, as a proportion of GDP, is 23.5 per cent, compared with 23.6 per cent last year. That is the strategy behind the bill: to provide investment and growth and to ensure long-term future secure jobs. This is all in the context of what is delivered in budget outlay measures. In addition to the tax cuts to which I have referred, we have the home care allowance for carers at home; dentistry for pensioners and health care card holders under Medicare; relaxation of the pensioner assets test; provision for child care; and $1,3 billion worth of programs in the labour market area, providing over 500,000 places in the 1993-94 financial year. Over 330,000 of those places are provided for lbng-term unemployed. Fightback, the package the opposition was so attached to, proposed to cut labour market programs by $435 million, or reduce them by 300,000 places. In addition there are $600 million in outlays in the very important trade and industry area, including $94 million in outlays supporting areas outlined in the MCKinsey report. I will provide some statistics. In the period 1982-83 to 1992-93, exports of Australian goods and services rose by 110 per cent in real terms. As a percentage of GDP, exports of goods and services rose from 13.3 per cent in 1982-83 to 20.2 per cent in 1992-93. In the last three years, the volume of manufactured exports has grown by nearly two-thirds. Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures rose by 217 per cent over the last 'decade and by 104 per cent over the last five years. Almost two-thirds of our exports are going to the fastest growing region in the world, the region nearest to Australia, Asia. Budget outlays have provided nearly $100 million to support and enhance the trade and export development areas. Many of the things I have referred to have occurred in recent years. There· has been a process of ensuring that Australia becomes an internationally competitive economy, where we are trading in our region and improving our international competitiveness. There has been a 12 per cent improvement in our international competitiveness in two years and a 25 per cent improvement since 1983, and massive increases in our productivity. All these things have been achieved by this government. They ought to have been achieved in the immediate postwar years, but unfortunately the only thing of passing international interest on the other side was when a House of Windsor petticoat passed them by. The great postwar trade in manufactured goods and services passed Australia by because of the dilatory nature of those on the other side of the House. I listened to the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in. reply to budget, waiting in vain for the current leader to indicate what the opposition's policy approach might be. I came to the conclusion that it was either standing for nothing that was good. There is no substance in his reply, only-as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) indicated this week-opposition. The GST, throwing people off bulk-billing under Medicare and $12 million in cuts to outlays were the things that the Leader of the Oppositaxes. tion stood for in the run-up to the election. Now we are not sure what he stands for. All we know is that he stands for depriving the Australian community of $8 a week in income tax cuts and a $2 billion stimulus to the economy. I was very surprised and bemused to see members of the cheer squad rising to their feet at the conclusion of the Leader of the Opposition's speech, but not quite so unanimously. The honourable memb-r for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) were a bit slow off the mark. The shadow minister for finance, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), was very slow off the mark. Mrs Sullivan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Surely what the honourable member is saying comes into the imputing improper motives category.",149
283,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I do not think that the words 'being slow off the mark', or that description, imputes anything. There is no point of order.",150
284,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"I thought it was a compliment. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) was also slow off the mark. Senator Bishop, from another place, had her own cheer squad in the course of the day. We will watch with interest the policy developments on the other side. A number of honourable members opposite have commented about the effect of the government's deficit reduction strategy and the budget on low income earners. It is important to look at what has happened to low income earners in the 1980s. During the 1980s, the real value of pensions was raised by nearly 14 per cent, unemployment benefits for single adults went up by over 20 per cent, the family payments for low income families increased by well over 70 per cent, tax rates for low income earners were lowered from 30c to 20c and the tax free threshold was nothing or for raised to $5,400. The budget preserves all those elements in the social net. All benefits for families, the unemployed and pensioners are indexed. This will compensate for increases in indirect We continue to meet our commitment to ensuring that pensions are at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. In addition, budget outlays provide $60 per fortnight to spouses at home caring full-time for children-more than 840,000 parents will get the new home child care allowance, including 55,000 low income families who do not currently receive the full dependent spouse rebates. Mrs Sullivan-When?",150
285,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,They will get it under us. They would not get it from the opposition. Mrs Sullivan-They had their promises under us. They would have done better.,150
286,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"We know what they would have got from the opposition-a massive $24 billion in indirect tax, slashing outlays by $10 billion, throwing people off Medicare bulk-billing and saying that an appropriate wage was $3.50 an hour. That is what those opposite stood for. It is important to look not at the disaggregation of these measures, but at the whole. The strategy behind the budget deficit legislation will ensure that we emerge from the recession with a low interest rate, low inflation and an investment capable recovery.",150
287,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,Low employment.,150
288,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,I missed that interjection from my colleague the honourable member for Moore.,151
289,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The honourable member will not respond to interjections and those on my left will not interject.,151
290,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES,"It was such a friendly interjection from my colleague from Western Australia that I could not resist the response. In conclusion, much of the discussion on this bill has been in respect of individual items. The essential point is that we look at the bill as a whole. By 1996-97 the deficit will be of the order of one per cent of GOP and we will emerge from the recession with low interest rates, low inflation and in an environment where business can flourish, investment can occur, and long-term stable, secure jobs will emerge as we trade as a modern, manufacturing industrial country in our region.",151
291,Mr MACK,COMMITTEES,"North Sydney) (10.10 p.m.)This is a unique budget. It is not unique in itself because, after all, in the past we have had horror budgets, unfair budgets and irresponsible budgets. This is the first budget in living memory which has not come down as holy writ from the Treasurer with not a line to be altered. This is going to be one of the most altered budgets in anyone's memory; it is really quite a watershed. It is occurring not because of public outcry, and not because of the dissatisfaction of many government members with the bill, but simply because of the situation in the Senate-the fact that the government does not control the Senate and there are two minor parties there.",151
292,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEES,"That's a bit churlish, Ted.",151
293,Mr MACK,COMMITTEES,"It may well be a bit churlish, but that is the fact of the matter. Had· that situation not· arisen in the Senate which, after all, is as a result of the Australian public, Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill would be going through unchanged, in spite of the wishes of many government members. It is a unique budget in that sense. It is the path to the future. Many people would think that it would be a very bad thing if we were to go down the American track where budgets are negotiated over several weeks. Unless someone manages to change the voting system in the Senate, or wipe it out, that is the future. I think it is a good thing that there will have to be a lot more consultation in budgets. The budget, in spite of all the rhetoric from the opposition, does have some merit. It certainly has been acceptable to the markets. It is certainly reasonable in its deficit reduction strategy. But it is quite unacceptable in its effect on unemployment which, as the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said very early in his speech, is the major problem facing the country. It seems to me that the budget really only says, from that point on, that we are going to set up a committee to report next year, and we are going to rely on the rest of the industrialised world to bale us out. I do not think that is acceptable. It is also true that we have the lowest tax revenue in the DECO group. When we look at the chart, we see that Australia is at the bottom with 29.2 per cent; Japan, 30.9 per cent; the much quoted New Zealand, 36 per cent; Germany, 39.2 per cent; and Sweden, 53.2 per cent. We have reached the. point where the government has to ask itself whether it is going to continue to be chased back to the jungle by the H.R. Nicholls Society, and how much longer we are going to pursue the whole question of low taxation. There is a point at which we ask: what sort of society do we want in this country? Australia has the lowest tax and, like it or not, one of the fastest growing populations in the industrialised world. We have one of the largest countries in the world and we have built-in inefficiencies of space and transport. It is an arguable question whether it is a good thing for us to have the lowest tax in the DECO group. It depends on what sort of society we want. Comparisons with the Asian the countries, as has been pointed out by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) at question time and by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), are completely valid. We are not going to accept Asian conditions in this country; we are not going to turn the clock back. Those Asian countries are going to raise their standard of living. We might become a bit more efficient, but basically they are going to have to come up to meet us. Some other benefits of the budget were the extension of the seniors card, the easing of the assets test,the child-care cash rebate, and the home care allowance. All those things are to be welcomed. But what has alienated the vast majority of the Australian public is the unacceptable and inequitable tax package that we have put out. It almost seems as though the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have gone out of their way to try to alienate the greatest number of interest groups in the country. We seem to have attacked all the people with weak eyes, the people with old cars, the people accumulating long service leave, the volunteers in the credit union movement, small wine producers, and a host of others who have been well canvassed in this debate. Much of the debate from the coalition's side and its concern for the poor, to understate it slightly, has been overdone. It is not a year-in fact, it was about 20 August, from memory-since the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said in this House that he was going to give this country a Hong Kong tax system. What follows from that, of course, is a Hong Kong social security system-about $18 a week, a halving of the education and health budget and spending a fraction of what we would need to spend in this country on infrastructure. So I think it has been overdone. When we look at the reaction of the public to this budget, we have to ask: how did people who are as smart as the Treasurer and the Prime Minister come up with a system that targeted so many people individually? Most budgets do things such as raising sales tax, and everyone jumps up and down, but after a few days that falls away. This budget is targeting individuals. People who own old cars suddenly feel that they have lost $1,000 cold. Those retiring with outstanding long service leave entitlements-which must be many hundreds of thousands in the community-have suddenly lost between $2,000 and $15,000. This is a very personal budget. I think that is why we have had the public reaction we have had. We have to ask: how did intelligent people do this? All I can put down to is the ivory tower syndrome where people develop a culture around themselves and lose contact with the community. It often afflicts all people in politics-very smart people. Margaret Thatcher took two years to come up with a poll tax in the United Kingdom. It would have taken 10 seconds to consult with most people. They would have said, 'This is fatal'-and it was. She took two years to do it, and she was very smart. Federal and state ministers for the environment .took a couple of years to decide that there should be a high temperature incinerator at Corowa. Again, in 10 seconds the average person would have told us that that was not on. But those ministers took two yearS to do it. They are intelligent and are advised by a lot of very sensible people. I think it is the ivory tower syndrome.' That is the only explanation of how the government could come up with such a tax package. I want to concentrate on one aspect of the budget which, although a lot has been said about it, I do not think has been canvassed in depth: the tax on leaded petrol. As has been said, this tax has devalued many people's cars. It has increased their running costs. It is going to force many people to upgrade their cars when they cari least afford .to spend money on cars. It is certainly regressive because it affects the less well-off in the community. It is also totally unfair. Getting lead out of petrol is a worthwhile objective. I do not think any sensible person would be opposing the need to remove lead from petrol and reduce ajr pollution. That is a benefit to the whole community. But a benefit to the whole community should be paid for by the whole community, not just one section. So, besides being regressive, it is unfair in that general sense. Instead of being led by the nose by the oil companies, which I believe is what has happened to the minister, and by the economic rationalists who always try to use the all-purpose solution of price signals-in other words, by putting a tax on the lead we will get rid of it that way-the problem should have been attacked directly. Australia has the highest lead content in petrol of any industrialised country in the it world. It varies from 0.03 grams per litre in Victoria to 0.65 grams per litre in the Northern Territory. Leaded cars will run very happily on 0.15 grams per litre, which is the European standard. If we want to get lead out of petrol, let us do it directly. Within three months we could reduce the average Australian lead content from 0.4 grams per litre down to 0.15 grams per litre. That would have a far better effect on removing lead from petrol. The cost of doing that is less than lc a litre. We do not have to do it all over Australia, because lead pollution is a problem of urban areas and there is no need to penalise rural Australia because of it. In rural Australia lead pollution is simply not an issue. There is no reason why 0.65 grams per litre cannot be delivered to rural areas but 0.15 grams per litre be delivered in the cities. We already distribute different grades of lead all over Australia, so there is no issue in doing that. The NRMA in New South Wales produced a very sensible report earlier this year. The government should have looked at its recommendation, which was simply to lower the level of lead in super petrol in New South Wales to 0.15 grams per litre within three months. The NRMA believes that the government could also phase down the lead content below 0.15 grams per litre. It also proposes programs of promoting the use of unleaded fuel in about 30 per cent of those pre-1985 cars that can use it by another range of means. If the government had adopted a program such as that, it could have got lead pollution out of the cities in a much more effective way without getting into the problems 'of raising unfair taxes on a section of the community which could least afford it. It is about time this parliament had a sensible debate about fuel tax generally. We have heard loads of statements from both sides of the House about the level of fuel tax' in this country. We have to face the fact; we cannot have it two ways. We have one of the lowest fuel taxes in the world, similar to Canada and the United States. Our petrol, as we know, is around 70c a litre in the cities. All' of the European countries are averaging $1.50 a litre. Some countries are now up to $2 a litre. We have seen from the Inter-State Commission report that if we have full cost recovery the true cost of petrol is over $2 a litre. I know that we all want cheap petrol for a whole host of reasons, but we cannot have it both ways. We have the longest length of roads in the world with the least number of cars to pay for it. If we want to have the lowest fuel tax in the world, we will have a terrible road system. We will also have a lot of other distortions in the economy. It will promote, urban sprawl in the cities, which affects the country areas because of all the inherent inefficiencies and taxation costs. As we have seen, we are putting all our country rail services out of business, because of this low fuel tax. We cannot have it both ways. We have developed the world's most dinosaur-like cars with five-litre enginestotally inefficient because of that low fuel tax. We also have the most massive consumption next to the United States. Naturally, the consumption of fuel and the level of fuel tax are directly related: low fuel tax, enormous consumption. That consumption of fuel is now becoming a major problem in terms of our balance of payments, and it will continue unless we find major discoveries. We really have to sit down and look at this problem. I realise that the problems in rural areas are totally different from those in city areas. Maybe we will have to subsidise those rural areas in some way. We cannot continue to distort the land use systems, the transport systems, of this country by running one of the world's lowest fuel taxes. Debate (on motion by Ms MCHugh) adjourned. NA Motion (by Ms MCHugh) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Professor Manning Clark",151
294,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT," There is always a danger when a public figure becomes an icon, particularly if that person is regarded as a public educator of some sort. People become afraid to question the utterances of the icon. Those who know better indulge in self-censorship and the mistakes of the icon pass uncriticised and come to be viewed as the truth. These views are then filtered down through the education system. The late historian Manning Clark was one such icon. I have read his first two books of the series and other segments and I have found them to be, in many respects, a caricature of history. That is why I welcome the recent criticism of Manning Clark by his former publisher, Peter Ryan. Ryan's article is an important contribution to Australian intellectual life. It is a grenade tossed onto a generally complacent and self-satisfied academic elite. A colleague of mine, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), has said in this place in defence of Manning Clark that the attack was merely political. I find that unconvincing. While there may be political elements, the basic charges are valid. An outstanding historian needs to be able to empathise with the people he is writing about. He needs to be able to view them in the context of their own times and transcend partisan feelings. When it comes to public figures, he has to be fair no matter what his own feelings and consider what was possible in the context of those times. He has to take care to be accurate. We all makes mistakes. Even for an historian a few mistakes in a book are understandable, but persistent inaccuracies, a pattern of inaccuracies, is cause considerable alarm. A tendency to make caricatures of figures by imposing a fanciful formula for judgment is another concern. Manning Clark was always in search of a fatal flaw, but how could he be so confident that he was not imposing such flaws, particularly as some of his judgments of political figures were so dismissive? Eccentricities have their place. Indeed, in the English culture, which Manning Clark so despised, they are highly regarded. But we do not discern the character of a person by staring at a portrait. It is akin to declaring people criminals because of the shape of their skulls. This is fanciful stuff; is not history. Imposing the beliefs and prejudices of a latter age as the defining values of an earlier age is arrogant and reveals a lack of historical imagination. This approach has been the fashion for some time and is revealed in the works of Manning Clark. Manning Clark portrays a partisan prejudice against the British connection, not viewing it in the context of the times, and downgrades the great achievement of federation because it did not occur as he would have wished. A fair minded student of the process leading to federation would acknowledge that it was one of the most democratic which has· brought a nation into being. Certainly there was no great conflict or cultural revolution. This lack of bloodshed seems to be a great disappointment to fashionable historians but was,of course, part of the greatness of the achievement. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) finds the language of our constitution uninspiring and uninspired. He has in mind, I suppose, the charged language of the documents of the American revolution. This sort of language would have been entirely inappropriate for our constitution, which was born not out of revolutionary feelings, but through an orderly and democratic process. This is unfortunate for historians looking for a bit of colour, but very fortunate for the people of the time who did not have to sacrifice their lives on the battlefield to make an historian's holiday. High flown language in our constitution would have been mocked by the Australia of for the time. It was inappropriate. That does not take away one jot from the greatness of the achievement. The Prime Minister for one does not understand this, but that is not surprising. His understanding of Australian history could be said to be a comic book version of Manning Clark, filtered through a joke writer trying to be serious. The Prime Minister's version of history is shallow, glib, partisan and lacks fair-mindedness, but from a position of privilege made possible by the efforts of previous generations, it damns those generations. How would the fashionable historians and others fare if they were judged by the standit ards of previous ages? I fear that judged by the standards of our forebears they would be damned. Keeping that in mind should make them humble, but of course that is the last thing they are. How many of those who condemn our history as one of shame and dispossession are prepared to sacrifice money from their own comfortable incomes, incomes often provided from the taxes of the Australian public they so despise? No, others must bear the consequences of their high-mindedness. How many of these people fairly compare Australia to other countries and the conflicts and slaughter of these countries? Australia is not pure, but in comparison to other countries it has been more tolerant than any other· country that I can recall. Our history is our culture. We should all study it so that we are not at the mercy of those fashionable historians and do not have our country defined by the mistakes of an icon. Wine: Taxation",153
295,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"Geelong's 13 winemakers produce a quality product. However, the budget proposals to increase sales tax by a massive 55 per cent overnight will have the harshest impact on vineyards like those at Geelong that sell to the premium end of the market. The changes by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), in a desperate attempt to supposedly raise just $70 million extra this year, have left . a very sour taste with Australia's hundreds of smaller winemakers. They are suddenly confronted with a major additional cost to their customers that no winemakers could have reasonably foreseen four or five years ago when they planted the vines that have borne the fruit that lies maturing in their cellars today. As the  bers, of the Staughton Vale vineyard at Anakie, says: In one stroke of the pen it will destroy all the work we've achieved over many years. (It will have) an obvious impact on business viability which we will be powerless to stop. Mr Otto Zambelli, of the Mount Anakie Winery, says that for Geelong's cool climate premium wines, all of which are sold in bottles, there will be more than a 12 per cent drop in sales. This will mean less revenue to the government from sales. Mr Zambelli says: Anyone who would have known four years ago about this massive tax hike would not have gone ·into winemaking. All Geelong's 13 winemakers will have to pay this additional tax on tastings. Wineries have to pay this tax on wine tastings of wines that they do not actually sell. What a terrible indictment that is on the wholesale sales tax system. Apart from paying the tax, they must also hire an employee to specifically look after the tasting room. Cellar door sales might generate up to half of the income of many smaller wineries, but the costs involved are comparatively large. . Four of Geelong's wineries each produce about 50,0001itres a year: Idyll, Bannockburn, Scotchmans Hill and Mount Anakie. Many of the others-Staughton Vale, The Minya Vineyard, Austin's Barrabool Wines, Prince. Albert, Waybourne, Ashers, Tarcoola, Mount Duneed and Innisfail-have begun to open their cellar doors at regular times over the past couple of years.",155
296,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,What do they taste like?,155
297,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"They taste very good. With the 20,000 wine related tourism visits being made to Geelong annually, an expansibn of opening hours can only help to_benefit the wider Geelong community. The local wine industry-Geelong's 13 wine makers, or Victoria's 230-depends for its future on either a stable or growing domestic demand. In 1986, When the sales tax was increased from 10 to 20 per cent under the present Labor government, Australian per capita consumption of wine was at 21 litres per head. It now stands at 17.6 litres, and has only just begun to recover-after seven years-from this tax blow in 1986. Every grape grown at Geelong's vineyards is of a premium variety. Mr Zambelli points good out that the Geelong winemakers will find it quite difficult to raise their prices either to wholesalers or at the cellar door because Geelong'scooler climate means that yields are only about two tonnes to the acre, whereas in· some other regions of Australia with warmer climates the yield can be 10 to 15 tonnes an acre. Many heavily discounted wines that are sold through large liquor stores are nearing the end of their shelf life. Geelong's premium wines usually are not discounted quite so heavily, but this has a downside when prices go up overnight-brought about by this Labor government. Some buyers of wine might trade down, even just a little, to a lower priced heavily discounted wine, leaving Geelong wines with an even smaller market. Winemakers know full well that an overnight tax hike of 55 per cent-raising the price of a $15 bottle of wine sold at a licensed restaurant to $16.50-will reduce demand. Winegrowing has never been an industry that can generate immediate returns. This is even more so in an .area such as Geelong that does not produce any bulk wines. It is typically five to six years from planting before Geelong's bottled wines are on the market. We should be proud of the efforts of the wine industry in increasing exports elevenfold by volume over the last 10 years. At the same time, consumers both in Australia and overseas have a higher regard for the standard of wine being produced in Australia. Our wines have an international reputation. Some of Geelong's wineries are now exporting a quarter of their output to countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Hong Kong and Britain, but they need a stable domestic market to fund any further overseas expansion. These winemakers have led the way for some other Australian industries. The Treasuris er should fully reconsider this unexpected attack on the wine industry. Geelong winemakers have turned in a vintage performance over the past few years, and this has to continue for Australia's overall benefit. Violence Against Women",155
298,Ms DEAHM,ADJOURNMENT,"Macquarie) (10.35 p.m.)Mr Speaker, I rise to speak to the budget initiatives to eliminate violence against women. I am very pleased to note the budget initiatives for women and, in particular, the commitment of funds to the vital task of reducing the incidence of sexual violence against women and children in our society. The government has committed over $56 million in 1992-93 towards women's refuges, counselling, and services for young women. Projects to assist women and children living in rural and remote areas to escape dangerous situations will be funded to the tune of $2.62 million. Most importantly, nearly $2 million or has been provided to extend the work of the National Committee .on Violence Against Women. A further $1 million has been made available to fund women's programs. Community grants, resources and publicity programs have been funded. In particular, a 'No Means No' campaign is planned, focused on younger women. This week, a group of women in my electorate met to remember and mourn the anguish of women who have been sexually assaulted. I think such an occasion makes all women feel very keenly the sense that 'it could have been me'. The statistics confirm our worse horror. The sense of fear to which all women are subjected is the fear of those to whom we are closest. Most rapists are known to their victims. They are our fathers, brothers, lovers, husbands, friends and neighbours. Try as they might, the experts have not been able to identify a pathology of a sexual assailant. The rapist is a normal man. There are those who would say that the incidence of violence against women is increasing as men respond to the growing power of the women's movement-a 'backlash'. I do not believe this to be the case. I believe that what we are experiencing an increase in the reporting of sexual violence. Although it continues to be chronically under-reported, many women now feel more confident that the system has something to offer by way of protection, prevention, or retribution. In light of recent events in New South Wales, however, it is easy to see that we have not achieved enough. 1\vo years after the domestic violence committee brought down a comprehensive plan to tackle domestic violence, it took a murder to spur the New South Wales government into finally taking action. It has announced minor changes to domestic violence legislation, and finally promised that the legal package will soon be introduced. This legal package has been taken out and dusted off two years after the committee reported. Although I cannot hope to pretend to understand the mind of a man who could violate a woman, I believe some things are clear. A society which does not value women as whole, independent people, but regards women as 'mere' mothers, daughters, and wives of men, condones the behaviour of those men who treat women as their property, and do so regardless of the harm that they do to us. Appeasement does not work. Standing up, shouting loud, and joining together in resistance is a hard road, but ultimately a successful one. I am doing that in this place, as are my women colleagues. We face such attitudes every day-in the way women are treated and the way that discussion of women's issues is denigrated. My second speech in this place was on a social security issue, which is of great concern to many women. I was interrupted by an interjection from a member sitting on the opposition front bench, who thus indicated his lack of understanding of the issue, and his contempt for the needs of women. It may, however, have simply been the reaction of a man who was brought so close to defeat by a woman in the last election! I am pleased to be able to say that the government is more responsive to the views and concerns of women. The budget contained a measure that resolved that matter. I am proud to be able to announce that measure to the women of my electorate who have drawn it to my attention. I would like to take this opportunity tribute to those who are involved in delivering services to women who have been sexually assaulted, or who are in fear of attack. Theirs are the most difficult, the most heart breaking, of tasks, and they are often unpaid, underpaid, or unappreciated. Women in crisis often do not get the - hance later to say what happened, or to express their gratitude to those who guided and supported them. So in this chamber I want to record congratulations for their vital contribution and inspirational strength. The initiatives of this government, the work of the Office of the Status of Women, the National Committee on Violence Against Women and the National Working Party on the Portrayal of Women in the Media, to name just a few, will bring that day forward. The honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) made her first speech earlier this week, and she spoke of her commitment to tak- up women's issues, while not ignoring the wider responsibilities of a member of parliament.",156
299,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"It was a good speech, too.",157
300,Ms DEAHM,ADJOURNMENT,"It was a good speech. I feel a similar commitment. I have been lobbying to obtain premises for a women's refuge in the Hawkesbury. I have hosted a consultation with women on law reform issues. I work closely with women's organisations within my electorate. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) may tire of my words on behalf of women, but I hope to be able to influence the agenda in this place in relation to women's. issues, and to work hard for women as well as working tirelessly for all of my constituents. ,. Mabo",157
301,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I call on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to sack his adviser on Mabo matters, Phillip Toyne, following the handing down of reasons for judgment by Northern Territory Supreme Court judge, Mr Justice Angel, in a defamation action brought by Toyne and another former 'white adviser' to Northern Territory Aborigines, Ross Johnston, against the Queensland Liberal Party President, former Northern Territory Chief Minister and memto pay ber of this place, Paul Everingham. From a reading of Mr Justice Angel's decision, it is perfectly plain that Mr Toyne is not the sort of man who should be advising the federal government in relation to highly sensitive matters such as the resolution of the High Court's Mabo adventure. The judge's findings show just how unsuited Mr Toyne is have to be entrusted with an important advisory role. It is all well and good for the government to sack Henry Bosch simply because he has the personal courage and fortitude to say the sorts of things which many people believe. But at the same time the Prime Minister has as one of his key advisers. a man· who has been found by a Supreme Court judge to have had a baseless mistrust of the Northern Territory as a whole in its dealings with Aboriginal affairs. In his reasons for judgment handed down recently, Mr Justice Angel said: Toyne had given legal advice to the Aboriginal community which had political implications and he had advised on those political implications . "". he had al.S? acted .on the national stage publicly and as a polltlcal agItator. He was, I think, accurately described by Dr RC. Coombes as 'a lobbyist'. and was regarded by the public as such. In his reasons for judgment, Mr Justice Angel concluded that Mr Everingham's criticism of the plaintiffs, Toyne and Johnston, as being part of 'a small clique of white advisers who have been conning successive Federal Governments and the national press for years' was justified on the grounds of qualified privilege. Mr Justice Angel said: Toyne was and was seen by Mr Everinghamto be sympathetic to the Federal Labor Government and unsympathetic, indeed antipathetic to the Northern Territory Government in its endeavours to negotiate and deal with the Aborigines over Ayers Rock. Each plaintiffToyne and Johnstonwas an intermediary between the Mutitjulu community and the outside world and people who wished to deal with the Mutitjulu community had perforce to deal through one or other or both of the plaintiffs. The defendant observed what occurred at the opening of the Connell an Airportat Ayers Rockand in particular Toyne's interruption of the proceedings at which senior members of the Mutitjulu community were invitees. The defendant was aware that many of the Aboriginal demonstrators on that occasion had been brought in from a remote distance. The defendantMr Everinghamhad also observed Toyne's conduct at the meeting at Uluru, and, as a consequence, the defendant formed the view that Toyne was acting manipulathat tively. The defendant had information from the Northern Territory Public Service Toyne was 'militating against reasonable negotiaToyne tions with the Aboriginal people'. The defendantMr Everinghamconcluded from these matters that Toyne was actively steering the Aboriginal people towards dealing with the Federal Labor Government to the exclusion of the Northern Territory Government. Mr Justice Angel concluded that Mr Everingham: had information .available to him suggesting that the plaintiffsToyne and Johnstoriwere using their positions as white advisers to the Aboriginal community in a way which was manipulative and he considered.himself obliged, given the Australia-wide interest in Ayers Rock, to inform the public about these things. Mr Justice Angel rejected any suggestion that Mr Everingham was in fact motivated by racial bias or prejudice. Mr Justice Angel was scathing in his criticism of Mr Toyne's attempt to blacken Mr Everingham's character by accusing him of racial prejudice. He said: There was thus a significant attack on the character and credibility ofMr EveringhambyToyne and Johnstonfor which the evidence gave no support at all and it is not without significance that the attack was made under the cloak of absolute privilege. It was a calculated attempt by the plaintiffs to make their case more persuasive than it was. By contrast, Mr Justice Angel said: Having heard the evidence of the defendantMr EveringhamI believe him, and moreover in all the circumstances, I cannot infer that Mr Everinghamdid not believe his statements to be true or that though believing them to be true he realised it had nothing to do with the duty or interest on which the qualified privilege was based. Rejecting the suggestion that Mr Everingham had acted maliciously or in bad faith, Mr Justice Angel observed that Mr Everinghamexpressed himself in strong language-but I think language is indicative of indignation and then conviction rather than malice and an intent to to the effect that '. injure. was ordered to pay costs estimated at $200,000. Phillip Toyne is a thoroughly disreputable individual. It is untenable that a man against whom these findings have been made by a highly respected .Supreme Court judge should remain in a position of influence with the federal government. PhiIlip Toyne must be sacked forthwith. Sydney Airport: Noise Abatement",157
302,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I draw the attention of the House to an article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 August where the Civil Aviation Authority admitted what residents of my electorate have known and have been complaining about for some timeauthorised breaches of noise abatement procedures. In this article it is admitted controllers at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport have been instructed by the Civil Aviation Authority to break noise abatement procedures during what they laughingly call peak periods to cope with increased air traffic. By peak periods, the Civil Aviation Authority means certain times of the day most popular with airline demand for airspace-those times of the day when people want to sit down for a quiet meal or to watch some television undisturbed' or, more likely than not, early in the morning when people just want to sleep. Defying not only noise abatement procedures but also logic, the Civil Aviation Authority tells us in this article that there has been no increase in noise, although as many as 70 flights being scheduled between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. is not uncommon. Somehow or other the Civil Aviation Authority has developed a new type of aircraft-one that does not make any noise. The Civil Aviation Authority stressed in the article that variations of noise abatement procedures do not necessarily mean there will be any more aircraft noise around the airport during peak periods. Obviously none of these people who work for the Civil Aviation Authority live under the flight path. In relation to there being no noise, the article states But it does allow controllers to alter runway use and flight paths in an attempt to improve ... maximum use of runways. The words 'maximum use of runways' are just code words for using the east-west runway for take-offs and landings. The Civil Aviation Authority has also varied the flight paths so that former quiet suburbs in my electorate such as Penshurst, Kingsgrove and Beverly Hills, and even suburbs further south in neighbouring electorates such las those close to the Royal National Park and in the far north of Sydney such as Hornsby, are for the first time experiencing excessive aircraft noise. The Civil Aviation Authority'S General Manager for Traffic Services is quoted in this article as saying: Flights approaching the airport from the north had risen 30 per cent. .The air traffic control system which is primarily designed to separate and sequence traffic, is having that air traffic to put themthat is, aircraftinto holding patterns and reschedule them ... The holding patterns referred to here are another form of this bureaucratic code. What the Civil Aviation Authority really means is that planes approaching Kingsford Smith airport are being swung around over the south-west of Sydney, over suburbs such as Hurstville, Beverly Hills and Kingsgrove, before proceeding to land, whether coming into land from the north or the south, and more and more planes are swung over and swung out of suburbs such as Peqshurst, even if it means to create separation. For years and years the Civil Aviation Authority has been wrecking the lives of the people in my electorate. One resident in my electorate told my office that one Sunday evening between 8 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. when his family was trying to sit down together to eat and watch a movie on television aircraft were flying over with as little as three-minute separations, and they were loud' enough to disturb the family's conversation and viewing, despite the fact that the television was almost at full volume. I do not think that by any stretch of the imagination one could suggest that between 8 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. on Sunday is a peak period at Sydney airport. What we have here is a government authority out of control. The Civil Aviation Authority is answerable to noone. It is run by bureaucrats who do not give a damn for the people who live around the airport. The Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation have the hide to put out all these stories about how they are user-friendly bodies. These people are absolutely out of control and have no interest or care for the people who have to put up with the disgraceful way that they are managing Sydney airport. I give notice to the House tonight that over the next 12 months I will be paying particular interest to this organisation. I will ensure that it is made accountable to this parliament, because it has disrupted the lives of the people of my electorate for far too long. It has to cease, and it will cease from now on.",159
303,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of this House the views of a young Australian. It is disappointing that, while we spend many hours mapping the future of our nation, many of us probably spend little or no time listening to the attitudes of young Australians. It is disappointing because it is their future that we are shaping. Recently, I initiated the Cowan/Qantas essay competition and invited local secondary students to write an essay under the title, 'What should Australia's politicians be doing for young Australians?'. I would like to read to the HOijse some extracts of the winning entry of the inaugural Cowan essay competition, submitted by Nathan Barns of Morley, who visited Canberra during budget week. As part of his prize, I believe that while he was here he met the Speaker. His essay states: The youth of today carry the future for tomorrow. For this reason it is important and detail is given to deal with problems associated with the youth as well as society as a whole. The most important challenge facing the youth in our current economic climate is the issue of unemployment. With youth unemployment 20% higher than the nation's current unemployment rate many young adults are being disheartened at their future prospects. The very high level of youth unemployment can be put down partly to the lack of skills and experience, but the main reason is the relatively small differential between youth and adult wage rates. In the guise of preventing 'exploitation' of young people the trade union movement has been able to keep wage rates higher than the market rate. This has the effect of making adult workers a more attractive employment proposition, and maintaining high youth unemployment. Mrs Sullivan-Who said that?",160
304,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"An interesting concept from someone so young. Nathan Barns went on to say: The high competition for places in University is dropping the morale of students and depression is setting in. Though most of this is due to the current economic climate, much of the problem lies in the government's lack of confidence in young Australians . .If employers were given special subsidies for training and employing youth then the youth unemployment rate would quickly decline. At the moment special subsidies are available to trainees Youth and apprenticeships yet not much is done on a professional basis. One of the basic problems is the current unemployment benefits system. By 1986 more than half of teenagers receiving unemployment benefits had been employed for six months or more. In the 1970s by way of contrast the figure was only one fifth. Australia is one of the few countries in the world which does not force dole recipients back into the work force after a certain period. In many countries people are forced to attend training courses if they are to continue receiving basic support from the government. ' I bring the words of Nathan Barns of Morley to the attention of the House, and particularly the government, because he speaks of the fears and concerns of many young Australians. It is clear this government should not rest on its continuous platitudes that it does not accept our high levels of unemployment. No matter how the government may choose to deny it, unemployment remains the single most important concern of all Australian that special care young people.",160
305,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,It's a tragedy.,160
306,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"I agree with the honourable member for Fisher, it is a tragedy. This House can no longer let their cries for jobs fall on the deaf ears of the government. Nathan Barns from Morley raised a most important point through this speech. He is a young Australian who is very concerned about not only his future but also the future of other young Australians. That concern is, 'Hey, listen. I'm going to university but where are the jobs?'. Ten, maybe 20, years ago the opportunity for young people coming out of secondary schools and tertiary institutions was very good. But where are the jobs now?",160
307,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,We were the lucky country.,160
308,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Fisher is right: we were the lucky country. In his budget speech, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said that the budget was based on providing jobs; but there are no jobs. Mr Speaker, there are no jobs for young Australians; over 30 per cent are unemployed. What is the future if our future children cannot jobs? Nathan Barns from Morley expressed that very well in his essay, and I congratulate him. Mr Speaker, he thanks you for the opportunity of having his photograph taken with you and the time that he spent with you. Tourism",161
309,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak about main road 92, which runs from Tomerong to Nerriga and ultimately links up with Canberra. I ask that the road be put on the agenda as a national highway. A task force in my area has looked at this road and come to the conclusion that there are a lot of reasons-for Canberra itself and for the coastal region of Gilmore, which I represent-why this road should be a national highway. The task force suggests that if this road were upgraded it would provide Canberra with a route to Port Kembla. In his speech earlier, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) spoke about the appalling state of the Macquarie Pass. Anyone who. has travelled through Kangaroo Valley, which is one of the alternative routes, would realise that that route is not appropriate in terms of heavy haulage. HoWever, the route through Nerriga has one major hill. The task force has estimated that in 20 years the cost of the construction of that road would in fact be paid for by the fuel levy. It seems that Canberra and the adjacent coastal area of Gilmore have a great deal in common in being able to align themselves in regional development. Canberra's long-term future does not rest solely with the Public Service or this place. It rests with an industrial base and an exporting base. Likewise, area I represent, Gilmore, requires access to markets, and access to the markets of Canberra would be very lucrative for the development of my area. I also want to raise the matter of tourism. I am glad to see that the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) is present in the House because at the moment most of the people from Canberra go to the far south coast. I do not want to get take trade away from the area represented by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Me Snow). However, anyone who has toured through our area, as I know the Minister for Tourism has, would know the exceeding beauty of this area, which includes Moreton National Park, Jervis Bay and some of the Roads best beaches in the world with arguably the best surf. Mr Lee-And a good local member!",161
310,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"It would be very easy for the people of Canberra to reach the coast by main road 92 if it were upgraded to a national highway. It would mean a significant link between the area I represent and Canberra. It would also go on to Port Kembla-which is an area close to your heart, Mr SPEAKER which would allow Canberra and the area I represent access to a port. If one has travelled the roadway from Tomerong to Nerriga, one would know that in many ways it is now a dirt track. However, the bridgework is all in place. That area requires surfacing improvement. We have talked about ecotourism, and this government is moving on ecotourism because it is committed to ensuring that the long-term future of tourism in this country is very much tied in with an appreciation of our environment and the intrinsic qualities of our land. In my area there is Moreton National Park, various other national parks and Jervis Bay which will soon be declared a marine park and will be of world significance. Linking that ecotourism with Canberra is of importance, and. I will explain why. Eighty-five per cent of foreign tourists who come to this country tread"" the same track. They go to Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast. I ask that the route be moved around to create a circuit. Who wants to go from the Sydney to Canberra up and back on the Hume Highway? The addition of main road 92 as a national highway and its upgrading would mean that tourists could come down and enjoy the beauty and ecotourism potential of my area, go through to Canberra and come back along the top. There is a great deal of merit in that suggestion, especially for the economic benefit and long-term job prospects of the people I represent. Mr Speaker, I know that you have visited the area that I represent and you appreciate beauty. I ask that this House consider this matter as a serious proposition. When the funds become available my hand will be up for my area to make sure that we get the appropriate amounts of dollars and cents to make main road 92 an alternative route to the Hume Highway in the strategic importance of the area.",161
311,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 11 p.m., the debate is interrupted. Mr Tickner- Mr Speaker, I require that the debate be extended.",162
312,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The debate may continue until 11.1 0 p.m. Mrs Sullivan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Moore is on his feet. I point out that if you call the minister it will close the debate.",162
313,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,There is no point of order. The minister is the only one who can extend the debate and participate in it. ,162
314,Mr TICKNER,ADJOURNMENT,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (11.00 p.m.)- Mr Speaker, I want to set the record straight. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) made what I consider to be a very serious and, indeed, vicious attack on Phillip Toyne, who is currently employed by the government, at least in a part-time capacity, as a consultant to the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) to assist in the preparation of the government's response to the Mabo decision. I have a very consistent view about the way in which parliament should be used. Being a member of parliament gives us very great privileges and rights to speak in the House unencumbered by constraints that would exist outside the House. However, the special privileges and rights that we have as members of parliament also impose on us the responsibility to use those privileges wisely. I believe that the honourable member for Fisher, in his unprovoked and somewhat vicious attack on Phillip Toyne, has abused the privileges reposed in us as members of parliament. The honourable member's suggestion that its Phillip Toyne is a disreputable individual is, to the very best of my knowledge, without foundation. Phillip Toyne is a very talented Australian and someone who, if he wanted to work in the private sector, could probably accumulate a vast personal fortune. But he is someone who-again, to the very best of my knowledge-has chosen to devote his life to working for causes in which he believes. As far as I am aware, all his adult life he has had a very deep commitment to Aboriginal people and to advancing their rights. To attack him in the way that the honourable member did, simply because he lost a defamation case against the former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, is a most regrettable exercise of the rights of parliamentary privilege. I conclude by saying that although Mr Toyne is a consultant to the government and assisting the government in its response to Mabo, as the Minister for Resources and the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) in the chamber will confirm, the response of the government is not that of advisers or consultants; it is a response that has an indelible Labor stamp impressed upon it and is the creation of cabinet under the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I have taken this opportunity to put those matters on the record and to defend the integrity of Phillip Toyne. It is regrettable that the honourable member for Fisher, while he may have changed political parties, appears to have brought to the Liberal Party the ideology of his former party.",162
315,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I listened with great interest to the minister's comments. Whereas I am not wishing to get involved in the particular matter, the minister has made some reflections on the character of the honourable member for Fisher. In particular, he referred to his having breached parliamentary privilege. I therefore think that the minister's comments are out of order and that he should withdraw those remarks.",162
316,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I am not aware that the minister suggested that parliamentary privilege had been breached in any way. The minister and other honourable members know the forms of the House if they wish to pursue that particular line.,163
317,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I apologise if I misheard but, Mr Speaker, if I may be indulged, I am sure that I recollect at one stage the minister referring to a breach or misuse of parliamentary privilege in the description that the honourable member for Fisher made of the person concerned.",163
318,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I do not believe that there was a reflection on the honourable member. I think the minister was very careful in his choice of language during his comments to wrap up this debate. House adjourned at 11.05 p.m. until Monday, 6 September 1993, at 3.00 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Currency: Legal Tender Notes (Question No. 50) Mr Mack asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 5 May 1993: (1) According to which procedures and guidelines is the authority of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to issue Australian legal tender notes exercised. (2) By (a) what means and (b) whom are the (i) number and (ii) value of notes to be issued from time to time determined. (3) Are notes to be issued by the RBA provided to banks (a) at face value, (b) at the cost of printing and distribution, (c) free of charge or (d) according to some other formula; if so, what is the formula. (4) In what form and manner is payment made by banks for notes issued and provided to them by the RBA. (5) If a bank tenders its cheque in payment for notes issued and provided to it by the RBA, how is the cheque dealt with. (6) What was the (a) face value of notes issued and supplied by the RBA to banks and (b) sum paid by banks to the RBA for the supply of notes in (i) 1990-91 and (ii) 1991-92. (7) Does the RBA make a profit from the printing and supply of notes; if so, what profit did it make from these activities in (a) 1990-91 and (b) 1991-92. (8) Are profits the RBA makes from the issue and supply of legal tender notes paid to the Commonwealth; if so, what sum was paid in (a) 1988-89, (b) 1989-90, (c) 1990-91, (d) 1991-92 and (e) 1992-93. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Reserve Bank's authority to issue currency notes derives from Section 34 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959. (2) (a) (i) and (ii) The volume of currency notes in circulation fluctuates during the year in response to the incidence of paydays, pension days and holidays. The commercial banks hold a stock of currency notes (at their cost) to meet the cash requirements of their customers. Banks can return NA notes to the Reserve Bank which are surplus to the community's needs, or order notes for delivery from the Reserve Bank if the community's demand for notes is expected to exceed banks' stocks of notes. There are established administrative and transport procedures in place to facilitate these note movements. (2) (b) (i) and (ii) The amount of currency notes in circulation and its denominational split-up is determined largely by community preferences. The Reserve Bank stands ready to meet that demand, as conveyed through the banking system, and holds inventories of currency notes of all denominations to ensure the public's requirements are met. (3) Banks purchase currency notes from the Reserve Bank at face value. Banks also pay security companies for the costs of transport and intransit insurance. When notes are returned to the Reserve Bank, the repurchases are made at face value. (4) Banks pay the Reserve Bank for currency . notes through direct debiting of their Exchange Settlement Accounts at the Reserve Bank. (5) See answer to 4. (6) The Reserve Bank issued currency notes (and received payments from banks) to the value of approximately $50 billion and $51 billion in 1990/91 and 1991/92, respectively. (7) The Reserve Bank does not make a profit from the printing of Australian currency notes, but earns a return from the investment of funds paid by banks for notes on issue. (See also the answer to part 8 of the Question) (8) Since 1988/89, the accounts of the note issue function of the Reserve Bank have not been kept separately from the accounts for the Bank's other activities. The 1988/89 accounts of the Bank showed that the profits of the Note Issue Department were $140 million; all of that profit was paid to the Commonwealth in the 1989/90 budget year. Profit is derived from the issuing of legal tender notes in the following way: Net new issues of notes in a year represent a form of interest-free borrowing by the Bank from the community. The aggregate amount outstanding of this 'borrowing' is the item 'Australian Notes On Issue' in the Bank's accounts; at 30 June 1992, the balance was $15.2 billion. The proceeds of the note issue are invested in the general pool of the Bank's assets-mainly in government securities issued in Australia or overseas. Those investments produce earnings for the Bank. The cost of printing currency notes is one of the expenses deducted from those earnings in determining the Bank's profit. Under Section 30 of the Reserve Bank Act, the net profit of the Bank is payable to the Commonwealth, except for any amount the Treasurer determines shall be credited to the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund. Payments to the Commonwealth from profits of the Reserve Bank (including, but not limited to, profits from note issue) in recent years have been: 1988/89 $486 million 1989/90 $440 million 1990/91 $675 million 1991/92 $1,503 million 1992/93 $2,554 million Macquarie University: Higher Degree (Question No. 195) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: Is Macquarie University accepting students without degrees for higher degree courses; if so, (a) which higher degree courses are involved and (b) who decided to implement this practice.",163
319,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Macquarie University as an autonomous institution, established under an Act of the New South Wales Parliament, is responsible for its own administration. This responsibility includes decisions about student selection. The normal requirement for entry to a postgraduate diploma or degree course is satisfactory completion of a first degree to and appropriate level. In exceptional cases, an applicant may be admitted as a candidate for a postgraduate award if he or she submits other evidence of academic and professional attainment and the candidature is approved by the University's Postgraduate Studies Committee. I have been advised that the University has admitted students without a degree to a number of its postgraduate diploma courses, including the Graduate Diploma in Management. Entry of such students to the Master of Business Administration Courses (MBA) course generally requires satisfactory completion of the Graduate Diploma in Management. (b) The University's statutes and degree regulations provide for special entry arrangements of this kind. Similar provisions exist at other universities.",165
