In many of the streets of the East End the Chinese' are hunted as soon as they appear, and those captured are severely used. . These violent methods have been adopted with the object of intimidating the Chinese, and preventing tbem taking employment on British ships. The British sailoTS allege that many of the Chinese cannot pass the language test, which the law insists shall be imposed on foreigners seeking employment on British vessels.

38,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CHINESE SAILORS ON BRITIS H,"The statement in, question is not altogether correct. The Department has a right to see that the kerosene imported into the Commonwealth possesses a flash point sufficientlyhigh to prevent' danger being apprehended from its use. Under the old Tariff and up to tfie present the flash point of 73 degrees Fahrenheit has been observed by the Department.

The Military Commandant states as fol1 The original arrangements made were for the Ballarat Militia to leave by the 3.30 p.m. train, for the Cadets to leave by the 7.53 p.m. train.' Afterwards, it became understood that a large proportion of the Militia men intended to in Melbourne for - a few days, and under these circumstances the order of departure was and the cadets were detailed to travel by the earlier, train, .as thfey were to go direct home. Through a misunderstanding on the part of Staff Officer, the whole of the Ballarat Regiincluding those who had elected to stay in Melbourne, went by the 3.30 p.m. train, thus there was no room for the cadets.

In Committee (Consideration of Senate's requests resumed from 15th May, vide page 11177): Item 417. Works of Art, framed or unframed, duty free. imported for public institutions or purposes under Departmental By-laws, free. Request - Inser t after ""By-laws"" the words "" ; also Stained Glass Windows' for churches or this Chamber. public institutions, under Departmental Bylaws.""",19
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.28] - In regard to this item there is, I believe, great difference of opinion. There was some discussion when the item was before us on the last occasion; and personally I'have, to a limited extent, always favoured the free introduction of stained glass windows.",20
61,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,This requested amendment is on> the list of those to be accepted.,20
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"That, is so; but there is such a strong difference of opinion, that I hesitate to move to that effect, because I do not think there is the slightest chance of carrying the motion. I have been informed that if this requested amendment be made there will be a desire to admit free other items of a similar character. Further, if we were to accept the amendment, I am told that difficulty will arise as to which stained glass windows should or should not be admitted. The desire of some honourable members is to have free admission when the stained glass window is the original work of art, with some restriction on the admission of replicas; but I ' am told by the officials that it will be difficult to say what is original and what is not. The Department is not in favour of the proposition, for the reason that it is so difficult to discern an original work of art from a copy. Before I had looked carefully into the matter, I gave an intimation to the effect that I intended to propose that the Senate's requested amendment be made. But the considerations that I have now explained had not at that time been brought under my attention. Another matter that escaped my observation was that there is ai duty of 15 per cent, on the raw material from which stained glass windows are made. Under these circumstances, I feel that it would be! idle, and would simply conduce to a, long debate, for me to move the acceptance of. the Senate's request. I therefore move- That the requested amendment be not made. OS ] -*",20
63,Mr GLYNN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Angas) [3.32] - When this item was before the Committee on a previous occasion, the Minister at one stage promised to consider favourably a suggestion that stained glass windows should be made The words requested to be added by the Senate are the words in respect of which a long debate took place in The wordsStained glass windows for churches and other public institutions under Departmental by-laws, Free, were suggested to me by the Comptroller General as the best formula for carrying out the intention. I think that most honourable members were in favour of a lower duty than that originally proposed by the Government. Some suggested 15 per cent. The debate turned on whether - the duty should be 15 per cent, ad valorem, or . whether - the item should be free. The item, having been postponed at the Minister's request for further consideration, came on for discussion again at about half-past five or six o'clock one morning, when most of us were only half-awake. The Minister had.then forgotten his promise and nothing was done. What we are now considering is a request by the Senate similar in form to the amendment which I formerly suggested. The Treasurer has apparently repented of his. promise, and has proposed that the requested amendment be not made. I hope that the Committee will recollect that this is really a tax on works of art, which will be very burdensome on some churches. If we do not make the item free we should, at all events, agree to a lower rate of duty. (",20
64,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Works of art are free under item 417.,20
65,Mr GLYNN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"But we were given to understand that stained glass windows did not come under that item. The original duty was, I think, 30 per'cent. A duty of 15 per cent, was suggested by the honourable member for South Sydney. It ought to be remembered that the production of stained glass windows involves 'a consider-' able amount of artistic skill. Some such windows may not be works of high art, but there are some pictures in our national galleries that are not worth very much. Good stained glass windows are very expensive, and highly-trained workmanship is required to produce them. I do at the same time recognise that some of our local producers would be entitled to complain of having to pay a duty of 15 per cent, on their raw material if stained glass were admitted free. I have letters from one or .two men engaged in the industry who, I believe, are very competent artists. I replied at length to the case; which they placed before me.",20
66,Mr WATSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,The least that should be done is to equalize matters.,21
67,Mr GLYNN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I pointed out that what we ought to do was to make both the raw material and the stained glass free. A Melbourne manufacturer is prepared to workunder free conditions, as long as his raw material is not taxed. I do not, however, think that the cost of the raw material constitutes a very large proportion of the total value of the finished output -. So that a duty of is per cent, on the raw material is not likely to be an exceptionally heavyburden. I have, in mind in relation to item that there is an Anglican Church in Adelaide which is importing a large stained glass window upon which the duty at the old rate would have been £ g 2 . That is a very severe exaction in respect of a window that does in some degree minister to the public taste for the aesthetic. I hope the Committee will accede to the Senate's request.",21
68,Mr WATSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"South Sydney) [3.39]. - I cannot understand the attitude of the honourable member for Angas as expressed in his concluding sentences. He does the artists in stained glass in Australia the credit of admitting the injustice to .which they will be subjected if the Senate's request be agreed to in its present for m ; and then he calmly expresses the hope that the request will be accepted, so that the artists will be placed in that unjust position.",21
69,Mr GLYNN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,I thought that I ought to express their views in fairness to them.,21
70,Mr WATSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"The honourable member expressed the views of the artists in fairness to them, but concluded with the hope that nd attention would be paid to their views. The honourable member should know with his parliamentary experience that we have passed the stage at which any discussion cantake place in regard to the duty on the raw material - I do not think that the trade in stained glass windows is likelv to constitute a very big industry in Australia, though, to accept the Senate's suggestion and make the item free, would constitute the gravest possible injustice to those who are working in the industry at present. I do not ask for any extravagant duty, but the very least that' those who think the articles should be free might do is to put upon the manufactured article a similar duty to that exacted upon, the raw ma-. terial. There is something in the contention of the honourable member for Angas, that there is a difference in value between the completed article and the raw material used in it , but if we make the amendment requested by the Senate, then not merely works of art of original design will come under it, but ' stained glass windows that are mere replicas of some design made, perhaps, centuries ago, will also be imported free, and the local designer and art worker in stained glass will be placed at a disadvantage, because he will still have to pay duty on all his raw material. I do not think the Senate fully appreciated the situation when the request was made. If the effect upon the local worker in stained this glass had been pointed out fo honourable senators, .they would not have asked for the item to be made free, although they might have asked for a reduction of the duty. I trustthat those who think that the item ought to be free will, at least, make the concession of extending as nearly that equal conditions as possible to the local worker. Mr - DUGALD THOMSON - Will the honourable member support 15 per cent. ?",21
71,Mr WATSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Yes , I should be willing to support that. "" Mr Wilks (Dalley) [3.42] - The rate of duty on stained glass windows agreed to in this House was that recommended by the Tariff Commission. The Senate thought it wise to alter that, and tried to bring stained glass windows under -"" Works of art."" The Treasurer has explained that they are not all separate works of art, and I should like to add that in Birmingham, for instance, there are companies that make numbers of copies from the one design, and send them all over the , - world. Therefore, to make the amendment requested by the Senate would not be to encourage art in the sense that it is the production of one artist, or that each stained glass window is"" a separate design. There are companies in Great Britain which pay a man a high fee for designing windows, and manufacture fifty or sixty copies of eacE design. We are, therefore, asked, not to encourage art, but to assist an artfu l combine in the. Old Country who work this trade for their own ends. Whilst I am not inclined, as a rule, to vote for high duties to build up a trade, I am opposed to placing a disability upon an established Australian industry, which would be the effect if the amendment were made, mechanical Fifteen per cent, is charged upon the raw material, and the finished article would be allowed to come in free. That is complete reversal of the usual position, and if honourable members vote for it they will be imposing cruel conditions upon people. In Australia, wages are higher, talent. and hours are shorter, than in the same class of occupation elsewhere. The duties originally passed by this House were 30 and 25 per cent. ' This article is not necessary of life, but the Committee, time duced article. after time, have agreed to duties of 40 50 per cent, upon ordinary necessaries, and surely the duty which the Minister is ing for upon what is practically a luxury, is not too high. I ani glad that the Minisdustry ter is opposed to the request. Some these windows may be distincrj works of art, but a great many are not. out of the difficulty is this-if the are really anxious not to penalize art, should be prepared to make the item free if each window were accompanied by certificate that it-was a special work by one particular artist.",21

73,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I quite agree with the honourable member, but if the Committee are squeamish, and so attracted to art they want art designs to come in free, let us impose the condition I have mentioned. If that were done, I am' sure that the porting trade in ' stained-glass windows would fall through, and those engaged in the industry in Australia would receive some . protection/",22
74,Sir JOHN QUICK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Bendigo) [3.45] - Most honourable members would like to grant a concession to the churches if it P could be done with justice to established riustrial interests, but I believe one of conspicuous anomalies of the old Tariff was the fact that stained glass windows were admitted free, whilst the plate and cathedral glasses forming the raw materials revenue duty. were dutiable at 15 per cent. Two manupropose facturers-on e in Adelaide.and Melbourne-cam e before the Tariff Commission and complained most bitterly of the operation of that anomaly. They pointed out also that the industry of painting glass and' burning in the tints was by means small, but was rather a growing one. 1 believe that in Adelaide there are no than four firms, in Melbourne four firms, and in Sydney two firms, producing stained glass windows for churches and various pubdealt with. lie buildings. In addition to the ordinary operation of producing the glass windows, there is the preliminary or associated industry of art designing, and unless a encouragement is given to that industry, those art designers, who are instructed in public schools and institutions, will have our little scope for the development of their It is, therefore, most desirable, from an artistic as well as from the ordinary mechanical point of view, that there should be at least equality of competition a between the imported and the locally proI believe that if the or anomaly in the old Tariff is perpetuated in the new, it will give serious grounds for askcomplaint amongst those who are-endeavouring to build up a new and important inin Australia. Not only is there a of duty upon the raw material, but when the raw sheet and cathedral glass is imported A way and manipulated, there is a serious Senate wastage. Very often 50 per cent, of a I sheet of. glass is actually wasted in the operation, and upon that, waste material a duty has been paid. The complete manu.factured article, if brought in free, escapes not only the duty, but also the liability to wastage and breakage which the local manufacturer has to suffer. There is, there« , most serious anomaly which I hope, f c e a that will not be perpetuated. I am informed that u n d e r the T a r if f as introduced by the Treasurer a duty of 30 per cent, was colimcted Pon this stained glass under item le u 49-glas s bent, bevelled, and heraldic.

Mr - HENRY WILLIS - What is the duty u o n the r a w material? in Sir JOHN QUICK - Fiftee n per cent, the If the Treasurer could see his way clear to propose a moderate duty, I should be prepared to vote for it. Thirty per cent, on the bent and heraldic glass 'is really a If the - Treasurer would a duty of, say, 25 or 20 per cent., another in that would meet the case.",22

Unfortunately, we cannot now raise the question of the duty on the raw material, because that has been finally I think that these stained glass windows might fairly be subjected to a moderate duty.

This is certainly a case in which we might do something in that direction. The productions of the local industry referred to are certainly equal to most of the imported specimens. We have men in Australia who are capable turning out artistic designs for this kind work, of as high a class as any that be' obtained from the Old Country. I do not think that a duty of 15 per cent., or even of 20 per cent., would be a sufficient duty to impose.' It is suggested - that, view of the duty on the raw material, duty of 15 per cent, would equalize matintroduced ters ; but, in view of the waste referred by the honourable and learned member. Bendigo, I think that such a duty would not afford adequate protection to the inglass dustry.",23
78,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,The cost of the glass bears but a very small proportion to the cost of the finished article.,23
79,Mr HUTCHISON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"That is so, but there is a great deal of waste in the dustry. I should like to know why we should make any exception in the case stained glass windows, when we charge duty on other fittings and ornaments of churches. We impose duties on organs, pianos, and harmoniums used in churches, and .it would be just as reasonable to contend that they should be admitted free of duty as to conarticle tend that stained-glass windows should be dutiable.",23
80,Mr GLYNN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Piano s are not played churches.,23
81,Mr HUTCHISON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Piano s are played in some churches, and harmoniums and organs are played in others. Honourable members will probably admit that many of the organs erected in churches are works of art, and why .should they not, as well as' stained-glass windows, ' be admitted free? The beautiful ornamentations some of our church pulpits will be mitted to be works of art. I have magnificent specimens of the carver's used to ornament church pulpits, and they should be admitted free if it is contended that everything used in a church or a public institution should be free of duty. To do that would involve a remodelling of the Tariff. No persons connected with any. church in Australia need fear that they will to secure locally, at a reasonable stained-glass windows, which, as works of art, will be equal to anything they desire. For these reasons, I oppose of the no lower duty amendment, should be and I think that imposed, than that to which the Committee has already agreed.",23
82,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Robertson) [3-'54]--Very ' little has been said on the point that the Senate's request refers only of to stained-glass windows imported for ot churches or public institutions. Honourable can members are aWare that these represent special gifts for memorial purposes or the charity or benevolence of persons interested in these institutions - To impose a in duty of 15 or 30' per cent, on such a importations would only mean that those in future would be of less value to . than they would be if no such duty were for imposed. Something, has been said about the waste in the manufacture of stainedwindows in Australia, but it must be remembered that that is a disadvantage which is common to the industry carried on in England and in other places. It should' be remembered also that if a duty of' 15 per cent, were imposed on the finished article, the real duty would be higher than has inbeen suggested; because the imported window would, carry a duty on-raw material, of and on the artistic work comprised in it as well. It is too late now to talk of introducing the raw material duty free, and, as we are expected to adjust anomalies in the Tariff, it seems to me that it is necessary that we should impose on the-finished a duty equal at least to that imposed not on the raw material. There is the other consideration to which I have referred, that the Senate's request deals only with in ' stained glass windows required for ' churches and public institutions; and the people who worship in the churches and those who admire works of art and like to see them exhibited in our public institutions cannot be said to' derive any benefit individually from their importation. I . direct attention to the beautiful window to be seen in the Council Chamber of the Melof bourne Town Hall. I consider that it readpresents a magnificent work of art. It seen was brought from abroad, and completed art in Australia by additions which give it a local character. I question whether it would be possible for local manufacturers to produce so fine a work. This window was a g if t to the City Council of Melbourne, and nearly all the works pf art we possess have been gifts. The stained glass windows found in our churches are, in most instances, copies of original works of art. The picture known as "" The Light of the World,"" the exhibition of which caused so much sensation in Australia some little time ago, although a great picture, was really a replica. No one will say that it was not a great work of art, because the artist himself admitted that, in his opinion, it is finer than the original picture. I have seen the same picture many times in stained glass windows, which represented really imitations of the original picture. We shall not go far wrong if we adopt the Senate's request to make these works of art duty free if imported for churches and.public institutions, but if we wish to adjust anomalies in the Tariff, a small duty should be imposed, in view of the duty on the raw material.",23
83,Mr COON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Batman) [3.57] - I hope that the Committee will not agree to the suggestion of the Senate. These stained glass windows are being manufactured here at the present time - Strange to say, it is in the large cathedrals only that the productions of the local industry are not used. The stained glass windows in St. Paul's and St. Patrick's Cathedrals, Melbourne, were imported, but those' interested in churches in the country towns have had the stained glass windows they require made. locally. I have here a photograph of a stained glass window erected last Decemberin St. MaTy's Church, Kyneton. It is a splendid piece of work, and was supplied at a cost of £,200. If those interested in country churches find themselves able to assist? a local industry in this way, why should not those interested in our large cathedrals do the same? 1 - Mr HENRY WILLIS - The same amount of money would have purchased a better article from abroad.",24
84,Mr COON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I venture to say that, for the size of it, there is no better bit of work' in the Commonwealth, imported or otherwise, than the window to which I have referred. ' We have an artist in this kind of work who was working, for 30s. a week in the Old Country, and who has been able to get £ $ 5s. per week here.",24
85,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Does the honourable member say that he was getting 30s. a week in the Old Country ?,24
86,Mr COON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I say that this artist, who did some of the .work of which I have been speaking, did the same class of work in London for 30s. a week. That is the swom evidence he gave before the Tariff Commission. When he came to Australia, he secured a position at £ 3 5s. a week. Surely the honourable member for North Sydney will not assert that we cannot make stained glass windows here. . . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member for North Sydney suggests that'the honourable member is misrepresenting the state of things here.",24

I have it for him in this case. 1 This is the evidence given before the Tariff Commission by Mr William MontgomeryI went to St. Kinton Bros., of the same city, for £ 1 ios. a week of fifty hours. That is sworn evidence.",24

90,Mr LIDDELL,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Does the honourable member suggest that because the man came from the Old Country he became an artist ?,24
91,Mr COON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Did the honourable member, because he came from the Old Country, become a doctor ? The Committee will do well to grant some protection to this industry. Windows are being made in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and other parts of the Commonwealth, and why should not the stained-glassworkers receive the same protection as the makers of boots and hats? I trust that the Committee will disagree with the request.",24
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Parramatta) [4.1]. - It is very wonderful to hear the human encyclopaedia who represents Batman rolling out knowledge from all parts of the world for the enlightenment of the Committee. In my judgment, what he does not know about. these things is a very great deal. ' He seems to get hold of a report, and on the statement of one man-whic h he takes to be.gospel truth-regardin g the state of the industry as a whole in the Old Country, he paints a word picture. If the man whom he quoted was a good artistand I have no reason to doubt that he was - h e was wasting his time to be in London at all. In the heart of the potteries, where I was brought up, an expert artist could earn £ 5 a week tomorrow in painting tea cups, saucers, vases, and similar articles. The honourable member quoted the statement in order to try to make the Committee believe that all that an artist in the Old Country can earn is 30s. a week. It is preposterous to hear that kind of ex parte statement made as though it represented the state of the industry as a whole. Twenty-five years ago a painter of tea cups and saucers could earn up to £ 1 daily in the potteries at Home. Therefore, it is moonshine for the honourable member to quote this stuff for the delectation of the Committee. He gets hold of a shocking case somewhere, and tries to hoodwink honourable members into the belief that it represents the condition af(affairs 'throughout the 'Old Country. He ought to know better, indeed he would know better if he were not busily engaged in piling up the duties on everything which comes into the country.  proof that these windows can be manufactured here?",24
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I have no doubt that in Australia there are men who can make these windows. I was surprised a few moments ago to hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh bewailing the fact that no encouragement is given to our artists. He went on to' say that we could produce artistic work equal to anything produced in the world if only sufficient Tariff encouragement were given. That is in direct conflict with the doctrine which he has constantly preached. I have always heard from him, and those who believe in the same economic theory as he does, that an artist painted because he could not help doing so, that no matter how we might equalize wages or conditions, that had nothing to do with the fancy of the artist, who simply worked, irrespective of local environment, and hard economic conditions. But when we are discussing the Tariff, the honourable member, heaves overboard' all such statement's, and says that we get so much artistic work for so much Tariff encouragement, and wages from week to week. There seems to be no more anomaly in the freeing of works of art,- such as church windows, from duty, than there is in the freeing of works of art which have their destination in other directions. If a person imports a work of art, say a beautiful vase,- to be placed in a church, no duty will be charged. He may present to a church any work of art, except a church window, without a duty being charged. What an anomalous condition of things that is ! Why should we stop at a church window ?",25
94,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,O i l paintings are not dutiable.,25
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Exactly . I believe that in Victoria there is an industrious gentleman who makes these windows, and, I am given to understand, that he turns out very good work. I hope that he will prosper, as he deserves to do, and that his artistic fancy may be indulged in this direction for many a year to come, for the benefit of Australia, and the beautifying of its churches. Perhaps he has some claim upon us, owing to the fact that his raw materials are taxed. To what extent the cost of the raw materials affects' the price of a window, I 'am at a loss to understand. Take, for instance, a work of art such as an oil painting. I venture to say that' the cost of the oils on which duty has to be paid is scarcely worth mentioning in comparison with the value of the finished painting. So again with the glass, or the canvas upon which an artist paint's. The cost of the glass in a work of art is small in proportion to the total cost. The fact remains, that we tax all the articles with which the artist works, and that would seem to make' out a claim for a duty on the finished article. When the honourable member for Bendigo talks of 25 per cent, as a fair duty to compensate, the artist - Sir JOHN QUICK - I said from 20 to 25 per cent.",25
96,Mr THOMAS BROWN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"f i e said, "" Not lower than 15 per cent."" I think that he will accept that rate.",25
97,Mr GLYNN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,I was going to propose a duty of 15 per cent.,25
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"in view of the fact that we have set ourselves to tax all the raw materials fort church windows, I should not be disposed to object to a proposal to levy a duty of 15 per cent. I suggest earnestly to the Minister that he rnight see his way to agree to a compromise of that kind instead of standing out for the full duties of 30 and 25 per cent. I should like to know whether he intends to press for the higher rates.",25
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,I think so.,25
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I shall be compelled to vote against the proposition of the Minister, but I urge him once more to accept a duty of 15 per cent, which, I believe, he could get without experiencing anv trouble from any part of the Chamber. Mr THOMAS BROWN [if. 10] - For many reasons I should very much like to support the request of the Senate. I think that the beautifying of churches with these works of art should be commended.' Very often the cost of the work amounts to such a very considerable sum, that the duty acts as a deterrent in the direction of beautifying church structures in that way. But I recognise that with respect to this particular provision there is a difficulty. is true that the art cost is much greater than the cost of the material, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that we have placed a duty on glass, and other materials required by our artists for the. production of stained glass windows. Therefore we cannot make stained glass windows free without doing so at the expense of our 'own citizens, which I am not prepared to do. They should have, at least, the same facilities as the foreigner. I trust that the Committee will agree to a middle course, making the duty on stained glass windows equal to that on glass, namely, 15 per cent. If that modification is moved, I shall support it , though I intend to vote against the Minister's motion that the requested amendment be not made.",25
101,Mr LIDDELL,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Hunter) [4.14] - I shall vote against any duty on stained glass. The Treasurer is thought to be a man. who will stand by his opinions. When he submitted his schedules of_ amendment, he said that he was prepared to make that requested by the Senate in this item.",26
102,Mr HUMECOOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"He has explained that there is a duty of 15 per cent, on the raw material.",26
103,Mr LIDDELL,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I ' am satisfied that he has been talked over. We know him to be a man amenable to suggestions from lobbyists, and it is evident that those who are trying to make the stained glass windows in Australia have had his ear. We should above all things encourage the taste for works of art. The beautifying of churches is part and parcel of the religious life of the people, and an aesthetic taste which should be encouraged.' In the Old Country, where artistic works have been accumulating during the centuries, persons will, at considerable expense, make long pilgrimages to view objects of art, in one place or another. We shall be making, a mistake it"" we encourage a very small local industry by putting a tax on stained glass windows. I am sorry that} the honourable member for Batman has a soul so small that he puts (Calare) the manufacture of stained glass windows on the same level as the manufacture of boots. We should foster the artistic sense of the community. This is done by the exhibition of pictures and works of art, and still further encouragement is needed. Stained' glass windows are placed in churches for the satisfying of an artistic taste, but the mere manufacture of replicas ot no particular interest is not to be encouraged. I shall not, if I can avoid doWhilst it ing so, vote for a-duty of 15 ,per cent., because, in my opinion, the Senate must have had a good reason for its request, which should be complied with. M . GLYNN (Angas) [4.18] - I am afraid that the Treasurer has forgotten the time when he walked "" the studious cloisters' .pale,"" withStoried windows richly dight Casting a dim religious light, and is not to be brought back to his early opinion that stained glass windows should be admitted duty free. But the original battle was on the question whether they should be free or dutiable at 15 per cent., inasmuch as the raw material bears that duty. If the requested amendment making these windows free is not made, we shall not be able to propose a modification, and therefore I think that it would be better to agree to a duty of 15 per cent. I should much ptefer the Minister to propose such a modi-' fication, but as he does not seem inclined to do so, I move That the item be modified by inserting (A) after "" 417""; by leaving out """"also,"" and inserting in lieu thereof "" n "" ; and by making the sub-paragraph thus creuted dutiable at 15 per cent. That will put the local manufacturer in one of the positions in which he is prepared to fight the importer. I have received from Mr Montgomery, who is a very capable representative of the local manufacturers, a long letter, in which he puts his case very intelligently, and makes three suggestions. One is that the duty on stained glass windows be allowed to remain, as passed by the House of Representatives, namely, 30 per cent. That, I think, is too high. His second alternative is that there be placed on imported stained-glass windows a duty1 equal to that levied on the raw material, namely, 15 per cent. I suggest that we should adopt that suggestion. His third alternative is that no stained-glass window be admitted free unless accompanied by a certificate or declaration that it is the nal design of one artist-givin g his nameand that it is not a copy or a replica of any other window executed by the exporting firm. These are alternative, not cumulative suggestions, and I think that we shall be dealing very fairly with the firms which Mr Montgomery represents if we adopt the second.",26
104,Mr SPENCE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Darling) [4.22] - The Treasurer might very well accept as a compromise the modification proposed by the honourable member for Angas. An illustration of the difficulty surrounding .this matter is afforded by the experience of a gentleman who recently presented to an Anglican church in my electorate a stained-glass window in memory of his late father. The window was designed and executed by a leading artist in the Old Country who did some of the work in St. Paul's Cathedral. When the order for this window was placed the old Tariff under which it would not have been dutiable was in operation, but when it reached Australia it was found that it was dutiable at a high rate under the Tariff now before us. There are many similar cases. I think we should be justified in differentiating slightly between original works of art intended for use in public buildings-wher e they may be seen and studied, and must therefore have an educational effect-and ordinary windows. I recognise that we are in somewhat of a difficulty. It is unfair to tax the raw material of the local manufacturers whilst the finished article is free. That being so, I think that this compromise might be accepted. The Department of Trade and Customs refused to class as a work of art the window to which I have referred, although there are many works of art that are not so difficult to produce as a stained-glass window portraying a certain individual. The proposed-modification will not handicap our local producers, nor fall too heavily on those who make gifts of stained-glass windows to churches and public institutions, and who perhaps should be encouraged.",27
105,Mr JOHNSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Lang) [4.26] - I regret that the Treasurer, has abandoned his original intention to accept the' request made by the Senate. I was under the impression - that his desire was'to dispose today. of the remaining requests', yet at the inception of our proceedings he has taken up an attitude which must tend to delay that work. The honourable gentleman would do well to accept' the proposed compromise: As a matter of fact I do not favour compromises, origiand if - I strictly followed my own principles I should vote for stained-glass windows and other works of .art,'whether 'for public institutions or private individuals, being .admitted free. Why should private individuals, who desire to beautify their honies by the use of stained-glass windows, be prevented from obtaining free' of duty the best that artists can produce? We should encourage amongst the great masses of the community an appreciation of art in all its forms, but, unfortunately, I am in such a small minority in this regard that I am sure it would be. useless for me to attempt to have such advantages placed within the reach of the masses of the people. The majority of honourable members are rather inclined to place obstacles in the way of their enjoying, at the lowest possible cost, the benefits of all that the artistic world can furnish them. This form of art is being largely employed in domestic architecture. In an increasingly large number of suburban villas of modern design .an effort is being made to get away from the old practice of using plain windows, and to adopt .various designs in stained-glass art windows. The duty now levied will make this a luxury that may be indulged in by only people of ""means. It is too late, however, to deal with that aspect of the matter, since there are limitations imposed on the wording of the item, but I should like to know, Mr Chairman, what is the position in regard to freeing these windows for churches and public institutions? I wish to vote for their free admission, but, failing the adoption of such a proposal, I should like to vote for the modification proposed by the honourable member for Angas.",27

That should be a sufficient justification for imposing a duty of 20 per' cent, or 25 per cent., such as I suggest.

The duties levied in respect of this item will be especially felt by the poorer classes of the community, who can least afford to pay the higher prices that will be demanded for these very necessary appliances to aid them in their time of suffering and trouble. certainly redounds to the credit of the Senate that the item should have been regarded from a humanitarian stand-point, and this amendment suggested.",29

118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Parramatta) [5-°]--There may be a trade distinction 29 between operating tables and dental chairs, but I venture to say that there is scarcely 3 an honourable member who does not realise, from bitter experience, that dental chairs are operating tables; and up to the present the Treasurer has given us no good reason for leaving such chairs out of the free list. So far as I understand the matter, dental chairs are not made in Australia'; and, if that be so, why should they be taxed? In any case, I should like to know under what item dental chairs will come, if they be omitted from this item.",29

122,Mr LIDDELL,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Hunter) [5.2] - It must be evident to the Treasurer that - if .3 deputation waited on ' the Department, as he has described, from the Committee of the Melbourne Dental Hospital, - there is some good ground for a request that dental chairs shall be admitted duty free. There is absolutely no difference between the dental chair of today and a surgical table. Surgical tables are made here, because any one can make a wooden table ",30
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"If surgical tables are made here, their manufacture ought to be protected.",30
124,Mr LIDDELL,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"What I submit is that dental chairs come within the same category a° operating tables, - because they are made of metal in such a way that special machinery is required in their manufacture. The dental profession is beginning to take a higher place than formerly, dentists being qualified in exactly the same way as are medical men; and there is no doubt that before-long there will be numerous dental hospitals throughout Australia for the purpose of treating the poorer classes. I remind honourable members on the Government cross benches that it is the poorer people whom it is proposed to tax by omitting dental chairs from the free list. These chairs are used very much for philanthropic purposes, and it would be a hardship on hospitals and other institutions if a heavyduty be imposed.",30

I do not wish honourable members to vote without knowing exactly what it means and what the effect will be. Some honourable members are anxious to obtain a rebate on certain classes of machinery, not only up to the time named in the suggested new schedule, but for a longer period. The honourable member for Maranoa desires' to obtain a rebate on machinery for the manufacture of fibrous material and for wool scouring. This is the time when that matter can be discussed. It has also been represented to me that machinery which is being imported for the making of wool tops should be admitted duty free.' I must confess that I should like to see it exempted from duty. The intention of this schedule is to validate certain things that have been done by the Customs.",31

141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Parramatta) [5.21] - I think the Minister's last statement is not quite correct. I take it that the rebate ceased to be payable the moment we inserted these classes of machinery under the general machinery items in the schedule. After that date the individuals importing these particular classes of machinery had no right whatever to the rebate, and had to pay the duty equally with the rest of the machinery users in Australia.

155,Mr TILLEY BROWN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"We are the same side. I did not refer to the honourable member. I said I looked upon it as a dodge of the Treasurer.  Treasurer tried to make the matter clear, but the more he tried the more befuddled he became. I knew what he was after, because he told me what he would do, and that is why I was trying to assist him. I will give him credit for wanting to give the same measure of rebate on machinery introduced for wool-scouring purposes. I can see no dodgery in that.",33

157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Parramatta) [5.33] - There is a very simple explanation of this matter which has not been furnished by the Minister, and which it is a great pity that he did not give. On referring to the debates in another Chamber to ascertain what really took place, I find that the Department paid some of these rebates, to which the persons claiming were clearly entitled, anterior to the date when this Committee - struck out the ' schedule. But whilst those particular manufacturers had been alert, others, who apparently were equally entitled to the rebate, did not apply for it during the term that - the schedule was operative. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - They had not the machinery, and had not paid the duty then.",33
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I do not gather that from what was stated elsewhere. The explanation certainly is that those persons did not apply for their rebates. Does the Treasurer now say that the object of the Senate's proposal is to allow rebate to be paid on.machinery which was in transit and had not arrived at the time? We have no right to grant. a rebate upon anything which had not been imported and installed before the date on which the schedule was struck out. The Minister now says that some people did not take possession of this machinery, and therefore, were not entitled to the rebate. If they had not taken possession of their machinery before the date specified, they both on were clearly not entitled to rebate, so that what the Treasurer is proposing to do is to legalize an illegality. If we are to do that kind of thing, we should, as the honourable members for Indi and Maranoa have pointed out, serve all alike. Why should we single out these two kinds of machinery for this specially favourable treatment? That is neither fair nor just. I suppose that we shall shortly hear some more from the Minister when he has had it pumped into him from'behind the Speaker's chair ; but, in the meantime, the position appears to be as I have stated it! There can be no after objection to the proposal in. so far as it refers to rebates earned during the specified period. But if that is the scope and intent of the proposal, what is it needed for at all ? The persons concerned were. entitled to rebate up to the time when we altered the law. It appears to me that this proposal is possibly intended to provide for rebate on machinery in transit at the time.",33
159,Mr TILLEY BROWN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,It is to refund money paid by the importers.,33
160,Mr WISE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,No ; the intention is to legalize refunds made by the Customs authorities.,33
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Senato r Best says that it is not. He says that in some cases manufacturers received their rebates, but in other cases they neither claimed nor. received them, and the object of the amendment requested by the .Senate is to see that all are treated alike, and to place. those who did not apply for rebates on the same footing as those who did, and received them. Does the Minister say that there are persons who were entitled to the rebate who did not apply for it during the specified period?. I should like to have an answer to that question. This proposal is not necessary for any refunds made prior to.the date of the alteration, and can only relate to refunds intended to be made since that date.",33

I at know of one case where the machinery was not lying on the wharf at a Queensland port, and the importers could get no rebate because it was not installed. I - wish to have no insinuations made in connection with this matter, because I have had nothing whatever to do with it. I feel that it is only a fair thing that the importers of this class of machinery who'had landed, but had not installed, their machines up to the date to, should receive the same consideration as those who had installed their machinery at that date. I am not sure it would not be wise, if we were in a position to do so, to deal in the same way to, with all machinery which could not be manufactured here. ""Feeling in this wayj do not think I should have been justified in letting this matter go through without informing the Committee as to what the requested amendment really means. It is due to our exclusion of a provision which appeared in the Tariff as' originally introduced, and the request is made in order to validate certain things done up to the date when the alteration was made.",34
183,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Kalgoorlie) [5.45]-The Minister may accept my assurance that this proposal would not be agreed to without explanation. I might describe the discussion which is. now taking place as the last act in connection with one of the most objectionable features of the Tariff. I do not say that it is not the duty of the Committee to keep faith with people who were invited to import goods under certain conditions, but I do say that it was a most objectionable thing for the Government to propose any such arrangement, and it would be still more objectionable to continue it. The Government having entered into an obligation to give a rebate to individuals importing a particular class of machinery in the event of its being installed for a particular purpose, must keep faith with those individuals - I do not approve of the granting of these' rebates, but the Government being committed to it, it is the duty of Parliament now to see that individuals who were able to have this machinery installed a few days earlier than others, because, perhaps, they knew more of the ropes, should not be given an advantage which is denied to others engaged in the same industry. I .understand from the Minister's third explanation that it is the object of the requested amendment to provide for the grant of a rebate under by-law in compliance with the provision struck out of the Tariff as it appeared originally, in respect of certain machinery only up to the dates specified. The honourable member for Maranoa suggests that the provision should apply to machinery'required for wool scouring, but it is absolutely impossible to give effect to that suggestion at this stage.",35

186,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I believe that there is some' justification for my honourable friend's suggestion that the people who have derived this advantage are those who have been able to have their views presented to Parliament every day of the week. I say that it is our duty at this stage to confine the application of the objectionable provision to what it was at first intended to apply,, and to see that this shall be the last of the. arrangement for the granting of rebates to persons introducing machinery required for industries the productions of which are themselves highly protected. If it can be demonstrated to Parliament that the machinery necessary for the carrying on of arty industry cannot be made in the Commonwealth, such machinery should be admitted free; but we . should not agree to a proposal to allow the Minister to grant rebates only to such as may happen to catch his ear.",35
187,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Parkes) [5.51]. - I think that your attention, Mr Chairman, should be directed first to the con- sideration whether the schedule is in order, or whether, in order to cover refunds of the nature proposed, it will not be necessary to bring down a message, the Customs Tariff Bill being purely a taxing measure. We have been told by. the Minister that money has been refunded in some cases and not. in others, and that the proposed schedule is necessary to sanction further refunds. He stated that it is a "" fair thing"" to treat all alike.",35
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Refund s have been made in all cases coming under the one category; they have 'not been made' in regard to-machinery not installed.,35
189,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I take exception to the proposal to allow refunds. When the Executive resolution imposing a new Tariff was laid upon the table, the old Tariff was superseded unconditionally, and, as the honourable member for Maranoa has properly contended, if one industry is now to be given an advantage; all should be similarly'treated. During the long, tedious debates on the Tariff, numerous appeals for the consideration of the primary industries have been made in vain. The requirements of the mining companies have been brought under notice, and the honourable member for Maranoa has called attention to an important industry connected with pastoral pursuits; but, apparently, it is only, those industries whose directors are able to get the ear of the Minister which are to be benefited. We know that the Denton Hat Mills are situated not far from here, so that their directors may have' frequent interviews with the Minister. Such interviews . seem to have taken place with advantage to them. As I showed some months ago, they have for the last two years paid dividends of 10 per cent., alnd have put 5 per cent, to their-reserves, while their £ 1 shares were quoted a few months ago at38s. At Customs that time their hats were protected by a duty of 25 per cent., and are now protected by specific rates ranging up to the equivalent of 120, and even, in some cases, of 180 per cent, ad valorem. Yet it is proposed tp single out the hatting industry for exemption . in respect to duties on machinery. Some of the low-grade propositions, as they are called, in Western Aus-' tralia, whose results barely pay wages, are charged the full duty on their machinery. So, too, are the industries connected with pastoral pursuits. Yet the hatting industry is not only coddled by high protective duties on hat's, but used also to enjoy the peculiar privilege of being .exempt from the payment, of duty on machinery. The Minister tells us that he thinks it a fair thing that a rebate should be paid on the machinery imported for hat-making, but how have other industries been treated ? I brought under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs a case in which a New South Wales industry had been required to pay .£600 in duty under an item which Parliament subsequently made free, a. refund of the money so paid being refused. If it is only fair to make a refund on machinery imported for hat-making, whyshould not a refund be made in the case to which I refer? However, it is proposed to treat the hat industry differently from, any other, up to a certain date. The Minister tells us that the schedule has been brought forward to permit the refund of duties paid during the time which elapsed between the introduction of the Tariff and the consideration of the machinery items. I do not think that the industry is entitled to the proposed refund. The Tariff resolutions abrogated the Tariff of 1902, including its exemptions, and every industry became liable unconditionally for the payment of the new duties. Until Parliament agrees to the proposed exemption, no industry will be entitled to a refund. I submit that the proposal should be negatived. I.object to it, first, because it differentiates between this one industry and others; secondly because tffere, are hundreds of cases in which duties' not sanctioned by Parliament were paid, and will not be refunded; and, thirdly, because the proposal, being in the nature of an appropriation, should be conveyed by a message, and cannot be included in a taxing Bill.",35
190,Mr SPENCE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Darling) [6.0] - The proposals should do good by - forcing Committee to realise the effect of refusals to give similar consideration to other [19 MAY, 1908.] Tariff Bill. 11199 dustries. Nothing is more calculated to make protection unpopular than the proposal before us. One large mining company alone has had to pay ,£25,000 in duty on importedmachinery, much of which is covered by patent rights, and cannot be manufactured in the Commonwealth ; but the representations on behalf of the mining industry were not listened to. The hat-making industry is well established,' and yetit is proposed that the machinery required for hat-making shall be admitted free. If the Government has made a promise which it is legally bound to fulfil, I suppose we must consent; but the honourable member for Parkes says that it is not so bound. In my opinion, favouritism is being shown) which nothing can justify. Similar treatment is not proposed for the wool-scouring industry. Apparently, piotectionists are ready to consider only the interests of manufacturers who make things to sell in this country; they will not consider the interests of those whose productions have to compete in the - markets of the world ",36
191,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Dalley)'[6.3] - I shall not occupy time - by repeating the remarks of other speakers. In my opinion, the honourable member for Parkes raised very strong objections to this proposal. The honourable member for Darling has referred - to the lack of consideration given to the mining industry. It is singular that the hatmaking industry, whose productions receive a protection equivalent to 120 per cent. ad valorem, is alone to be permitted to import its machinery free. As I have said on many previous occasions, the engineering trades have received least consideration under the Tariff. Those connected with them are taxed on their hats, and on everything else they wear or use. Yet, while they have to pay duties for the advantage of the hat-making industry, they get no return, since it is allowed to import its machinery free of duty. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie said that this is objectionable; I say that it is scandalous. I hope that the piotectionists of the Committee will show themselves disposed to assist the engineering trades, and will vote against the proposal. Why should this advantage be granted to the industries specified? 'Not only the people on the spot, but also the industries on the spot have received the first consideration. One of the reasons the why I changed my attitude onfiscalismwas because such industries had received special intreatment, while industries far removedfrom this city had been neglected Throughout the consideration of the Tariff I have been fighting on behalf of the engineering and machinery industries. They have received the least protection, and when there is a chance for them to do some work, surely they have a claim upon a highly-protected industry like hat-making! It is really scandalous that any protectionist should allow this proposal to pass. Those who should receive some consideration are picked out to be penalized in the interests of the proprietors of woollen mills and hat factories.",36
192,Mr HUME COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,All this machinery is dutiable now.,37
193,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Why was it treated differently in the first instance? - Mr HUME COOK - Because it was done under departmental by-laws.,37
194,Mr WILKS,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"This proposal found a place in the Tariff simply because a certain man had "" got in "" early. Why should his machinery be exempted any more than that > of the man who did not "" get in "" early?",37

198,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Does not this proposal provide for the payment of persons who have not yet been paid? Mr HU ME COOK -^NO.,37

In my opinion, it is a dangerous one. Sir WILLIAM LYNE.

It will be recollected by honourable members that the leader of the Opposition took exception to that provision. When that exception was taken under this Bill, the rebates had been given; but no rebate has been given since that time. The provision was rejected on the n t h December. .

Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [6.25] A few moments ago, I gave expression to certain opinion which the discussion, to mind, has proved to be well founded. I the Treasurer had told the Committee what this request really meant, we should understood his action, but I think that the mittee requested schedule means a very important unhesitatingly, leakage. The Treasurer has repeated words I used on a previous occasion when the.leader of the Opposition drew attention to this most remarkable schedule providing for a rebate on imports for home consumpliament tion. The debate on that schedule took place on the 28th November, and we then' struck out of it not only item 124, but items 164 and 166. We prohibited the granting of any further rebates under the schedule from that date, yet we now find that it is proposed under this request that rebates shall be granted up to and including December, 1907.",40
256,Mr HUME COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"That date relates only to rebates of duty on piece goods used in the manufacture of rubber waterproof cloth. The honourable member should look Treasurer. at the date named in respect of the other items in the schedule. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - In the case of the remaining items, the date named is 28th November, 1907. As a matter of fact, we made no alteration in respect of the date; we struck out the whole schedule.

Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I have looked to up Hansard, and know what I am talking new about. I well remember when the schedule was under consideration. It was then said consideration should be given to pastoralists who had to import machinery, and also to those engaged in the mining industry. That consideration was not granted. I have a particularly clear recollection of'' the incident, because I drew attention to .the fact .that the Stanley Mining Company I had imported special machinery which could not be made here, and that it could not obtain a rebate of duty, although a rebate was granted on machinery imported for use - in the Denton Hat Mills, which are proa tected to the extent of 150 per cent. As my the leader of the Opposition said, the Gof vernment collected the duty on hat-making machinery at the front door and returned have it at the back door. We now have a proposal to exceed the power which the Comthen gave the Government. I say, that this is a proposal to the extend the granting of rebates from 28th November until the n t h December. If the Government can deal in this way with the revenue of the Commonwealth, then Parhas very little power over it.

Such a step would constitute grave departure from the whole principle which has hitherto guided us in respect of similar matters. It would be an attempt to remedy, perhaps, two or three cases hardship whilst ignoring thousands of cases in which an equal amount of hardship has been imposed in connection with other' items in the Tariff. There is no difference-s far as the hardship inflicted is concernedbetween machinery which was lying wharfs and had not been installed in factories upon the date that we made the alteration in the rebate of duty, and machinery on which duty was increased which was on board ship at the wharfs and the entries in respect of which had not been passed.",40

270,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I do not think Mr THOM AS BROWN - No r do T, but certainly that is the inference to be drawn from the remarks of the Treasurer earlier in the evening, when he indicated that he did not wish his proposition to be passed without the Committee being fullyaware of his meaning,'and of their powers. If I have correctly interpreted the utterances of the honourable the Treasurer, 1 should like to know what are the privileges of the Committee with .respect to other .branches of industry? Would it be possible for an honourable member to move an addition embracing some other industry which is quite as much in need of the concession as is the particular industry referred to? Here we have a Victorian industry, which has enjoyed the advantage of high protection for twenty-five or thirty years-advantage s which have never been denied by the Federal Parliament-and this' industry is carried on with the aid of duty amounting to 120 per cent, on some lines. One particular firm was mentioned by the honourable member for Parkes, and the figures he .quoted showed it to be a fairly flourishing industry, paying 10 per cent, on its capital, carrying 5 per cent, to a reserve fund, and having its paid-up £ 1 shares quoted at 38s. in the market. This is an industry which was specially favoured by the Treasurer under the old Tariff, and it is the industry for which this special concession is now sought. I ask the Treasurer to compare this industry with the farming industry in his own electorate, which is just now being overwhelmed by the rabbit pest. In the original Tariff the Treasurer proposed to impose duties of 25 per cent, and 30 per cent, on wire netting, but the House decided to remit that taxation. Only the other day I received a letter from a constituent who was compelled to pay £ ^ $ in duty on 5 miles of wire netting necessary to protect his holding against the rabbit pest, but it is not proposed by the Treasurer to indemnify that struggling man, and thus .place him in the same position as those who imported prior to 8th August, or since ist May. If the whole question is open, as may be gathered from the Treasurer's remarks, I should like to move a further addition, placing wire netting on the same basis, and empowering the Treasurer to return to the users- I do not say the importers-the duty paid on the wire netting actually used in enclosing land against the rabbit pest. As to the particular interest under discussion, I have no desire to deal with it harshly, because I should like to see the necessary machinery introduced as cheaply as possible; but I do object to an industry being so coddled as to be given a distinct advantage over other industries. The agricultural and pastoral industries are vital to the progress of the Commonwealth, and those engaged in the fight against the rabbits deserve every consideration at our hands. It is unfair that those who were compelled to fence during the time the duty was col-' lected should be penalized, whilst those who imported prior to the 8th August, or since ist May, should obtain their wire netting duty free. With a view to testing the question, I give notice that at the proper time. I shall move the addition to schedule B of the following - 1 Item 186. Wire. Netting, used for the enclosure of land, as protection against rabbits or other noxious animals, rebate up to and including ist May, 190S, full duty paid.",41
271,The CHAIRMAN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,The honourable ' member would be out of order in moving an amendment of that description.,42
272,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Robertson). [8.JO] - The iproposal foreshadowed by the honourable member for Calare is just what one might expect to result from: that now - submitted by the Government. This is not a new question, but one handed down from the Tariff of 1901-2; and such a provision is bad, and ought not to have been introduced by the present Government. An opportunity should have been given to the Committee to say whether they would perpetuate an advantage to any particular industries. At any rate, the Government now ask the Committee to validate what has been done, and that, I think, is a proper thing to do. Possibly the Government have been advised by their Attorney-General that there is some technicality as to date, and to make matters doubly sure, as has been the way of the Government all through, we have this proposal before us. . Even if it were possible tohring - all classes of machinery under such a provision, I should still regard it as unsound and unbusinesslike, for the reason that it would give those already in an industry an advantage of 75 per cent, or 100 per cent, over those who might subsequently enter on the - same line of business. I should even regard the provision outlined by the honourable member fr.r Calare as unfair and unsound, inasmuch as the rebate would never find its way into the pockets of the people who have paid for the wire netting at the increased cost; and thus the advantage would really go to the importer or distributor. I think, however, that there must be something more in the mind of the Treasurer than has been made clear to the Committee. The honourable gentleman would never waste the whole afternoon on a proposail so simple as that in the schedule, but must, I think, have an' intention of, by-and-by, submitting an amendment to include consignments of machinery that were on the wharf, and not actually placed in the factory, on the ground that those whohad in good faith introduced those imports, should receive some consideration of the kind. If that be the intention, I assume that I would be out of order in discussing it at the present time. I may say, however, that I should regard such a proposal, as quite improper, because all engaged in importing should be placed on exactly the same level. It may be that these few anticipatory remarks may have the effect of inducing the Treasurer to change his mind, seeing that he has not had the courage to table a motion to the effect indicated.",42
273,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Parkes) [8.14.]. - Before the discussion on this schedule closes, I desire to say one ortwo words in modification of an opinion I expressed at an earlier stage on the constitutional aspect cl the question. I was under the impression, when the present Tariff was intro-' duced, that there was not a similar provision in the Tariff of. I'QOI -2. .From that I made the deduction that the rebate could not be given, and that this provision was an improper one. But I find that at the foot of the page upon which the duties-upon machinery are included, there is a note to this effectSubject to rebate under the conditions' fied in the schedule hereto. That seems to me to. get rid of the objection that the rebate provision in the schedule is in the nature of an appropriation, and would require a different Bill ; because the note gives it the character of a modification of a duty introduced in the Tariff. But it seems to me, also, that that note cuts the ground from under the proposal which the honourable member for Calare has indicated ; because it is quite clear that no rebates could be provided for in the part of the schedule which we are now debating, unless there had been some provision in the Tariff originally' for rebates which it is intended to indemnify the Government for having paid. I still, however, hold the opinion that the provision now under discussion is unnecessary. It may be. desirable to have it in for the sake of extra' precaution, but if the schedule provides fora rebate, then I do not see. any necessity for putting this new provision into the Tariff at the present time. I shall not, however, find fault with it on that ground, because it only makes what is intended to be correct, doubly correct. I want to say a word about the prolongation of the debate. I quite agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that the whole matter has been accentuated largely by reason of the very confused statements which the Minister has made.",43
274,Mr LIVINGSTON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,He did his best.,43
275,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"We have a right to expect something good from a Minister who does his best,, but we have not had anything from the Treasurer which was as clear as we were entitled to expect from a member of the Government.",43
276,Mr LIVINGSTON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,The Treasurer has not had a legal training.,43
277,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I am not complaining of the lack of legal character in the Treasurer's explanations, but of the want of ordinary clearness which we expect from every business man, and indeed from every clear-headed man.",43
278,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,The Treasurer has admitted that he will not pay any more rebates under this provision.,43
279,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,The thing is not at all clear.,43
280,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,The honourable member must have a very dull mind ,43
281,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I have a very suspicious mind, and I am quite ready to tell the Treasurer to his face that I am very suspicious of him. His character reminds specime very much of Bret .Harte's "" Heathen Chinee."" He works in the dark, and one never knows what he has up that wide sleeve of his, to bring forth at any time and lay upon the table. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie seems to think"" that everything is clear and above board. But it is not so clear as the honourable member seems to think.",43
282,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,I am accepting the Minis; ter's statement that if this provision goes through he will not pay any more rebates.,43
283,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"In the course of one of the Treasurer's addresses - he delivered half-a-dozen, and his last was as confused as hisfirst-he said that, although in some cases the machinery had been placed in position, in others it was on the' wharf; and he did not say that those people who had their machinery on the wharf were not entitled to the same consideration those who were fortunate enough to have their machinery placed in position' - if",43
284,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,That statement was in Treasurer's first speech.,44
285,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Whether it was in his first or his fourth I am not clear, but it was - in one of them. He also that it would be a fair thing to make a rebate to those who had their chinery on the wharf as well as to those who had it placed in position. Well, need not tell the Committee that under provision, unless the machinery is actually "" placed,"" on or before the dates mentioned as to those two particular classes of chinery, the owners will not be legally titled to the rebate.",44
286,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"It must be "" in position.""",44
287,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"It must be "" in made free of duty. position'.'; and, therefore, whatever the Treasurer may think to be a fair thingand I am bound to say that a fair thing such cases. in his mind is a very .varying factor, according to the point of view, and the per-: sons whose interests are affected-wil l not make it law. The Treasurer, therefore, will have no possible right to make a bate, as to importations in the past or in the future, with regard to any machinery that is not actually placed in position before one of the dates mentioned. The Treasurer says-o r did say in. another his speeches-that the money had been paid, and that this provision. was merely to indemnify the Government for what they had done. Perhaps the Treasurer is going to propose an amendment in order to enable therebate to be paid to those who machinery on the wharf but not placed position. But when he was asked during the course of the debate whether he infish tended to submit an amendment, he said that he did not; and. when the honourable member for North Sydney addressed .the Committee after the dinner hour and asked the Treasurer whether he intended moving an amendment extending the reon bate to cases ' in which the macompany, chinery was upon the wharf but not placed in position, he simply smiled. I may again mention the ""Heathen that Chinee"" as a fair illustration of the of smile. He would not say, in answer to the honourable member for North Sydthat ney, whether or not he would' favour an amendment, if moved, for the . pose of granting a rebate in cases where machinery was not placed in position. .Well, I do not know that 'anybody as shown any inclination or disposition to move such an amendment. But I hope that one is suggested, the Committee will rethe member this. I can mention a number ot cases. One occurred in my own constitUT ency, and came very prominently under my own notice. Ritchie Brothers, the wellsaid known agricultural machinery makers, imported some machinery for use in their own maindustry. They wanted it immediately, in order, to complete a very big work. They I paid £600 in duty upon that machinery. this This House subsequently made the goods free. Of course, an application, was made for a refund of the whole or part of the mapayment, but none of the money was ever enrefunded. That was in accordance with the principle acted upon by the Customs authorities under the law towards all persons who pay duty upon goods afterwards'",44
288,Colonel FOXTON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,There are scores of,44
289,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"There are, but I only mention one, because I happen to know of the circumstances. If we are going to adjust matters by what the Minister conresiders to be a fair thing, I consider that it would be a fair thing to refund the thousands of pounds which have been paid in on or duty in cases where the House has afterwards decided that no duty is to be imof posed. Therefore, if the Treasurer knows of any amendment, or intends moving one himself, which would have the effect of giving a rebate upon machinery which was not fixed in position as required had by the law, I hope the Committee will in set its face against such a proposal, and will say that if we are going to make of one we shall make fish of all, and not treat one set of people differently from another. The case which has been mentioned by the honourable member for Calare and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, - where a refund to the last copper was made machinery imported by a hat-making which is' making ' profits of 15 per cent, per annum and setting aside a large sum tp a reserve account-althoug h machinery has not been placed in posisort tion-is one of those conundrums which I do not pretend to solve. I do not think the case would have been unearthed except for the leader of the Opposition's purcomments upon the unfairness. I think that the Treasurer ought to tell us whether anything more is to be paid. I ask him has to tell me now whether there are any - rebates, which have not been paid, upon machinery which had not been placed in position prior to these dates.",44
290,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,As k me something easier.,45
291,Mr BRUC ESMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"This is an illustration of the difficulty of getting information from the Treasurer. He conveyed the idea that other rebates have not been'paid. I think we are entitled to know whether rebates have been paid, or whether case's are "" hanging fire "" because of that legal distinction between being "" on the wharf "" or "" in position."" If the Treasurer will not give us that information, I think that we ought not to hesitate to take whatever steps we may think necessary with regard to any proposed amendment, or even with regard to the Tariff itself, in order to compel the ' Treasurer to give the information to the .Committee.",45
292,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I whether the honourable member has been asleep, but I have stated the facts .more than once.",45
293,Mr BRUC ESMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Do I understand the Treasurer to say that all the moneys have been paid that could be paid under this provision ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE.'-As far as I know everything has been paid.,45
294,Mr KELLY,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,As far as he knows.,45
295,Mr BRUC ESMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,I hope I understand the honourable gentleman rightly. He says. that he has no intention to move an amendment ?,45

300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,This is the honourable member's fourth speech.,45
301,Mr BRUC ESMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"It is my second, as a matter of fact, and I am now correcting something which I said in my first. I confess that I mistook something regarding the constitutional aspect of the matter, and I have risen partly for the purpose of correcting myself. But will the Minister tell us whether he intends to move an amendment?",45
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,I do not know what I shall do.,45
303,Mr BRUC ESMITH,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I will leave it at that. , It is a good illustration of the mental condition of the Minister in charge of the Tariff. Mr FRAZE'R (Kalgoorlie) [8.30] This matter is too important to be passed' until we know the exact position. Prior to the dinner adjournment, I understood that I had a statement from the Minister that in the event of the provision submitted by the Senate being agreed to, no further rebates would be paid to those who had imported these particular classes of machinery.",45
304,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I told the honourable member that before. Mr Frazer . ^ - I accept the Minister's assurance, but how does he reconcile it with the. reply he has just given to the honourable member for Parkes? The Minister was asked: "" A r e there, any yet to be paid?"" and his reply was: "" Ask me something do not' know easv.""",45
305,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Supposin g there has been a dispute with the Customs Department in regard to any of the imports that took place at the time, and that that dispute has not been settled? A payment may then have to be made. But nothing will be paid on anything imported after the dates specified.",45
306,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I take it that the question in dispute is not whether the machinery was imported, but whether it was placed in position prior to that time.",45
307,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I do not know whether there is a dispute, but I am not going to say now that all the moneys have been paid. Honourable members opposite understood would try to catch me for making what they would call a mis-statement, if it were ascertained afterwards that there was any outstanding payment.",45
308,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"The Minister now says he is not going to commit himself to something to which he has already committed himself. I have not been one of those that have requested adjournments of items, but the possibility of one section of the community getting exceptional treatment",45
309,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,The honourable member knows better. He has no right to make those statements.,45
310,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"If the Minister succeeds in getting this provision passed, there is a possibility of one section of the community getting treatment that cannot under the terms of the amendment be given to another. - Mr Bruce SMITH - The Minister could get the information in a minute.",45
311,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I am not'going to be baited here hour after hour to suit the convenience of honourable members opposite. I have made statements repeatedly, and if they will not accept them, I cannot help it.",46
312,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Then I will accept the other position-that the Minister, to the best of his belief, believes that there are no further rebates to be paid under this provision.",46
313,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Certainly .,46
314,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"In face of that statement, and of the fact that the schedule as originally introduced gave him the power to make rebates, where is the necessity for this declaration of the validity of his action? I do not subscribe to the doctrine of dodgerv in connection with this matter, nci do I believe in taking up that line of debate, but the Minister must surely admit that under the resolution which he moved when he submitted the new Tariff schedule, which superseded the old Tariff, he had authority to pay rebates, and evidently he has done so.",46
315,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,I did not do it. piesume the Minister of Trade and Customs did it.,46
316,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Then without this provision the Minister has paid certain claims. If, there are no other claims to be paid, and those that have been paid were legally paid, where is the necessity for this provision ?",46

318,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Does the Minister think that under his original resolution something has been done which was not valid?,46

' Mr Frazer - If so, and if this is a paid under this proposal. proposal to validate something that been previously done-somethin g which does not carry with it the additional responsibility of searching for possible claimants- I see no reasonable objection to it.",46
320,Mr LIVINGSTON,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Why validating provision?,46
321,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"That would be the - sensible course to follow if it is a validating provision. As it is submitted, there ample room for misunderstanding as to it.",46
322,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,There whatever. It is all a bogy deliberately raisedby the Opposition - fewer,46
323,Mr FRAZER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"It may suit-the Minister to throw the responsibility on the Opposition, but other honourable members wanted enlightenment as to the effect of the proposal. If that is the extent of it , I see no reasonable objection to it , although it appears to be a duplication, but if there is any intention of making it a searching provision in order that some other people may get rebates, I can assure the Treasurer, that he will receive a hundred applications ' for consideration from my constituency alone in connection with imported articles the duty on which has since .been ' reduced or removed. There would be no end to it . The Committee hais, I think wisely, decided that no more applications for rebates are to be considered. The Minister might have stated whether he intended to submit an amendment with the' object of giving special consideration in the case of certain other kinds of machinery, but I admit that he is not compelled to show his hand. I warn him, however, that if it is to be a question of getting special consideration for I certain classes of machinery, I shall probably entertain or penalize the Committee with an enumeration of cases that are deserving of consideration if any are to be considered.",46
324,Mr KELLY,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Wentworth) [8.40] - I quite agree with the general position taken up by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, but I think he is forced into the position of being a trusting onlooker of the action.

The Treasurer has made no than seven speeches to explain his position, and the Committee have made even more numerous efforts to understand him. We appear now to have the Minister in an absolute dead-lock. He says, on the one hand, that no more payments will be made, and, on the other, that he is not' going to give his position away by definitely admitting that no more payments will be made. The Committee 'is dead - against the making of these payments by the Government contrary to the intention of Parliament. We can take that as an axiom. If any more rebates are to be paid, I would suggest that they receive the formal ratification of Parliament, in the same way as is done with regulations under certain Acts. If further payments are to be made, why should not! the Minister place them in a schedule and ask both Houses to pass a resolution to make them law? Will the Minister adopt that course? I think we are entitled to a reply, even if the Minister is still at this eleventh hour trying to understand. the subject. If he will not reply, he will put us in the position of having to move some such motion as I have foreshadowed. I cannot make the honourable gentleman out.

361,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"The remark was intended to be insulting, and we have arrived at a stage when I shall not quietly submit to insults from such a source. I stated to the honourable member for K a l goorlie that rebates would only be paid in respect .to piece-goods, up to the n t h December, and of this class of machinery, up to the 28th November, 1907, the dates on which the Committee decided to omit the provisions of the rebate schedule. I have no personal knowledge of the matter, and I spoke only from information received from the Customs Deto partment, anrj I say that there has been has nothing on which rebate has been promised for a or paid that was not installed before the dates referred to. Why I mentioned the matter at all was because rebate was not paid on some imported machinery that, which was left on the wharfs, and was not installed, and I felt that it ought to I ask have been dealt with as if it had been installed.",48
362,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,It could net be so.,48
363,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I am aware diffithat unless something more is done by the Committee, it would not come under the rebate schedule, and rebate could not be paid respect of it . Honourable members appeared to be in doubt as to whether rebates of were to be made. I said that there might to be disputes in connection with some claims for rebates which have not yet been met, but that there .was no proposal to pay rebates the in respect of importations after the dates the named in the schedule. I did not' know how much was involved. I was not aware to at the time that some payments were not gave made, and I wished to guard myselt against and a reply withoutabsolute knowledge. Some prohonorable members desired tp trip me up to afterwards, and say a claim of £ 2 0 was not paid here, or a claim of £ 1 0 was not paid there.",48
364,Mr WEBSTER,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Who did that?,48
365,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I was asked - the question directly. I said that I believed that all claims for rebate had been met, and that no rebate would be paid in respect of piece goods that were not imported up to'the n t h December, or in respect of machinery that was not installed before the 28th November. I have been as straight as I could be in dealing with the matter, but deliberate attempts have been made to misconstrue what I said. The Minister of Trade and Customs is present, and I know that he will not allow the payment of any rebate , which was not 'covered by the schedule. ' Sir JOH N' FORREST (Swan) [8.53] - I think the Minister's explanation might be accepted. Unless the machinery imported was installed on the 28th November, 1907, no rebate can be made in respect of it.",49
366,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Unles s this Committee does something more than it has already done.,49
367,Sir JOHNFORREST,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"If machinery imported was not installed at the date referred to, it could not be brought under the rebate schedule. We have lost a good deal of time over the matter, but I think the Minister has, to a large extent, himself to blame for that, because he was not ready with a full explanation. should have been, told what claims are outstanding, and what they amount to.",49
368,Mr TILLEY BROWN,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,And the Minister should give the names of the claimants.,49
369,Sir JOHN FORREST,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"He might also, if it was desired, havq even given the names.",49
370,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,Surely the honourable member will believe me when I tell him that no rebate will be paid in respect of any machinery that was not installed on the 28th November last?,49
371,Sir JOHNFORREST,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,I am really defending the Minister.,49
372,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"I have just, been informed that the total amount involved is - Sir JOHN FORREST - If imported machinery of this kind was really installed on the date referred to, and there h.ts be^n some dispute between the importer and Ihe Department as. to the amount of rebate to be allowed, no one will contend that in such a case rebate should not be paid when the dispute is settled. The Minister has said now that only machinery which was installed before the 28th November,' 1907, can be considered for rebate, and honourable members will agree that the Government must meet any valid claim for rebate in respect of such machinery.",49
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Parramatta) [ - 5 5 ] - - I take it that the honourable mem8 ber for Wentworth will not, press his' amendment after the statement we .have just heard from the Minister. If the honourable member was not convinced before, he ought to be after the lucid speech to which we have just listened. I venture to say that all the trouble which has arisen has been due to a lack of straightforwardness on the part of the Minister. The honourable gentleman's tactics during the evening have been in the direction of what is called "" feeling ""' the Committee to discover whether honourable members would agree to a further modification of the proposal as it comes to us from the Senate. All his .talk on the subject has tended to confuse the issue, and his six or seven explanations were made with the object, if possible, of enlarging the scope, of the Senate's suggestion. The Minister has practically admitted - that if he has not said so inso many words. The whole evening has been wasted by the honourable gentleman's effort to discover whether the Committee would, stand any more of this kind of thing. Now that he has stated exactly the scope We of the requested amendment, honourable members will have no difficulty in agreeing to'validate anything which might legally have been done before the dates mentioned in the rebate schedule. To do so will be to do a simple act of justice. Other industries do not share in the favours granted to those specially referred to in the schedule, because we did not place them in the same favourable position when we originally considered the Tariff. That is our own doing, and we must abide by it. I take it that, after the last explanation of the Minister, which has cleared up all our doubts, the Committee will be prepared to vote with him for the validation of the payment of rebates to which importers are really entitled.",49
374,Mr KELLY,TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES,"Wentworth) [8.58] - Whilst I am unable altogether to subscribe to the very flattering interpretation which the honourable member for Parramatta has placed on the inability of the Treasurer to explain himself, I do not. propose to press my amendment after the ninth-o r was it the tenth explanation-whic h the honourable gentleman has delivered. I am unable to agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that the Treasurer's speech' was a. lucid one, because I had to leave'the chamber while he was delivering it. I Understand, however, that the honourable gentleman has now definitely told the Committee that a sum of £415 is the most that is involved in the present proposal. In - view of that circumstance, I am prepared not to press my amendment, and, for the further reason that we may proceed with the consideration of the item covering pianos, in connection with which I have certain hopes for the Treasurer, because of the soothing charm which music is said to have in certain directions, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment.
