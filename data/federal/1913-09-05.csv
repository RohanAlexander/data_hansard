16,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,It will apply only to the future.,13
17,Mr AHERN,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General a question without notice. W it h a view to the extension of country telephone lines, and the cheapening of the cost of construction, has the Minister given any instructions to the departthe mental officers to prepare new specificato tions with a view to carrying out that object; if he has not done so, will he give such instructions, and permit resinexion dents to take part in the construction lines in accordance with the new speciof fications ?",13

26,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"The localities named are not known to me, but I will 'inquire into the matter.",13
27,Mr FRAZER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Before a decision is arrived at by the Postmaster-General or the Government in regard to telephone extensions and the possible losses, will the honourable gentleman endeavour to place House in possession of the figures as the probable annual cost?",13
28,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I do not think that one can prepare an estimate in conwith this matter, but none of the of lines will be put up without the consent the Department.

30,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"In the Deas partment there is a regulation providing where a line has become payable, and the full amount of the guarantee is received, the Department shall refund to the guarantors the amount they have paid. I think that that arrangement was proposed by the honourable member for K a l goorlie when he was Postmaster-General.",13

Personally, I think there are men in Australia who can do this work; I desire to ask the Prime Minister a whether he does not know that, as soon as the Postal Department pays the wages down under the Arbitration Court of award, there will be thousands of menavailable.",14
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I am not aware of that fact, and all I have to say is that I am glad to hear it . The reason I made this matter public before acting was in order to see if we could not get these people in Australia.",14
49,Mr ORCHARD,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"W it h reference toadvertisements which have been issued calling for applications for the position of telephone mechanician in the TelephoneDepartment, Sydney, will the Postmaster General undertake to seriously consider the claims of men who, although graded as temporary hands, have been carrying out the duties satisfactorily for the last five or six years?",14

69,Mr JENSEN,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I ask the Prime M i nister whether he was correctly reported in the Argus on Saturday last to have presented, at a meeting held at Kyneton the night before, a bangle to a young lady who is secretary of the Liberal League of that town ? If so, was not his action in contravention of the Electoral Law?",16
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I both made a presentation and received a present, a very nice g if t of chocolate. The presentation was made on behalf of the members of the League in Kyneton to their president, the g if t being a beautiful gold watch-bangle, which I believe the recipient greatly appreciated.",16
71,Mr THOMAS,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"In view of the fact that the Electoral Act prohibits a candidate for this Parliament from spending more than £ 1 0 0 in his electoral campaign, I ask the Minister of Home Affairs if he is aware of the statement made in this House by the honourable member for Bourke that Mr Herbert Brookes, during the recent campaign sent a cheque to the honourable member for Perth, who was at the time a candidate for that division. If so, as the money was sent obviously for use in the campaign, will the Minister ascertain whether the honourable member for Perth spent more than £ 1 0 0 on his electioneering ?",16
72,Mr FOWLER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"As a personal explanation, I wish to say that I am very sorry that the honourable member for Barrier has thought fit to put this construction on a matter that he understands perfectly well. The sum of £500 was remitted to me by Mr Brookes for the Liberal organization of Western Australia, which sent an acknowledgment of it to Mr Brookes, and I have his authority to say that it can be seen by the honourable member for Barrier at any time that he wishes to see it . I was given to understand at the time that the money had been collected as the result of an appeal to a number of persons in and around Melbourne who were interested in Western Australia, and the facts, I think, indicate that the thousands of pounds which are alleged to have been subscribed to the funds of the Liberal party by trusts and combines in - the Commonwealth did not reach Western EXPEN - Australia at any rate. AMENDMENT Mr HUGHES - I desire to ask the Attorney-General a question in relation to prosecutions under the Electoral Act for offences alleged to have been committed during the recent electoral campaign. Before I left office, certain prosecutions were authorized, and the initia l steps were taken. I should be glad to know what has been done in regard to those prosecutions in which instructions were given to proceed. So far as I know, none of the cases have come before the Court, except in the matter of one obscure newspaper in Manly, New South Wales. There were some other cases of much greater importance of which I have heard nothing since; and I should like to know what is to happen in regard to them. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have the same answer to give that I gave to the same question some weeks ago. That answer is that the prosecutions to which the honourable member refers are prosecutions initiated, if at all, by the Department of Home Affairs. The only way in which such, cases come before the Attorney General is, I think, under section 208 of the Electoral Act . By that Act the At torney-General is called upon to advise any other Department as to prosecutions which that Department may contemplate. As to the advice that I have given as Attorney-General to my colleagues, I decline to disclose it , or any part or it , to this House. W it h regard to actual prosecutions, so far as the Attorney-General is responsible for the initiation of them, the persons who will first require any knowledge of them will be, as I said before, the persons mainly and primarily interested, namely, those who are accused. If the honourable member desires any further in formation as to those prosecutions, which are in the discretion of the Department of Home Affairs, I suggest that he had better ask that Department.",16
73,Mr HUGHES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"The honourable gentleman seems to be under the impression that I am asking for information to which I have no right. I do not desire information that is private, but only that in formation which should be given to the House in reference to matters of first public importance. A great many statements have been made about improper practices during the election-statement s affecting the election and affecting the Labour party-and I wish to know, in particular, what has been done in regard to the proseaware of the law. cutions in which the secretary of the never mind the law. Liberal Association of New South Wales was implicated? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I thought honourable member would be quite familiar which to apply for the facts. with the rule on which, personally, I always acted, and believe to be the rule always acted on in the House of Commons and other Legislatures in the British Possessions. The Attorney-General, the honourable member knows, occupies a dual position.",16
74,Mr FRAZER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"He does-the Attorneyof General is quite r i g h t ! Mr W . H . IRVINE - The Attorneyasking him. General occupies a dual position. He is the King's Attorney in the King's Courts, and in that position has no responsibility to this House. In his own Department, of Home Affairs. he is a responsible officer administering that Department, and, like every other Assistant Minister. Minister, is responsible to this House. Under the electoral law, there are certain offences, and that law is administered the Minister of Home Affairs, just as Customs prosecutions are initiated or carried on by the Minister of Trade and Customs. The responsibility for initiating or carrying on a prosecution under the in electoral law is a matter for the Depart Mr. ment of Home Affairs, and rests with Minister of Home Affairs. There are ceralleged tain matters-and their range is pracwish tically unlimited-in which the Attorneythe General, as Attorney-General, on his own initiative, finds it his duty inaugurate prosecutions, whether under Act of Parliament or otherwise. regard to these, he acts as King's Attortion, ney in the King's Courts, and not as responsible Minister of the Crown.",17
75,Mr HUGHES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"But this prosecution was initiated. Mr W . H . IRVINE - And I say that it was initiated, if at all, by the Home Affairs Department.",17
76,Mr HUGHES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"It was not; it initiated by my direction, on the recommendation of the Departmental officers. that. Mr W . H . IRVINE-Perhaps I had better refer to the Act .",17
77,Mr HUGHES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"The Department of Home Affairs simply carries out the fornamely, mal part of the business. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is where I differ from the honourable member.",17
78,Mr HUGHES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I am perfectly well I want the facts; Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am giving you the law, and, in giving you the law, I the am telling you the proper quarter in That have proper quarter is the Department of Home Affairs.",17
79,Mr THOMAS,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,The honourable member for West Sydney had better ask the quesas tion of the Minister of Home Affairs. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is what I suggest; and the Minister of Home Affairs is anxious to supply all the facts the case if the honourable member for West Sydney will go through the form of,17
80,Mr HUGHES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I shall have one more try, and put the question to the Prime Minister, who, I understand, is Minister",17
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,Pu t it to the,17
82,Mr HUGHES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I shall do nothing of the sort. I ask the Prime Minister, as by Minister of Home Affairs, to supply me with information in regard to the prosecution initiated by the previous Government for offences alleged to have been committed under the Electoral Act , and, particular, in regard to a case in which Parkhill, the Secretary of the Liberal the Association of New South Wales, was to have been implicated ? I do not the Prime Minister to refer me to Department of the Attorney-General, but to tell me in plain terms exactly how sometimes to the position stands.",17
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"The honourable W it h member persists in asking me this quesand my reply is that I do not know a how the matter stands. If the honourable member wil l give notice of the question, I shall try to give him an answer.",17
84,Mr HUGHES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,All right.,17
85,Mr WEBSTER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"The Attorney General has said that the Attorney General of Australia has a dual capacity as representing the K in g and the Parliawas ment of the country. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No , I did not say",17
86,Mr WEBSTER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I desire to ask now whether or not it is a fact that the Attorney-General has a triple duty to perform, to the K in g , to the Parliament, and to the Marconi Company ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member shall have a very full answer to that question next Tuesday.",17
87,Mr HIGGS,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I wish to ask the Attorney-General, without notice, whether there is any truth in the statement published by the Adelaide Register, on Tuesday last, on the authority of "" A well-informed legislator,"" that it was the intention of the Government to introduce a Bill to amend the Electoral Act, the Bill consisting of one clause only, and its in tention being to re-establish the postal vote? It was further stated that this Bill was to be forced through the House of Representatives and sent to the Senate, with a view of endeavouring to secure a double dissolution. If there be any truth in this statement, will the Attorney General be good enough, when asking for leave to introduce the Amending Electoral Bill , to explain the main features of that measure? Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member will learn the intentions of the Government respecting the matter and form of Bills which we intend to introduce at the same time as every other honourable member will learn them-that is, when they are introduced. PERSONAL EXPLANATION. CHARGES AGAINST EX - MINISTER MINISTERS ' TRAVELLING EXPENSES.  personal explanation in connection with a speech made by the honourable member for Kennedy last night, containing a reference to an affidavit read to the House at an earlier stage of the same debate by the honourable member for Yarra. The affidavit is said to have been signed by four residents of Costerfield, who made this declaration in the public hall on the evening of Monday, May 26th, 1913, said that Mr Fisher, Prime Minister, and Mr O'Malley, Minister for Home Affairs, were robbers. He accused them of taking money out of the Commonwealth Treasury - and putting it in their own pockets, and said there were men in gaol doing two or three vears for lesser crimes than these Ministers had committed. I disclaim the verbiage there attributed to me. In the first place, the ex-Minister for Home Affairs was not mentioned by me; my reference was to the ex-Prime Minister, the ex-Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the ex-Postmasterpublic General. I was challenged on several casions during the no-confidence debate tc> prove my statements, and last night I told honourable members that I would reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy, but subsequently, as I understood it to be the general wish that thediscussion should close in time to allow the last trains to be caught, I waived m y right to speak then, and now crave the in dulgence of the House to put what I have to say into a personal explanation. I am reported in Hansard to have interjected,, when the honourable member for Yarra was speaking, "" I mean to prove it in parton the floor of the House,"" and I mustlay stress on the words "" in part, "" becauseI do not profess to be able to prove statements which I did not make. What I said was, that persons who took money out of the tills of their employers to which theywere not entitled, and did so without theknowledge of those to whom it belonged,, were put into gaol, and that the then Prime Minister and the other Ministers! whom I have mentioned had been guilty of an offence worse than that, or words to> that effect.",18

89,Mr SPEAKER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"The honourable member is entitled only to make a personal explanation in regard to something about, which he has been misrepresented.  vented by the forms of the House from making an explanation which I know every honourable member desires. Mr SPEAKER : - A personal explanation must refer to a matter upon which, the member making it has been misrepresented, misquoted or misunderstood. In making a personal explanation, it is not permissible for an honourable member to go beyond what is necessary to make his position clear. If , however, it is the desire of the House that the honourable member for Echuca should be allowed to proceed further, the House can grant him the requisite leave. I takei t that it is the pleasure of the Housethat that leave should be granted to him ?"" Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear !",18
90,Mr SPEAKER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Leave is granted.  meeting at Costerfield I quoted from ocHansard certain words which fell from the lips of the ex-Prime Minister on the 19th December, 1911. Those words will be found in Hansard, page 4871. It was the last day but one of the session of 1911 that the Prime Minister came down to the House and made a statement in the course of which he said I wish to intimate to both Houses that the Government think it would be fair for the Prime Minister, while on official visits only, to be allowed 40s. per day, and other Ministers holding portfolios to be allowed 25s. per day when on similar visits. At that stage Sir John Quick interjectedWhat assurance have we that Ministers might not engage in party business? and Mr Fisher repliedI said on purely official business. If Ministers went on party business, they would, of course, not draw any allowance. But what happened ? On the first day of the following session I gave notice of my intention to move that a return be prepared, showing the amounts drawn by various Ministers for travelling allowance during the recess.",18
91,Mr MATHEWS,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,And the member got more than he wanted.  derable difficulty in getting that motion through the House. I was personally dissuaded from moving it by the ex-Prime Minister,19

93,Mr SPEAKER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Order ! The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has interjected, which is disorderly in itself, and he has also made a statement which is not parliamentary. I ask him to withdraw it .",19

On the 8th August, 1912, my motion was moved, and with an addition upon which the ex-Prime Minister insisted, was carried. On the same date the return was laid on the table of the House. From that return certain facts were made apparent to those who chose to investigate. But they were so shrouded by other information which was not pertinent to the case that it was difficult to find out thair meaning. However, in vestigation proved that within five months of the ex-Prime Minister making the virtuous statementI said upon purely official business, he was in Queensland fighting the battle of his own political party, and drawing his travelling allowance during the time he was there.",19

99,Mr SPEAKER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Thes e proceedings believe the are grossly irregular. I am sorry that day after day I have to repeat my request for order. When the Speaker calls "" Order "" it should not be followed i m mediately by another interjection, and still less by a series of interjections.  established by the return which was in Hansard, that the ex-Prime Minister drew his travelling allowance all the time he was in Queensland, notwithstanding his promise that he would draw it only when he was engaged upon "" purely official business.""

101,Mr FRAZER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"The honourable member is even indecent enough to mention that.  facts. The case bf Senator MCGregor, who occupied the position of Vice-President of o the Executive Council at the time, differs from that of the honourable member for Wide Bay, because honorary Ministers have always drawn a travelling allowance when engaged on public business. But Senator MCGregor, as a representative of South Australia, had no official business in Queensland at all. Y e the drew his travelling allowance from the Treasury for every day that he was there fighting a political battle. In the same way the records of the Tasmanian newspapers show that the ex-Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, went to that State ostensibly upon public business. He arrived there some days before the elections took place, and the newspapers show that in the most inflammatory language he was day after day engaged in fighting the party's battle. Whilst so doing he drew his travelling allowance. I say that if we put a man in gaol for dipping his hand into his master's t ill and taking money which does not belong to him, those who occupy high places in the government of this country and who use their power to dip their hands into the public Treasury and take out money to enrich themselves under conditions which Parliament has not sanctioned, are guilty of an even worse offence.",20
102,Mr FRAZER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"And their names should be Palmer.  know that the present Government are above suspicion in this regard, because its members are not drawing the travelling allowance at all. I repeat that the man who takes money which does not belong to him is guilty of robbery, be he the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth or the lowest individual in the community. Both should be judged by the same standard.",20
103,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I crave the permission of the House to make a personal explanation, as I was the honourable member who read the affidavit to which the honourable member for Echuca has replied.",20

Standing order 258 readsBy the indulgence of the House a member may explain matters of a personal nature, although there may be no question before the House. But such matters may not be debated.

The affidav it proceeds held in the public hall, on the evening of Monday, May 26th, 1913, said that Mr Fisher, Prime Minister, and Mr O'Malley, Minister for Home Affairs, were robbers. He accused them, of taking money out of the Commonwealth Treasury and putting it into their own pockets, and said there were men in gaol doing two or three years for lesser crimes than these Ministers haoT committed.

When I read that affidavit during the debate on the no-confidence motion the honourable member for Echuca interjectedI mean to prove it in part on the floor of this House, to which I repliedWhy does not the honourable member prove it altogether? He then said I will prove it as far as it applies to Prime Minister. That is to say, he would prove that the ex-Prime Minister is a robber, and ought to be in gaol. Other honourable members went on to say that they would have him in gaol. However, I understand that they did not mean that, although the honourable member for Echuca has not denied that he would have the ex-Prime Minister in gaol. It is very unfair to attack a man who is not present to defend himself. The honourable member for Echuca had ample opportunities to raise this question when the ex-Prime Minister was present.",20

118,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I regret that the Standing Orders do not permit of the honourable member being described in the terms I have used, but I will withdraw the remark. This question of travelling expenses was raised by the honourable member on 8th August, 1912. The intention of the Government with regard to the the ex- drawing of travelling expenses was put before the House in December, 1911, not after an all-night sitting, as has been said, but at 9.15 p.m. The ex-Prime Minister then stated distinctly the course that it was intended to follow in regard to the payment of travelling expenses. When the matter was mentioned in the Senate by the then Vice-President of the Executive Council, Senator MCGregor, Senator Millen, the present Minister of Defence, made a speech in which he approved of the proposed action.",21

130,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Certainly , sir, if honourable members opposite object to the insinuation which they say I made. I shall withdraw it with pleasure. Apparently the honourable member for Echuca may say anything he pleases.

With that admission I am perfectly satisfied; but I do think that he has acted unfairly in attacking the ex-Prime Minister in his absence. The right honourable gentleman made the position perfectly clear. He showed clearly on a previous occasion that long before either the first or the second Fisher Ministry took office Ministers were drawing this allowance. An Executive minute was passed as far back as 1901 ]iroviding for Ministerial travelling expenses, and that minute has never been revoked. Some members of ithe Ministry in 1901 and also in 1909-10 drew expenses on the authority of this Executive minute. There was authority for the drawing of the money to which reference has been made, otherwise the Auditor-General would not ""have passed the accounts.

139,Mr KELLY,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,The honourable member for Yarra says that the honourable member of for Echuca has made this statement outside. Why not let him prove it in a Court of law ?,22
140,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I agree with the attitude taken up by the present Attorney-General on 8th August, when he said that he was personally anxious to see the matter settled and that it was a distasteful subject to raise. I do not think that any one, save the honourable member for Echuca, would have raised it . ",22

143,Mr TUDOR,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I regret exceedingly that this matter has been raised, but since it has been we have the right to clear the character of an honourable gentleman who stands high in the estimation of the people of Australia. I believe that nine-tenths of the Government party are prepared to say that every action taken by the ex-Prime Minister would undoubtedly be perfectly straight, correct, and honest. Apparently, there is only one member of the party who is prepared to indulge in these tactics. The ex-Prime Minister stated distinctly that during the whole time that he was in his own electorate he did not draw a penny-for travelling expenses, although every one knows that a Minister, even when visiting his own electorate, is called upon whilst there to transact official business. My leader said that, whilst he was transacting official business in Brisbane on. the occasion in 'question, he did draw travelling expenses, and informed by his private secretary that political life. only on one night out of the number that he spent in Brisbane did he speak at any political meeting. Surely cian's nights are his own. I think it solutely disgraceful that the honourable member for Echuca has not accepted the statement made by the ex-Prime Minister on the 8th August, and I have only to say that if the honourable member chooses to say anything about me outside I shall be Ministers of State. prepared to deal with him either inside or outside the House.",22

I challenge him to say that documents cannot be produced from the office to prove my statement. It is true that there was an election in progress whilst I was in Hobart, and that I made two speeches on behalf of my party, but it is also true that I did not draw expenses in respect of the day on which I delivered those speeches.

Seeing that there is a large number of honourable members on the other side who have arrived at an age when it would be almost dangerous to be vaccinated, and seeing that they could not leave Sydney without being vaccinated, will the honourable gentleman grant to these honourable gentlemen exemptions, as is provided for in the Quarantine Act , the same as have been granted to the parliamentary visitors fro m the Old Land !

That is laid down in May, at page 250, eleventh edition.

I wish to know whether, before introducing a Bill to amend the Arbitration Act , by abolishing preference to unionists, and a Bill for amending the Electoral Act , byreinstating the postal vote, he will propose measures for the establishment for a general works Department, the taking over of Norfolk Island by the Commonwealth, the regulation of life and fire in surance and bankruptcy, the punishment of offences against the Commonwealth, and the taking over of the public debts of the States. I ask the question so that, so far as possible, public business may beexpedited, and the Government assisted in carrying out legislation. Will the Prime Minister remove contentious matters from the business-paper, and bring forward such as might possibly be non-contentious ?",26
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"The Government is painfully aware of the determination of honourable members opposite to assist us in carrying on the business of the country. We know that they are dying to do so. They show their determination at every possible opportunity. I shall be glad if the honourable member will intimate the measures that he desires us to pass, and that he pledges himself to help us to pass. QUESTIONS.",26
198,Mr BOYD,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"I wish to ask a question which I do .not know whether to address to you, Mr Speaker, or to the Prime Minister. Perhaps I had better ask him through you if he will take into consideration the enforcing of standing orders 95 and 96, which read as followsNotice of question shall be given by a delivering the same at the table signed by himself, and showing the day proposed for asking such question. When notices of questions are given the shall place them at the commencement of Notice-paper, according to the order in which be allowed. they were given. If those standing orders were followed, we might get business done without wasting an hour and a half at the beginning the sitting.",26
199,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"It is the province of the Speaker to see that the Standing Orders are enforced. H ad the honourable member read the three standing orders in front of those which he has quoted, he would have seen that standing order 92 providesAfter notices have been given, questions may be put to Ministers of the Crown relating to public affairs, and to other members relating to any Bill , motion, or other public matter connected with the business on the Notice-paper, of which such members may have charge. Then follow these standings orders93. In putting any such question no argument or opinion shall be offered, nor any facts stated, except so far as may be necessary to explain such question. 94. In answering any such question a member shall not debate the matter to which the same refers. The practice of permitting honourable members to ask certain questions without notice is a perfectly regular one, though it is, of course, for Ministers to say whether they will answer such questions, or . request notice of them. morning again drawn the attention of the House to the nature of the questions that may be asked, and have desired honourable members to frame their questions in conformity with the Standing Orders.",27
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"On e reason for allowing a little latitude this morning is that all these questions have been bottled up for a month, and they had to be asked or there would have been trouble. I do not know that we should object to f u r nishing an opportunity to our honourable friends opposite to demonstrate to the country their time-wasting capacity.",27
201,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,I ask the Prime Minister to withdraw that remark.,27
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"I withdraw it , but protest against the time that has been wasted.",27
203,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"The honourable member is making a reflection on honourable members opposite, and must withdraw his words without qualification.",27
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"Do you rule, sir, that it is unparliamentary to describe member the tactics of honourable members opposite fairly written, as time-wasting ?",27
205,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"It has been ruled, Clerk on several occasions, that that is a reflecthe tion on honourable members which cannot",27

208,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,That is not a proper question to be asked. QUESTIONS WITHOUTNOTIC E.,27
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"I desire to say that we shall not answer any further questions without notice this morning. Mr J. H. Catts, proceeding to ask the Treasurer a question without notice,",27
210,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"The Prime Minister has intimated that no further questions without notice will be answered this morning, and, therefore, it is useless to put them.",27
211,Mr JH CATTS,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"I submit that I am entitled to ask my question, and that' I have this you, Mr Speaker, cannot stop me from putting it .",27
212,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"Question s without notice have been asked from the commencement of the sitting at half-past ten until the present moment-te n minutes past twelve-and the Prime Minister has intimated that no more such questions wil ; be answered this morning. If Ministers will not answer questions without notice, the further asking of them is obviously a waste of the time of the House, and the honourable member will not be in order in proceeding with his question. Mr J. H. CATTS - As a matter of privilege, I submit that I am entitled to ask a Minister any question I choose relating to public business, without interference by the Speaker, although the Minister may, if he wishes, decline to answer the question.",27
213,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"The Prime Minister % having intimated that Ministers will not answer further questions without notice, such questions are no longer allowable. Questions without notice may be asked only so long as Ministers are willing to answer them. It is evident that no good purpose can be served by asking questions which will not be answered, and persisting in asking them is merely wasting the^time of the House.",27
214,Mr ROBERTS,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"May I submit for your future consideration, Mr Speaker, that if the ruling which you have just given is aalhered to, the rights and privileges of honourable members will be placed within the hands of the Prime Minister, who a minute after the assembling of the House might say that questions without notice would not be answered, which would, under your ruling, at once debar members from asking ,such questions. The refusal of Ministers to answer questions is quite within their right, because there is no obligation on Ministers to answer the questions put to them, either with or without notice; but surely the exercise by them of the right to decline the answer does not take fro m honourable members generally the right to ask questions. The position of honourable members would well nigh be intolerable if that were so. I submit that we should not be prevented from putting our questions before the country. As to the statement that an hour and a half has been occupied this morning in the asking and answering of questions without notice, I point out that it is no unusual thing at the beginning of a session for a little extra time to be occupied in this way. We must recognise the right of the Prime Minister to control the business of the House, but he .should not be able at any moment that he chooses to take from honourable members the right to ask questions. We are here as representatives of the people, whether our opponents like it or not, and our constituents may desire us to put certain questions. If the Prime Minister is permitted to say that he will not answer questions, and to thereby prevent us from putting them, we shall be prevented from representing our constituents in a manner in which they desire to be represented.",28
215,Mr FENTON,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,Speakin g to the point of order,28
216,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,I do not require further assistance in this matter.,28
217,Mr FENTON,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"There has already been, a ruling on the point.",28
218,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"I have already given a ruling on the point, and to discuss that ruling is irregular. Honourable members are not precluded from asking questions without notice of M in isters, but it rests with Ministers themselves to say whether they will reply to them or whether they will require notice to be given. As soon as Ministers intimate that they require notice to be given, any further questions must be placed upon the business paper, and the right of honourable members to get their questions answered is thus not interfered with . In the present instance the Prime Minister has notified that no further questions without notice will be answered today, and seeing that such questions are not recorded in Hansard, the mere putting of them cannot serve any useful purpose, and can only delay the business of the House. In these circumstances honourable members must avail themselves of the opportunity to put their questions upon the business paper, either for the next day of sitting or for any other day that they may think fit.",28
219,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"I wish to know, sir, whether it is open to any honourable member, after you have given a ruling,, torise in this House and occupy ten minutes in arguing as to the correctness of that ruling ?",28

221,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"If that privilege is to be allowed to one honourable member, it must be allowed to all others. But .1I have always understood that the proper way to take exception to Mr Speaker's ruling is by submitting a motion of dissent. You, sir, have allowed the honourable member for Adelaide to discuss your ruling for ten minutes. I wish to know whether it is now open to me to debate the propriety of your ruling, and, if not, why that privilege was extended to the honourable member for Adelaide.",28
222,Mr SPEAKER,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"Order ! The honourable member appeared to be labouring under a misapprehension. The honourable member for Adelaide, as I understood, rose, not for the purpose of questioning my ruling, but of submitting a question, as he said, for my f u t u re consideration, and if it referred to a new matter, it any would have been in order. I did not understand him to raise the question of the propriety of my r u l in g ; but to raise the question of privilege, affecting members' rights. I have already dealt with that question. But now that a ruling has been given, it would be quite out of order for an honourable member to attempt to traverse that ruling. If my ruling is to be called into question, it must be done in the regular way.",28
223,Mr BRUCE SMITH,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"I wish to say, sir, that I was under the impression that you had already ruled on the point of order when the honourable member for Adelaide rose.",29

The commission paid by the Bank covers all services rendered by the Postmaster-General's Department, including use of premises and equipment. 2. Yes. 3. See reply to 2.

Whether it is a fact that the cost of colthe land tax has risen from 1.22 per cent, for the first year to 4.09 for the second year, that a and to 5.78 for the third year? 2. If so, what is the reason for such increases?",29
235,Sir JOHN FORREST,VISIT OF BRITISHMEMBERS OF,"The answers of to the honourable member's questions 1. Yes. 2. The reasons are :(a) The full staff necessary to carry out the work of the Department was not appointed until the second year of the tax. The first year's expenditure in salaries was ^4,898 as against the present expenditure of A2I.997(b) The first year's expenditure included no. outlay for check by field valuers, of the unimproved values included in land-owners' returns. This cost 18,982 in the second year, and 27,683 in the third year, when the organization was in full working order. The check valuation has resulted in the collection of ^203,774additional tax, and this amount will be_ largely increased when the valuations are fully applied to each year's assessment. The average expenditure of the Department since its inception is 3.69 per cent. This can be reduced when the valuation work is complete. RECIPROCAL TRADE TREATIES.",29

Further, the award itself expressly states that it shall not come into force until the expiration to of such thirty days. Prior thereto the rates of pay are governed by the Public Service Act and Regulations, and up to the date the awardi comes into force the officers concerned in the award cannot lawfully be paid any wages other than as prescribed by the Regulations. If the award in the present case is departed from, as regards the date on which its principal! features shall come into operation, a dangerous precedent will be established for all futurecases. The Court has now before it claims by several Public Service Associations lodged at various dates back to the n t h September, 1912, and, if the present request be acceded to, eachof these associations will , no doubt, ask to have the awards in their cases also made retrospective in disregard of the provisions of the law.

Our proposition is that this provision shall apply only to payments that have been authorized by Parliament for the previous year. It is not proposed that any increase of salaries shall be paid under the provisions of this Bill. The ayments made during July will be on the as is of the Estimates for the previous year.",32

272,Sir JOHN FORREST,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I shall come to that point in a moment. As honourable members are generally aware, much inconvenience has arisen from the fact that the Treasury is without any legal authority to make any payment whatever after the close of the financial year, on the 30th June, until a Supply Bill is passed. It has been found necessary almost every year to interrupt the debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to hurriedly obtain Supply in order that payments that are imperative shall be made. Under our procedure, in a great many cases, wages payments are made weekly, and it has happened on more than one occasion that payment has had to be deferred owing to the Parliament not meeting until close upon the end June.",33

Payments wages have to be made in accordance very often with the award of an Arbitration Court or a Wages Board, but it has someGovernor times been found impossible to make them for the reason that Supply has not been obtained. A measure similar to this has been in force in New South Wales for regulate many years, I believe, and has worked satisfactorily, so that there is no reason to anticipate that any injury will be done to the public affairs of the country passing it . If it were usual to meet in under the Bill. May, or even early in June, we should probably be able to dispose of the debate on the Address-in-Reply, and obtain Supply before the end of the month, but experience shows that that is next to impossible. As a rule, Parliament does not meet until nearly the end of June, so that, unless we alter the date of the closing of the financial year, or make up our minds to meet earlier, Parliament must either pass this Bill, or continue to submit to the annual inconvenience as heretofore. This is a matter which has been talked about a good deal by more than one Government. We could, of course, go on as before, doing the best we can; but it was felt that as we were amending the Audit Act we might submit this proposal for the consideration of honourable members. Of course, it could be said that such a measure might induce a Government to delay meeting Parliament a little longer than they otherwise would. At present we must meet shortly after the 30th June in order to get Supply, whereas under the Rill it will be possible to carry on until the 31st July, to which date, at any rate, there will be money available. The general feeling of the House is, however, that we ought to meet about the end of June as the most convenient time, and I do not think that a Government would be acting quite in accordance with what we expect, if they took advantage of a measure of this kind to prolong the recess.  it has no advantage?",33

We should not be so much hurried, and the discussion of the policy of the Government would not be interrupted each year by the introduction of a Supply Bill shortly after the House had met. We should have time to settle down of to business before there was any necessity to consider the finances. The second object of the Bill is to give power to the in Council to make regulations for the purchase, custody, control, and issue of Government stores, and also to constitute a Supply and Tender Board to the purchase of public stores.

The explanation the right honourable gentleman has been purely formal, and he has not dealt with such a Board. any of those points which are of vital importance. The measure, which been placed in our hands only this ing, deals with matters of first moment, because nothing can be of more importment. ance than the control of the finances. Some truly revolutionary suggestions are made in the Bill , but these were not covered by the right honourable man's speech. I certainly object to being asked to discuss this measure without an opportunity to see precisely how far it is proposed to extend payments after the conclusion of a financial year. Paraunder graph (6) of sub-clause 2 leaves very authority grave doubts as to the utility of the posal. We have had Supply Bills this year, and, consequently, this clause would not apply until the next financial year. The proposal to institute a ply and Tender Board creates an entirelypowers new position. No doubt a suggestion to give authority to make necessary payments pending appropriation might, subject certain conditions, be favourably; but at present I am opposed to a Supply and Tender Board, because this seems to me to be giving the A u d i Department duties quite foreign to its Commonwealth. proper functions. The basic principle of the A u d it Department is that it is charged with the duty of inspection and inquiry in regard to other Departments-in itself it does nothing-and it has to inquire those Departments have done their work. journment Under section 45 of the A u d it Act , i one of the duties of the Auditor-General to ascertain the quantity, description, and price of all stores purchased ou acis count of, and all stores supplied to, every Department, and whether any person has requisitioned for or obtainsd any stores in excess of the reasonable requirements of his office.

Leave granted; debate adjourned. BUREAU OF AGRICULTUREBILL . SECOND READING .",35
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [2.16] - I m o v e That this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill has usually been in the care of the Minister of Trade and Customs. H a d he been here today he would have moved the second reading. In his absence I have to step into the breach, and, owing to the tired feeling which appears to pervade the Opposition benches, shall endeavour to give some pabulum which can be readily digested. The Bill proposes nothing that is difficult or occult. object is to establish a Federal Agricultural Bureau. I do not think that at this time of day any argument is needed as to the advisableness of taking a step of the kind. We have all agreed that anything relating to the primary industries of the country is of first-rate importance, and to take first place in our consideration. However much we may argue as to the importance of our secondary industries, and all the manifold and multiform social manifestations of our modern existence, it is undoubtedly the first and chief consideration of any body of individuals possessing a desire for the welfare of the community that the interests of agriculture should be promoted. Because, rightly comprehended, this is the basis of everything else. The aim in every country, it seems to me, ought to be to proportion development, to maintain a ratio, or, at any rate, a harmony, between primary and secondary industries. We have heard a great deal about the urgent necessity for Tariff revision. No doubt that is an important question. venture to say that this is equally important. Certainly, without attention to our primary industries, there would not be much need for the revision of the Tariff for the development of our secondary in dustries. This is the beginning of every form of natural development. Op- Mr Laird SMITH - It is unfortunate that there are not more farmers' representatives in the House to listen to this.",35
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"There are none over there. Is that the point ? I see before me fifteen or sixteen members of Parliament, and from one of them. I receive the interjection that it is a pity that there are not some members representing farmers here. I suppose, therefore, that we may infer that my honourable friends opposite have nothing to do with the farmers. Otherwise, what is the point of the interjection ?",35
296,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,We are in a good temper now. Do not stir us up.,35
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I would not for the world, but when an honourable member makes a statement like that I must take notice of it . It is a clear indication that honourable members opposite have nothing to do with farmers, and that the only members of this House who will take notice of their needs are those sitting on this side. I will pass on. Our primary industries are vital to the community, and Its of supreme importance to the State as a whole. As showing their importance, I point out that last year our total exports of pastoral and agricultural products amounted to £52,000,000 out of a total of £76,000,000, or 68 per cent. In this respect Australia is receiving attention from all parts of the world in a way that has not been the ca3e for many years past. Now and again we receive a delegation to our shores of people who are interested in investigating our conditions and natural resources. Everything seems to me to in dicate that the world at large is looking to countries like Australia for the food and for much of the clothing of the f u t u r e. We have here potentialities in abundance to supply the world's needs. I was very much struck by reading some statements made by the Scottish Agricultura l Commissioners who were out here a few years ago having a look at us. They refer, for instance, to the dairying industry: Indeed there must be very few parts of the world where Nature does so much to help and so little to hinder the provident and industrious But I producer of milk . . . It would not be easy to overstate the benefit a dairyman receives from being relieved of the need for housing, handfeeding, and tending his cows during a long winter . . . His anxiety, his work, and his expenses are reduced by half through the simple agency of a friendly climate. This indicates the viewpoint of people who have to feed their stock during a portion of the year, and to look after them very closely and carefully during the winter,",35
298,Mr ARCHIBALD,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Australi a compares very favourably with Canada.,36
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"Yes , in that respect we have many advantages over Canada, where the farmers have to house their stock during the long cold winter; whereas here very little of that kind of thing is necessary in the bulk .of our dairying districts. This is a matter of general interest. It does not affect the Commonwealth Government alone. affects all the States in common. The scientific, pastoral, and agricultural problems are differentiated in various ways in the various States.",36
300,Mr ARCHIBALD,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Will not this bureau clash with State Government institutions ?,36
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,I do not see that it will; but I will dwell on that point economical. in a moment. A clear case is to be made out for a Federal Bureau which would not come into conflict with any work that the States are now doing.,36
302,Mr HIGGS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Is this to be a Socialists' Bureau or an Anti-Socialists' Bureau!,36
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,I know very well that this does not concern my honourable friend very much.,36
304,Mr HIGGS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,The Prime Minister knows nothing of the kind.,36
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,There is not enough politics in it for him. This is far too useful a measure to appeal to him.,36
306,Mr HIGGS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"The Prime Minister says that he is an Anti-Socialist, but yet he is introducing a Socialist measure.",36
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I am trying to introduce this Bill by grace of the honourable member. He has plenty of other opportunities of demonstrating his great ability to lead the party opposite, and need not interrupt when I am busily engaged in explaining this proposal.",36
308,Mr HIGGS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,We are all going to help the Prime Minister to carry it out.,36
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"In my judgment, this little Bill, which has been on the stocks for nine or ten years, is one of the most important that could occupy this Parliament.",36
310,Mr BAMFORD,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,It was introduced originally by Mr Justice Isaacs when he was the member for Indi.,36
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I know that he made some excellent speeches on the subject. So did Sir John Quick, and so did we all. Pests, and similar troubles, have a peculiar affinity for some States and for some degrees of our climate. Every State is peculiarly interested in their obliteration from the Commonwealth. Outsiders see this just as clearly as we do. I shall quote again from the report of the Scottish Agricultural Commissioners, because I think it well that honourable members should know the impression made on their minds in respect of this subject. They came to the conclusion that, in connection with the work of It the States, a great deal of overlapping goes on. Here is an extract from their reportIt appeared to us, however, that a considerable amount of overlapping was going on, that in general there was a want of co-ordination and co-operation, that the policy of allowing each State to attempt to attack the solution of each agricultural problem by itself, was not the most There are many problems which are common to the whole of Australia, or to the greater part of it, and it would appear that time and money would be saved by placing some of the work of research in the hands of a Federal Department. For example, every State is afflicted with various stock diseases. In Queensland there is "" tick fever,"" in another there is "" coast disease,"" and so on. A strong and wellequipped Federal Department would seem more likely to cope with such diseases than the weaker and less well-equipped State Departments. The prickly pear, again, is not a State monopoly, but may through time spread over most of the country, and here again is an argument for Federal control, which would not"" absorb or limit the energies of the State Departments, but concern itself with a broader and a wider field. Now, a great deal of work in these fields is already being done by the Federal Government. We are employing many of the State agencies to do work which I am inclined to think could be very much better done by a bureau of our own. For instance, we have all sorts of quarantine arrangements which are looked after by the States. State officers do the work for us.",36
312,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,That would hardly come under this bureau.,36
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I think so. The purpose of quarantine is to locate disease, and, if possible, to eradicate it. Therefore, there must always be a close and intimate association between a Bureau of Agriculture and our general Quarantine Department.",36
314,Mr SAMPSON,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Would the Agricultural Bureau take over quarantine?,36
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Hardly . It would furnish scientific information to the Quarantine Department which it is unable to get today in regard to many matters.,36
316,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"Disease s in plants. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Yes , that is a very good illustration. The question of worm nodules in beef is being investigated in America, I know.",37
317,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,They have a man here now investigating it .,37
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"There is now an American here investigating the conditions under which our beef is sent away; in fact, our meat generally. The question of worm nodules in beef is, I understand, one which relates itself to both the Quarantine Department and the Agricultural Bureau.' It impinges upon both Departments, and there must necessarily be a very close relation between the two. A bureau of this kind would help us to make our quarantine very much more effective, and perhaps very much more intelligent. At present the States are doing a great deal of this work for us. I fiud, for instance, that the Commonwealth pays about £ 1 5 0 a year to the Sydney Bureau of Micro-Biology for special services rendered by them. And we are investigating very closely the question of the worm nodules in beef, which, I believe, affects Queensland in a way that it does not affect any other State.",37
319,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I suppose it is safe to that on that we have spent ten times as much as all the States have done. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I suppose so. I know that the other day we gave a Melbourne scientist a commission to look f u r ther into the question on a holiday trip she was about to make in Europe. refer to Dr Sweet, who, I believe, in connection with Professor Gilruth, has made a special study of this matter. There are others who are working in the same field. Then we pay £4,000 a year to a tropical school at Townsville. That, so far, has been concerning itself with human diseases, but it is enlarging its functions gradually to embrace animals and plants, and diseases of all sorts, as they express themselves in tropical lands. Again, there is the question of bitter pit. We are paying £1,000 a year for the investigation of that alone.",37
320,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"There is also £1,000 paid like that. in expenses. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I am speaking of the salary which comes from the f u n d contributed to by the States the Commonwealth. At any rate, Mr . MCAlpine is engaged in investigating the matter, and he receives £1,000 a year for his work. It has always appeared to me that what we most need in Australia is a small select body of the best original investigators we can get. I am afraid that we have never gone to the top of the tree in engaging the kind of ability that we want in these matters.",37
321,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I think that in the United States they have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in the in vestigation of bitter pit, but they do not seem to know much more about it now than they did at the beginning.",37
322,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,They do not know any more about bitter p it than we do.,37
323,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I do not know that that is a reason for not spending money-it is a reason for persevering. That reminds me that only this morning I received from a Tasmanian a letter telling me that he has a remedy for bitter pit. He says he can tell when he goes into an orchard whether bitter p it is there or not. I have no doubt that in many ways men are investigating in this field. The trouble is that there are so many theories concerning bitter pit. One of our University investigators says he has proved to demonstration that bitter p it is simply a poisoning of say the apple, and that it is caused by the various sprays which are used, and, perhaps, some poisons in the soil. Another investigator comes along and says he has proved to demonstration that ^ the spraying has nothing to do with bitter pit. Altogether, a great realm of exI ploration lies open to us, and we have to persevere until we find a solution for many of the problems. It appears to me that a great deal of this work will be done in the laboratory-it must be done there before it can be done in the field. I know that in connection with f r u it there are many troubles. If we got a man to deal with one of these troubles and solve it for us, he would be worth £50,000 a year to this country. Y e t the ordinary salaries that are being paid by the States range, I suppose, from £400 to £600 or £700 a year. We cannot buy the best ability of the world for a sum I do not want to say a word about what the States are doing, except in terms of the highest praise. I bejoint lieve that they are doing, most of and them, excellent work; but they are not doing the particular kind of work which a Federal Bureau ought to he set up to do. Over and above what they do in the practical fields of investigation there is the scientific laboratory work to be done, and for that purpose we want a small, well-equipped and thoroughly trained body of original investigators to tackle some of the problems that now afflict our people so much.",37
324,Mr SAMPSON,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,But would you confine the operations of the Bureau to original research work ?,38
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"To begin with, certainly. There is every possible facility in the States to test all their work. It would be an unnecessary duplication, it seems to me, for them to launch out into practical fields for the purpose of testing their own work. My own idea is to link up the practical Departments of the States to this Federal Bureau.",38
326,Mr SAMPSON,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,But that can only be done with the consent of the States.,38
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Quite so.,38
328,Mr HIGGS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,He has not got consent.,38
329,Mr SAMPSON,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,I think he w i ll get it .,38
330,Mr FLEMING,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"Would the Bureau have anything to do with the Pastures Protection Boards, or would it leave that work with the States?",38
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I take it that the Bureau would supply information to anybody and anywhere. It would investigate all these problems so far as its ability and the resources we placed at its disposal would permit it , and the knowledge would be there for any State or local body to get.",38
332,Mr FLEMIN G,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,The Bureau would have nothing to do with practical work ?,38
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"No . My idea is not to set this up as an administrative, but as an investigatory, bureau. Let the Bureau get on with the work which the States are not doing at present, and, when it has got scientific information, disseminate it . When it has traced the life history of a disease, and found the remedy to be applied, let it make that information available to the State Departments, which would test it in a practical way through their own organizations. I do not want this to be a competing bureau except in the highest sense of all .",38
334,Mr LIVINGSTON,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,There is plenty of room in the Northern Territory for experts to conduct experiments.,38
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"There is room for them in all the States. Take one matter alone, that of bitter pit. It would pay this country to get the best expert it could obtain in the world, and to set him to this work, and to be patient with him while he studies the disease for some years.",38
336,Mr MCWILLIAMS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"And you do not want him to stay in Melbourne, but to go where the disease exists.",38
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Exactly .,38
338,Mr HIGGS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"There might be no result from the Bureau for some years, that is, until the expert had discovered a remedy.",38

340,Mr FENTON,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Bitte r p it is not peculiar to Tasmania.,38
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I know that, but there are some matters which are common to Australia. We want these diseases their to be investigated at the point where we know its life history, and what its nature is, and I say that any one who could find out the remedy to be applied would be worth more than we could pay him in money. We must begin the work of higher specialization in this field of agricultural and pastoral pursuits.",38
342,Mr WEST,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,I presume you have no desire to cook the State bureaux.,38
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,What I am speaking of would be entirely outside of what the States are doing.,38
344,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Would not the Bureau duplicate some of the work which they are already doing?,38
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"No . My point; is that the States are not doing this laboratory work to any extent, and that fact is proved by the huge payments we are making every year to outsiders to undertake the work. Take, for instance, the payment of £4,000 a year to the Queensland Institute.",38
346,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,That is in relation to tropical medicine.,38
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I know it is, but surely that is a work which we ought to be doing in connection with an A g r i cultural Bureau.",38
348,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Yes .,38
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"There is no more intricate or difficult problem than that of those diseases of the tropics which .seem to have such a peculiar affinity for white people, and to cause them so much trouble. I do not wish to labour the question. But I desire to make it clear that the Commonwealth Bureau will in no way come into - conflict with the State bureaux; on - the contrary, it would assist the scientific work that they are doing, and the State agencies would test its laboratory experiments by practical application of their results. The intention is to link up the - Commonwealth and State Departments, and supply what is now missing from the State machinery. We require a standard Australian wheat, which will take a place in the world like that of the Manitoba wheat. The experiments of the late Mr . Farrer in producing wheats specially suited to our climate and natural conditions have already produced results worth many times more than they cost. Federat i o n wheat, and Bobb's wheat, two varieties due solely to his efforts, have brought hundreds of thousands of pounds to our farmers. A great calamity befel Australia when death took Mr Farrer away from the work he loved so much. I was ""brought into intimate relationship with him many years ago, when for a little while I had charge of the Agricultural Department of New.South Wales; and I know with what rare fidelity to his duty his work was done. He did not work for money, and could not be paid for what he did. Indeed, he had begun liis experiments long before the Department got hold of him, and, as I have said, our farmers are today reaping hundreds of thousands of pounds from the results of his self-sacrificing labour. It is work of that kind that we wish to encourage. In time to come Mr Farrer's name will stand high in the records of the world as that of a benefactor of his race. Others who are further away are better able to estimate the worth of such work as his than we who areclose to it are apt to do. Scottish Agricultural Commission, referring to Mr Farrer's experiments, said in their reportThere are a great many varieties of wheat, and beyond"" doubt the nossibilities of wheat raising the Commonwealth have been in a large manner due to Mr W. Farrer, who devoted his life evolving wheats suited to Australian conditions. A whole vista of duties and potentialities opens up when inquiry is made as to what there is to be done in Australia. Everynothing thing that is a pest elsewhere is a pest here, and the means we have taken to eradicate pests have often brought about the introduction of others. Indeed, at the present time there is a controversy as to whether the importation of ferrets should not be prohibited, lest they become a bigger nuisance than the rabbits which they have been brought here to destroy. A phase of the matter to which I draw attention is this: Parliament has been trying by the offer of bounties to stimulate and develop new industries, such as cotton and coffee growing, the production of fibre plants and other tropical products. The Commonwealth Bureau of Agriculture will be very useful if it carries out investigations along scientific lines to show how best to undertake this work. Our idea is to help the States, not to supersede their activity in any way. If they should feel that they can hand over to us special work which we could do better because of our greater facilities, we shall be glad to accept it , and thus bring about economy and improved efficiency. But the first idea is to supplement the work of the States; to take up the higher scientific work and make the knowledge that is obtained readily available to the whole of Australia. I ask the sympathetic and kindly consideration of the House for a very useful measure.",38
350,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"Yarra) [2.53] - I ask the Prime Minister to consent to an adjournment of the debate, so that we may have time to consider his remarks.",39
351,Mr HIGGS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,He has given us no information.,39
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"If the honourable member is not ready to proceed, there may be others who would speak. I cannot consent to the adjournment yet.",39
353,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"We are not likely to have the second reading carried this afternoon, and it is not far from the usual hour for adjournment. The Bill contains The no information. Under it the cost of the proposed Department might be £5,000, or £50,000, or £500,000 a year. We have not been told whether it is possible to make arrangements with the Departin ments of the States for the doing of scientific work. The Prime Minister confused to the work of the Tropical School of Medicine in Townsville with the work that would be undertaken by the proposed Bureau, but the two institutions will have to do with each other. He might as well have said that the proposed Bureau will deal with diseases like small-pox. Of course, it might be possible to attach a laboratory to the Tropical School of Medicine at Townsville for the purpose of making investigations, much in the way in which the well-equipped laboratory at the Customs Department is being used to do certain work for Mr MCAlpine. The Prime Minister twitted us on this side with having no interest in the country districts; but I would remind him that, although Liberal Governments had this measure on the stocks for years, they did nothing to pass it . Without waiting for legislation, the Labour Government made an agreement with the States, under which Mr MCAlpine was engaged to carry out an investigation of the bitter pit disease. That is one of the things for which honourable members do not give us eredit.",39
354,Mr HIGGS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,The Prime Minister would not give the last Government credit for anything.,40
355,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I think that he would, privately. I was in charge of the Department of Trade and Customs when Mr. MCAlpine was appointed. I hope that his work will be crowned with success, because bitter pit causes immense losses, not only to Australian orchardists, but to orchardists elsewhere. The United States of America have spent well over 1,000,000 dollars in trying to get rid of it. The last Government was also responsible for the investigation of the worm nodules that appear in meat. Professor Gilruth was sent by us to Northern Queensland to investigate the subject, and it was due to our efforts that the beef trade of Queensland was saved. Had it gone, the mutton trade would have suffered too, because our unscrupulous competitors were ready to make use of any statement to damage our meat business. A great deal of useful work of this kind can be done without establishing a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau. If we merely add to six sets of professional State officers a seventh set of Commonwealth officers, there will be continual dissension. State officers will not work with Commonwealth officers unless some agreement is come to about their relative spheres of action.",40
356,Mr BENNETT,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Why do they not quarrel in America?,40
357,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I do not know; but professional men-chemists , bacteriologists, entomologists and others-ar e very jealous of their reputations, aud each assumes that he knows more than his fellows.",40
358,Mr FOWLER,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,The best scientific men of the world are above such feelings.,40
359,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,I should like to think so.,40
360,Mr AHEBN,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,The university professors of the different States work harmoniously together.,40
361,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"The position of matters might change if a Commonwealth university were established to do the same work that the State institutions are doing. I do not know that the States are willing to give up any of their powers. My view has always been that work of the kind to be done by the Bureau could be done more effectively by one body than by six, and the States are beginning already to cooperate to some degree. For instance, Victoria, finding it difficult to keep Mr. Elwood Mead, one of the best experts in his line, is seeking to co-operate with New South Wales for the retention of his services. No doubt, if the States find that they can save money by handing over work to the Commonwealth, they will do that; but their Departments are desirous of keeping as much as possible in their own hands, and will be ready to complain if the Commonwealth Bureau is started without consultation with them, and without an agreement with them. The Prime Minister has stated that if we establish the proposed Agricultural Bureau it will be able to take charge of the quarantining of fruit and vegetables passing from State to State. That is absolutely absurd. This Bureau of Agriculture could not undertake any of the quarantine functions which are referred to in section 112 of the Constitution, and which are defined in the Quarantine Act itself.",40
362,Mr SAMPSON,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,The Prime Minister did not say that the Agricultural - Bureau would take over the inspection laws which are now administered by the States.,40
363,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,He said something very much like it .,40
364,Mr SAMPSON,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I understood him to refer only to the quarantining of plants, and not to the inspection laws.",40
365,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"The honourable member for Franklin made an interjection in regard to quarantine functions, and I understood the Prime Minister to say that these could be undertaken by the proposed Bureau. I admit that the honourable gentleman found himself in a dimcult position this afternoon, owing to the absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is at present with the British parliamentary party which is visiting Australia. I-regret that the head of the Government should have declined to grant me an adjournment of the debate, because the subject with which we are dealing is an extremely large one. The Bill before us contains only two important clauses, and yet it may involve the Commonwealth in an expenditure of £5,000 or £500,000 a year. I think we should know definitely to what we are committing ourselves. We should be told whether the proposed Bureau will have its headquarters here, or in the Federal Capital, or in the Northern Territory; and whether it will have branches throughout Australia. I do hope that the Bill w i ll not be rushed through the House this afternoon. It is altogether too important; and I do not think that such a procedure would be fair to members of the Opposition, who are just as much interested in this question as are the supporters of the Government. The action which the late Government took in connection with bitter pit, and worm nodules in beef, shows that they were thoroughly alive to the importance of this question. The Bill should not be passed before we know whether the. States will co-operate with us in this work.",40
366,Mr RODGERS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,There can be no conflict when there is no work being done at the present time.,41
367,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"If the work of the prothe Bill? posed Bureau is to be confined to the laboratory, we have a right to be told that. I think we should be told how much it is intended to expend on this Bureau during the first two or three years of its existence. I am aware that in Queensland, which seems to be specially affected by pests such as the cane grub, and the worm nodule in beef, some of the best scientific work might be done. take it that a portion of the work which is now being undertaken by the Commerce Department might with advantage be transferred to this Department. withstanding that we are doing a trade in beef and mutton with Great Britain and the Continent, amounting to £4,000,000 annually, it is a fact that, until Mr , Cherry was appointed by the late Govern[35] ment two years ago, we never had a representative there to look after our interests.",41
368,Mr SAMPSON,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,Would the honourable member place the whole of the export powers under our Commerce Act in the hands of the Bureau of Agriculture?,41
369,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"I do not know. But I say that in our Commerce Department we have practically the nucleus of an Agricultural Department. A great amount of work is being carried out by the Commerce Department in seeing that our exports are free from deleterious sub Department, and the analytical work is  rose, not for the purpose of opposing the Bill , but of asking for further information.",41

373,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"Yes , and I recollect that he never adopted my suggestion. One or two honourable members were caught in that way, but not the present Honorary Minister. The general principle underlying the Bill is that we should establish a bureau to carry out invest!- gatory work concerning many of the pests with which we are afflicted today.",41

375,Mr TUDOR,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"Yes ; but I think we ought to know whether any arrangement can be made with the States to prevent overlapping.

I have been accused of desiring to obstruct the passing of a certain measure. Prime Minister told me that there were no politics in the Agricultura l Bureau Bill so far as I am concerned. I wish again to place before the Prime Minister a proposal that he should select from the M in isterial programme such subjects as the Agricultural Bureau Bill , the consolidation of the States debts, the establishment of a general Works Department, the Bill dealing with the transfer of Norfolk Island to the Commonwealth, the question of life and fire insurance regulations, the Bankruptcy Bill , and Offences against the Commonwealth Bill , and proceed to deal with these matters, which are of a practical and non-contentious character. Honourable members upon this side of the Chamber will offer no obstruction to the passing of the measure which has been discussed this afternoon. But in the Government programme there are about fifteen other measures of a violently contentious character, and if they are to be proceeded with nothing will be done. If the Prime Minister meant anything when he said that he was going to appeal to the patriotism of honourable members on both sides of the House to carry on the business of the country he will recognise the wisdom of immediately proceeding with the non-contentious measures I have indicated. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And help him.",42
377,Mr HIGGS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,We will help him to do the business for which the country is waiting. That is the proposal which I submit to the Prime Minister. I do not know whether I am to get any information on the subject this afternoon. haps it would be better if I placed the matter on the business-paper in the form of a question.,42
378,Mr MATHEWS,LETTERS POSTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS,"Melbourne Ports) [3.14] - I have no wish to charge the Public Service Commissioner with endeavouring to do something that he ought POSTAL not to do. But I understand that it is his desire to introduce postal mechanics into the Commonwealth. It is idle for any one to tell me that we have not in Australia mechanics who can carry out any work that the Department may require. We have in the engineering trade men who are competent to do anything required in this respect. The Prime M in ister, according to the newspaper reports, said he would be sorry if it were found necessary to take this action; and I hope The that the Public Service Commissioner will not be allowed to do anything in this regard until the tradesmen of Australia have had an opportunity to assert themselves, and to show that they can do the work required by the Department. It is also peculiar that the Government intend, so I am informed, to introduce mechanics from the Old Country to fit up machinery for the woollen mills at Geelong. I do not know whether it is a case of the immigration question being always uppermost in their minds; but I should like to know whether the intention is to bring out, to fit up this machinery, men who, as soon as the work has been carried out, will be thrown on the labour market of Australia. Is that what is proposed, or are these men to be made members of the permanent staff? There are already in Australia men who can look after such machinery, and do the work well. It may be necessary to introduce a leading hand to deal with some new features of the machinery; but it is an undoubted fact that we have here men who are quite capable of erecting machinery for woollen mills, and of looking after it when it has been erected. There are men here who have done such work. I do not like the introduction of this system. We had something of the sort done by the late Government in connection with the Defence we will Department; and if the practice is to be continued, I shall be inclined to believe that officers of the Department are deter. mined that Australians shall be given no opportunity in connection with works under their control. I have nothing to say against men coming from the Old Per- Country, for, no doubt, they would be highly capable mechanics and good citizens; but I would point out that the labour market in respect of the engineering trade is already overcrowded. I represent a constituency in which there are many engineering works; and I know that, both in my own electorate aa well as in other parts of the Commonwealth, at the banks. we have highly-skilled men in all trades. I hope that the Government will see Australians are given an opportunity show that they have the ability to do work.",42
