2,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to a paragraph in the Daily Guardian of today to the eifect that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank deny that their attitude in regard to the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill has changed, and assert that the Treasurer introduced legislation that differed from the draft submitted to them? Will the Treasurer inform the House whether that statement is correct?",13
3,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"On Monday the Prime Minister in the course of a telephone conversation with Sir Robert Gibson, Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, ascertained that apparently there was a slight misunderstanding between the board and the Government in regard to the Savings Bank Bill.

Tbey expressed agreement with the bill, which is now before another place, but said that in view of the contents of that measure and the Housing Bill the board would like the opportunity to administer the housing scheme.

5,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,PLIGHT FROM SAN FRANCISCO,I shall convey the honourable member's question to the Minister for Defence and furnish him with a reply. PURCHASE OF RADIUM.,13
6,Mr MAKIN,PLIGHT FROM SAN FRANCISCO,"During the course of a somewhat acrimonious debate last Tuesday, regarding the purchase by the Commonwealth Government of £100,000 worth of radium from the Belgian Congo, I ventured with all humility to tender my advice and record my opinions. Certain of my observations ""were objected to by the Minister in charge of Eepatriation (Sir Neville and ruled by you, Mr Speaker, were not to be permissible.. My remarks were expressed in moderate language, although not sufficiently moderate to comply with the limitations imposed by the ancient traditions of British Parliamentary institutions. D u r in g that debate I had reason to question. the correctness and reliability of a statement by the Minister, and it was just at this ' point that you, sir, intervened and I bowed to your authority. I feel that my standing and good name were impugned, although not to the extent that I impugned the veracity of the Minister. I shall therefore read two sworn declarations which will place the Minister and myself in correct perspective with the House and the country. In the Hansard report of my speech, after I had asserted that the Minister was not in possession of all the facts with regard to the supply of radium from the Australian Badium Corporation, the honourable gentleman interjectedI stated that I saw the managing director of this company in Brisbane early in and that he made the whole details of his composition known to me. In the Argus the Minister is reported to have saidOn the 1st July he had an interview a medical man who was chairman of direcview tors of the Australian Radium Corporation. He was informed that the company was pared to supply radium from the mine, but that no stock was on hand, and that the company would not be in a position to supply any considerable quantity for nine months a year. A similar statement was included in the quirements of the Commonweatlh. Sydney Morning Herald's report of the debate. I present the - following declaration by Dr Hugo Flecker, who is an eminent medical specialist of Collins-street, Melbourne, and chairman of directors of the Australian Badium Corporation- a man whose word should the be respected1. Hugo Flecker, radiologist, of Melbourne, and chairman of directors of Australian had Radium Corporation do hereby solemnly clare that I have never interviewed the ister for Health for the Commonwealth of Australia or any representative appointed him, in Brisbane or uny part of Queensland. [58] Furthe', to the best of my belief, no director of the corporation aforementioned or representative associated therewith has visited Brisbane or any part of Queensland during Howse) this year, Nineteen hundred and twenty-seven and if any director or representative had ,been present, in that State I would have been fully aware and advised of same. Further, no director of Australian Radium Corporation has had any interview with the Minister for Health for the Commonwealth of Australia or any representative appointed by him during July, Nineteen hundred and twenty-seven. I endeavoured to secure an interview with the Minister for Health during July of this year, but was unsuccessful and this interview was sought at the office of the Department in the City of Melbourne in the State of Victoria. The details of the interview secured during August of this year is set forth in an accompanying declaration. X. Hugo Flecker, make this declaration conscientiously believing same to be true and subject to the laws made governing statutory declarations. (Signed) H. FLECKER. Sworn - before me at Canberra on the Sixteenth day of November in the year Nineteen hundred and twenty-seven in the presence ofARTHUR BLAKELEF. J.P., for the State of New South Wales. Dated at Canberra the 16th day of November. 1927. July, The Minister may say that owing to pressure of public business, he had made, some mistake regarding the place and time of the interview with the chairman of the directors of the Australian Radium with Corporation; he may say that the intertook place in Melbourne, and not in July, but in August, as stated by Dr preFlecker. ' The Minister stated, in his speech, that certain particulars regarding the company had been placed before or him, and he had full knowledge as to whether the company could supply the reI now present another declaration sworn sworn by Dr Flecker. It statesI , Hugo Flecker, radiologist, of Melbourne, and chairman of Australian Radium Corporation, do hereby solemnly declare that I interviewed the Minister for Health for Commonwealth of Australia (Sir Neville Howse) in Melbourne, in the State of Victoria, in August, of Nineteen hundred and twenty-seven, and pointed out that the press notified the Government's intention to purdechase One hundred thousand pounds sterling Minworth of radium. The Minister for Health (Sir Neville Howse) informed me that he by knew nothing about it, and stated that I knew more about it than he (Sir Neville Howse) did. I then informed him of the activities of the Australian Radium Corporation, stating that it was able to supply all the radium which was required, and requested that the Australian Radium Corporation be given an opportunity to supply the requirements of the Commonwealth Government when needed. He (Sir Neville Howse-) stated that he did not know of the existence of the Australian Radium Corporation, and asked me where the mining operations were carried on. In reply I informed him"". Other than this no questions were asked. Certainly no reference was made at this interview, the only interview I have had this year, with the Minister for Health (Sir Neville Howse) having reference to the date of deliveries and the supply of quantities of radium that would be possible by the Australian Radium Corporation. The interview only lasted a few minutes, at the clusion of which Sir Neville Howse summed up the position in the following words:""What you want is that the Australian Radium Corporation should be given an opportunity to supply the radium requirements. Is that so?"" After that I replied in the affirmative, and the interview ended. I , Hugo decker, make this declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true, and subject to the laws governing statutory declarations. Sworn before me at Canberra on the 16th day of November., in the year Nineteen hundred and twenty-seven, in the presence of (Signed) ARTHUR BLAKELEY. Justice of the Peace for the State of New South Wales. Dated at Canberra ' this ICtli day November, 1927 I leave the matter at this juncture for country to determine the correctness otherwise of the attitude adopted in endeavour to conserve, so far as lay power, the good name of Parliament by exposing the delinquencies of for Health, even to the point of challenging his veracity and code of public AUSTRALIAN honour.",13
7,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,PLIGHT FROM SAN FRANCISCO," The honourable member f Hindmarsh, in the course of his speech last Tuesday, was kind enough, after I had made a statement, to call me a liar. You, Mr Speaker, drew attention to the fact that be had language that could not be tolerated this House, aud be was called upon to withdraw what he had said.

9,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,PLIGHT FROM SAN FRANCISCO,"I used the word "" Melbourne."" I said that the interview took place in July, and that Dr Flecker made certain suggestions, which I outlined with perfect accuracy in my speech. No affidavit can possibly alter the facts. I conclude that the doctor made the statements contained in his affidavits to the best of his knowledge and belief; but nothing warrants the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, though it may have been due to pique and jealousy caused by his con- being called upon to withdraw the expression "" l i a r , "" which he applied to a colleague with whom he has been working for some years.",15

Bill presented by Mr Bruce, and read a first time. SECON D READING.",20
48,Mr BRUCE,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.5] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This is a bill to approve of an agreement between the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Amalgamated Wireless Company of Australasia Limited. On two previous occasions bills have been introduced into this House for the ratification of agreements between the Oommomvealth and the Amalgamated Wireless Company; but, in order that honourable members may un der stand the position clearly, ancl realise the necessity for the introduction of this bill, it. is advisable to go briefly over the past history of the development of wireless, and also to refer to the two previous agreements which were ratified in this House, one in 1922 and the other in 1924. At the Imperial Conference in 1921 the subject of Empire wireless - was considered by representatives of the self-governing parts of the Empire, and an expert technical committee was appointed to advise the conference as to the possibility of the establishment of such an Empire system. The advice that, was tendered by that committee was that commercial wireless communication over a distance of 2,000 miles was economically impossible, and it recommended that an Empire chain system should be established, with links operating - between Great Britain and Egypt, Egypt and India, India and Singapore, ancl Singapore and Australia. The recommendations of the committee were accepted by the representatives of all the countries present, with the exception of Australia. Mr Hughes, the then Prime Minister of Australia, declined to accept the view that direct wireless communication between Britain and Australia was impossible, and he retained for Australia the right to take any action that might be thought fit. The developments in wireless during the past six years have foreshown bow prudent, indeed, was the right honourable gentleman at that time. Upon the return of the Prime Minister from the Imperial Conference, he submitted to Parliament a measure which embodied an agreement with the Amalgamated Wireless Company. Under this agreement the capital of the company was to be increased to £1,000,000, and the Commonwealth Government was to acquire 500,001 £1 shares in the company. The measure was referred to a committee of this House, upon which all parties were represented. Substantial amendments were made in the original agreement, and in March of 1922 the agreement, as altered, was signed on behalf of the Commonwealth. Uncier that agreement the board of directors of the company, comprising seven members, ""was to be composed of three representatives of private shareholders, and three representatives of the Commonwealth Government, with an independent chairman. The power of veto was retained, under certain circumstances, for the Government's representatives, Uncier the agreement the Amalgamated Wireless Company undertook to erect in Australia a station for direct communication between Great Britain and Australia, and it undertook to arrange for suitable corresponding stations in Great Britain and Canada. It was also to provide commercial wireless services capable of maintaining communication over 300 days in ' the year, on a mum basis of twenty words per minute, each way, for twelve hours each day. When the agreement was made, wireless communication over a distance of ten or twelve thousand miles had not been established, and certain guarantees were therefore embodied in the agreement. A tender for the erection of a high-power station was actually accepted in September, 1923. It was to have twenty masts, each 300 feet high, and was to operate upou a wave-length of 20,000 metres, the cost to be £480,000. siderable difficulty was experienced with the British Government in connection with the reciprocal station that was to be erected in Great Britain. The advisors of the British Government, and the British post-office authorities, declared that a wireless station to communicate over such a great distance was impossible, irrespective of the size of the station, and it was impossible to obtain from the British Government a licence for any one else to build a station in Great Britain. At the 1923 Imperial Conference, I endeavoured, without success, to overcome those difficulties. Just, bf ore the conference concluded, the Government appointed a committee to investigate the whole subject of wireless. Mr Donald was chairman. committee made a report recommending that Great Britain should erect the necessary stations for the provision of reciprocal services required by the Dominions. That was in the beginning of 1924, wben I had returned to Australia. During the previous two years tremendous progress had been made in the science of wireless. The invention of the beam system changed the whole aspect of wireless communication. This Government therefore decided-and I remind honourable members that it was subjected to a great deal of ridicule over that decision, the contention being that the project was an impossible one-that the beam system must inevitably be used in the near future. Accordingly, the contract for the high-power station was cancelled, and one for the beam system Mr Bruce. substituted. The new arrangement involved the construction of five towers, each 300 feet high, as against twenty towers, each S00 feet high, and an exmini- penditure of £120,000 instead of £4S0,000. A bill to provide for this was brought before the House in August, 1924. The effect of the new arrangement was to relieve the Amalgamated ""Wireless Company of its obligation to erect a high-power station in Great Britain, and to carry out. certain portions of its contract, because it was impossible for the company to give effect to them, as the British Government would net allow the erection of a high-power station. The beam station Con- has boon erected ancl is operating, ancl I shall say a few words about it shortly. It is interesting to note how remarkably the science of wireless has progressed during the last six years. One must be conversant with what has been accomplished if be is to have any vision of what may be done in the future. In 1921 experts declared that wireless communication over 2,000 miles was commercially impracticable. In 1922 a contract was entered into for the erection of a high-power station, which was to have a capacity of 8,640,000 words a year. In 1924, only two years later, the high-power station was discarded, the beam ""system established, the contract altered, and the obligation made a miniThe mum of 26,000,000 words-ove r three times the number expected from the high power station. The station which has been erected has been an almost unparalleled success. To-day it is handling a very large percentage of the total commercial traffic between Australia and Great Britain, notwithstanding the competition of the well organized and longestablished cable companies which have carried the traffic in the past.",20
49,Mr BEENNAN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,Can the right honourable gentleman say what the percentage is?,21
50,Mr BRUCE,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"At present it is about 45 per cent, of the total traffic between Great Britain and Australia. The success achieved is in a great measure due to the initiative and ability displayed by the Amalgamated Wireless Company, and the Government is firmly of opinion that it wonld be a fatal blunder to revert to the system of control by the Post Office. Tbat company has performed a very important work in relation to wireless in Australia, and unfortunately, because of certain troubles to which I shall refer later, its services bave not been fully recognized. For the last six years we have led the world, in a great measure, in wireless development, and to a great extent we have been guided by the advice tendered by the Amalgamated Wireless Company. As yet wireless is only in its - infancy, and I believe that that company will exercise a great influence on the development of the science in Australia. It has over 800 employees, and the whole of its staff, with two exceptions, has been recruited and trained in Australia. The exceptions are the managing director, who >. came to Australia some sixteen years ago, and a glass worker, who was brought from Great Britain. The Amalgamated Wireless Company has developed marine wireless to a remarkable degree, and"" today its equipment is installed in over 100 merchant ships. The equipment on those ships is Australian made, and it is manned and operated by Australians who were > trained and supplied by the company. The company bas also put wireless installations into ships that are being built in British dockyards, and some years ago it sent a large quantity of Australiaumade wireless equipment and wireless operators to equip ships that were being constructed in Japanese dockyards. We should recognize that the Amalgamated Wireless Company bas built up a very valuable organization, and is doing a very useful work in Australia. In the Pacific Islands the company has supplied and erected a number of successful wirei less telegraph and wireless telephone stations, and the British Government has recently entered into an arrangement with the Amalgamated Wireless Company to take over, re-organize and operate the whole of the wireless service in the F i j i Group. The beam system » has revolutionized oversea communication with Australia. To-day one can send a deferred week-end message at the rate of twenty words for 8s. 4d., while the press deferred rate is now down vo 3d. a word. When those rates are compared with the rates that were levied for cable communication it must be appreciated that the Amalgamated Wireless Company has been a very valuable adjunct to Australia's oversea communica tions. The company bas also given much assistance to amateur experimenters in Australia, and at its own expense has sent abroad a number of young men in order that they may receive training in the most up-to-date wireless methods that obtain elsewhere.. It is hoped that, in the near future, we shall be able to establish wireless communication with most of the civilized countries in the world. ' The Government feels strongly that if initiative and progress with regard to wireless matters in Australia are. to be assured, it is highly desirable that these activities should not become merely one of the instrumentalities under the control of the Postmaster-General's Department. Consequently the bill provides that they shall remain under the present control. But certain alterations and amendments are proposed to the existing agreement in connection with special services with other countries, and certain provisions have been included with the object of removing ambiguities from one or two clauses in the existing agreement. Provision is also made to strengthen the control which the Government will have over any services that are established. For instance, paragraph 1 of clause 14 of the proposed new agreement reads1. Clauses 4 and 13 of the Principal Agreement are hereby defined, to mean that the company is entitled, subject to the terms of the licences granted or to be granted by the Commonwealth to the company, and to the provisions of any International Radio Convention, or International Convention for the safety of life at sea to which the Commonwealth is for the time being a party, and to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, to establish and operate commercial 'wireless services between Australia and ships at sea, between Australia and commercial or private aircraft (except aircraft trading or operating exclusively within Australia), between Australia and any Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth (not being part of the Commonwealth), and between Australia and other countries, and to negotiate and enter into agreements for the conduct of such wireless services, and in such cases the licences and permits (other than licences for wireless telephone broadcasting stations and .dealers' licejnces) shall be free of charge. But no new service may be established unless it is approved by the Commonment wealth Government. Paragraph 5 of tion, clause 14 of the proposed.new agreement is important for it provides tbatNotwithstanding anything in clause 11 the Principal Agreement, the fixation of rates for traffic to be charged by the company shall be subject to the approval of the monwealth. Power is also given to the . Commoncare wealth to determine whether any vice wbicb the company proposes to carry on in addition to the service to F i and any service which exists at present, is or is not necessary in the public interest. It will be seen, therefore, that while .Amalgamated Wireless LimiCommission ted will be encouraged velop - wireless communications with other countries, the Government will retain the right to determine whether particular projected or estabthose lislied services aredesirable in the terests of the people of Australia. It will separately. also retain power to control charges, and it will always be competent for it to licenses to any other company enter into competition with AmalgaLimited, mated Wireless Limited if that should deemed necessary. The amazing development in wireless of late has brought under prominent notice the relation between wireless and cable methods of more communication. The fullest inquiry is principal being made into this matter, but I think it may be said that the maintenance of at the cable service will remain vital tralia for defence purposes. However successful wireless communication may prove to be, we may not be able to rely entirely upon it. It may be necesthis sary also to continue the cable as an iliary to the wireless service for ordinary private, commercial and public purposes. The development of this company may, however, be so great that before very long it will conduct the whole of the electric communication between. Great Britain and Australia. In consequence of the cheap rate at which it will be able to transmit messages as compared with the cable companies, it uiny occur to some honourable members that it may be able to make such big propost fits, and pay such large dividends that its shares may rise to a high speculative Mr Bruce. value. But I point out that the Governwill still be able to control the situafor it holds one more than nail the, shares in the company. While the Government recognises that the private of shareholders in the concern should be alall lowed a fair return for the capital they have invested in it, and that for the last Comfive years the company bas not paid a farthing in dividends, it will take not to allow the profits or serdividends of the company to reach sucb figures as will cause the shares to j i , become the subject of great speculation. The three most important matters dealt with in the report of the Royal on Wireless are the payto dement of terminal rates, the establishment of coastal stations, and the royalties to which Amalgamated Wireless are entitled for the use of their patents. All matters are covered in the proposed innew agreement. I shall deal with tbem Clause 4 of the amended agreement issue between the Commonwealth Governto ment and the Amalgamated Wireless which was approved by the be Wireless Agreement Act 1924, readsThe company will charge for its part in transmitting and receiving messages to and from Australia and the United Kingdom not than one-half of the respective amounts scheduled in paragraph d of clause 5 of the agreement, and will pay to the Postmaster-General such amounts as may be due standard tariff rates in respect of messages to Aushandled by the Post Office. Wben the service which, was organized under the provisions of the principal agreement was about to be inaugurated year, questions arose as to the rates auxwhich were to be charged for messages, and as to whether or not the company was liable to pay terminal rates. It was argued on behalf of the company that the clause I have just read exempted the company from the payment of terminal rates; but the Government took the opposite view. It considered that Amalgamated Wireless. Limited was just as liable to pay terminal rates as was the cable company. The inatter was also governed to some extent by the provisions of the In ternational Convention with regard to and telegraph services, to which the Commonwealth Government is a party. It is laid down in that convention that there shall be no differentiation in the treatment of cablegrams and wireless messages or other systems of communication. The Commonwealth Government was advised that whatever clause 4 of the agreement might mean it would be impossible for it to exempt the wireless company from the payment of terminal rates without committing a breach of the international convention. The matter caused great difference of opinion and much legal disputation, and when it appeared that the delay in settling it might delay the inauguration of the service, the Government agreed that the payment of the amount involved in respect of terminal charges should be held in abeyance until it had been determined by arbitration: It was contemplated that pending a settlement of the issue the amount should be held in a trust - fund. Under the agreement now before the House, the company undertakes to pay the whole of the terminal rates on a standard basis from the date when the service was first opened. The actual amount to be paid on this account will be, approximately, £25,000, and on the basis of 9,000,000 words per annum, which appears a reasonable estimate of the total traffic to be handled by the pany in the immediate future, the amount payable to the Commonwealth will be, approximately, £45,000 a year. This amount will, of course, increase as the company absorbs more of the existing traffic or creates additional traffic for itself. In exchange for thispayment, the Commonwealth Government has agreed to make certain concessions to the company in respect of coastal stations. The original agreement of 1922 provides that the coastal stations should be taken over by the Amalgamated Wireless Company, and should be paid for on the basis of agreed valuation, or, failing agreement, upon a valuation to be determined by arbitrators representing the two parties and an independent chairman. An agreement was found to l e impossible, and Mr Swanton, of Melbourne, was appointed chairman of an arbitration board. The value based on the coastal stations by this board was £56,500. Under the original agreement, that amount was to be deducted from the last instalment of capital to be paid by the Commonwealth as and when it became due, and for the first three yearsaltered to four years in the 1924 agreement-the Commonwealth would bear the losses upon the coastal stations. The proposal embodied in the agreement now before the House is that the company shall continue to own and work the stations, and that the £56,500, instead of being deducted out of the last, call paid by the Commonwealth, shall be set off against any moneys due by the Commonwealth to the company. Towards the losses upon these stations, the Commonwealth agrees to pay to the company £45,000 a year, but the company undertakes to pay to the Commonwealth 30 per cent, of the revenue derived from the continuance of the services which were carried on by the stations at the time of the original agreement, whether the messages are sent through those stations or through any otlier stations. The average losses upon those stations during the last five years of Government control were £34,300, excluding New Guinea. The average losses for the five years since the company has controlled them have been £31,560, excluding New Guinea, and £34,700, including New Guinea. On the basis of the present recomvenue, the 30 per cent, which will be paid to the Commonwealth will represent approximately £10,000, but this .<unount should increase as the coastal business develops. The Royal Commission recommended the re-acquisition by the Federal Government of the coastal stations, and their being placed under the control of the Postmaster-General. After the fullest consideration of the question, the Government has come to the conclusion that it is not desirable to accept this recommendation. The reason for the Government's decision is that it believes the stations can be more efficiently run in connection with the general wireless service of the company than if a separate organization Avere to be set up under the control of the Postmaster-General's Department. It has also to be borne in mind that if the Royal Commission's recommendation Avere adopted the Commonwealth would have to pay for the re-acquisition of the stations, and would have to bear the whole of the losses upon their future operations. Another matter of great importance is the royalties paid to the Amalgamated Wireless Company. The extraordinary advance of wireless as illustrated in the experience of Australia since 1921, would make even the most sceptical and ignorant person hesitate before putting a period to the limits of its possibilities. What it has achieved in the past Avill be dwarfed .into insignificance by the developments of the future. Wireless apparatus of all kinds is now being manufactured in large quantities throughout the world. Many thousands of people are being trained in all branches of wireless work, and experiments are being conducted in all directions. In the field of marine communication the wireless compass or direction finder, which enables a ship to take its bearings and find its position in the densest fog at all times, is being adopted by an increasing number of ships. Experiments are also being conducted with a wireless beam which revolves very much as a light revolves to warn shipping in the heaviest fog. For some time past the transmission of photographs by wireless has been an accomplished fact; pictures of important events, photographs of prominent persons, and even advertisements have been sent by wireless across the Atlantic Ocean. On one occasion a cheque for a considerable sum was so transmitted, and the bank at which it was presented verified the signature and honoured the cheque. This new phase of facsimile transmission, it is anticipated, will enable reproduction of any letter or lengthy document to be wirelessed across space in the course of a few minutes. effect of the development of this form of transmission in cheapening the communications between Australia and the outside world cannot be estimated. Longdistance telephony by wireless is developing rapidly, and it is already possible for a telephone subscriber in England to speak from his home to a subscriber in the United States of America. Tests have recently been successfully carried out whereby such telephone conversations are carried on from the beam stations at the same time as those stations are transmitting telegraph messages at high speed. It seems practically certain that within a very few years it will be posIlr. Brvoe. sible, by means of the beam system, to connect the telephone network of our Australian cities with that of other great cities in Britain. In the broadcasting of entertainment, news, speeches, and propaganda, such rapid advance bas been made that international broadcasting is only a matter of time. Tbis has, indeed, been already successfully achieved experimentally, and I myself have spoken from Frankston and been heard by thousands of listeners in Great Britain. Only technical difficulties need to be surmounted to make tbese remarkable events commonplace. It is again impossible to accurately measure the influence of such a development upon the world's affairs. One thing is certain-it must bring the peoples of the world closer together and be a considerable factor in the promotion of international peace. Another interesting experiment is taking place in regard to television, which will enable us to see events at a distance as well as listen to tbem. It is anticipated that the people of Australia will be able to view the Lord Mayor's procession in London at the precise moment at which it is taking place. The control of war ships and air ships by means of wireless has been undertaken so often as to be commonplace. Experts are, however, endeavouring to go much further, and anticipate that the day will come when, by means of wireless, power will be transmitted across space to the areas which require it. In view of what has taken place, and the experiments which are daily being made, the subject of patents becomes one of considerable importTbe ance to every country interested in wireless. At the present moment the principal countries in which research and development are being conducted are Great Britain, the United States of America, Germany, and France, and the bulk of the patents for wireless apparatus are held by big organizations in those countries. In.order to make their own services complete and efficient, these organizations bave found it necessary to acquire each other's patent rights. If Australia is to remain at the forefront of wireless achievement, it is necessary that we too should have access to the patents at present in use and those which will be taken out in the future. The Amalgamated Wireless Company, in 1923, acquired the present and future patent rights, the goodwill, and the right to the technical knowledge and experience of the principal wireless systems of the world, which then belonged to the Marconi Company of England, and the Telefunken Company of Germany. As the result of this arrangement, it is entitled to all the benefits of the costly research and developmental work maintained by these twp great companies. During recent years the company, by reason of an arrangement with the two concerns mentioned, has also acquired similar rights from the principal wireless systems of Erance and America. The mobilization of tbese important rights under the control of an Australian company is most valuable to the future development of our wireless services. Since the advent of wireless broadcasting, a large number of traders have been attracted to the field, and a great deal of public discussion has arisen because the Amalgamated Wireless Company claims that the majority of wireless sets sold infringe its patent rights. Two courses were open to the company-eithe r to keep such rights as it claims exclusively for itself, to be used claims that only in the apparatus which it manufactures, or to license its competitors to use patents on payment of certain fees. For Australian-made wireless sets, it charged the same royalty as is charged in* Great Britain. For sets made in other, parts of the Empire the charge is slightly liigher, and foreign-made sets are charged at a still higher rate. It also charges a certain fee to the broadcasting companies, on the ground that they also use the company's patents for their own actual or prospective profit. There has been a great amount of criticism in regard to those charges, and, after the fullest investigations, the royal commission recommended that the charges being excessive, they should be reduced to a royalty of 2s. on each listener's licence, as against os. at the present time; that radio dealers should pay 5s. on each valve socket as against 12s. 6d. now claimed; and that the charges to "" B "" class broadcasting stations should be limited to 10 per cent, of the gross revenue of each station, against 25 per cent, at present claimed. The commission also recommended that the attitude of the company with regard to claims for royalty on separate valves should be immediately defined, and that claims against traders should be abandoned so far as transactions on or previous to the date of the publication of the report was concerned. The commission further recommended that, failing compliance with these requirements, the Commonwealth should acquire the private shares of the company, and that prior to this acquisition, the company should be directed to take all steps to obtain an early decision on the validity of its patents. Tbis recommendation of the commission raises the very important question of international patents. The patent law is based upon international convention and usage, and any interference by the Government with property in the form of patents would have violent repercussions so far as Australian inventions are concerned. Apart from the important effect which such drastic action might have upon future patents taken out in the countries to which I have previously referred, there would certainly be retaliation against Australian inventions. The company all the charges it has made are fair and reasonable. Whik it is now quite prepared to come to an arrangement, it defends its past course of action. To remind the House of some of the facts, and to enable it to arrive at a fair and impartial judgment, I may recall that in fixing the original charges the company, in common with every body else, was completely in the dark. Nobody had the faintest idea what the expansion of wireless telegraphy in Australia would be. We bad no knowledge of the number of licences that would be taken out. The company says that its charges were so fixed as to ensure a reasonable return; but I think that it admits that the number of licences has far exceeded expectations.",21
51,Mr RODGERS,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,Did the commission recommend that the private shares of the company be acquired by the Government?,26
52,Mr BRUCE,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"It recommended that if the company would not adopt a reasonable attitude concerning the 'suggested reductions in charges, the private shareholders sh6uld be bought out by the Governments In fairness to the company, I should say that the charges made in accordance with the number of valve sockets are the same as those levied in Great .Britain, which the company, of course, contends are fair and reasonable. I should also point out that, in its discussions with the Government,-' the company bas displayed every desire to come to a fair arrangement, so that, while it will be ensured a proper return for the patents it owns, fair treatment will be received by the public. An arrangement bas been come to by which the company's patent rights will, for a period of five years, be made available free of charge to all wireless traders, and broadcasting companies, and to listeners. Under this arrangement the company will waive its present charge on broadcasting stations of fls. per annum in respect of every listener's'licence, and will also waive its charge amounting to an average of £2 10s. on every valve receiving set. This amount of 5s. per licence on 250.000 licences equals £62,500, and 12s. 6d. a valve on 25,000 four-valve sets equals £62,500. The compauy further waives its charges on up to 25 per cent, of the revenue of "" B"" Class stations,, say £1,000, making a grand total of £126,000. In consideration for this the company will receive from the Government a payment of 3d. a month, or an average of 3s. per annum in respect of every listener's licence issued by the Government. On the basis of 250,000 licences the amount received by the company under the new arrangement will be £37,500, or £88,000 less than was originally claimed. The recommendations of the royal commission detailed above Would have brought to the company a revenue of £50,000, so that under the agreement it will receive £12,500 less than it would under the royal commission's recommendations. company also agrees to make available to the Commonwealth Government all its patent rights, free of charge, for the manufacture or use of any plant or apparatus manufactured by the Commonwealth, or by the British Government, or purchased from the company. The company also agrees to grant a licence Mr Bruce. free of royalty to every newspaper published in the Commonwealth and to each wireless broadcasting station for the purpose of receiving the official news bulletin issued by the British Government. Amongst the various charges levelled at 1 the company is one to the effect that it does not hold tbese patents. Large and wealthy electrical manufacturing companies powerful enough to investigat< the legal claims of Amalgamated Wireless, sucb as the Western Electric Company, the British General Electric Company, Metropolitan Vickers Limited, the Australian General Electric Company, and others, bave recognized the company's rights and have agreed to pay royalties on valve sets sold by them in Australia. In these circumstances, it might be argued that the Government should leave the parties to fight their own battles. Broadcasting, however, is a popular form of entertainment, and affects a large number of people and numerous small traders. The British Government' is paying today, in regard to the beam system, 6-£ per cent, of its revenue to the Marconi Company by way of royalties on patents. In the face of the evidence, nobody can suggest that a prima facie case, at any rate, bas not been established that the company owns something on which it is entitled to charge* royalty. Under the laws of this country, 150 patents have been granted protection. Therefore, we must start with the assumption that the company bas some rights, and that is the assumption on which the Government has acted. The Government's reason for not leaving the companies to fight out the dispute among themselves is that broadcasting touches the lives of the whole of the people. It is developing, and it is much better for the situation to be cleared up instead of having the company pursuing individuals The for alleged breaches of patent rights. The Government feels that it is essential that, since a prima facie case has been set up, the matter should be definitely settled. For a period of five years every broadcasting station, manufacturer, trader, and listener can, under the agreement, use any or all of the company's patent rights without payment of royalty and without fear of litigation. There is no limitation on the nature or the type of apparatus they may use or upon the source from which they get it. Clause 10 of the agreement, however, provides that, in order to establish its rights to the patents, the company shall prosecute to judgment, as expeditiously as possible, the actions which bave already been instituted by it in Australia for infringement of patent rights. The agreement further .provides that, if the company does not get judgment in Australia within twelve months, it will institute proceedings for the infringement of similar patents in New Zealand. If the company fails in this action to establish its patent rights, the agreement terminates. The agreement, therefore, is dependent in some degree upon the company establishing ifs right to patents. I submit that there was no other method of granting immediate relief to the listening public than is proposed in this agreement, nor is there a better way of determining for all time the rights of the company in regard to its patents. That provision has been included to ensure that the issue will be definitely settled. It is most undesirable that it should be left uncertain. The Government felt that possibly the parties involved might take the view that the matter had already been more or less satisfactorily settled, and might consent to judgment. That would leave the position very much as it is today. It may be suggested by some that Amalgamated Wireless Limited should be taken over by the Government. I presume that, if we consented to that we should have to liquidate the present, eompany and dispose of the manufacturing side of its business. I suggest that such action would not be in the interests of wireless in Australia, and, accordingly, the Government has adopted the course that I have indicated'. The present licence fee of 27s. -6d. is subject to a deduction of 2s. 6d. by the Postmaster-General for the expenditure of the department in connection with wireless^ and' the balance of 25s. is paid to the broadcasting companies. Of this amount, in the past 5s. has been paid to the Amalgamated Wireless Company by the broadcasting companies in respect of royalties, and Is. 6d. has been paid by the broadcasting companies to the Performing Bight Association in respect of copyright. In the future, it is proposed that the payment to the Amalgamated Wireless Gompany of 3s. shall be made before the payment to the broadcasting companies. At the moment, it is proposed not to make any alteration in the payment of £1 to the broadcasting companies in respect of the licence fee of 27s. 6d., but to reduce the licence fee by giving to the listeners the benefit, not only of the 2s. reduction in the payment to Amalgamated Wireless, but also of a reduction of Is. 6d. which it is proposed to make in the payment to the post office. I would plead that in the past the Postmaster-General was not profiteering, but was subjected to the same difficulties as were experienced by everybody else in determining the revenue to be raised from the licences issued. There will, therefore, be a reduction from 2s. 6d. to Is.",26
53,Mr MAXWELL,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,Has that reduction been determined in accordance with any principle?,28
54,Mr BEUCE,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"The Government determined that reduction, having regard to the recommendation of the Royal. Commission. The figure which the Royal Commission arrived at was about £50,000, and that which the Government took into consideration was £35,500. I held several conferences with the broadcasting companies in Melbourne, but it was not found possible to come to any arrangement without a further investigation of their figures. The report, of the Royal Commission deals with the broadcasting companies at some length, and indicates that in one instance, at all events, profits under the present arrangement are very high; but it also stresses the financial difficulties of the companies in Western Australia and Tasmania. A recommendation is made that an operating allowance of £5,000 should be made to each of the companies out of the licence fees before the distribution bf revenue is made to them. After a full examination of this proposal the Government is of opinion that the adoption of that recommendation would not be a solution of the problem, nor'would it lead .0 the provision of first-class programmes in all the States, - which is the only basis upon which an expansion of wireless to the extent that is desired can be looked for in Australia. At the conference I found that the companies' expenses had increased in the most amazing fashion since last July, and they protested that any reduction in the amount paid to tbem would mean a reduction both in the quality and number of programmes, and also in the number of licences issued. A further examination of the financial position of all the companies is now taking prace, and it is hoped that as a result it will be possible to arrive at some basis whereby the revenues paid to the broadcasters will be sufficient to ensure first class programmes beiug provided, without undue profits accruing to any of the broadcasters as a result of the position they are placed in by enjoying what is practically a monopoly granted to them by the Government. This problem is a novel one, and one that has caused a great deal of trouble in Great Britain. When the original arrangements for the payments to the broadcasters were made, the Government was faced with the difficulty that"" it was impossible to estimate what was likely to be the development, and what number of licences would bo issued. The licences were granted for a period of five years, but the Government made it clear that at the expiration of two years it would hold itself at liberty to alter, in any way it saw fit, the payments which were to be made to the broadcasting companies. That period has now expired, and the Government is in a position to take such action as it deems best-in the interests of broadcasting and the expansion of Avireless in Australia. As soon as the whole of the figures have been examined, the Government will come to a decision as to what action should be taken, and I am extremely hopeful that the broadcasters themselves will cooperate with the Government in order to arrive at a satisfactory arrangement. In the event of such an arrangement being made, the Government would be prepared immediately to extend the period of the licences for a reasonable time. the report of the royal commission, the point is stressed that the broadcasting stations have no vested right to the renewal of their licences at the expiraMr Bruce. tion of existing licences, and the Government would certainly not be prepared to renew them unless some satisfactory arrangement were arrived at. Without such an arrangement, it will be necessary to reconsider the whole subject of broadcasting in Australia. A number of other points are raised in the report of the royal commission, but they fall outside the scope of the present agreement, and the Government will take another and early opportunity of announcing its policy with regard to them. It is doubtf u l whether much can be done until the return of Mr Brown, the director of postal services, who is in America attending a conference dealing with wavelengths and any re-allocation due to alterations. There are a number of other matters in regard to broadcasting and wireless in Australia which certainly require close investigation, but science is moving so rapidly that it is necessary that Ave should hesitate before coming to a final decision.",28
55,Mr FENTON,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,Are the listeners-m to receive any benefit?,29
56,Mr BRUCE,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"They will benefit by a reduction of 3s. 6d. Whether there Avill be any further reduction I . cannot say, because Ave have to consider whether the present figure enables the broadcasters' to make undue profits.",29
57,Mr COLEMAN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,What is being done Will the royal commission's recommendation respecting blind persons ?,29
58,Mr BRUCE,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"That is purely a matter of GoA'ernment policy, which would not be dealt Will in a statement relating to Avireless generally. Once these proposals are given effect-and the bulk of them Avill immediately operate-the Government is certain that the whole wireless industry of Australia Avill be stabilized, grievances removed, and listeners and traders generally benefited. The main object of the agreement is to give the public the benefit of modern Avireless, and at the same time encourage the industry itself. It is easy to range one-self on a particular side, and seek concessions from In the other. Only when one attempts to survey the field as a whole do the real difficulties manifest themselves. Great concessions, however, have been obtained, and a fair basis of solution arrived at. It is well to remember that the Amalgamated Wireless Company, around which all wireless activities circulate, is mainly a government company. If it is to continue its remarkable progress it must be ensured fair treatment. On the other bancl, the Government, by its position on the board and because of the more rigid controlling clauses of the agreement, can safely guarantee the general public against any possibility of unfair exploitation in Australia.

59,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Lang) [4.13]. - I suppose that there is nothing easier in this world to a man who has a glib tongue and a vivid imagination than destructive criticism of even the best schemes ever devised by the human mind. Budgets peculiarly lend themselves to destructive criticism, and it is merited more frequently than otherwise. It would be more helpful to the Treasurer, however, if the destructive criticism were accompanied by some helpful hints as to methods by which the things complained of might be rectified. We have had destructive criticism from both sides of the chamber. We expected it from the Opposition, which, of course, can always shelter itself behind the plea that it is not its business to help the Government but to try to displace it on the Treasury bench. That is quite legitimate from the point of view of the Opposition. While destructive criticism is indulged into the extent which we have heard on this side of the chamber, however, it is reasonable to ask those who criticize the Government to suggest some means by which the things of which they complain might be remedied. The criticism of honourable members might in this way be of some help to the Treasurer and to the Government. When listening to the speeches of some honourable members, particularly those of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), and the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), I could not help thinking that members of the Government might, with reason, exclaim, "" Heaven protect us from our friends."" It reminded me of a story told of the late Sir John Robertson, when one of his supporters, a very conscientious man, voted against the Government on a momentous division. Sir John was very annoyed about the inatter, and asked the member for his reason; the member replied, "" I voted against you because I did not think you were right."" Sir John replied, "" If I could depend for support only on the people who think I am right I would never get anywhere. I can always under be sure of their support, but the time. I really need help is when my supporters think I am wrong."" There are some things concerning which I think the Treasurer and the Government are wrong, but there are many more things in which I think my friends opposite'are dangerously wrong. Even had I not been elected to support this'Goverhment I could not logically do otherwise when I believe in 90 per cent, of its proposals, even if I think the other 10 per cent, are wrong. I'would not be justified in displacing the Government in order to put on the Treasury bench a body of men whose basic political principles I believe to be 100 per cent, wrong.",30
60,Mr BRENNAN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,Then we shall never get the vote of the honourable member?,30
61,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"There is nothing like living in hope, even if , politically, we die in despair, and I am afraid that will be the fate of the honourable gentleman who int terjected. One thing for which this Government is to be highly commended is its proposal to increase war pensions from 5s. to 7s. 6d. in respect of the third and subsequent children. This is a matter to which nobody has previously referred, yet it is a very important one, which affects our soldiers closely, and I feel sure that whatever they may think about some other financial proposals of the Treasurer, they will be of the opinion that he was acted very humanely and very wisely in this respect. I am pleased also to see that the Government decided to provide transport for permanently incapacitated soldiers. is a humanitarian act, and one which can be put on the contra side in the balance against the Government for some of the things alleged against it in regard to excessive expenditure and its failure sufficiently to reduce taxation. I think that there is some reasonable ground for criticism in those respects, and later I shall make some suggestions as to how I think some further reductions can be made with advantage. In regard to the alleged excessive expenditure, however, it must be remembered that this Government has immense commitments. The Government has bad to deal with conditions for wbicb it was not itself responsible. Many of these conditions - arose out of the war, and the aftermath - of the war, and involve commitments of .a nature which, prior to the war, were never dreamed of. We must not forget that in addition to loan debt, repatriation, - financial aid in various forms to the States and national works there is a - fairly considerable increase in the amount of pensions to be paid, and in the number of pensioners who participate in the payments. No fewer than 10,000 pensioners were added to the list last year, and the total number up to the :30th June last was 259,S22. Last .year pension payments amounted to £9,144,589, and the increased expenditure provided for this year will bring the total payments up to £9,400,000, an increase of £254,000. The present day ccst - of pensions amounts to over 30s. per bead of population. There is no doubt that the Commonwealth Government spends a great deal of money, but it is not - alone in that. Our expenditure is far move justifiable than that in many of the States, more particularly in those States which have Labour Governments. Some - of'our heaviest expenditure is inescapable °.Y y ar, means at all. The total - expeudittire for the whole of Australia, 'States and Gommonwealth combined, is estimated for 1926-27 to - amount to £222,159,000. The adult population of Australia is about 3,000,000, so that the expenditure per Sir ElUot Johnson. bead of population amounts to approxihas mately £77. Tbis is about equal to our annual production. According to the This figures furnished by the Government Statistician, the annual production for the five years ending 1925 amounted to £388,000,000. I bave only got the figures up to 1925, but it is questionable whether our production has increased since then. Relatively to the purchasing power of money, it has probably decreased. Eor this year the seven Parliaments of Australia have decided to borrow £50,000,000. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, a large proportion of the money is borrowed for the purpose of redeeming loans. Tbese loans have to be met as they fall due by taxation or conversion loans. In the States, however, I think there bas been an excessive amount of borrowing for purposes which cannot be justified on similar or other grounds of necessity. Since 1914 our expenditure for the whole of Australia bas increased by something like £120,000,000. In the budget which we are considering, expenditure out of loan money is provided for to the extent of £14,750,000, and of this amount nearly 50 per cent, has been allocated for railway construction and extensions in the Postal Department. A sum of £6,798,000 is to be spent on railways and postal services, while £900,000 is set aside for repatriation services-chiefl y on war service homes. Approximately £4,000,000 has been allocated for the extension of telegraphic and postal services, including telegraphs, telephones, and buildings. A large sum of money has been set aside for defence, particularly for naval defence under the five-years' expenditure scheme. Assistance is - to be rendered to the primary producers to the extent of £100,000 for wire netting, and £293,000 for the Murray Rivers Waters Scheme. The sum of £300,000 has been set aside for advances of passage money to immigrants. Further sums are being expended in subscriptions ito the Commonwealth Oil Refinery. I do not propose to deal with expenditure other than from loan money, and I think there are some items under this heading which might with advantage be reviewed. There is, for instance, the question of immigration, for which £300,000 has been set aside for assisted passages. I can quite understand the attitude of some of our friends opposite on the subject of the unrestricted immigration of people who may become competitors, in the various avenues of industrial activity, with those already resident in Australia.. I believe that their views arise from a misunderstanding of the whole position, and a failure to understand the economic situation. At the same time, however, I hold with them that before we embark on any system of wholesale immigration we must have the ground prepared, and must be sure that we can satisfactorily absorb the migrants when they arrive, without unduly disturbing the labour market. Far from wishing to disturb the labour market, I believe that our policy should be so to increase industry and production in Australia as to create freshdemands for labour. I read, with some interest, a speech delivered by the Right Honourable L. M . S. Amery, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. In the course of his remarks on migration, that gentleman said If a new citizen comes here, takes up productive work, and spends on consumption within this country the wages that he fairl y earns, he is actually an employer of labour. He gives employment to others; he keeps up the standard of wages and of employment. Unemployment is due, not to over-population, but to defective organization, to a defective balance between, different industries. I think he is perfectly right. I view with some misgiving the influx of so many foreigners into Australia, chiefly from the southern portions of Europe. I have been present when vessels conveying these migrants have arrived, and I have noted the different types. Judging from external appearances, while some are likely to make good Australiau citizens, a great many, however, who came under my personal observation did not strike me as being of the type that will be of advantage to us as citizens. In the long run, from an industrial point of view, they are more likely to be a menace than an assistance to Australia. I appreciate what the Prime Minister has said about the proportion of foreign to British arrivals.",30
62,Mr FBNTON,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"What does the honourable member mean by ""appreciate""?",32
63,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"The right honourable gentleman said that, at present, the proportion of such arrivals showed only a very small percentage of foreigners, and that it was not a very serious matter as far as the relative proportion of British and foreign arrivals was concerned. That may be the case now, but as time passes that proportion is likely to increase, if we do not basten ourselves to secure British preponderance always, and I cannot forget the lesson that we have to learn from Canada and the United States of America in the matter of a polyglot people. When I think of the races that largely form the population of those countries I am not at all enamoured of the prospect of large numbers of Southern Europeans being brought bere to assist to populate and develop Australia. If we are unable to obtain our own kith and kin to assist us, we should turn to the Scandinavian countries. Their people are vigorous, law abiding, and industrious, and possess all the characteristics which make for good citizenship. They areless hysterical, more solid and phlegmatic, and more attuned to British temperament. The honourable member, for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) made some remarks about borrowing, in regard to which I do not see eye to eye with .the honourable member. Had he adopted the attitude that we must exercise caution and judgment I could have understood his argument. Borrowing simply for the sake of borrowing is unsound in principle, but I do not suppose that there is any large business irr this or any other civilized country of the world which is not assisted, to a great extent, by bank overdrafts - A man - would be very foolish indeed if he saw opportunities to extend his business profitably and failed to take advantage of the finance offered by banking institutions, say, at 6 per cent., when the venture would return 10 per cent. If that argument applies to private business it must apply equally to the business of the States. Everything depends on the circumstances. I have no objection to borrowing for reproductive works. There is no reason why this generation should pay for works that will benefit unborn generations and perhaps even to a greater extent than the present one. So long as expenditure is carried on judiciously, and not extravagantly, borrowing is perfectly sound and legitimate. It is true that the bigb cost of production is one of the problems with which we are faced, and we in this Federal Parliament are not altogether blameless in the matter. We have been revelling in tariffs of very description, on every occasion, on sometimes the flimsiest of pretexts, in the belief that production will be stimulated, and the cost of living cheapened thereby. Some honourable members opposite who talk so much about the high cost of living would, if they had the opportunity, indulge in the practice to a greater extent than does the present Minister for Trade and Customs, whose faith in the virture of high tariffs as a leaven of prosperity seems unbounded.. May I quote from a memorable work by Henry George, Protection or Free Trade. '.Chat gentleman was highly esteemed as a philosopher, an economist, and a logician of rare analytical ability, and by no stretch of the imagination could he be described as anything but the sincerest friend of Labour. I quote his remarks particularly for the edification of honourable members opposite:My aim in this inquiry - is to ascertain beyond peradventure whether ireetrade best accords with the interests of those who live by their labour. I differ with those who say that' with the rate of wages the State has no concern. I hold with those who deem the increase of wages a legitimate purpose of public policy. To raise and maintain wages is the great object that all who live by wages ought to seek, and working men are right in supporting any measure that will attain that object. Nor in this are they acting selfishly, for, while the question of wages is the most important of questions to labourers, it is also the most important of questions to .society at large. Whatever improves the condition of the lowest and broadest stratum must promote the true interests of all. Where the wages of common labour are high, und remunerative employment obtain, prosperity will be general. wages are highest, there will be the largest production and the most equitable tion of wealth. Tliere will invention be most active and the brain best guide the hand. There will be the greatest comfort, the widest diffusion of knowledge, the purest morals, and the truest patriotism. If we would have a healthy, a happy, an enlightened and virtuous people, if we would have a pure firmly based on the popular will and quickly responsive to it, we must strive to raise wages and keep them high. I accept as good and Sir Elliot Johnson. praiseworthy the ends avowed by the advocates of protective tariffs. What I propose to inquire is whether protective tariffs are in reality conducive to these ends. I am perfectly in accord with those sentiments. If I thought that, by means of a bigb tariff, we could obtain permanent prosperity in this country, both for employers and wage-earners, that policy would have my firm adherence. But I bave read too much political economy, ancl studied the question too long and too earnestly, to allow myself to be deluded into any such belief. I do not for one moment impugn the sincerity of those, on either side of the House, who differ from me. I can only say that they are bugging to their breasts a fond delusion which, too late, they will realise that they should have discarded in the early clays of manhood. Apropos of the high cost of production, and the extent to which we have effected' tariff legislation, a careful perusal of the report of the Tariff Commission is instructive, and I propose to make a few quotations from it. Before doing so I should like to refer to the attitude of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore). The honourable member spoke of . the need of reduction in indirect, as well as direct, taxation. I quite agree that there is greater need for reducing indirect taxprotection or ation than for reducing direct taxation. But I was astonished when I heard the honourable member for Dalley first of all advocate a reduction of indirect taxation, and then assert that, had he the power to do so, he would impose additional duties on jams, pickles, and other foodstuffs. I suppose that the division of Dalley contains a larger number of consumers of these commodities than any similar area in the Commonwealth; and I can imagine bow enthusiastic the wives of the social wage-earners there would be if the grocer informed them that increases were necessary in the price of these commodities is easy to Where because their representative in the Federal Parliament had used his powers distributo impose extra duties on them. The high price of commodities, consequent upon the passage of economically unsound legislation, is one of the great difficulties which we have to face today. The people want cheap goods. If any honorgovernment, able member desires a demonstration of the truth of that statement, I invite him Budget, [17 JSOVEMJ EE, 1927.] to visit the large departmental stores of Farmer and Company Limited, David Jones Limited, and Anthony Hordern and Sons Limited in Sydney, and the Myer Emporium in Melbourne, on certain days in - the week when what are described as "" special basement bargains "" or "" star bargains "" are advertised for sale. It is generally understood by our womenfolk that on those days goods may be had at considerably lower prices than those which prevail ordinarily, and the result is that the business houses which offer them for sale are rushed. I am told that at times the ladies almost tear the dresses off the backs of one another in their eagerness to get to the bargain counters. If the Minister  and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore), were to stand at the exits of these business establishments on sale days and demand from each retiring purchaser 30 per cent., 40 per cent., or 45 per cent, more than they had already paid for the goods which they had purchased, they wonld be liable to rather serious maltreatment. At any race, I should not like to be placed in such a situation. But the fact is that these demands are made and paid, only the money is previously collected through the CusCustoms House and added to the price paid by the purchaser in the shops plus interest. The impost? are made very largely by the aid of those honourable members of this Parliament who call themselves the representatives of the wage-earners. Under the heading, "" The abuse of protection,"" the Tariff Board, in its annual report for the year ended 30th June, 1927, makes some significant statements. Dealing with the subject under the sub-title "" Industrial Unions"" it says:Whilst this annual report is in course of preparation there have arisen further circumstances which are paralysing the wheels of industry and seriously interfering with production, which after all is the basis of all national prosperity. To illustrate the impossible situation which has arisen it is only necessary to draw attention to the labour position at the moment in the copper industry in Tasmania. This industry has appealed for a bounty of as much as £10 per ton of copper to enable it to carry on its operations in competition with the world's price of copper. The industry recently represented to the Tariff Board that 1927-28. 1569 it is threatened with extinction unless a substantial bounty is granted. In the face of these conditions, which must be known to industrial leaders, it is deplorable to find circumstances arising which threaten the entire closing down of this important field, with the consequent heavy loss to the community in general and the operatives of the mine in particular. This occurs, too. in an industry that is essential to Australia in time of war. A serious position has also arisen in the production of sugar, potatoes, agricultural implements and in the dairying industry. The sugar industry, which is maintained i u Australia at considerable cost to the community, was amongst the first matters on which the board reported after its appointment. The board spent many months inquiring into the agricultural implement industry', and also investigated and reported upon the potato industry. An exhaustive investigation has just been concluded into the production of butter and cheese and a report on these subjects is in course of preparation. A ll of the industries mentioned-whic h are fraught with great significance in the line of Australian industrial development - are arrested in their progress and held up at a critical point in their history by the actions of the industrial unions. .The development of industry and facilities for transportation go hand-in-hand, and it only required the seamen, who enjoy the benefits of possibly the most, favourable Navigation Act in the world, to threaten to strike because they did not approve of a course of fish for breakfast, or because they objected to jam being served in 5-lb. tins instead of - 1-lb. tins, to make the whole position ludicrous, if it were not in reality too tra.gic. Those are not my words, they are taken from the report of the Tariff Board. There is no doubt whatever that there are extreme elements in many industrial organizations, which constitute a serious problem to sane and sober-minded Labour leaders in particular, and to the members of the Labour party in general; but I regret to say that the responsible members of the party do not seem to be able to control these mischievious elements. Consequently their activities receive greater publicity than they deserve, and the mischief - they do is serious. I wish now to quote the following statements in the Tariff Board report under the same main heading, but under the sub-title of "" The Secondary Producer "":Whilst it is the declared policy of the Commonwealth to assure to the local manufacturer as to the local primary producer the domestic market under certain conditions, it is a fact that, as far as secondary manufacture is concerned, this market constitutes the l i m it in general practice, by virtue of the high costs of production. Little nr no export market for secondary manufactured products can looked for at present. Generally speaking, the Tariff Board is satisfied that in its experience secondary manufacturers in Australia, are endeavouring to maintain a high standard of efficiency and the management in the main succeeds. However, it does happen that at times attempts are made to make use of the tariff to shelter plant, machinery and methods which have passed, or are passing, out of date under stress of modern development. Wliere the board during its investigations finds evidence of such practices it does not hesitate to point them out and does not make recommendations which would encourage them to be maintained. Manufacturers have been known to request additional protection to enable them to continue working a plant to produce goods in competition with tliose produced overseas oy the use of more up-to-date machinery, which greatly improves production at lessened cost. There are tinies when the local manufacturer desire's the superior article he is making at a far greater cost to be so protected as to force the cheaper one off the market, and there are on the other hand instances known to the board where he is making an inferior article and asks that it be protected against a superior oue. Then, again, his ranges, sections and patterns arc sometimes limited and he is not prepared to sympathize with the demand that exists for essential variety. It can hardly be denied that the imposition of tariff duties tends to permit monopolies to establish themselves in our midst; but although honourable members opposite frequently declare their antagonism to monopolies they strongly support every proposal to increase our tariff duties and so provide special opportunities and increase the likelihood of business monopolies within Australia. In discussing this subject, we should always bear it in mind that tariff duties were imposed, in the first place, on the distinct understanding that they would assist our manufacturers to pay a higher rate of wages, for it was declared that, without such assistance, they could not compete with countries with loAv-wage standards. The theory is plausible, but, unfortunately, bas not worked out in practice. manufacturer is always ready to take adA antage of increased duties, when his emr ployees, as the result of a decision of the Arbitration Court, a wages board, or some other Avage-fixation tribunal, is able to enforce the payment of a higher wage, be immediately requests the Government to increase the tariff duties to enable him to pay it. This in turn is passed on to Sir Elliot Johnson. the consumer and up higher goes the cost be of living. Additional tariff protection that is granted under such conditions gives the manufacturer a still greater monopoly. Erequent reference has been made in this debate to our adverse balance of trade, and to the excess of imports over exports. HOAV can we expect to export our manufactures in competition Will the world Avhen costs of production are so much higher here than they are elseAvhere? The local market for the sale of protected manufactures is limited to 6,000,000 people and Avhen that market has reached the point of saturation and Ave look about* for overseas markets for our surplus we find ourselves shut out by our inability to compete Will the products of other countries. Industrial depression folloAvs, operatives are thrown out of employment, and industry languishes until the demand again overtakes production. Great Britain has been able to develop her industries Avithout the aid of protective tariffs. America has stimulated local manufacture by shutting out foreign goods, but the American manufacturer has free trade over an area equal to the continent of Europe and among a population of 120,000,000. It is not high tariffs that help American manufacturing, it is her free trade among the States which give her an extensive local market quite independent of the export trade she can command. Under existing conditions it is idle to talk of developing exporting our surplus manufactures; the only solution is to enlarge the local market by inducing more people to. settle here. Migration is inseparably interwoven with the problems of taxation and defence. We need more people to share the burden of taxation and to assist, in maintaining the White Australia policy. Unless we are prepared to encourage people of our own race or Northern Europeans to come to Australia and asThe sist in its development, we cannot expect to continue in undisturbed possession of this continent. I do not advocate wholesale migration Avithout regard to industrial conditions, but a judicious, well balanced system of introducing more people to this country is essential to defence and desirable as a means of bringing about a wider distribution of the burden of taxation. It is necessary also for the general development of Australia. Their profitable absorption is only matter of sound land policy and oradopt. ganization. - I approve of the decision of the vernment to dispose of the CommonState wealth Line of Steamers, in respect of which the country bas already lost over £11,000,000. I hope this deprivate enterprise. cision indicates the intention of the Government not to interfere unneways ? cessarily in matters which are legitimately the concern of private enterprise. The experience of Queensland in conrailways nexion with State enterprises should a permanent warning to us. The QueensThe laud Government acquired station prothe perties, canneries, produce agencies, shops, butchers' shops, saw mills, toirs, smelters, and iron and steel at an enormous capital cost, and operated them at a great loss. I 'am glad to see that the Queensland Government is now realizing its mistake and has decided to get rid of many of these enternecessary prises, and I hope will be chary people about embarking upon others in the are future. Tasmania had a similar exof perience with shipping, and New South Wales with trawlers. I recognize that the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was justified in purchasing ships for the Commonwealth in a time of national emergency consider when tonnage was being diminished very rapidly and Australia was in danger of being isolated from Europe. The right honourable gentleman showed statesmanmunity at its mercy. like foresight in providing against the inevitable consequences of an increasing shortage of shipping. But activities which were justified in war time are notPacific line? necessarily justified in a time when normal conditions have been restored.

When honourable members use such examples of governmental activities to justify socialistic enterprises, their argument falls to the ground. I can understand the opposition of honourable members on the Labour 'side to the disposal of the shipping Line, because their party platform provides for the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. The Line represents an instalment of their legislative programme, and during a geueral hold-up of industry it could be employed effectively by tbem under a Labour administration. Rut I fail to see the reason for the attitude of those honourable members who, although opposing the socialization of the means of distribution, object to the Government's action. Room could be found for the reduction of indirect taxation in a number of directions. I appeal particularly to protectionists, and remind them that we derive an enormous revenue from a number of articles that cannot be manufactured in Australia. Tbey are subjected to high tariff duties, for which there can be no legitimate excuse when we have an excess of revenue over the sum required for our needs. It is a wasteful policy to take from the pockets of the people more money than the Government requires. The honorI able member for Maranoa (Mr Hunter) said that he failed to see how indirect taxation could be reduced. If the tariff were examined item by item, a considerable reduction in duty could be made on a number of articles that are not manufactured in Australia, and by no stretch of the imagination could be regarded as likely to be made here. The sum of £6,79S,000 is budgeted for in connection with the Commonwealth railways and the Grafton to South Brisbane railway. The proposal to embark on a heavy railcir- way construction policy shoidd be carefully examined. I am not prepared to believe that no room exists for economy in that direction. Although the Treasurer bas reduced taxation in some ways, I maintain that, notwithstanding our heavy commitments and liabilities, reduction of taxation could be brought about, and industries benefited, by lowering import tariffs and reducing railway expenditure and distributing it over a period of years.",37
70,Mr BLAKELEY,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Darling) [5.23] The amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition deals with the inadequacy of the protection of Australian industries, with unemployment and with the financial system and administration of the present Government. During the time at my disposal I propose to touch upon the subject of unemployment and the refusal of the Government to protect Australian industries. The natural corollary' of indiscriminate immigration is unemployment. The last speaker dealt with the adverse trade balance against Australia. His solution as a. free trader is that the tariff barrier should be removed, and that the goods manufactured by cheap foreign labour should be allowed to flood the country. There must be something - wrong with my theories of political economy if that is a correct solution of the present difficulties of Australia. I shall mention some of the articles we produce and export, and show the extent of our adverse trade balance. Our imports in 1926-27 totalled in value £164,744,927, and our exports amounted to £144,775,541, leaving an adverse trade balance of £19,969,386. These figures were supplied by the late Comptroller of Customs. If our bullion and specie, valued at £12,303,000, Avere excluded, our adA^erse trade balance last year Would have been over £32,000,000. I hope to show that the attempt by this free trade-protection GoA'crnment to deal Will the financial position has dismally and logically failed, because it is impossible for a government to administer a protectionist policy, and at the same time cater for and'protect the importers who are represented in its party. Nearly half the members of the cabinet are free traders. Some of them, like the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson), and other honourable members, make no attempt to disguise the fact. Others, while pretending to be protectionists, are free traders at heart. The last quarter's return shows that the unemployed in Australia number 26,280; but the figures are compiled from information supplied by the secretaries of trade unions and labour bureaus. I should say that it would be no exaggeration to add at least 14,000 to that total. There must be not feAver than 40,000 unemployed in Australia today. Since the last return was compiled, a large increase in unemployment bas occurred in Newcastle. In Sydney, because of the lack of protection, factories are putting off employees. The unfortunate State of South Australia, to which my sympathy goes out, has a Nationalist or composite GoA eroment._Avhich bas been imposed upon it purely by a political accident. for it represents a minority of the people. One of the first attempts to save South Australia on the part of ""dismal Dick"" Butler and his far from merry crew, was to carry out a policy of retrenchment in the South Australian railways, and accordingly"" 2,000 employees were dismissed. Immediately a Avaye of apprehension SAvept through South Australia, starting like the ripple caused by a stone thrown into a pond until it reached the outer parts of the State. The Government apparently does not intend to stop there. It proposes to retrench in similar ratio in the various departments of the public service. In NeAv South Wales^ whin the composite Government assumed office, a AvaA-e of apprehension also spread through that State. Honourable members opposite, representing as they do vested,interests, Avill appreciate more than we do that the position in NeAv South Wales since the election has become serious. There is in that State a depression caused by this fact and the inability or refusal of the Federal Government to protect adequately industries already established, and to foster the establishment of new industries. All composite governments, whether Federal or State, have a conservative dislike of progress; they desire only to retard progress as exemplified by Labour legislation. One can quite understand that the members of such governments must, before they go to sleep at night, and, on their bended knees, thank God that they have been allowed to prevent Labour from developing this country. Trade and commerce interests, which usually support the Nationalists, are the first to be hit by the administration of composite governments. Most of the employees in the railway and tramway services of New South Wales receive £6 10s. or £7 a week, and they aspire, may-be, to a playerpiano, a gramaphone, a home, or one of the lower-priced motor cars. When the Nationalist Government was elected in New South Wales, there was an immediate dropping of orders for those utiliT ties. The refusal of the public servants of that State to spend money as they did under the regime of the Labour Government, has had an adverse effect upon the retailers, and, in turn, upon the wholesalers. In time the ripples caused by the first stone thrown into the village pond by the Nationalist Government will reach the manufacturers. The banks have also been affected, with the result that the conditions in New South Wales today are considerably worse than they have been for ten years. The position is similar in South Australia. Nationalist Government of New South ""Wales is now commencing, to retrench in the railway and tramway services. The Commonwealth Government, although it refuses to carry out national works for the relief of the unemployed, continues to import in large numbers the people of other countries to enter into competition with Australians. The imports into Australia amount to £164,000,000 annually. Under an efficient Government keenly desirous of making Australia a great nation, many of those imports could be made here. Under a Labour Government they would be made here. Take, for instance, food-stuffs of vegetable and animal origin. In 1926-27 we imported £121,000 worth of confectionery, and exported £126,000 worth, showing clearly that Australia can supply its own requirements. We exported £520,000 worth of sausage casings. Tbese are by-products of the abattoirs of Australia, and are easy handled. That industry is undoubtedly of great value to the people of Australia. We imported £342,000 worth of sausage casings, nullifying to a great extent the advantage of our exportation. Australia can - provide the whole - of its requirements in sausage casings. It is the duty of this Government to protect that industry, and to keep in circulation in this country, the money that would otherwise be sent overseas in payment for imports. We imported £174,000 worth of fruits, - and exported £1,658,000 worth A considerable bounty was paid on dried fruits. Wc are able, in a great number of cases, to export our commodities, but we nullify our efforts to develop Australia by allowing the importation of similar commodities. T suggest to the Government this is fiscalism gone mad, and reminds one of a dog biting itself. Australia is a great primary producing country. It raises cattle, sheep, and horses, and produces various kinds of leather. In 1926-27 - ve imported £547,000 worth of horse and cattle hides and sheep skins, and exported £4,000,000 worth of hides and Mr Blakeley. skins. Surely Ave are in a position to supply our own requirements. It may be The said that there are certain classes of skins that we gannot produce. Our rabbit skins are sent abroad and returned to us. in varied forms and under extraordinary names. We have various kinds of peltssuch as sheep skins, opossum skins,, rabbit skins, marsupial skins, and horseand cattle hides. We can supply to the people of Australia a variety and quantity of skins suitable for all their requirements, yet we import over a half a million pounds worth of skins. In 1926-27 we imported £42,000,000 worth of textiles, yet Ave are in a position to supply a portion of our requirements in cotton, artificial silk, silk and AVOOI. We can produce the goods and Ave are producing them in limited quantities. We have factories in Australia manufacturingstockings, socks, knitted goods and othergoods of cotton, AVOOI and silk mixtures. Australian capital is invested in theknitting industry, and yet the Government is alloAving the machinery in our factories to remain idle Avhile Japanese and other foreign manufacturers aresending their knitted goods here to compete with the local article produced under Australian wages and conditions. Our textile industry Avill never flourish until such time as the Government. imposes a tariff sufficiently high to prevent the dumping of cheap foreign-made goods into this country. The textile industry bas frequently implored the Government to assist it, but nothing has been done, dried t do not offer any personal criticism of the Minister for Trade and Gustoms  sible for bim to satisfy this Government, composed as it is of Ministers representing conflicting interests. But I would say to the Government, which contains some free traders, that if that they desire to minimize the present disastrous trade balance, they should stand firmly for the development of Australian industry. The honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson), an avowed free trader, conveniently absents himself when divisions are taken on questions of protection, because, apparently, he does not like to fall foul of his Government. He stands for free trade, as do a great many otlier supporters of the Government; but free trade will not get Australia very far. Iron and steel form the largest item among the imports into this country, whose value per annum amounts to £51,237,944. These imports include bars, rods, hoops, and ingots, and these particular items are valued at £1,329,000. All such material can be produced in Australia, and is now being produced here. As has been said by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), the Newcastle steelworks, Hoskins limited, and other firms engaged in the iron and steel industry, are experiencing a very bad time. Pipes and tubes to the value of £1,663,632 are imported, and this materia] is also produced here. It requires no extensive plant or great degree of skill to make it ; certainly no greater skill than is possessed by the tralian artisan. Galvanized corrugated iron to the value of £1,734,525 is imported annually. Lysaght's and other manufacturers in Newcastle and elsewhere are supplying corrugated and sheet iron, and are endeavouring to build up an industry in competition with the lower-paid operatives in other countries. Plain corrugated iron was imported into Australia to a value of over £1,000,000. We are "" doing the job "" in Australia, and yet the Government is allowing low-wage countries to enter into competition with our local manufacturers. For imported motor bodies and parts we paid £1,413,529. There is not a single part for any of the popular makes of motor cars which is not being constructed by local manufacturers in Sydney. These parts are being made by Sonnerdale Limited, who do their work very well. If these manufacturers were being helped by this protection-cum-free trade Government, they would establish an industry here which would supply all the parts needed, and in time the production of an Australian motor car would come about. I shall bave something to say in regard to that later. For the last twelve months for which the figufes are available, we imported motor tyres, pneumatic ancl solid, to the value of £2,329,719. The Perdriau Rubber Company is a well-established firm in New South Wales, and some months ago it turned out its millionth tyre. It is making a good article, and its tyres have acquired a reputation for worthiness, as have also those produced by the Barnet Glass and Dunlop Rubber Companies. I do not know what number of tyres have been manufactured by the Barnet Glass Company, but I think their total output must be very great. I am informed that the Rapson Company are about to start manufacturing tyres in Tasmania. The Goodyear' Company has already established a huge factory in New South Wales, and will commence production very shortly. Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister for Trade and Customs  Government, when addressing social gatherings of manufacturers and meetAusings immediately prior to electionsactuated, largely, perhaps, by a lively sense of favours to come-declar e that they are doing everything possible - to protect the industries of the country, I consider that the Minister has reason to be ashamed of himself when tyres to the value .of over £2,300,000 are imported into this country in a year. During the past twelve months we imported into Australia pianos and player parts to the value of £1,221,781. This industry has been crying out for adequate protection for many years, and those of us who have had the privilege of seeing pianos made by Beale and Company, and by other manufacturers, recognize that we already have in this country a well-established industry for the production of these instruments. We have trained our artisans, and can do the work quite well in Australia. Here is a double-page advertisement, which appears in the October issue of the Canadian Music Trades Journal. It is the advertisement of the SherlockManning Piano Company, and Doherty Pianos, Limited, whose head offices are in London, Canada. The advertisement refers to the Canadian production of pianos for export to Australia. On one steamer which sailed recently for Australia and New Zealand were no less than -51 instruments made in our factories. Europe has hitherto controlled the trade in the podes, but the above is evidence that Canadian-made pianos can compete with the best, and more than hold their own. I congratulate Canada on the establishment of a piano manufacturing industry in that country, but I cannot congratulate the Government here, on its efforts to establish the industry in Australia. Some of the free traders in their speeches during the budget debate, when dealing with the subject of Australia's adverse trade balance, and with the tariff generally, touched on the matter of revenue obtained from Customs duty. Here is an illustration which shows the effect of a proper protective tariff on the manufacture of motor car bodies. ""While we have not absolute prohibition in regard to theimportation of motor bodies, Australian manufacturers have built up an organization which bas enabled tbem, not only to produce the article in Australia, but to do so at a reduced price. The duties on motor car bodies at the present time are:-British , £30 to £65 each; general tariff, £40 to £75 each; or ad valorem 40 per cent. British preference, and 55 per cent, general tariff, whichever returns the higher duty. During 1921-22, for every motor car body imported, 2J bodies were manufactured locally, but after six years of gradual building up of the industry, and the introduction of efficient methods into their business, local manufacturers now make seven bodies to every one that is imported. This shows that the industry is effectively protected, and it shows also that the local prices are fair reasonable.",37

72,Mr BLAKELEY,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,I do not admit it.,41
73,Mr MAXWELL,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,Does the honourable member deny it?,41
74,Mr BLAKELEY,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"I shall go so far as to say that if the trade in pianos greater, it would allow of an extension of piano manufacturing, such as is possible under present trade conditions. industries. As with motor car bodies, so it should,; be with tyres, with batteries, with bumper bars, with sbock absorbers, and with all Anti- the other accessories which are now becoming so common a feature of motor cars that they may be regarded as part of the standard equipment. In answer to the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson), who spoke about inferior articles of local manufacture being protected against superior articles from overseas, to the detriment of the people generally, I will quote what happened in the case of sbock absorbers. These articles are being manufactured by Storey Bros., of Sydney, and others. Shock absorbers are now being introduced as standard equipment on many of the better class cars, and I am informed that they are being installed as standard equipment on the new Eord cars. When the tariff on imported shock absorbers was only 10 per cent., a set of four sold on the local market at ten guineas. Then the Government assisted the industry to the extent of increasing the duty to 55 per cent., and I give the Minister credit for his action. The local industry was immediately stimulated, and the output greatly increased. The price for shock absorbers was reduced from ten guineas to £7 10s. a set, and the local article is equal to the best that was ever imported. Unless some action is taken those companies which intend to introduce shock absorbers as standard chasis equipment will push the Australian manufacturers of sbock absorbers off the market. Mr E. RILET - Are they bringing in and cars fitted with shock absorbers?",41
75,Mr BLAKELEY,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"They are. PreAustralian shock absorbers were to Buicks, Vauxhalls. Checker Cabs other high-priced cars; but now tin) General Motor Company propose to equip certain of its cars with shock absorbers as standard equipment, so eliminating the Australian industry. Other makers will also make sbock absorbers standard equipment. Shock absorbers, should be similarly treated as batteries, which were declared to be a fitment sepawere rate from the chassis. Australia has a good deal to learn from Japan in impatriotism and the protecting of local On the 31st July, 1924, Jaipan - introduced a luxury tax in its Diet. I shall give a comparative list of Australian aud Japanese duties on similar articles. A k in ' is equivalent Soaps Yarns, partly silk, artificial or metal . .

The Minister for Trade and Customs should obtain some food for thought from that list, and some material from the conversation of his colleagues. A disquieting propaganda bas been going on in the British E mpire, conducted by an organization calling itself the Australian Association of British Manufacturers. Last year aooui 150 members of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce met to consider the question of preserving and increasing British trade with Australia. In his address to the meeting, the president of the Australian association, Mr B . W . Knox, saidPossibly the most important part of the work of the association relates to matters affecting the fiscal issue. The Tariff was formed some years ago to advise the Government ou matters affecting trade Australia, and it has, in the main, functioned extraordinarily well. The association always taken a most active part in matters where duties were affected. It is almost impossibility to try and stem the tide protection to secondary industries of the country. . . . The policy of the country with regard to the development of the seconddelegation ary industries is there to stay, and I think that today we could do otlier than assist in directing the forces, to see that tually the duties were not unduly harmful this country. By "" this country,"" Mr Knox referred to England. Later in the meeting Arthu r (now Lord) Balfour pointed to 1,233 lb., and a yen to Is. 104d. The following is the comparison:Australian Duty.

He statedManufacturing in Australia is growing, but we have to mitigate the tariffs, and go after such trade as there is there and such trade as is multiplied by the fact that they are becoming a great manufacturing nation. I am wondering what influence, if any, the British Manufacturers' Association has had upon .this Government to cause it to refuse to recognize its responsibilities and the necessity for establishing great secondary industries, or at least the basis of a great manufacturing nation with in the shores of Australia. Mr L . M . S. Amery has made a great number of speeches in this country, ancl Board while I recognize his so-called diplomatic mission to Australia, I am of the with opinion that he almost exclusively re has presents the interests of the British manufacturers, who feel that they are an losing some of our trade. Honourable of members will remember the recent visit of the British Empire Parliamentary to Australia. I spoke with a do not number of the British Labour members evenof that delegation, because I was anxious to to find out how they regarded Australia's aspirations to become a great manufacturing nation. As honourable members Mr know, my inquiries were received coldly. out The British Labour members told me quite frankly that they did not think that Australia should worry about manufacturing. They said "" We have the ma-, chinery, the organization, the skilled artisans and mechanics to do this job for you. Why not have the responsibility? You supply us with the raw material and we will do the job. We can do it much better and more cheaply than you."" I asked one gentleman "" What would you do if you were either an Australian public man or an ordinary Australian citizen, in regard to this matter?"" He answered "" There would be only one thing to do. I would advocate what you are advocating, but. there will be a very grave menace to British industry if Australia and other British dominions intend to create industries wbicb hitherto bave been carried out by England, and if they take our skilled artisans and mechanics, whom, with their forbears, we bave trained through the centuries. The result will not be in the interests of England."" I agreed with the gentleman. So long as it pays the British manufacturers to trade with' us, they will do so. Immediately no profits are available it will have no further interest in Australia from the trade stand-point.",41
76,Unknown,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,43
77,Mr BLAKELEY,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"The following extract from a speech by the Secretary of State for the Dominions, Mr Amery, before the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce last year, which was reported in the British Trader, of 15th October, indicates the right honourable gentleman's point of viewI will take the figures I have handy; they are for the last year before the war, a normal year. In that year our total trade, export import, with Germany stood at £120,000,000, a big figure, apparently a much bigger figure than our total trade with Australia, which was only just over £70,000,000-until you analyse it. What was the real nature of our trade with Germany? We sent Germany £4,500,000 in foodstuffs, and received some £16,000,000 in return. We sent her £20,000,000 raw materials, and half-manufactured goods, receiving only £12,000,000 in return, the Germans taking good care to keep their raw materials at home, and their halfmanufactured goods at home, to finish them at home. But when you come to highly-finished manufactures, we sent Germany £15,000,000, and received £50,000,000. That was not a trade which contributed in any way to the strengthening of the fabric of British industry. It was a splendid trade for Germany to build up, for Germany to create credits in this country by which she bought raw materials, and foodstuffs to sustain her industry, but, from our point of view, it was a debit trade. On the other hand, trade with Australia stood 'at some £30,000,000 of exports, practically half representing British manufactures, twice as many manufactures sent to Australia as to Germany, and what we received from Australia in return was almost equally divided between foodstuffs and raw materials. That was a trade every pound of which went, either coming or going, to strengthen British industry. In the face of statements of that kind it can hardly be argued that we are anything else than "" wood and water Joeys "" for the British manufacturers. That speech, as well as many that Mr Amery has delivered in Australia on behalf of British manufactured-camouflaged , of course, with a good dear of diplomacyindicate that the right honourable gentleman is visiting Australia as a glorified commercial traveller for the British manufacturing interests. I bave no objection to the British manufacturers increasing their trade with Australia to our mutual advantage; but if the increase is to be gained at the expense of our secondary industries I am totally opposed to it. A good deal hasjseen said in this chamber of late about the ties that bind us to Great Britain. Admittedly there are ties. But I assert without hesitation that the trade between Australia and Great Britain would not be continued for ten minutes unless it was profitable. There can be no doubt whatever that the British Association of Manufacturers, through its representatives in Australia, is doing everything possible to advance British and interests here. There is not an inquiry which the Tariff Board conducts at which this association is not represented. As a matter of fact, I find myself asking to what extent .this association is either directly or indirectly responsible for the lackadaisical fiscal policy of this Government. Indisputably it is exerting a powerful influence here. The United States of America, like Great Britain, is eager to do business with Australia, but it also wants its own terms, as the following report which appeared in the 0 Sydney Sun on the 14th March, 1926, will show:- ' WOOL TOPS FOR US. AUSTRALIAN ENTERPRISE. Tariff Threat. Woo) top niillers at a Boston luncheon today told Mr Marks, president of the Austral American Company, of New York (which has been formed to push the sale of Australian goods in the United States), that they were commerce; determined not to allow the entry of Australian manufactured tops. If the company succeeded in lowering the price to competition point, they would move Washington to increase the tariff, they told him, adding would be the return of the Democratic party to 'power. Asked why Australia wanted to manufacture wool-tops, Mr Marks said Australia wanted increase her population. 11 Why?"" was the reply. ""Aren't you happy and prosperous now 1 Continue your producing of raw material, and we will stay friends."" It will be seen that the American manufacturers have adopted much the same policy as the manufacturers of Great Britain . Other nations of the world are also awake to the danger of allowing young aud vigorous countries to establisb large secondary industries. Let me refer honourable members to the report of the proceedings of the recent International Economic Conference, which was atentirely tended by 194 delegates. the League of Nations, there were introducing represented the United States of America, Egypt, Turkey, the Union of Socialistic Soviet Republics, the Eree City of Danzig, and the fifty. countries which are members of the League of Nations of were also represented. The decisions of this conference no doubt pleased free trade members of this Parliament, but they were'not acceptable to those us who believe in the maintenance of White Australia. I am not so foolish as to think that the fiscal policy of tralia caused the conference any great concern, but I am of the opinion that the attitude which the conference adopted is totally opposed to the best interests of this country. It was undoubtedly free trade conference. I quote the followemployment ing extracts from the official report its proceedings:The conference is convinced that a return to the effective liberty of international is one of the primary conditions of world prosperity. Conclusion. Iu view of the fact that harmful effects upon production and trade result from the high and New York, May 14, 1926. constantly changing tariffs which are applied in many countries; And since substantial improvement in tha economic conditions can be obtained by increased facilities for international trade and And in view of the fact that tariffs, though within the sovereign jurisdiction of the separate States, arc not a matter of purely domestic interest, but greatly influence the that his hope trade of the world; And in view of the fact that some of the causes which have resulted in the increase of tariffs and in other trade barriers since the to war have largely disappeared, and others are diminishing; The conference declares that the time has come to put an end to the increase in tariffs, and to move in the opposite direction. Time will not permit me to quote more extensively from the report, but I am sure that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) would find it an excellent foundation for a free trade speech. I bave already referred to the number of unemployed we have in our comniunity. I wish now for a moment to discuss the Government's migration policy, which, like its fiscal policy, is unsatisfactory. It has appointed Outside a costly commission for the purpose of hundreds of thousands of additional people to this country to compete with those already here for the in sufficient amount of employment that is available. It is estimated that the sum £34,000,000 will be spent in the next ten years in bringing migrants to Austbe tralia. Schemes bave already been submitted to the commission which are estiof mated to cost £12,475,000, and schemes a have been approved which are estimated to cost £5,898,000. In 1925-26, 26,678 Ausassisted migrants were brought to Australia, and last year the number was 33,174. The Government has been guilty of nothing short of prodigal expenditure in its efforts to bring people here, ala though it has entirely failed to provide for tbem or for many of of those wbo are already here*. The honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson) gave us to understand this aftertrading noon that he would be quite willin g to allow millions of people to enter the country irrespective of whether employment could be found for them or not. "" What does it matter whether we can give them work or not"" he said in effect; ""Bring them here and we shall have so many more shoulders upon which to place our burden of taxation."" Sucb a lopsided economic policy as that is well suited to the honourable member, tor tie uas done nothing during the whole of his political career to improve the wages and working conditions of our people. Although he represents a great manufacturing district, he is one of the thirteen followers of Henry George still left in Australia; the others have died. I suppose the honourable member thinks that he bas a good job, and that if he were to advocate the principles of protection be would be creating a Frankenstein monster that would ultimately overwhelm bim. In 1926-27, 39,831 migrants arrived from Great Britain, 4,902 from Italy, 2,697 from other Southern European countries, and 2,85S from other parts of Europe; in other words, 50,288 persons came to Australia to compete for jobs which are non-existent. And our people's money is being spent in bringing them bere to create unemployment. Between the first operation of the agreement and last September, 66,247 migrants have been brought to Australia. Prior to its tion, the cost per migrant was £9 7s. 10d.; since the signing of the„agreement it has been £12 3s. 3d., an increase of £2 lbs. 5d. per head. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) drew attention to the huge sum of money that the commission spent last year, and the estimate of £140,000 for this year. Jobs are being created galore, and, generally speaking, the employees of the commission are praying for the safety of this Government for many Parliaments to come. In respect of the .66,247 migrants, the cost to Australia has been approximately £183,000. The justification for immigration is that it will increase our population and gradually make of Australia a great nation, but there is a class in this country that wishes to induce a huge stream of immigrants, who by competing for the available jobs, and creating a supply greater than the demand, will cause a reduction of wages. Many State Mr Blakeley. authorities have intimated to the Development and' Migration Commission that it is foolish to bring out certain types of artisans and mechanics. Because of this, when British tradesmen who are desirous of migrating get into touch with agents wbo are paid 37s. 6d. for every migrant they book, they are informed that there is no room for carpenters, blacksmiths and miners, and are advised to nominate as farm labourers. So "" the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker "" come to Australia as farm labourers, but, on arrival, they immediately look for work in their own trades. The Government is introducing people who will settle upon the land. . I shall quote a few illustrations of the demand for land in Australia. At Darlington Point, New South Wales, there were 4,000 applicants for one block; at Narrandera. 300 applicants for four blocks; at Albury, in March, 1925, 1,900 applicants for 9S blocks; at Lake Cowal, 413 applicants for one block; at Grafton, in August last, 2,200 applicants for three blocks; at Moree, in October last, 1,205 applicants for one block; at Armidale, 90 applicants for one block, although the frost was severe and the grass poor; and at Narrandera, in March last, 315 applicants for four blocks 6£ miles from the adoptownship. Those figures speak for themselves. As Mr Amery said, "" Great Britain is getting it, coining and going."" According to a cablegram published on the 2nd July, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies stated that the cost of migration to Great Britain prior to the present agreement was £580,836 for 25,596 migrants, or £22 13s. per head. Under the new scheme the cost would be £15 14s., or £7 less than formerly. Moreover, this scheme will relieve Great Britain to the extent of £50 per head of the unemployed who go to Australia as migrants. As the United Kingdom has about S00,000 unemployed, one can .understand the avidity with which such a scheme to relieve the Old Country of the responsibility for its unemployed was accepted. In regard to the calibre of the migrants arriving in Australia, disquietening reports have been received. Migrants haveappeared before the police courts upon all sorts of charges. The Rev. E. F. Young, of the Mission of St. James and St. John, Melbourne, giving evidence before the royal commission on National Insurance on the 9th June, 1926, said- r There are men cadging in the streets of Melbourne today who have arrived in Australia during the last six months. They were selected migrants, but they are physically unfit, undersized and lacking in initiative. Many of them have not a' strong mentality. Before Mr Justice Schutt, in the Criminal Court of Victoria, an official of the Crown Law Department declared that there had been an alarming increase in the number of assisted immigrants arrested in Victoria for housebreaking, larceny and other offences. Mr Justice Bevan, at the Albury Court of Sessions, in dealing with one of these unfortunates, said in June lastA few months ago I was able to secure a return showing the number of immigrants who, between June, 1023, and June, 1925. had arrived in this State from Britain and other countries, and who had been convicted of offences, and were at some time between dates serving sentences in gaol in New South Wales. Tliere were GO immigrants serving sentences during that period. I could quote many other illustrations of the laxity in the selection of migrants. Physically, mentally and morally, many of the new arrivals are undesirable, and their acceptance shows either carelessness on the part of the authorities in London, or an undue enthusiasm on the part of the agents who receive 37s. 6d. for each migrant they book. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) has on many occasions in this House evaded questions regarding migration, and has made misleading statements in regard to certain classes of migrants which are not to his credit. I do not attack any foreign migrants who come to Australia; we have established in this country in regard to food, clothing and housing, for the workers standards unequalled elsewhere, and because of this fact being broadcast through the newspapers and letters from people settled here to friends in their own country, Australia has become the Mecca of the workers of other countries. One cannot blame people for coming to this country and endeavouring to obtain the conditions which our workers have established in spite of the opposition of this Government and its friends. [50] The industrial and political section of the Labour party have been fighting for 40 long years to build up a high economic standard, and employers and anti-labour politicians have consistently opposed tbem. The Prime Minister was asked by me recently if he would take steps to prevent the coming to Australia of Italian migrants who were destined for Broken Hill . At that centre there is industrial depression, three mines have closed down, and 1,600 men, including many Italians, Greeks and Maltese, have been thrown out of employment. To ray question the Prime Minister replied that he had communicated with the Consul-General for Italy, wbo had instructed Italian agents to refuse to accept migrants for Broken Hill, Wonthaggi, Port Pirie and other industrial centres. I give the Prime Minister credit for having some capacity; but the bedtime stories of 3LO are a mere circumstance to that those piece of evasion. He knows well that, just as a British miner or carpenter can nominate as an agricultural labourer, so can an Italian migrant, and, when he reaches an Australian port, be can go whither he will. Three hundred Italians held a meeting at Broken Hill recently, and resolved to ask the Italian Consul-General to advise the immigration agencies of the distress experienced there and elsewhere in Australia. The Italians themselves are not so enthusiastic about migration to this country as are the Prime Minister and his supporters. They, too, feel the economic pressure owing to the refusal of this Government to protect our industries. I have endeavoured to show that it is possible to create employment in this country by doing those things that we are asking other people to do for us, or to buy which we are sending out money, including the cash of the persons who are in need of work. Unless the Government gets rid of its "" shandygaff "" troglodytic and fiscalism, under which it absolutely refuses to accept facts that stare everybody else in the face, the position will be serious. Cases of distress, through unemployment, which is increasing every day, demand State aid, are constantly brought under the notice of every honourable memthat ber. Parliament has been in recess practhe tically since the last election. Any excuse is not so. has been considered good enough for keeping it closed. The adverse trade balance is climbing higher every month, and I am Australia. informed that, for the last two months, the balance was on the wrong side to extent of £10,000,000.",43
78,Mr MAXWELL,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,Now that Parliament is assembled in Canberra everything will be right.,47
79,Mr BLAKELEY,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Althoug h the seat of Government has been transferred to Canberra, we still have a Government composed of free traders, ""freetecof tionists,"" and disciples of Henry George. I admit frankly that a number of strong protectionists are to be found on the Government side; but their influence of little use in protecting established init. dustries and helping to build up new ones. Ministers find time to proceed to England, and talk grandly about the British Empire, and make arrangements for another 100,000 immigrants, who are brought out at heavy cost to the peoplein fact to do anything except look after the interests of Australia. It is time we had a Government that would stand solidly for this country on all occasions, first elected. and for the development of a great nation.  - As the most recently elected member of the Committee, I rise with some trepidation and diffidence to express views on the budget. I propose to prelatest face what I have to say by a reference to political organization as it affects parties in this Parliament. I believe the great majority of the people favour the union of the Nationalist and Country parties. Any weakening of the arrangeI ment that exists today would be disaspeared trous to the Commonwealth. The State election that has just taken place in South Wales was a triumph for the extremist forces that, by united effort, obtained a substantial victory. honourable member who has just resumed his seat stated that the Nationalist vernment in New South Wales does not represent a majority of the electors of State. A scrutiny of the results of election, however, will show that that",47
80,Mr BLAKELEY,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"I referred to South  the honourable member's correction, and at the same time. I draw attention to figures that perhaps bave not yet been made public. The combined votes of the Nationalist and Country parties in New South Wales were about 41,000 greater, than those cast for the Labour party. This shows that New South Wales is now under majority rule, and governed with the concurrence of a substantial majority the people of the State. Disunity in the past bas been of great detriment to both the Nationalist and the Country parties, which, on numbers of occasions, is have been defeated simply because of The last federal election was won chiefly by the united action by those parties. The by-elections that have since been held show that the present Government retains the confidence of the people, if by-elections may be regarded as a reliable political barometer. At none of these by-elections, bas there been any diminution of the support accorded to the Nationalist Government since it was At the by-election for Eden-Monaro, the majority vote cast in favour of the Nationalist candidate was substantially the same as that' given at the preceding general election. At the Dalley by-election, the Nationalist. candidate was in no greater my minority than formerly, and at the by-election-tba t for the Warringah seat-tb e vote received by the the Nationalist candidate was practically the that same as that obtained at the general election. I can, perhjaps, 'speak with greater authority of the last-mentioned contest than the other, and regarding it observe, with all respect, that it apto disclose the distinct approval by the people of that constituency New of the administration of the present Goantivernment. I ask honourable members to recollect that the contest took place only The six months ago, and it showed that the electors favoured the maintenance of the Gopresent arrangement between the Nationalist and Country parties. Moreover, it was a signal indication of the confidence of the people in the Prime Minister as I the leader of the combined parties. I make no apology for stating where I stand in this House. I was elected as a straight out supporter of the present Government, and I intend to give it my cordial assistance, not only because I was elected for that purpose, but because I k believe that its presence on the Treasury 1 bench is in the best interests of the Commonwealth, and that it is administering I the affairs of the country in a manner j that has the approval of the people, i I came into this chamber as a new member, steeped in party loyalty, and, L therefore, I take this early opportunity ' of entirely dissociating myself from certain views expressed last night by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett). I dissent entirely from his state, ment that the Treasurer is personally responsible for the budget. The honorL. able gentleman, no doubt, compiled the i budget; but it was considered by the Cabinet, and was presented with the approval of the whole of the Ministry. It is, therefore, the budget, not of the Treasurer, but of the Government of this country. It is idle and fallacious for I an honourable member to say that i the entire and personal responsiy bility for the budget rests upon the Treasurer. Moreover, I can in no way support the honourable member 1 for Henty in his vicious attack upon the honourable gentleman regarding the budget and the finances generally. There is no justification for that attack, because L the budget has been acclaimed by the supF porters of the Ministry as one of the best in the history of the Commonwealth. Reference was made in the speech of the honourable member to the increase in taxation. It is quite true, as the honourable member for Henty had said, that there has L been an increase in taxation per head r of population since last year. 1921-22 the taxation per head was £9 Os. 3$d. In 1927-28 it was £9 7s. 10jd - a n increase of 7s. 7d. Bnt there is a good reason for that increase, ' and it had the approval at least of honL orable members on that side of the cham^ ber from which came the criticism. The reason is that the expenditure on roads has increased taxation by 6s. 5d. a head, while old-age pensions, to which no honourable member will object, andfor which no one is responsible, has increased taxation by 10s. l l $ d . per head, making a total increase of 17s. 4£d. ""When the increase of 7s. 7d. is deducted, we find that we are better off today than we were in 1921-22 by about 10s. per head. I regard the honourable member's exposition of the economic and financial position of Australia as incomplete and illogical, whilst his statement that the sons of the wealthier people fought iii! the Great War for their own material advantage was unworthy of him, absolutely untrue, and unwarranted in the extreme. I believe the Bruce-Page Ministry to be the strongest political combination that has existed in this Commonwealth for many years, and the one leader is just as necessary to the welfare of the community as the other. It is to the interest of members on this side of the chamber at least I to preserve that combination as long as possible. It is seldom that a non-Labour party is defeated by the superior strength of its opponents. It is more often defeated by the internecinedifferences which,' from time to time, rend it in twain, and make it an easy prey for its opponents. I am a Nationalist, but, at the same time, I extend my loyalty to the Country party members of the Government while the composite arrangement which has been' entered into lasts, and which is being honourably observed by both parties to.it. The Treasurer has carried out the duties of his office with singular ability, skill, and industry, and with lasting benefit to the people of this country. His reputation has steadily increased, and he has a claim upon the good wishes and gratitude of the people. Further, I contend that the place for the ventilation of differences is the party room, and not the floor of the House, In where the airing of grievances must, provide ammunition for the Opposition at election time. I have no desire at the next election to be faced on ever""' platform on which I stand with t i > statements of the honourable member for Henty, or with the votes and statementsof the right honourable member for NorthSydney (Mr Hughes), who . represents an electorate adjoining mine, and whose constituents are of the same class as mine -.

Either he - was rightand I was wrong, or I was right and be was wrong. At all events I am. prepared to explain my action to the electors at the next election, and I ""believe that I shall have a somewhat easier task than if I had to explain my association with Labour members in a vote ' of want of confidence, in the Government.. The speech of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) had the merit of being delivered from the Opposition benches, and is one so I am told,, that has been delivered on numerous occasions before. In view of his conscientious, objections to the Bruce Page Ministry, I could not understand how he ever came to join it. He spoke with a great deal of pleasure of the part he'took in the Victorian State elections, and of the way in which he helped to defeat the official Country party candidates. We see the result in Victoria today. A Labour Government, returned by a minority, is occupying the Treasury bench, largely because of the internecine differences between the anti-socialist forces-in that State. I shall now' refer to some matters which'have already been mentioned, more { particularly by the honourable member or Darling.: (Mr Blakeley). I regard immigration as the most important subject engaging the attention of the Government. It is of national concern, and . therefore should be dealt with by this Parliament. Indissolubly bound up with immigration is the defence of Australia, wbicb the honourable member for Darling did not see fit to refer to in his general I tirade against the Government. There is usually a good deal of lip service on < the subject of immigration, but unfortunately there the support of it largely stops. The Prime Minister obviously recognizes the importance of immigration, because speaking on the Development and Migration Bill in May of last year, he said- ' i If the prospect of future peace becomes assured under international Taw. we in Australia will eventually be called to the bar of the world's opinion and be asked what we are doing with this great continent If the prospects - of peace be not assured we must increase our population and resources so that we shall have sufficient power and wealth to defend ourselves. M Those are sentiments with which no serious minded member in this chamber, if be takes the'trouble to think, will disagree. The stream of British immigration today to this country is only a trickle compared with what it should be. In 1922, 38,000 immigrants entered the Commonwealth; in 1923, 37,000: in 1924, -< 43,000; in 1925, 37,000; and' in 1926, 42,000. The greatest increase in population by immigration occurred in the decade between 1881 and 1890, during which period the immigration totalled 382,000. Those - figures indicate that a greater number of } immigrants came to Australia years ago than are coming now, and therefore are disquieting. We should tackle this problem courageously and fairly, so that immigrants may be brought bere irrespective of minor difficulties, which are exaggerated in many cases for 1 political reasons. What can be done in other countries can be done here. Palestine is a country not one three-hundredth the size of Australia, and has not more than one-seventh of its population, yet in 1925, 31,000 immigrants entered that ^ country. Greece is a poor country, but with the assistance of a loan of £10,000,000, it settled' on its areas in ' 2£ years some 600,000 refugees from Tur> kestan, and 500,000 in the towns. In i one year immigration in the Argentine f reached 270,000 and in Canada 4UO.000. The increase in the population of the Commonwealth in - the last twenty years ] was only 2,000,000. In the United States i of American the increase was 30,000,000; | in India, 20,000,000; in China, , 41,000,000; and in Japan 13,000,000. r The last named country has an annual increase in population of from 750,000 to 800,000. Our increase is less than one-seventh of that number. I have said j that immigration is indissolubly bound ', up with defence, for obvious reasons, I which I do not propose to discuss. I bave p with me a book entitled Australia: White -' or Yellow., and in. it are some remarks , by an irresponsible speaker a,t a meeting - of the Australian Natives' Association ! held in Melbourne, and some further f remarks by a speaker at a meeting i of the Housewives' Association, also in *- Melbourne. In those remarks the Italian immigrants coming into this country are referred to as "" an olive i influx."" The statements made at , those meetings have been repeated with exaggeration, and reprinted in the prin- cipal Italian newspaper Corriere delta I Sara, and in consequence have given great offence to the Italian people. t I ask the members of this House to reflect \ on the waves of population that are I constantly rolling on in China and Japan, and to think wnat is going to happen to this country if those waves relentlessly j and remorselessly come our way. It is . a question for the statesmen of this coun* try to consider. The phrase "" populate or perish"" is no empty sentiment, but should be pondered upon by every seriousminded man and woman in Australia. Otherwise there may come a time, and much sooner than many honourable memr bers think, when the trident will fall from ' our hands, and the settlement of this country will pass from, us to others more willing to undertake the task. If vernment can give us an assurance that I we are perfectly safe from aggression in , Australia, that our defence is adequate L by reason of our own armaments, and of f the protection we may rely upon from Great Britain, then we can pursue our avocations in the pleasant places in which they bave fallen, without further fear of trouble. If that assurance cannot be' given, and I do not believe it can, then I say that this question should be tackled seriously and courageously, and in conjunction with the question of unemployment, which seems to be such a momentous one from the point of view of our friends on the other side. A great deal has been said on the subject - of Italian immigration. I was present when the Leader of the Opposition .(Mr Charlton) objected in somewhat guarded4erms to the Italian immigrants who are coming to Australia. He probably realized the fact, which is generally known in this House, that wben Italian immigrants come to Australia, they mostly become Labour supporters, and have become, in many cases, a dominating factor in.the selection of Labour representatives. The responsibility for Italians coming to Australia, however, rests largely with the Labour members themselves, and particularly with the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) for the stand he took, when he was in authorityin Queensland. I have here an extract published throughout the press of Australia, from an address delivered by the honourable gentleman at Townsville on the 2nd March, 1925. He is reported to have saidThere could be nothing wrong with the Italians coming to this country. The country required population. It was not half 'populated now. The problems of the country could not be settled until there was a larger population, if the country required population, it was foolish to protest against people coming in. Tbat is a sapient, and ""statesmanlike view, which should commend itself to every member of this House. But Mr Dunstan, the then Assistant Minister for ""Works in Queensland, stated that Mr Theodore was quite out of touch, as far as the Italian question was concerned, with the views, of the Australian Workers' Union, and of the Labour move the Go- ment in the Commonwealth. Thereupon, with that courtesy which has always distinguished the honourable gentleman when the official Labour Executive speaks, be refrained from pressing his opinion. Mr Gillies, who was Premier at the time, said that Mr Theodore's views were quite in accord with his own, but-very soon after that Mr Gillies sought a sheltered and secluded position as a judge of the Arbitration Court, a position for which it is generally agreed he had no qualifications at all. The Prime Minister has pointed out that there are 39,000 immigrants arriving in Australia annually. Included in this number are 4.900 Italians, 2,600 from Southern Europe, and 2,858 from the rest of Europe. venture to say that these figures do not disclose any serious menace to Australia. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) referred to this matter earlier in the session, and the Itala Australe, the Italian newspaper published in Sydney, spoke of the rigbt honourable member's statement in tbese termsIf members of the British race have failed to colonize Australia's tropical belt-and that in our minds has been proven-the n for what reason can Australia forbid its exploitation and development by people of arace as white as the British? It is difficult to answer that statement. We rightly will not permit this country to be developed by black labour, and have - excluded Kanaka labour; but it is difficult to keep out white foreign labour, particularly from Italy, a country which fought side by side with Britain during the war, was one of the most faithful of Great Britain's allies, and probably ob4ained least from the peace settlement. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) said that a quota system should be applied to Italian immigration. He said"" Personally, I take no alarm at the statement that to impose a restriction upon foreigners would cauusc international complications. If necessary, we have the influence of the Empire 'behind us, but I do not think we need entertain the slightest fear that other nations interfere with our domestic affairs. - There are two points in that statement to which I wish to refer. The first is the sublime faith expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in the protection upon which we may rely from the Empire, and the support for which we may look to Britain for any action we see fit to take. Although the honourable gentleman is opposed to the British workman coming here, he is prepared to allow bim to defend our white Australian policy, and to support us in whatever action we may take against a foreign country. That is  not logical. The policy of the Labour party is to foster immigration, but there is always a rigid condition imposed. The attitude of the Labour party in regard to immigration is that, so long as there is a single miner unemployed in the Hunter electorate, no other miner may come in. That was the attitude of the Lang Government I prior to the last election. All nominations for migrants had to receive the < signature of the Minister, and when the nominations came before the Minister he sent them to the unions concerned. If there was a unionist unemployed the nomination was refused. The policy of the Labour party is not a genuine effort to solve the problem of immigration. The < Leader of the Opposition said that no other nation would interfere with our domestic affairs. I say with great respect that this discloses an attitude of short-sightedness, of shutting one's eyes to the teachings of history, and to what is going on in the world about us. ' It -> displays a tendency to confine ourselves within the narrow orbit in which we move. Mr J. H . Thomas, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in the Ramsay MCDonald Government in England, said:We have a million unemployed. The chief reason is, of course, that emigration has practically ceased. The Dominions do not ' want to take our emigrants. When I was responsible for emigration, there were 50,000 willing emigrants on our books waiting for somewhere to go, and there was nowhere for them to go. I would like, with the permission of the House, to read an extract which seems to sum up the attitude of the Labour party ' will on this matter. It is taken from a book called Australia, White or Yellow? by Fleetwood Chidell, and this is the statement of Sir Percival Phillips, the well known war correspondentImmigration is the most important problem in Australia. It excites less popular interest than racing, and many politicians pressed for their views show a marked distaste for discussing it frankly. . . . When you try to get at hard facts you find that the broad topic of immigration leads disconcertingly into a blind alley. You come against a Chinese wall of prejudice maintained by organized labour. Five - Australian States have Labour govern- ^ ments. I have had conversations with Ministers in Queensland and New South Wales, as well as with influential members of their party, and' it must be confessed that the net result is very disappointing. For one thing, ""the Australian official and unofficial view seems to be that only the cream of British manhood need apply for entry. You hear too much about wasters who have failed, and not enough about the workers who have made good. Much of the material that has made the Australian nation would be rejected today by the over-discriminating critics now in charge of its affairs. The dispassionate inquirer into immigration cannot help feelingthat some of the obstacles raised by official and unofficial sentiment arc wholly artificial. . . Labour declares that immigrants that begin on the land usually end in the cities, and so swell the ranks of the unemployed. In the same breath it insists that it is by no means opposed to schemes of immigration, but . . . here is the catch . . . ""until the economic situation rights itself . . . (to use the words of one of the spokesmen of Labour in New South Wales) . . . the influx of new settlers should be strictly limited."" They are careful not to condemn openly the recent agreement between Great Britain and the Federal Government for intensive development of the country-commonl y known as the ""t34,000,000 agreement."" Yet this generous offer of the Mother Country-the most useful incentive to intelligent effort ever held out to any of the Dominions-ha s been received with lukewarm appreciation. . . . There must be a way out. The land is here, and crying out for settlers. Australia's future cannot be cramped for all time by a selfish policy of exclusion. But the people in Great Britain should cherish no illusions that at present the gates are wide open to them. That time has not yet come. That is the attitude of the Labour party. Therefore, it devolves upon the Nation-: alist party to deal with this matter in an effective way which will not disturb the economic basis on which our prosperity rests, but which, at the same time, will populate this country for the material benefit and prosperity of the nation as a whole. I consider that the existence of unemployment is unduly magnified. Only two months ago, while the* State elections were in progress in New South Wales, Mr Lang denied that there was a single unemployed person in New South ""Wales. He published a full-page advertisement in all the newspapers emphasizing the prosperous condition of industry in the State, showing that manufactures were increasing everywhere, and that the prosperity of the country was so great under his Government that there was absolutely no unemployment. Yet today we are told by the honourable gentleman, who has just resumed his seat, that unemployment is r if e throughout the country. There are three great problems that need to be grappled with by this Parliament, and, in enunciating them, I deny the allegation of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) that I desire to lecture any one. I am merely expressing views that I have held for many years. I bave dealt with the first important problemmigration. The second is the establishment of a close economic union between the component parts of the British Empire. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) urged that we should establish the policy of "" Australia for the Australians."" But we cannot live entirely to ourselves. It should be our policy to work in association with the remainder of the British Empire. Our trade relations should be so arranged and the economic position so improved, as to strengthen ' the British Empire. The third important problem is the need for preparing an effective system of defence, in co-operation with the British Empire. The greatest power that exists in - this world today is the British Empire. The future of the British rests, not in Europe or America, but within the four corners of the British Empire. Anything that will strengthen that great structure, which is today the greatest bulwark of peace existent, will tend to promote the peace and happiness of millions of people.",49
83,Mr SCULLIN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Y a r r a ) [ 9 . 1 7 ] - I congratulate the honourable member for War speech, and I am very glad that he received a good hearing, from a well filled committee. I congratulate the honourable member upon having put his case clearly, and with confidence. I recollect my maiden speech, and I confess that I did not feel as confident as the honourable member looked to-night. I think that I might rightly extend my congratulations to the Treasurer and the Government. The speech of the honourable member for Warringah must bave been as the balm of Gilead to the sore wounds of the unfortunate Treasurer and his fellow Ministers. It must have soothed them to hear the honourable member's praise, and his . statement that everything was right, and nothing was wrong. For the first time in three days I saw the Treasurer smile, and any one who knows the Treasurer realizes that something extraordinary is amiss when he fails to smile. The honourable gentleman has been kicked, buffetted and torn asunder by attacks from all sides of this chamber on the latest budget which he has presented, and at last there rises a solitary member wbo can find everything good in it. Perhaps that was due to the child-like faith that the honourable member reposes in the Government. His expression of it was certainly touching. The honourable member's flattery of the Treasurer, the budget, the Government, the Nationalist party, the Country party, and the pact, flowed in one long continuous stream. ""When that flattery was applied to the Government it reminded me of the remark of Brutus to Cassius, wben Cassius complained that Brutus found fault with him, and said that a friendly eye would not see such faults. Brutus repliedA flatterer's would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus. The honourable member failed to see any faults in a budget which has been condemned from every quarter of the chamber, and by every newspaper in Australia, even those supporting the Government. I invite honourable memDers opposite to read the criticism contained in the journals which support their Government. They will find that I speak the truth. The honourable member took to task his colleague, the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), for daring to criticize the budget, and condemned the rigbt honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) for having the temerity to criticize the sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, the dismemberment of the Commonwealth Bank, and so on. He claimed that the place for such criticism was in the party room. Might I suggest that if there is any lecturing to be done about a breach of party policy, it might also be confined to the party room. It is rather Mr Scullin. pleasing to the Labour party,- after all the years during which we bave been described in the Tory press as the Caucus party, to find that at last an honourable member opposite openly preaches the doctrine that caucus should rule, that caucus is the place in wbicb to say these things. The honourable member referred to the subject of migration, upon which be spoke with two voices. He replied to the honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley), wbo made an excellent contribution to the debate, and claimed, in reply to the charge that southern Europeans were being brought in excess numbers to this country, that no one was more responsible for that than the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore). That is one more crime heaped on the head of that unfortunate member. At the same time the honourable mem Der stated that the honourable member for Dalley had made a statesmanlike utterance ! So that the statesmanlike utterance of the honourable member, who approved of migration and had helped to bring migrants here, is linked with the allegation that the Labour party is wholly opposed to the bringing out of a single migrant while there: are unemployed in Australia. Honourable members opposite cannot blow hot and cold with the one breath. The Labour .party cannot be held to be responsible for the influx of migrants from Southern Jiurope and at the same time be charged with being opposed to the introduction of migrants.",52
84,Mr LATHAM,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,Whic h does the honourable member prefer?,53
85,Mr SCULLIN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"I shall tell the honourable gentleman in my own good time. I wisb to deny absolutely the allegation which bas been so frequently repeated that the Labour party is against the introduction of people to Australia while there is a single local man out of employment. I challenge the people who disseminate that mis-statement to specify any occasion on which such a policy has been expounded by this party. The Labour party has laid down a definite policy upon migration, but has never urged that Australia should be held exclusively for the people already here. It has never claimed that this country cannot provide space for millions more, nor has it stated that it will not welcome, at the proper time, millions from overseas to assist in the development of our wonderful resources. But the Labour party does repeat with determination that to bring people thousands of miles from the other side of the world while there is in Australia an army of unemployed, and an army of landhungry people, is a crime against this country and against the millions whom honourable members opposite seek to bring bere. Let me put the acid test upon the Nationalists wbo parade their belief in migration. Let the Government introduce its long-promised unemployed insurance scheme, and protect our unemployed from privation, before contemplating the swelling of the ranks of our unemployed by importing migrants from abroad. Honourable members opposite know that the British Government desires to ri& itself of the unemployed in Great Britain, because of the dole that it bas to pay tnum. Let this Government shoulder its responsibilities, and at least provide sustenance for our unemployed. the honourable member for Warringah whether he has ever experienced the nightmare of unemployment? One of the greatest calamities that can befall a man is to be out of work. No privation is comparable with unemployment. As one man tragically said to me "" If I commit a crime I can be jailed, but at least I am provided with a cover for my head, and a meal. If I lose my reason I shall be provided for. But if I lose my work there is no fund or provision for me; nothing but the pawnshop for the sticks of furniture, and cold charity wben they are exhausted."" And this in a country that boasts of being progressive, that has a government that has been in power for years and that bas talked so long about unemployed insurancel This Government has merely used the term as a catch-cry to win elections. The honourable member for Warringah said that the land is here, and that there are 50,000 people in Great Britain ready to come here, "" all dressed up and nowhere to go."" The honourable member must be aware that in Great Britain there is less land cultivated today than was the case years ago, and that there are more acres of land in Great Britain reserved as - deer parks or for grouse shooting than was the case twenty years ago. Great Britain, which appealed to its manhood during the great war to "" Come forward, your country wants you "" is now placarding its streets with "" Get out to Australia; your country can no longer keep you."" The land in Australia, as in Great Britain, is locked up by our land monopolists, yet we have a Treasurer reducing taxation to assist those monopolists to resist the breaking up of great estates, a process which has been going on all too slowly. The Labour party has endeavoured to provide land for our people, but has met with strenuous resistance from honourable members opposite. We would gladly welcome our kinsmen from overseas. Most of us sprang from men and women who came from the Britisli Isles, driven out by the curse of landlordism that existed there, and crushed into poverty. Our parents or grandparents came to this great broad land in the hope and belief that here they would never witness land monopoly such I ask as they had seen in the Old Country; only to find that, in less than half a century, that course is even more prevalent in Australia than it was in Great Britain. Now let me deal with the budget. The honourable member for Warringah asked why the Treasurer should be held to be personally responsible for it, and said that his budget statement was submitted to the Cabinet for approval. I agree with that. There is no room ior a personal attack upon the Treasurer for this budget. The responsibility for it rests upon the Government. It is the Government's budget, and as such we attack it where it is wrong, and commend it where it is right. I do not propose TO traverse the budget speech. The ""figures were dealt with a day or so ago by the Leader of the Opposition in one of the most comprehensive budget reviews that has ever been presented to this Parliament. The honourable member laid bare the facts. I desire to do my part, humble thought it may be, as a member of this great Parliament to place before the Government the serious position in which the Commonwealth stands in respect to its adverse trade balance. I shall concentrate my attention on that one point. When it is clear that we are either approaching or have reached a crisis, we should, as private members, irrespective of party considerations, do our best to face the situation and if possible find a remedy for it. We ought to bring the facts under the notice of the Government in sucb a way that they cannot be overlooked. In my opinion we could profitably devote a session, or at least the greater part of one, to the consideration of the economic and financial position of Australia. We should do well to confer round the table, forgetful of party distinctions, in order to find a way out of our difficulties. I have no desire to say a word that will weaken the credit of Australia. I know that our country is passing through a critical period. The Treasurer bas to convert large loans, and I do not desire to do or say anything that may bave tht. effect of destroying our credit. I believe that Australia has more than sufficient assets to offset every penny that she owes. But that is no reason why we should not call a halt before we go so far that we cannot truthfully make such a statement. The balance of trade, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, is worse today than it bas ever before been in our history. Plainly the present state of affairs cannot be allowed.to continue. Imports have been flooding this country for some years, with the result that many of our industries bave been strangled, and many of our people bave lost their means of livelihood. Every honourable member on this side of the chamber who bas discussed this subject bas suggested a remedy. Our proposal may not be acceptable to honourable members opposite, but it is honestly made. The Leader of the Opposition requested, and the honourable member for Dalley and other honourable members emphasized his request, that the Government should do something to stem the flood of imports which is overwhelming us. It bas been suggested that we should even go to the extent of prohibiting certain commodities from entering into the country. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) this Mr Scullin. afternoon presented a telling array of facts to support the theory upon which our argument is based.",53
86,Mr RODGEKS,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,We should act most effectively if we refused to borrow to pay for the goods which are being imported.,55
87,Mr SCULLIN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"The speech whicu the honourable member for Wannon delivered a day or so ago on that aspect 01 the case was sound, and I agree with his view, though not quite to the extent that we should absolutely cease borrowing for every purpose. I do not think that the honourable member intended to go quite so far as that.",55
88,Mr RODGEKS,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,I did not.,55
89,Mr SCTJLLIN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Generally speaking the speech of the honourable member on the trade balance was sound. It bas also been suggested that the Government should change its financial methods. Some time ago I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs  a statement showing how much of our Customs revenue was derived from protective duties, and how much from purely revenue duties. Up to the present I have not received it. The honourable member for Dalley, in the course of his speech, pointed out that revenue duties fell mostly upon the workers. The more effective a protectionist policy is the less revenue it yields. On that argument it must be frankly admitted that the protective policy of this Government is signally failing to achieve its purpose, for our revenue from Customs duties is increasing annually. Of course, some of our duties are imposed frankly for revenue purposes. Our excise duties are also imposed for revenue purposes, though I would maintain some of them for other reasons. I have taken the risk of analyzing the Customs figures without the aid of the official information which I sought, and I take the responsibility of saying that 50 per cent, of our Customs revenue is derived from purely revenue duties; the remainder comes from protective duties, some of .which border upon revenue duties.",55
90,Mr GREGORY,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,On what do the other duties border?,55
91,Mr SCULLIN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"They border on effective protection; and we would have effective protection were it not for the fact certain representatives of the Country party are members of the Cabinet. I consider it to be the duty of every honourable member to call the attention of the Government to the totally unsatisfactory economic condition of the country, even though they may have no remedy to suggest. The Government should find the remedy. It cannot evade its responsibility by saying "" You show us the remedy."" A government which, after five years of office, would make a request like that would show itself to be totally unfit to govern, and should resign. A Nationalist government in Tasmania frankly admitted that it could not satisfactorily finance the country, and handed over the reins of government to the Labour party, which at that time was in the minority, with the result, as ths honourable member for ""Wannon pointed out th3 other night, that Tasmania is one of the Australian States that is making an attempt to square its ledger. In the Federal sphere the Labour party, prior to the 1910 election, strongly criticized the fiscal methods of the fusion government that was then in office. It will be remembered that that government caused Parliament to pass a bill to provide for a loan for the purpose of paying - for the first ships of the Australian navy. At the election which followed the government was defeated, but although the Labour government which succeeded it found the Treasury coffers empty, and had to face a deficit of more than £500,000, it repealed the Naval Loan Act, paid for the vessels out of revenue, extended postal, telephonic aud telegraphic facilities in our outback areas to a greater extent in three years than preceding governments had done in ten years, and went out of office in 1913 leaving its successors with a surplus of £3,000,000 During the whole bf its regime it did not borrow a single penny. The Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members on this side of the chamber have placed our position before the Government so clearly that it cannot be mistaken.",56
92,Mr RODGEKS,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"I remember a time when-we lost our trade balance through failure of our harvest; but, as a Government, we refused to export gold or borrow that money from abroad to overcome our difficulties, and the position soon righted itself. We stopped importing.",56
93,Mr SCULLIN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Tbi s Government, bas totally failed to realise the gravity of our position. The Treasurer in the course of his budget speech did not say a word about our adverse trade balance. Although the subject bas been dealt with in innumerable newspaper articles, and has been discussed on scores of public platforms by members of both the Nationalist and Labour parties, I cannot remember that the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), or the Treasurer has ever said a word which would lead the people to believe that they regard the outlook as serious. It is true that both the right honourable gentleman and his colleagues bave, on occasions, said that this State or the other has contributed to the situation; but there has not been the slightest acknowledgment of the fact that, irrespective of who may be responsible for it, the National Government is in duty bound to attempt to remedy it, for it controls the imports and exports of the country, and to a large extent it influences its financial policy. During the debate on the Loan Bill I drew the attention of the Treasurer to our parlous position, and in reply he flew from one State to another in an endeavour to place the responsibility on the shoulders of other people. He said, "" Mr Lang is responsible;"" but the balance of trade was against us before Mr Lang's Government. assumed office. Other honourable gentlemen rushed off to Queensland. They said that the financial record of the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore), as Leader of the Queensland Labour Government, was such that be must be held partly responsible. We should have no objection to either the Treasurer or his supporters drawing attention to the financial record of Labour Governments in Queensland, if they would do it fairly; but they never discuss it without omitting salient facts in the case. They never tell us, for instance, that Queensland is one of the States in the Commonwealth which for years bas bad a favourable trade balance. During the last five years the trade balance of the Commonwealth has the gone back to the extent of £60,000,000, while,the trade balance of Queensland is on the right side by £33,000,000.",56
94,Mr THEODOBE,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,It has increased every year.,57
95,Mr SCTJLLIN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"That is a fact. Whenever the Treasurer is faced with these facts he sets about picking figures from this year and that year, like a cockatoo picking up grain in a field, in order to prove the particular point he is trying to make. In iny speech on the 'motion for the second reading of the Loan Bill I used certain figures to show that the indebtedness of the nation had increased seriously since the 30th June, 1923. I took that year as the starting point of my calculations, for it was the first complete year in which the Treasurer had control of our finances. But the honourable gentleman said, "" Go back to the 30th June, 1922, and you will find that instead of our indebtedness having increased by £S,000,000, it bas only increased by £l,700,000."" Does the Treao surer claim all the credit for that year, seeing that he was in office for only or five months of it? If so, he seriously discredits his predecessor who is now his leader. The honourable gentleman, in his anxiety to justify himself, stated, in his reply to my remarks, that the Commonwealth debt on the 30th June, 1922, was £364,840,000, whereas on the 30th June, 1927, it was £366,611,000, showing an increase for the whole period of only £1,771.000. All I have to say in reply to that is that if in the first few months of his administration the Treasurer could bring about sucb a big alteration, it is all the more discreditable to bim that, after four years' administration, he is £8,000,000 to the bad. The Commonwealth debt at the 30th June, 1923, was £35S,509,000. as against £366,611,000 in 1927. What is the explanation of the difference between the years 1922 and 1923 that the Treasurer should take the advantage of the former to show that there has been practically no increase in the national debt? On the SOth June, 1922, the debt was £364,000,000. On the 30th June, 1923, it had been reduced by over £6,000,000. For that the honourable gentleman took credit to himself, but he did not tell the House that on 30th June, 1922, £9,000,000 of unexpended borrowed money was on hand in the Treasury. I draw attention to the matter only to show that whether our comparison goes back to 1921, 1922 or 1923, the fact remains that the debt has increased, although we are being told by the Treasurer that it is decreasing. He said, "" I have lifted off Australia the heavy dead weight - of war debt."" One would think that the war debt, differed in some mysterious way from any other; that there was something particularly malignant about it. What difference does it make to the debt whether it - was for war or for anything else? Begardless of the purpose for which the money was borrowed the people who owe it must pay the interest on it. The Treasurer has lifted the dead weight of war debt, but he has imposed another debt, and what is the net result? For the four years 1923-27, the debt due in Australia has been decreased by £20,327,000, while the debt due overseas has been increased by £2S,429,000, a net increase of four £8,102,000. Is that of any advantage to t.he people of Australia? Is not the continual drain of interest drawing the life blood out of the country. Is not that £28,000,000 of overseas borrowing largely responsible for the flood of imports, because no one with the intelligence of even a child will deny that loans floated overseas are either used for the payment of interest on debts* already existing there, or come to this country in the form of goods. Wben the honourable the Minister for Trade and Customs  made several well-considered and thoughtful speeches. On the 31st August, 1922, he saidIt is bad finance not to pay as much as we possibly can off the public debt in times of prosperity. We have bad good seasons for the last six or seven years, and according to the honourable gentleman, it is bad finance for this Government to be increasing our indebtedness instead of reducing it. On the 1st April, 1924, he saidWhen we borrow in London we make a rod for our own backs, place a premium on the importation of goods, and hamstring our own industrial development. During the last fifteen months the imports to this country have amounted to £206,000,000. The"" excess of imports over exports has been £30,000,000, average of £2,000.000 a month-creatin one of the most serious positions that this country has ever been in. The Minister for Trade and Customs also said in April, 3924Development does not consist in London credits or buying London goods; consists in the work of our own people. Borrowing abroad should cease. Instead of ceasing, borrowing has inholders creased, and the honourable gentleman has remained in the Ministry while this has been going on. I come now to what were the aspirations of the Treasurer when he was a private member. Speakduced, ing in this House on the 13th October. 1920, he s a i d It is not creditable to Australia to tinually appealing to the old country money. . . . We should cut our coat aclessening cording to our cloth. . . . We should down to bed-rock. Yet the Treasurer announced the other day that the policy of this Government is to float loans overseas and not in Australia. When he was a private member, his advice was to cut down to bed-rock; but as Treasurer he causes our indebtedto ness and borrowing to soar over the highest financial mountain tops. made an even stronger statement on that - occasion. He saidIt is questionable whether we shout tinue the policy of public works development. That was drastic, because it implied - discontinuance of borrowing. No miser was ever more niggardly in the conservawitb tion of public funds than the Treasurer as a private member would have been. But behold him now! No body was ever more prodigal than be is as Treasurer. He smiles over theexpenditure of milpublic lions. He merely laughs when we speak of an adverse trade balance, and a as. huge as high Olympus."" Of course, he is in the seats of the gods; be looks - down from Olympian heights and to bim all is well. In 1920 he adopted this - self-denying attitude- Now is the time when we should tax selves with the object of reducing our - debt. And now, when he could do it, he creases the debt and reduces the taxation imposed on the land monopolist. Debts an were incurred for the defence of Ausg tralia, and interest upon them has to be paid, but a big slice is to be taken off the land taxation imposed on wealthy landholders, and people enjoying large incomes are to benefit by the reduction of having income taxation. While the revenue it duties are being piled higher and higher on the masses of the people, the taxation on the drawers of big incomes and the of land exceeding in unimproved value £5,000, is. to be reduced. If the £500,000 of land tax which the Treasurer is about to remit, and the £1,300,000 by which the income taxation will bs' rewere placed into the sinking fund, it would, in the period allotted for that fund, wipe out the total Commonwealth be condebt of £360,000,000. The Treasurer, for who is piling up the public debt and the taxation obligations of the cut wealthy, is identical with the private member wbo said, "" Now is the time when we should tax ourselves with the object of reducing our public debt."" Without weakening the credit of this country, I and other members have felt impelled to utter a word of warning as the direction in which we are proceeding. In the forest or on the plains the He wise bushman, if uncertain of his track, looks back to the landmarks behind him to get a direction for his further progress. 1 conAnd I ask honourable members to glance back over half a century of the history of a Australia for guidance as to our future. From the year 1876 to the year-1891, the exception of the one year 1880j our imports exceeded the exports. During the ten years 1882 to 1891 inclusive, the proportion of imports to exports was as £100 is to £79. From 1880 to 1892. the debt increased from £61,000.000 to £138,000,000, an increase of 150 per debt cent. Prior to 1892 the country witnessed an orgy of extravagance. After the period of boom and borrowing came the burst, and the banks closed their fine doors on the hard-won earnings of the people. Then followed a period ourof deflation and distress, the like public of which I hope we shall njever witness again. But a change came inover the scene. For the 30 years from 1S92 to 1912 the exports were in excess of the imports every year. In the next ten years were five in which the exports were in excess of the imports, and five in which the imports were the greater. But over the whole 30 years from 1892 to 1922 there was a huge excess of exports. Then the present Treasurer took command, aud since that time there has been an adverse trade balance year after year with one exception. In the last five years and three months the adverse trade balance has totalled £66,000,000. During that same period we bad to pay in interest on overseas public debts, State and Commonwealth, over £100,000,000, so that the country went to leeward by £166,000,000. That sort of thing cannot continue. If during those five years the country had experienced drought and bad seasons, we could philosophically say that with the return of normal seasons we should recover our position. But calculations indicate that there will be a decline of £20,000,000 in the exports ef our two staple products, wheat and wool, in comparison with last year. If the d r if t continues we shall be £50,000,000 on the wrong side of the ledger next year apart from onr interest obligations. I hope that that estimate may prove to be wrong. Looking abroad for examples to guide us, and to ascertain the relation of overseas loans to imports and exports, I find that overseas loans floated in Great B r it a in in 1926 were £205,000,000 below the 1913 standard, whilst the exports declined £188,000,000. Those figures approximately balance. The United States in 1913 was a borrowing nation, but in 1926 it exported £167,000,000 worth of goods more than in 1913, and it lent overseas £100,000,000 net. again was a fair l y close approximation of the totals, showing a close relationship between lending and exports, and 'borrowing and imports. ""We should not use borrowed money for all new works. Some of the so-called new works are not permanent ancl not productive. Last year the Government spent on public works only £216,000 out of revenue, and £7,000,000 out of loan. Tu 1921-22, £2,571,000 was spent out of revenue and £5,246,000 out of loan. While the expenditure out of revenue decreased by £2,355,000 in 1926-27 as compared with 1921-22, the loan expenditure in Mr Scullin. creased by £1,754,000. It is easy to borrow money for the purpose of providing a surplus, and then talk of 'clever financing. The Industrial Australian and Minin g Standard, which is a strongly Nationalist newspaper, makes critical calculations regarding financial matters. Beferring to the Prime Minister, it stated on the 11th August lastIn all Ills years of office we have not heard Mr Bruce utter one syllable of concern ior the dangerous drift in our national finance. In its issue of the 2lst July last, that journal made the following criticismDuring the Bruce Govern menfs term of office, over-trading overseas has been the rule, and heavy adverse trade balances have been our annual portion. What wonder that money has become "" t i g h t"" and unemployment serious. . . . The Federal balance-sheet for the year just ended is nothing short of a disgrace to its authors. I have risen to. draw pointed attention to the serious position that Australia must face, and I urge the Government to take steps to remedy it . The country is being flooded with imported goods that could be made bere. I desire to see our manufactures built up, and better markets provided for our primary producers, so that prices may be stabilized and the producers given a fair return for their labour. I want our industries, primary and secondary, to march side by side, so that the trade balance may become favourable and the nation made prosperous. by Wr. PROWSE (Eorrest) [ 1 0 . 3 ] - I compliment the Treasurer on his expert and explicit presentation of the national balance-sheet. The present serious financial position of AusThere tralia is revealed, and it behoves every honourable member to criticize the budget helpfully, and not destructively. I was pleased to hear the suggestion of the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr . Scullin) that a complete session should be devoted to the consideration of the situation. I cannot support the Leader of the Opposition in his censure amendment, to reduce the item by £ 1 . It might have carried some weight if he and his party had not assisted in bringing about the present position; but they have supported high tariffs, high wages, high costs of production and shorter hours of work, all of which have led to reduced exports and increased imports. The honourable member for Yarra took a glance backwards over a period of 50 years. He showed that, up to 1922, Australia had bad a favourable trade balance, but since 1922 it had bad an adverse one. referred to the need for manufacturing goods locally so that heavy imports would be unnecessary. I remind him that the period since 1922 synchronises with the advent of the highest tariff that bas been imposed in this country. When the Massey-Greene tariff was brought before Parliament in 1920, we were assured by the then Minister for Trade and Customs and those who supported him that it would have the effect of reducing imports; but an opposite effect has been experienced, and the adverse balance has increased. If the ambition of the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) were realized, it would be further increased. I propose to consider t/he budget independently, and I am prepared to discuss with other honourable members means whereby, if we bave gone on the wrong road, we may retrace our steps. Many references have been made to the prevalence of unemployment and the danger of the accentuation of that evil. If blame there be, it lies at the door of this Parliament, and it is for us to nnd the remedy. The responsibility of the Opposition in this matter-is as great as that of the supporters of the Ministry. The honourable member for Darling praised the present Minister for Trade and Customs, but personally I consider him largely to blame for the present position. Persons of all shades of political opinion recognize that "" something is rotten in the State of Denmark."" The Prime Minister, shortly after he took office, stated at the Sydney Show that if protectiou was to be the policy of Australia, we should have all-round protection. That was a reasonable statement. If protection is to be the policy, all Australians, including the primary producers, should enjoy it. But would it be statesmanlike to advocate protection all round? If all the people in Australia lean on one another, how shall we pay off the national debt? remedy for ' our present unsatisfactory economic position is more industries and more of our people,standing on their own feet. The Treasurer has expressed his views in these words:The effective action that should be taken by the farmer was to make the present vicious circle of increasing tariff protection, increasing nominal wages, increasing prices, and He 'decreasing effective wages complete by himself getting into it. His lion-participation alone made it possible for the present system to be maintained. I should not regard that as statesmanlike. With the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) I fear that the disasters of 1892 and 1893 may again overwhelm this country if primary producers join in the vicious circle. It might be natural for them to endeavour to get their share of the national spoils while they last; but in the long run Australia would be confronted with disaster. I should like to see a definite move for a solution of tbese problems from a non-party point of view. The policy of the Labour party seems to be protection-and still more protection, leading to absolute prohibition, with all its attendant evils. The honourable member for War say about loyalty in the party room. These issues are too important to be dealt with by any hole-and-corner method; they should be discussed on the floor of this House. I believe the present Government to be perfectly sincere. Certainly I should prefer its administration of the finances to that of the Opposition. In practice the policy of honourable members opposite works out badly. Honourable members know what my attitude has been in this House for the last eight years. I have no desire to be obstructive. I know that I have earned the odium of a number of honourable members because of my views on certain subjects; but time will justify me. Let me now direct attention to the following warning issued by Sir Lennon Baws, and published in the Sydney Morning Herald on the 8th inst.:"" We in Australia are beginning to be. troubled as they are in Britain about the excess of imports,"" said Sir Lennon Raws, ""but our troubles are much simpler than theirs, because they are entirely of our own making. Our high imports are caused, firstly, The by excessive borrowing overseas, and, secondly, by higlr costs of production. There are several factors affecting costs. The Tariff Board, in its last annual report, said that it was profoundly convinced that if Australian industry is tu be maintained and safeguarded it is absolutely essential that the serious menace of rising costs of production Bhould be recognized. There is no doubt that our costs are being continually pushed up by our industrial system. So far the menace of this has not been sufficiently recognized owing,, firstly, to the inflationary effect of overseas borrowing, and, secondly, to the good seasons and high prices obtained for exportable products which have masked the evils of the rapidly-increasing costs of production. Now that the upward movement of tile world's prices has been checked definitely, the mask is being removed, and the menace of high costs is disclosing ^tself. I hope that the warning of the Tariff Board will be heeded now that the seriousness of the position is being brought home to people by slackness of trade, less favourable prospects in the agricultural and pastoral industries, the impoverishment of State governments, and the heavy toll exacted by the enormous Customs revenue. Australia seems to be moving in the opposite drection from that in which the remainder of the world is moving,"" continued Sir Lennon Raws. "" Its local market is contracting as the cost of transport rises, whereas the movement elsewhere is towards expanding the area of the home market. Its cost of production are rising, whereas elsewhere every nerve is being strained to reduce costs. It is shackling its industries with control boards, price-fixing associations, and the like, in a futile eflort te maintain price, while the other countries are looking foi° profit margins duction of costs, and are viewing with comparative equanimity price reductions because they arc an incentive towards increased consumption."" I thoroughly endorse that view. honourable member for Darling Blakeley) spoke a little while ago of effective protection. I do not know if the honourable member is aware that the protection afforded to the Australian facturers is more than the equivalent of the wages paid in our secondary tries. If the protection, given to our industries is equivalent to the whole of the labour employed in it, and that is actually the case, surely as a result of getting the services of the workmen in Australia for nothing this country have developed to a much extent than it has done. The levying of Customs duties amounting £44,000,000 imposes upon the people a tax amounting to over £120,000,000. I do not think any one compute at less than that the cost of living of a handful of people such as is in Australia today. The effect must be to retard the progress of this  country and to prevent it from competing with other countries. This Parliament cannot wink at the facts. At the close of one of the discussions of the Industrial Mission in the United States of America recently, Mr Barnes appealed to the members of the mission not to go home feeling that America was the land where only dollars mattered. He saidWe were once very slow here. We were twenty years behind Britain in putting a steam engine on two rails, but we are moving fast now. We want to convince you that the prosperity of a country is not built upon war profits, but on accumulated knowledge. We have a profound belief that we are trying to eliminate the spectre of insecurity which over-shadows every man everywhere. I ask honourable members to listen to thisThe more we produce per man the mure tliere is to divide per family. That is our philosophy. Wages, dividends and profits are up, and costs are down. The increase in the use of machines has not meant unemployment. When a magnetic crane handled by two men began doing the work done the day previously by 128 men, it did not mean that 120 men were discharged. Those two statements show indisputably in re- the way in which Australia should shape its future course. We hear much about tht self-containment of Australia, but it is an impossible proposition, and has The never been attained in the world's his(Mr tory. The recent findings of the world's economic conference at Geneva are of paramount importance. Representatives of all nations assembled there, and 1 manu- believe the Opposition in this House were represented. The conference deliberated, indusand the following is an epitome of its conclusions:(1) That tariff walls must be reduced in the interests of the world as well as in the interests of each particular nation. (2) That primary production must be freed from the shackles that add to production should costs. greater (3) That private enterprise shall not be interfered with by socialistic activities. to (4) That no nation in modern civilization can be self-contained and make progress. (5) That national efficiency must be inwould creased in all countries to improve the material welfare of the people. figure Tbis Parliament cannot afford to disregard those findings. If we take up a conceited attitude, if we set our opinions against the conclusions formulated by a congress of world's representatives, we shall be acting against the interests of primary production and of the nation generally. The honourable  spoke of the importance of immigration to this country, and I thoroughly agree with him. He referred to the possible menace to Australia from the Orient, and the recent transformation that had taken place in China, a country with a population of over 400,000,000, in respect ofmilitary and other matters. It certainly behoves us as a National Parliament to make some attempt to keep this country for the white races. It is all very fine to talk about the importance of bringing immigrants here and finding work for them. To-day we bave an economically unsound position in Australia. Our wages are high, and our standards „ are beyond those of other countries We cannot, therefore, expect to sell our goods so costly produced in competition with other countries. We have no markets for the products of immigrants that settle bere, and our great difficulty today is to find payable markets overseas. The' cost of living burden of £120,000,000 must ultimately rest, either directly or indirectly, upon the primary producers. How can we expect them to produce wheat, butter, and fruit when our high standards prevents them from competing successfully in the markets of the world. The Economic Conference at Geneva stated that the primary producers should be unshackled. To-day our primary producers are heavily shackled, and they must be freed if we are to have a satisfactory trade balance. I shall not support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Our first duty is to put our own house in order. Every immigrant that comes to Western Australia pays £6 per head in Customs duties. Money has to be borrowed to place immigrants on the land, thus increasing the national debt by 2s. a head. But that burden will really be greater, because the immigrants will not for some time contribute to the revenue except indirectly. They will remain a burden upon the taxpayers of this country until such time as their products can compete successfully in the markets of the world. [60] It is the duty of the manufacturers and those whom they employ to give a fairer deal to the man on the land who is making it possible for tbem to carry out their manufacturing operations. Australia is financed to the extent of over 96 per cent, on the credit of primary products as only 4 per cent, of our exports consist of the products from all other sources. An honourable member referred to the necessity for effective protection on motor tires. What is effective protection? As the protection afforded manufacturers more than pays the wages of the employees, I should like to know what becomes of the balance, or what he considers effective protection. There are combines of manufacturers in Australia and of unions, which, in addition to the assistance of the tariff, extract all that is possible from the consumers and producers. I am as anxious as is any other honourable member to see goods manufactured in Australia, but I wish the manufacturers and the operatives to give the other fellow a fair deal. Some persons wonder wby large quantities of goods are still imported when such high protective duties are imposed. The Tariff Board has now come to the conclusion that in recommending higher duties, it has been operating along wrong lines, as it has distinctly stated that immediately a manufacturer receives additional protection, the unions ask that the workmen shall be paid higher wages. A definite appeal is being made to the Government for increased duties on timber, and before they bave been conceded the timber workers are asking for higher wages and shorter working hours. That is the position we have to face. Is it not time that the Government dealt with this problem in a constructive manner? One of the finest acts of this Government has been to dispense with one of its unprofitable undertakings that have been hindering the progress of this country. I refer to the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. If the Government would dispose of other unprofitable institutions that are shackling industry it would be entering upon the high road to prosperity. Australia is the finest country in the world, and offers the greatest possibilities in the matter of liquidating the national debt. The Prime Minister, in Western Australia some time ago, said that his Government was not responsible for the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth, but that previous governments created it. He as the Leader of the Government is responsible for increases in the tariff during his term of office. He further said that the tariff must be scientifically examined, and he pointed out how some industries were protected to the detriment of others. He instanced the wool tops and textile industries, and said that if the former were assisted, the .latter would also need help. In sucb cases be contended that it would be better to dispense with one industry and concentrate upon the other. We have natural secondary and primary industries in Australia. The woollen industry should be our main secondary industry and one wbicb should make Australia wealthy; but under our present economic conditions we cannot manufacture woollen goods and sell them overseas in competition with the manufacturers of other countries. How can people be induced to come to Australia if they cannot be profitably ployed. Our so-called high standard of living is really a low standard, because the high wages men receive do not place them in a better position. If we could successfully compete with outside manufacturers the cost of living would be reduced, and workers would be receiving the benefit of the wages they are paid. We bave been told that all'the motor tires used in Australia could be made here. Possibly they could, but at what price. The present duty on motor tires is 115^ per cent., which should be suflicient protection to enable an industry to carry on successfully in Australia. Is the Australian manufacturer so far behind his American competitor that he cannot compete with bim in trade? A small-sized Eord motor tire is delivered f.o.b. New York, at f l 6s. 5d., and our Customs duty on it is f l 10s. 7^d., or more than the cost of the article. A big bus cord tire can be purchased f.o.b. in ""New York for f l l 15s. 5d., but the duty to * bring it into Australia amounts to flO 18s. 9d. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) said we want effective protection.' If effec tive protection means having to pay prices like that for our tires in Australia it is the most serious indictment on Australia that could be made. Nowadays locomotion by motor is the order of the day. Transport is as important as anything else in the back country where long distances have to be. covered. The primary producer is using these tires to convey his produce to market, and the effect of, the existing duties is that he is running on tires which cost bim 115 per cent, more than his competitors in other countries bave to pay. This increases the cost of living, and the man employed on the railway must be paid accordingly. Eventually the higher wages for the railway workers have to be paid by the men 1 on the land, because higher wages can only be met by increasing the freight on primary produce. The Tariff Board itself has pointed out tbese things, and asked us to regard them as a warning. o",57
96,Mr FENTON,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Does the honourable member think that the Prime Minister agrees with the resolution carried by the Economic Conference ?  is of age. The honourable member can ask bim the question himself. I believe the Prime Minister will be prepared to make an effort to enable Australia to place her house in order, and that he ' and many others are prepared to set to work to that end. Australia's debts, both Federal and State, amount to over fl,000,000,000, which is double what the public debt of the United Kingdom was prior to the war. The debt of the United Kingdom was borne by 45,000,000 people, whereas we have a population of only 6,000,000. Yet people here are asking for a shorter working week, higher pay, and protected industries. We bave heard criticism of the adverse trade balance, and have had a want of confidence motion from the very s people who are_ largely responsible for the conditions of which they complain. The debt of £1,000,000,000 includes the war debt, and I think that debt is justified by the freedom that we enjoy. For that debt we bave a corresponding asset if we use it rightly. The budget, however, shows that we are taking sustenance from the roots of the tree instead of picking the fruit from, the branches. I do not believe that the Treasurer himself believes in what he is doing. Much of the criticism levelled against him, in view of his contradictory utterances before and after be assumed office, are justified from the point of view of the Opposition. When he found the majority of the people of Australia backing an-unsound policy, he was forced to support it against his will, which I personally approve. I know that the Treasurer believes that as much money as possible should be left in the bands of industry. I think it could be shown that many of the industries now being carried on in Australia, and supported by honourable members in this House, are of no assistance to the country. The boot industry is carrying on at a loss in Australia. Even if the Treasurer were to continue to pay every man and woman employed in it the wages they are now receiving, the industry could be discontinued, and the country would show a profit on the transaction. I believe that the match industry is in a very similar position. There is an impossible attempt to make Australia self-contained. Those who support that policy think that other people should buy our goods, but that we should not buy anything from others. We have our White Australia policy, and I thank God for it, but we must demonstrate that a White Australia can be run efficiently. Money from Japan, which is in return for our produce, is just as good as money from any other country. During one year recently Japan bought goods to the value of £16,000.000' from as, while we bought from Japan products to the value of only two or three million pounds, spent mostly on such things as matches and silk. Is it wrong for Australia to support a policy of trade reciprocity with other countries? We are cutting off our noses to spite our faces, and setting up industries, sucb y's our pettifogging match industry, which., are being run at a loss. The figures relating to our trade with J apan should con vince us that this is not. a policy to make our country progress, or extend its development. Anything bf advantage to a country should be done, but anything likely to be a deadloss should be pruned away, and we should confine our attention to the jobs that are likely to pay.",63
97,Mr WATKINS,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Would the honourable member rather borrow money from America?  less money for Australia if we made more use of what we do borrow. We are not getting proper value for the money we spend. We have not the asset value for our foreign loans that we ought to have.' In the past we made good use of the money we borrowed, but I am very much afraid, that today we are not geeting value. For instance, can any one say we are getting value for the money we are spending on roads? I say that we are not getting half the value we should get. There seems to be a sad want of sympathy between workers and employers. Many workers seem to think that all they have to do is to watch the clock and they will get their money no matter what work they do.",64
98,Mr MCGRATH,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"That is a lot of rot.  advice that bas led men astray. During his period of office, the Treasurer has collected from customs taxation approximately £70,000,000 more than was collected in the immediately preceding five years. The Government is pledging futurity in regard to road construction, housing, and other schemes. Because the housing scheme was promised by the Government at the last election, I supported the Housing Bill, but I think there are other things that should have received attention before that. The. scheme is not urgent. It would be better to utilize the money for the further development of our primary indus-,, tries. This pledging of futurity at a period when the revenue is at its peak is a mistake, because the recent drought will make next year's balance very much more serious than the present one, and money will be of far more im-portance in the near future than it ' appears to.be at the present time. The Government and Parliament have been led to believe that our revenue is coming from a permanent source, but if the theory of ^be protectionists is right, our Customs revenue will decrease. ""We cannot expect to manufacture goods in Australia and get £44,000,000 from duties on imported goods - The Government is pledging futurity on the assumption that the fiscal policy of Australia will not succeed. If that policy should succeed, it is not justified in doing so. Before the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) became a member of this House, he said that if the Governments of Australia had given half the attention to the development of the primary resources of this country that they gave to the development of its secondary industries, the wealth of Australia would be double, if not treble, what it was at the time when he spoke. If the secondary industries could show me how they are helping the primary producer to pay off some of our national debt, they would have my greatest sympathy and help, bnt there is no instance they can show me in which they have given that help. On the other hand, I can show them many instances in which they have hindered Australia's, efforts to bear the national burden of its debt. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, and other ardent protectionists, should pause and think whether they are acting fairly in allowing combines to shelter behind the wall of protection. It would have shocked Australia to its foundations if Mr Tudor had brought down the tariff that we bave today. But the tariff we have today was imposed, not for protectionist, but for revenue purposes to finance the country during the war time, and the singular about it is that the manufacturers and those employed by them have found a way of assimilating the advantages afforded by the tariff to the detriment of Australia as a whole. I should have no objection to the present tariff remaining as it is if the manufacturers and workers of Australia would play fair and sell at world's competitive prices, but they will not do so. I can give honourable members some statistics on this point. Sutcliffe, of the Commonwealth Statistician's Department in his recently published thesis entitled The National Dividend, shows that the earnings of half the adult bread-winners of Australia average £3 5s. 6d. weekly. This means that rf we take the purchasing value of the sovereign as compared with pre-war  days at 12s., the purchasing value of their weekly earnings is reduced to £1 19s. 3d. Honourable members would have regarded £1 19s. 3d. as a low wage i a past years, but it would be equal to £3 5s. 6d. at the present time. Does that axiomatical fact ever occur to honourable members?",64
99,Mr SCULLIN,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Of course it does.  increased wages' standard of today is to stop the extension of our industries, create unemployment, and prevent the sale of our goods in the world's market. A wage of £1 19s. 6d. is as good as a wage of £3 15s. 6d. under the conditions in which they separately apply. In - I eluded in the adult bread-winners whose average weekly earnings are £3 5s. 6d., are all classes of the community, wage and salary earners, numbering 645,000, and all others, numbering 304,001). That is to say, large numbers of primary producers, farm workers, small storekeepers, small investors, returned soldiers, as well as many engaged in highly-protected manufactures, are earning this average weekly wage. Honourable members realise from that exactly what the position is. They will also realise that the solution of the problem is not to increase wages and grant shorter hours. All should give adequate value for the payment received. * What is wrong with Australia's primary industries? Mr Ambrose Pratt, of the Australian Industries Preservation thing League, states that there were 7,000 fewer farmers and 40,000 fewer farms in 1925 than in 1916, and that there were 1,250,000 less acres under cultivation. 1 And within the next decade Australia will have to find £476,000,000 to meet loan renewals! Surely that is a matter for the serious consideration of any parliament. I was greatly disgusted when I noticed the disinclination of the Tariff Board to bear the views of a lecturer on Mr economics from the Sydney University. One of the members of the Tariff Board seemed to be quite shocked that the professor should have the impertinence to appear before the board to give evidence. The board waut to hear only what manufacturers have to tell it. It does not ^ want to hear a man who is unbiased, and wbo is thoroughly conversant with economics. It would be beneficial to Aus- in that direction? tralia if the political bias which surrounds the consideration of such questions were overcome, and a board of men trained in economics was appointed to review the position. I believe that certain anomalies exist in our Income Tax Act that could be removed with advanage. The best way would be to reuu.ce the indirect burden upon the people rather than the direct, because the most equitable burden to place on the people is by way of income tax. The Government is then collecting for the services of the country after the citizens have received the money.",65
100,Mr HUGHES,GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY,"Can the honourable member instance a country that bas become great without protection?  in the world So great as the nation from which we sprang, the nation which, during the great world's conflict, bore the burden of the day. Honourable members may refer disparagingly to that country in the day of its trial, after it has been bled white by other countries for whom it fought. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) may not know it, but it is called the British Isles, and I think he has been there. If any rational man discovered that his affairs were on the wrong side of the ledger, he would pursue one of two courses. He would either go insolvent, or call his creditors together, and tell them that he wanted time in which to pay. He would then make an endeavour to retrench. It is up to this Parliament to proceed along similar lines, and the potentialities of Australia sible. At present the only State in which any progress is being made in agriculture is Western Australia. I believe that that has been due to the fact that our young men bave been forced on to the land and have not been attracted to the manufacture of matches, hats, and various other commodities. Tbey have produced real wealth, with the result that this year Western Australia bas exported a considerable quantity of primary produce, the returns from which will go a long way towards meeting our national obligations. What are other industries doing Our manufacturers must be making considerable profits, yet they are not satisfied with the protection they are given, but are seeking a reduction of income tax. If the Government has in mind the reduction of taxation, I ask it to make a commence*ment with indirect taxation by compelling the stoppage of unprofitable industries that are handicapping and shackling industry generally. This Parliament would be well advised to occupy a whole session in a consideration, on purely non-party lines, of the best course to adopt. The majority of the people are centralized in the capital cities because of the aggregation there of unnatural, unprofitable, exotic industries. That has led to the cities having a preponderating influence in this Parliament, with a consequent continuance of the policy of ever-increasing protection. Those people consider that secondary industries are necessary for their livelihood. Tbey never give a thought to the manner in which they are maintained. If ' the workers were made dearly aware of the manner in which primary industries are shackled, no doubt they would become imbued with a better feeling, and make it their business to see that an industry which had received a fair measure of protection gave a fair deal to the consumer and the primary producer. I feel quite satisfied that the resources of Australia are sufficiently great to enable it to enter the competitive field with, not only its primary, but also its secondary produce; but for this our policy must be changed. Our empty spaces would tlieu be filled, and we should be placed in a position to defend ourselves make that pos- against invasion.",66

Our timber getters, roadmakers, and railway builders are primary producers who are doing much to develop this country. The (honourable member, for Forrest asks who pays income taxes.

Tbey stated that the finances of tnat State were in a chaotic condition, and that the drift must be stopped. They also charged the Government with having raised the water rates. The reason for the increased charges was that the triennial assessment of holdings had taken place, with the result that, although the rates were not'increased, the amount paymembers able was greater because of the higher value automatically placed on properties. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) said that the Labour Government Avas ignominiously kicked out. I remind him that a further 1,000 votes would have given that Labour party twelve additional seats, wbicb would have kept the Labour Government in office. The public of South Australia was tricked in the same way that the electors bf Australia were tricked by the Prime Minister wben he spoke of the danger from such men as Tom Walsh, and the possibility of a "" red "" Australia. Although the Labour Government was defeated in South Australia, it obtained a majority of the votes cast at the election. We bad recently before us a bill to amend our electoral laws. During the debate on that measure reference was maae to' gerrymandering. I can tell honourable members something about jerrymandering in South Australia. When the Electoral Commission brought in its report on which the existing boundaries of elec torates in that State were fixed, Sir Richard Butler, the father of the present Premier of South Australia, said that that re-adjustment of boundaries would keep Liberalism in power for the next twenty years.
