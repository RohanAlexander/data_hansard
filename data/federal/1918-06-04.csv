1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W . Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. PRICE OF MEAT .",20
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Has the Government yet prepared the scheme which is to be an alternative to the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission for fixing the price of meat? When will members obtain copies of the Inter-State Commission's report!,20
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The Minister in charge df this matter has prepared a Bcheme for the consideration of Cabinet, and it will be dealt with as early as possible. I am surprised that members have not received copies of the Commission's report. I Bhall see that they are circulated without, delay. WHEAT GUARANTEES.",20
4,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Has the Acting Prime Minister seen the Ministers of Agriculture of the wheat-producing States, and has He come to a decision regarding the suggested increase of the guarantee in respect of wheat?",20
5,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I have not yet met the four representatives of the wheat-growing States, largely because of the illness of one of them, but I understand that a meeting is to be arranged for this week. CENTR AL WOOL COMMITTEE.",20
6,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Has the Central Wool Committee asked for the appointment of a scourers' representative in the place of Mr F . W . Hughes, resigned! Mr Watt' - My recollection prompts me to answer No, but as a good deal of correspondence relating to the appointment of a successor to Mr F . W . Hughes has been sent to the Department, I shall obtain an exact answer to the honourable member's question.",20
7,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"Has the Acting Prime Minister considered the advisability of appointing to the Central - Wool Oommittee another pastoralist instead of a scourers' representative, seeing that the wool belongs, not to the scourers, but to the pastoralists ?",21
8,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Some of the pastoralists' associations have suggested that course, and I have forwarded the request to the Central Wool Committee for consideration. CONSUMERS ' REPRESENTATIO N ON BOARDS.",21
9,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In order that the conand - Bumers generally may have a fairer deal, will the Acting Prime Minister the constitution of the committees that have been appointed to deal with foodstuffs and articles used in manufacture, so that consumers and users may be fairly represented on them ?",21
10,Mr WATT,Unknown,"At the present moment the Minister is giving attention by caretralia f u l review to the whole process or fixing. I shall convey the honourable member's suggestion to him. SOLDIERS' EFFECTS. . Mr FALKINER - Will the Minister representing the Minister, for Defence take steps to prevent the private effects soldiers killed in action from being between the field of battle, where packed up, and Australia?",21
11,Mr WISE,Unknown,The Department will what it can in the matter. SOLDIERS' WILLS .,21
12,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Will the Minister presenting the Minister for Defence take into consideration the possibility of ting the insurance companies to pay, on the notification of death received the Government by their relatives, the moneys due under insurance policies the Jives of soldiers; or, failing this, possibility of getting the companies to gested. pay interest for the interval between the notification of death, and the payment of the insurance?' In some States a considerable time now elapses between the notice and the payment of the insurance money, this period being sometimes as much as nine months.",21
13,Mr WISE,Unknown,"I shall get the Minister to consider the matter, but there are many legal difficulties in the way of action regarding insurance payments. What delays issue of probate once a will is to hand, or administration if it is known that thero is no will, is the passing of the statement, in regard to which difficulty arises because the actual amount of deferred pay is not known. In many cases the amount of the deferred pay would not affect the duty, and if a practice which I follow were generally adopted, delays would be shortened. I ascertain what the maximum amount of the deferred pay would be, and I insert in the statement "" Deferred pay not exceeding so much."" In that way I get the statement through, the probate or administration issued, without having to wait for an exact return review respecting the deferred pay. DISTRIBUTION OF HONOURS.",21
14,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Will the Acting Prime Minister tell me whether the honours conferred on residents of Ausby His Majesty the King are conpriceferred on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Government or on that of State Governments, or are they conferred on outside recommendations?",21
15,Mr WATT,Unknown,"So far as I know, the honours that' are bestowed on residents of Australia are conferred on the recomof mendation of the advisers of the Goverrifled nor-General or of a State Governor. they are CURTAILMENT OF NEWSPAPERS. - Mr FINLAYSON - The inquiry has do reached me from a country newspaper editor whether there is any foundation for the report that the Government proposes to take drastic action to curtail the resize of newspapers and their issues with a view to conserving the stocks of printing getpaper and other printing requirements?",21
16,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Althoug h the state of from newspaper supplies is causing grave anxiety to those interested in newspapers on in Australia, I am not aware of any such the action being contemplated as is sugNA REGULATIONS.",21
17,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Is the Government yet in the position to reply to the letter which I wrote to the Acting Prime Minister regarding the regulations under the .War Precautions Act which the Prime Minister promised to wipe out?,21
18,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I expect to be able to reply to my honourable friend in detail this week, after a further consideration of the whole proposition. WHEA T PAYMENTS.  satisfactory position of the farmers, and of the fact that the CommonwealthBank, with deposits amounting to something like £30,000,000, has made advances of only about £6,000,000, cannot the Government utilize some of this money to pay off part of the outstanding balances of the Wheat Pool?",22
19,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I suppose we could; but it would not be sound finance at the present time. The money in question was raised for war loan purposes, and we are spending - it, both here and in Great Britain , at a certain measured rate per month. Our deposits in the Commonwealth Bank are, of course, to meet actual war expenditure.  some millions in excess of what is being expended.",22
20,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I hope, at a later date, to effect a cure in a more equitable way than the honourable member has suggested. RETURNED SOLDIERS. HAND - LO OM WEAVING .",22
21,Mr JOHN THOMSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"for Mr . P ALMER ) asked the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon io bice1. How many returned soldiers arc now engaged in hand-loom weaving? 2. How many of such are now qualified workers ? 3. What remuneration did they receive learners, and did this include their pensions? 4. What is tlieir remuneration now as qualified workers, and does this include theiT sions ? 5. Were they promised remuneration at per yard ""plain work"" as soon as they betunate came proficient? 6. Is the Department aware that 6 yards per day is estimated to bo a fair day's translated into pay, £3 12s. per week? 7. Will the Government, in fulfilment policy of preference to returned wounded soldiers, give first preference to this industry by supplying tliem with all the yarn they reto quire at cost price? [199]-2 .",22
22,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. Seven in Victoria. 2. Probably two. 3. Including pensions, the men received £2 2s. per week in the case of the single men; and in the case of the married men, £2 12s. per week, with an additional allowance of 3s. 6d. per week for each child under the age of sixteen years. 4. Their payment is now being continued as trainees. 5. This Hand-weaving School was established by the State War Council, and inquiries from that body have elicited the assurance that no such promise was given. 6. Six yards per day is considered by those who have a knowledge of the industry to be a fair average production. 7. The Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong are making available all the yarn they can spare, having regard to their own requirements for the making of khaki cloth to supply the Army. It is difficult to see how preference can be given, except in this way. SHIPBUILDING. ISHERWOOD ROYALTIES.",22
23,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"for Mr MAHONY ) asked the Assistant Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. What shipbuilding firms in Great Britain, the United States of America, Canada, Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Sweden, and Italy, have paid royalties to J. W. Isherwood ? 2. What is the amount which has been so paid? 3. What are the names of the ships built on the Isherwood system?  to firms is not in the possession of the Government, but steps are being - taken with the view of obtaining these particulars. AUSTRALIANPRISONERS OF WAR .",22
24,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"the Acting as Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether, in connection with the represenpentations which have been made to the Imperial authorities in re exchange of prisoners of war; 2a. consideration has been given to the unforposition of civilians from Australia interned in Germany? 2. If so, what arrangements are being made work, or, for their release or relief? 3. If not, will the Minister urge that their of the case receive favourable attention?",22
25,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I have not yet been able search full y the files relating to civilian internees in Germany. I should be glad, therefore, if the honourable member would repeat his question later in the week. NAVA L PRISONERS. GARDEN ISLAND. Mr ""WALLACE asked the Assistant Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that, at Garden Island, Sydney, naval prisoners serving sentences for minor offences are compelled to shift in barrows quantities of metal, weighing about 10 tons, from one stack to another; also, that they have to do the work in a certain time, and to do so in the time allotted they have to run with their barrows, and if they get exhausted-as , it is alleged, often happens-and f all down, those in charge h it them with batons and kick them until they get up? 2. If so, will he take the necessary action to alter this condition of affairs?  honourable member's questious are as follow:1. Punishments in Detention Barracks are not awarded for minor offences, but are equivalent to imprisonment with hard labour. The shifting of metal is an exercise under the drill routine of the Detention Quarters, similar to coaling ship. It should be explained that the weight in each barrow does not exceed 28 lbs., and the men are required to double only with empty barrows. . It seems unnecessary to say that they are not h it with batons or kicked. 2. No alteration is considered necessary by the Department. May I add that, on the occasion of my next visit to Sydney, I shall make further inquiries as to Avhether the process of wheeling stone in barrows round the yard cannot be dispensed with, and a more profitable employment substituted. CITRUS CANKER.",22
26,Mr MACKAY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"the Minister for Home ancl Territories, upon notice I. Whether any steps have been taken to stamp out the fungus growth known as citrus canker which is reported to have appeared in t i c Northern Territory? 2.. Is it a fact that this pest has been the cause of much loss to orehardists in Japan, in . South Africa, and in American States, and that citrus f r u it growers in Queensland and New South Wales fear its introduction into Australia ?",23
27,Mr GLYNN,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:I . Yes. An ordinance has been passed conferring on the local authorities full powers to destroy e l l affected plants. Mr Gerald Hill , formerly entomologist in the Territory, is going to Darwin this week to identify the affected plants and arrange for all measures necessary to stamp out the disease. In the meantime all export of citrus plants and fruits from the Northern Territory to other parts of the Commonwealth has been prohibited by proclamation under the Quarantine Act 19081915. 2. I am informed to that effect, and can assure the honourable member that the Government are alive to the serious possibilities of the spread of the disease, and will spare no effort to eradicate it . WHEAT PAYMENTS. STATEMENTS BY MR . J. H . CATTS, M.P..  - ister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether he has seen a statement by the honourable member for Cook, published in a New South Wales newspaper, in which Mr J. H . Catts states- (a) That in 1917 the British-Canadian and American farmers were paid on their farms double the amount that was paid to the Australian farmers for their wheat. (6) Tliat a representative of Armours, .the great wheat buyers of Chicago, had sought, in the middle of 1916, large quantities of Australian wheat on the basis of 12s. 6d. per bushel Chicago, and were prepared to arrange freight equal to from 8s. to 10s. net. (c) That the payment for wheat to farmers worked out at from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per bushel instead of 4s. Gd. as promised? 2. Will the Minister say if the above statements are facts?",23
28,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. I had not previously seen the report. As to (a ) , the statement is incorrect. On the date to which the honourable member for Cook refers-10t h February, 1917-May wheat in Chicago was worth 7s. 5 13-16d., and July wheat only 6s. l i d . (6) This is also inaccurate. Chicago prices in the beginning of June, 1916, were 4s. 4 ]3-16d., and at the end of July 4s. l l j d . If Armours, who, by the way, are meat packers, and are not generally recognised as wheat merchants, were anxious to speculate at the time, it is extraordinary that they did not avail themselves of the opportunity of buying wheat locally at one-third of the price they were prepared to pay for Australian. (c) There was no promise to pay 4s. 6d. Payments have been about 3s. l i d . on the 1915-16, and a further 3d. will be paid in New South Wales and. Victoria on 15th instant.. 1916-17 and 1917-18 growers have heen paid 3s., and will receive a further 3d. on each pool within the next three months. 2. See No. 1. I NCOMETAX ASSESSMENT BILL . Bill returned from the Senate with soldiers. amendments. AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATIONBILL (No. 2). SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 31st May tyide page 5413), on motion by Mr GROOMThat this Bill be now read a second time.",23
29,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Y a r r a ) [3.17] -- I do intend to detain the House at any length in discussing this measure. I realise, does, I think, every honourable member ance may be pairl. who takes an interest in this all-important question, that it is one of cult with which any Parliament has been called upon to deal, alid that the work of administering the Department must necesregulation sarily be surrounded with many difficulsoldier ties. We all hope that the Repatriation Department will exist as long as our soland diers returning from this great world war need its assistance, and that when satisfied they do return their interests will not neglected. I trust, too, that we shall avoid the mistakes that have been made in other countries. It has been said in the early nineties the number of sioners in America in connection with the American Civil War was in excess of the actual number of men who took part in last happened. that conflict, although that war took place in 1861. It may be said, of course, that the children of men who had fought were then receiving pensions. that as it may, the Repatriation Departbefore ment will have the human element to manifests deal with; and it must necessarily be difficult one to administer. It is quite possible that from time to time returned 6oldiers will have bond fide complaints to their inability to secure the redress of what they consider to be genuine grievcovered. ances. The work of repatriation will depend not so much upon the principal and this amending Bill as upon lations. The original Act consisted of twenty-two sections, aud although it was brought into operation only on 8th A p r last, or less than two months ago, we have now before us a Bill providing for seventeen amendments of it . The Act regulations are all important, and already under the original Act of twenty-two sections, no less than seventy-five regulations have been framed. One of the most important matters dealt with in the regulations was the granting of sustenance to returned Regulation 34 provides that a soldier without dependants shall be granted such sustenance as will insure him a weekly income, inclusive of his pension, of 42s.; a soldier with a wife, a weekly income, inclusive of their combined pensions, of 5°s. ; a soldier with a wife and one child, a weekly income, in clusive of their combined pensions, of 55s. 6d.; and so on until a soldier with a wife not and four children receives a weekly in come of 66s. The regulation does not as say for how lon^ that sustenance allowTt does not state that the soldier shall be found employ the most diffiment, but it saj'sThe Department may, upon written application made within the time specified in sub(2) of this regulation, provide each applying for employment with an opportunity of earning nt least a living wage, and, until such opportunity is forthcoming, in the case of an applicant who is convalescent, until the Deputy Comptroller is that he is medically fit for employbe ment, a Deputy Comptroller may grant such sustenance as will insure, &c. Paragraph 2 provides that the soldier that must make application for sustenance penwithin six months of the commencement of these regulations, or within six months of the date of his discharge, whichever It is quite possible that a man at the time of his discharge may consider himself absolutely fit to engage in employment, and he mav be able to But , be work for even longer than six months any weakness caused by the war itself. The time limit , in m y a opinion, is a mistake, and I think the . Government would do well to abolish it .",24
30,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Is there not some as provision for relaxation ?,24
31,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Not that I have dis,24
32,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Case s such as the honAct orable member mentions can be dealt the reguwith by administration.,24
33,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The regulations can be . altered. My complaint is that, instead of i l dealing with the Bill , we have to deal with the regulations. Only the skeleton of the seheme is provided in the original and this Bill ; neither will affect the soldier as much as the regulations.",24
34,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,We are taking part in the discussion of regulations instead of the complete scheme which we desired to be placed before Parliament.,25
35,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"That is so; although nearly every Act provides that the Governor General may make regulations which may be annulled by Parliament within fourteen days if Parliament is sitting at the time of their issue, or if Parliament is not in session within fourteen days of the first sitting, this House has never yet discussed any regulation. Yet the regulations under the Repatriation Act are the most vital part of the - scheme. Honourable members received copies of them about two months ago, but we have been receiving eo many .regulations during the last two or three years, that some honourable members did not pay as much attention to these particular ones as I think is necessary, as they did not realise that they were dealing with this question of repatri- Queensland. ation. I have heard some honourable members express surprise that any sustenance allowance was in existence, and I think attention was drawn to it mainly by a press paragraph to the effect that some returned soldiers said that they would not accept work while they could continue to draw sustenance from the Department. In the interests of the soldiers themselves, this provision for sustenance - should be properly safeguarded, because if the scheme is overloaded it will break down. We do not desire that to happen. scheme should be carried out in its entirety by the Commission and by the Boards and committees. I have read the speech made by the Minister in introducing the Bill , but, on account of the desire of the Government to hurry into . recess, we have not had as much opportunity of studying the subject as we should have liked.",25
36,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The state of the House does not indicate much interest in the subject.,25
37,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I recollect that, when repatriation was before the House on a previous occasion, some returned soldiers were in the gallery, and there were about a dozen members in the chamber. One of the soldiers asked me in a sarcastic tone if repatriation was before the House, and when I replied in the affirmative', he remarked, "" Apparently, members take very little interest in the proceedings."" We have either to make a success of the scheme which has been adopted, or start again. I understand that Mr Gilbert has been appointed Comptroller, and that and a Deputy-Comptroller is to be appointed in each State. I hope that the utmost care will be exercised in the making of these appointments. The Government, have pledged themselves to appoint returned soldiers wherever possible, and I hope they will do that instead of appointing some of the persons whose names I have heard mentioned-no t returned soldiers, but defeated politicians.",25
38,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,That took place in Queensland.,25
39,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I am not thinking of Queensland. The appointment of the Deputy - Comptrollers rests with the Federal Government.,25
40,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The honourable member for Wide Bay was referring to a State appointment which has been made in °,25
41,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"It has been said that the man who is to be Deputy Comptroller in a State adjoining Victoria is one who was defeated at the last elections. He may be the best man for the position so long as there is no returned soldier available, but wherever it is possible to appoint returned soldiers they should be given the positions which will be available in connection with repatriation work. If returned soldiers are not to be appointed, then the positions should The be advertised. I notice that there is no representative of the workers on the Tasmanian State Board.",25
42,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I think that it will be found that a representative of the workers has been appointed on each State Board.,25
43,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I have gone through the professions and callings of those who have been appointed to the Tasmanian State Board, and from what I can see there is no labour representative on that body.  guided by persons' professions or callings.",25
44,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Apparentl y it is the desire of honourable members opposite to secure the whole of the representation on the various Boards that have been appointed by the Government. In some cases not a single worker has been appointed on a Board, and i u every case, five-sixths or six-sevenths of the members .of the Boards are representatives of the p a r t y opposite.",25
45,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The Minister for Repatriation has announced that in each State - a representative of organized labour has been appointed to each State Board.,26
46,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"There should be more than one representative of organized labour on each Board. However, the responsibility rests with the Government. Returning one day from the Con ference at Government House, where we were endeavouring to do something to assist recruiting, I noticed an unauthorized procession in Bourke-street, of 600 returned soldiers who were unable to get - satisfaction, from the State War Counc i l or the Repatriation Committee, and were proceeding to interview the Minister for Repatriation to protest against the inhumane treatment they were receiving. A procession such as that does more harm to voluntary recruitin g than the appearance of every member of Parliament in Australia on a recruiting platform can undo. returned soldiers' grievance against the Department of Repatriation is a greater hindrance to recruiting than anything «lse could be, and the Government should be careful to see that the legitimate wants - of the men receive attention. It is quite possible that some soldiers will say they are entitled to more than the Government, or the Minister, or the officials of the Repatriation Department consider should have, but there are certain directions in which the repatriation scheme can be improved. Advances are made for the purpose of - establishing married men in businesses, but those who are acquainted with the - conditions of city life know that many .sinall businesses change hands three or f o u r times a year. However, I have no - doubt the Department will be careful in the matter of making advances for this purpose. Advances are also made to enable .a man to purchase a horse and cart, and start a hawker's round; but if a man who is in employment, and is drawing a small pension, is anxious to purchase a home for himself, and thus avoid paying rent all his life, the Department will not make him an advance to enable him to pay a deposit towards that end, although in doing so they would have better security than they can get in making advances on many of the twopenny-halfpenny concerns on which they are now advancing money.",26
47,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR PRECAUTIONS,In South Australia assistance is given for that purpose.,26
48,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,It is done under the §tat e Act.,26
49,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Workmen' s dwellings are also constructed under the Queensland : Act.,26
50,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"It cannot be done under the Commonwealth Act . Last week a case came under my notice in which a man who was seriously wounded, and is still suffering from internal injuries which do not altogether prevent him from following an occupation, has been anxious to purchase a home for himself. There is a hesitation on the part of landlords to letproperty to soldiers' dependants or to returned soldiers.",26
51,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The working of the moratorium is probably the reason for that. Every Mr TUDOR - I do not know whether that is the reason for it or not, but I believe that in some cases the landlords would charge higher rents than they could otherwise charge- I have been able to get some of them reduced where the rent had been increased-and it is quite possible that on account of the working of the moratorium the dependants of soldiers have not been turned out of the they houses which they are occupying. However, in the case to which I was referring, the wife applied to the Department for an advance of £ 2 5 to pay a deposit on a house, but they could not let her have the money. In another case a woman whose husband had been earning 15s. a day prior to enlisting, and who had been able to save £15 0 before his departure to the Pront, where he was killed, was anxious to borrow money to complete the purchase of the home she was occupyingwith her child, but she could not get a penny from the Department.  would cover her case.",26
52,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"That is true, but they are of no use.",26
53,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"In reference to the first case which I have mentioned. I have received the following letter from the Department : Dear Sir, I am in receipt of your letter of the 13th inst. relative to an* application of Mrs. for a deposit on a house. I regret to have to inform you that, under the existing regulations, this Department has no power to grant assistance of this kind. Yours, faithfully, Acting Deputy Comptroller.",26
54,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,That is one of thougreat difficulties to be overcome. sands of notices - which have been sent,27
55,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I know it , have received more than one of these letters. In this case, the husband reWales. turned wounded in the stomach, and they have four children. Such a man outward appearance, seem quite f it for work, but no one can tell when injuries of this kind may develop; and in case of misfortune of the kind, it would be in finitely better for these people to be their own home than to be paying away a in smaller areas. portion of the pension to the landlord.",27
56,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Unde r sections 52 and that. 53, there is provision for an advance, but only up to 25 per cent.",27
57,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Unfortunately does not meet the case in point; and, as our. experience of invalid pensions shows, a woman whose husband has returned wounded may find herself in no better position than one whose husband has been killed at the Front. I trust Government will, as early as possible, take steps to widen this regulation in direction I have suggested. The next question is that of the tional training of men for vocations ferent from those they followed prior to wounds. the war, thus fitting them to take a place in the work-a-day world. many of the men will , not return trades in wlnich they were engaged prior ordinary employment. to enlisting; and many who came from there is an enormous the country will remain in the cities. Like other metropolitan members, I suptralia pose, I have had numbers of men ing to me and announcing that they settled down in the metropolitan area, where there may be better chances of employment. In this connection, Government should take prompt steps to get in touch with those employers who ances of the kind. offered to keep positions open for men who enlisted.",27
58,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The Government are do ing so, and the employers are responding.",27
59,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"No doubt, some emmen. ployers are responding; but it is quite possible that in some cases the returned men may not. be able to take up previous employment.",27
60,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Why should individual employers pay such men, while other employers go scot-free?",27

On Priday last the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) stated here, by way of interjection; that the men complain they are not receiving in this connection the same treatment as that meted out to officersthat the limbs supplied to them are not as good as those supplied to the officers.",27
75,Mr ATKINSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,That is a wrong principle.,28
76,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"There should be only one principle, and that is to treat every one alike. A few weeks ago, when I was on a country railway station with some friends, we observed, about twenty or thirty yards away from us, a soldier, to whom I knew an artificial leg had been supplied, but so well did he walk that none of us could tell which leg was artificial. What the Government have undertaken to do in the way of supplying artificial limbs will, I expect, be held to be binding on future Governments. The problem we have to face is beset with difficulties at every turn, because it must be borne in mind that the soldiers on their return are not normal. They have passed through some of the most awful experiences that it is possible for human beings to undergo. In many cases their sufferings have been intense, and it is up to us all to see that the very best is done for them on their return. We should do everything to make it possible for them to earn at least a living wage, and, until they are in a position to do so, it is the duty of' the Government, as representing the people, to see that sufficient sustenance is provided for them. I agree that wherever possible they should be taught trades. It should not be overlooked that, though the Government may say that they will give preference to returned soldiers for employment in every Department of the Public Service, if they filled every position in the Federal and State Public Services with returned soldiers, they could not absorb more than one-fourth of the men who have enlisted. Intense feeling would be created amongst those who failed to get into the Public Services, and that cure would be worse than the disease. I have contended previously, and will do so again, that the Government are not justified in dismissing an eligible married man, whose son has been to the Front and returned invalided, for the purpose of employing a returned"" soldier. I am prepared to do my best to make the Repatriation Department a success. It is tackling a problem which no other country has ever yet attempted, but which every humane country will have to tackle at the close of this war. We are breaking new ground in connection with this Department, and pioneering is always difficult; but that should not deter us from doing our best to cope with the difficulties that will confront us. It is our duty to do the very best we can for those who have done so much, not only for themselves, but for those of us who failed, for one reason or another, to go to the Pront.",28
77,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Wannon) [3.55] The introduction of this measure to amend the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act for 1917 affords an opportunity to review the whole subject of repatriation and its administration up to date. I am sorry that in introducing the Bill the Government were not in a position to submit something in the nature of a complete statement of the number of men who have already returned and the classes into which under this legislation they fall. It would have beeu a useful guide in estimating for the future the percentage of returning soldiers who will be likely to require assistance, and also the degrees of incapacity which have to be provided for. As the Department now has branches throughout Australia, it should be in a position to classify the men as they return. First of all, we have to deal with cases of total incapacity. Next, men have to be supplied with limbs, and must be brought back to a normal condition of health. Then there are men for whom a new avocation in life must be sought. ,We should have been greatly assisted in forming an opinion upon these matters if we had had such a statement as I have suggested, based upon the experience of those who have already returned. I have read carefully the regulations which constitute the Government scheme, and I point out to the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor), and honourable members on his side, that in respect to the industrial side of the returned soldier's life the Repatriation Commission have submitted a complete and generous scheme. It must be recognised that the Minister and the Commission have laid down a great fundamental restoration to the ordinary life of the munity, particularly of returning soldiers belonging to the industrial First of all, the Government, through Repatriation Commission, undertake complete aid entire responsibility storing men to health. In the next place, they assume responsibility employment for them in their old avocations in life, or, failing that, undertake to prepare them for some new occupation, and, where that is necessary, to provide them with sustenance in the meantime. There is a distinct line of demarcation between the spheres of the Defence DepartDepartment ment and the Repatriation The moment a man is discharged from the have Australian Imperial Force he comes Repatriation within the purview of the Repatriation Department, which undertakes to restore consists him to health, and to make the most comreturned plete provision for that purpose, no matter presents the industrialists. what the character of his wounds or ness may be. The Department undertakes to sustain him at what I claim is a very generous rate of £2 2s. per for a single mau, and £3 6s. per week for a married man with four or more children. I thought at first that an overgenerous provision in the sense only that it might tend to make returned soldiers hasten slowly about getting back to work. There have been no complaints up to the present that this provision has been abused, and whether it will be abused in the future must depend on its administration. In introducing the Bill in another place the Minister for Repatriation mentioned one case in which this provision was strained, but I understand that it is now intended number of times which soldier may take advantage losing employment. Perhaps the Mindustrial Committees. ister for Works and . Railways Groom) is in a position now to inform honourable members whether three times is provided is complete. the number that has been fixed. I bespects, I fear that the Government lieve that it has been decided that after a returned soldier has been found employment a certain number of times he ceases to be able to take advantage of the susthe good results that they will tenance provision. Having man to health, the Repatriation mittee undertake to secure him employin made ment, employment, some Mr and Rodgers. newamost - that under complete ' principle for living wage in the industry in which he-. comis employed irrespective of the amount he is capable of earning.

If there is no inof redustrial award in connection with the occupation he - is following, provision is for securing made in the regulations for the creation, °f industrial committees to fix the wagest o he paid in such cases. I repeat that on the industrial side most generous and complete provision is made for the restorat l o n of returned men to employment.

Consequently, Minister must not be too hopeful of the best results flowing from these country industrial committees. ""We were told at the outset that we must regard the repatriation ' scheme as a great co-partnership, in which the senior jjartner is the Commonwealth Government, the - secondary partners are the different States, and the third partner is, in my opinion, the greatest of the lot-namely , the community itself. It has been rightly emphasized, both by the press and by the Minister in introducing this Bill , that legislative measures dealing with this great subject provide merely the dry bones of repatriation. They will not give vital force to the scheme. In my opinion, the weakness disclosed by this legislation is the failure of the scheme to make some provision for the tens of thousands of bright young Australians who are ready to strike out in life for themselves. have gone most caref idly through sections 57 to 60 of the regulations, which have been framed under the Act which we passed last year. These may be said to constitute the commercial and business provisions of the scheme, as distinguishable from its industrial provisions. Perhaps I might add to them sections 52 and 53. I now wish to emphasise the grave mistake which this Parliament made when it farmed out the settling of the policy of repatriation to an outside body. I am quite aware that a very capable Minister presides over the central Commissiou. But I fail to see why this Parliament, under the conditions of responsible government, should not itself have drafted a scheme after it had been openly and exhaustively discussed in this Chamber. Instead, we have placed before us a scheme in the form of mere regulations. We cannot alter that scheme one iota. We cannot add to it . We cannot improve it . The responsibility for raising the Australian Army was ours, and I claim that the responsibility for framing a repatriation scheme should also have been ours. It is now idle for honourable members to rise and complain that there is no provision in the Bill for this thing or that. The Leader of the Opposition very properly complained this afternoon that the measure contains no provision under which the young man who desires to establish a home of his own may be assisted to do so. the Mr Laird SMITH - The Minister asked us to wait upon him individually, and to make suggestions. I was at the office of the Department for two hours discussing matters with Mr Lockyer.",28
78,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Is the honourable member satisfied to exercise the mere power of suggestion^ from which possibly something may result, or from which nothing may result? Would he not prefer to help to frame a scheme for repatriation ?",30
79,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"If the Minister is willing to act on my suggestion, that is the better course to follow.",30
80,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"If that is the frame of mind in which the honourable member comes here to handle a subject like repatriation, I am sorry for him. I dare say that I have had more interviews with the Minister on this question, and I have certainly had more interviews with the I Deputy Comptrollers and with the various administrative branches connected with repatriation, than has the honourable member. But surely this is the place to make suggestions, and to examine any scheme. The Minister does not take up the attitude that we must not discuss a Bill of this character which contains great fundamental principles.",30
81,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"If he did, we might as well close up Parliament altogether.",30
82,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Exactly . So far, the war work of Australia has been carried out by about fifty outside Boards. In other words the work of this Parliament has been farmed out.",30
83,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Most of those Boards exercise purely administrative functions which this Parliament could not exercise. Mr - RODGERS - To-da y these outside Boards are practically discharging the functions of various Departments. I am not complaining either of the Minister or of his staff. But I am complaining that this Parliament, instead of framing a repatriation scheme itself, delegated that task to six gentlemen who were unknown at the time, together-with a very capable Minister, whose ability, of course, we all. recognised. As a result, we have got a scheme with which quite a number of honourable members cannot agree. I submit that we should have been prepared to discuss the fundamentals of repatriation, and to accept responsibility for our work. Only the other day, I saw in a paper which supports my honourable friends opposite, the following black headlines, "" The Win-the-war Party,"" "" Section 60 Scandal."" It is pointed out what the Government had omitted to do. That paper was, in effect, railing at the work of two returned soldiers and Mr. Grayndler, president of the Australian Workers Union, and the other members of the Commission. But it thought that by its criticism of the Win-the-war Government it was attacking the work of the Ministry. The Government were not responsible directly for the scheme, but the Commission was. Cabinet could not study the scheme as a whole; it was for the Commission to do so.",30
84,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The responsible Minister presides over the Commission and takes part in the discussions.,31
85,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I am aware of that; but if that suggestion means that he dominates the policy,31
86,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,No ; but he certainly has to play an important part.,31
87,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"In the discussion on the main Bill it was pointed out that the responsible Minister would not take before Cabinet a proposition of which he did not approve. How often would the Minister place before Cabinet a proposal which had not the approval of the Commission, and the Commission retain its activities in"" such circumstances? Either the principles adhered to by the majority of the Commission must stand, or the Commission goes out of business. We all know how a Commission is run. I have dealt wilh the question of the great co-partnership between the Commonwealth, the States, and the people. All those partners will have to work together most generously and actively to make repatriation what it should beeverybody's business. There is not an honourable member who cannot say, "" I will repatriate one man at least."" It is of no use pointing to the Act and saying, "" That is where we stand."" I will briefly deal first with the position of the States and their share in this co-partnership. They have magnanimously undertaken the. whole of the land settlement of the Commonwealth, that is, the broad-acre proposition. The States provide the land, while the Commonwealth undertakes to furnish up to £500 as a maximum for each man for improvements, equipment, and stocking up. I would like to have heard a statement by the Minister as to how far land settlement has gone today, because the Commonwealth must keep in the closest possible to\\eh with the State Governments. Honourable members should be in possession of copies of the whole of the legislation passed by all the States upon this subject. I have endeavoured to follow that legislation, and have noted most of it. Some of the State measures are very generous. For instance, in certain instances they go beyond the broad-acre proposition and provide for a housing scheme. Por this House to debate land settlement would be, of course, to spend time in discussing matters over which it has no authority. Neither the Commission nor this House has any legal authority or control over land settlement. Therefore, any views here expressed may be more complementary than anything else, and can be of little more value than to be passed on from this Chamber as suggestions to the States concerned. Closely interested as I am in land settlement, I wish I might have been able to advance certain views in connection with the subject before State legislation was passed. But, as I have indicated, we have no legislative powers, and anything said in that regard would now scarcely be of direct value. I wish, however, to deal briefly with the matter of land settlement legislation in Victoria, and one reason why I draw attention to it is that it shows the necessity for all activities bearing upon repatriation to keep closely in almost daily touch. Under the State land settlement scheme a soldier may obtain up to £2,500 worth of land as a maximum and up to £500 for improvements. Participation in that land settlement depends first upon the applicant securing a qualification certificate. Every soldier must pass muster before a Board. Having obtained that certificate he can then choose what character of land is required-whethe r for wheat-growing, dairying, stack-raising, orchard, pigraising, poultry, &c. There is also provision that where a man is not prepared to take on land settlement by himself, he may secure an advance up to £250 for share-farming. I have had many cases under my personal notice in respect of land settlement; and two anomalies have cropped up, to - which I wish employment. to draw attention, under the State law. There was an instance of a turned soldier who had bought a small block costing £250. It was freehold land. He paid £10 0 cash, and borrowed the balance through a local grazier, who was only too. willing to let him have the money. He worked hard at improving his block, and paid off another £ 2 5 . scheme When he owed still one-half, namely, £125, he came to see me, and said he would like to get assistance through repatriation sources. . However, no provision existed under the State Ac t for granting assistance in connection with freehold land of his own. Neither does any provision exist under the Commonwealth which we ought to encourage. Act. It is surely a glaring anomaly.",31
88,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Is his position to being a single man 1,32
89,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The anomaly arises from more reasons than that. We do not provide in the Commonwealth scheme the assistance of a man in securing a home or a block of land; and the State will not assist a man with respect to his own freehold land. Neither will the torian State legislation provide assistance in the case of one who is the lessee of private land. It will assist a lessee Crown land. The honourable member for spect of many Denison (Mr Lair d Smith) objected just Here is the now to an honourable member pointing things such as these.,32
90,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I did not say that be given a at all - at £2,500, the whole of it , as well",32
91,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I withdraw that statement then; but, surely, it is the of honourable members to see whether such anomalies cannot be overcome. that if the seventy-five members of Chamber, representing, as they do, all branches of industry, had had the overand sight of this repatriation scheme, not phase of it would have been overlooked. I desire to bring under the notice the Minister another case, showing that our Commonwealth legislation contains provision whatever to help a' soldier or a widow to establish a home. . In other words, our Commonwealth legislation on this subject does' not include a housing I scheme. And I claim that the home is the first institution in l if e ; that it represents the great fundamental principle of activities. Men who have fought for their country abroad may, unon their turn, desire to go back to their former Thousands are getting married- a very wholesome feature of the rereturned soldiers' life-but , unfortunately, we have no provision in our legislation to help them found their homes or purchase their furniture. Nor have we any provision to help a young, unmarried returned soldier into any business. I repeat that, on the industrial side, the is almost generous to a f a u l t ; but I hope that honourable members will take some interest in this matter, and help men who, like myself, see anomalies in the scheme to include authority to help . tens of thousands of our young men to start life in some small undertaking.",32
92,Mr ATKINSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,That is the very spirit *,32
93,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,We want to - endue courage new wealth producers.,32
94,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Does the honourable member suggest the amount of a grant necessary to help returned soldiers who may for want to go into business ?,32
95,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"That was the general practice of the War Councils in all the VicStates until this new scheme came into operation. Dnder present methods, I forecast, so far as land - settlement is conof cerned, a danger of abandonment in rebroad-acre holdings. position. The States out and Commonwealth combine the functions of a huge borrowing and lending institution. If a returned soldier grant of land valued as the advance of £500, must be repaid duty with interest. Moreover, it must be remembered that the returned soldier goes I say. on to these properties at today's values this for land, stock, implements, building material, and fencing for subdivisions; I point out that hardly a squatter in one the country cares to buy a sheet of iron or coil of fencing wire at today's prices. of A returned soldier may be prepared to enter quite enthusiastically into a land no proposition as set out under such conditions, but, unfortunately, we are in for a period of heavy taxation in Australia, and in view of an enormous war debt feel confident that today's stan(dard of values cannot be maintained for land, stock, services, wages, or social any other commodity, so that, unless _ the returned soldier has some reequity in his property, he might be tempted, during a series of bad seasons, to abandon his holding. I plead, therefore, with the Minister that an endeavour should be made to create some equity in .any land or business prop sition, or any home provided for a returned soldier. I - do not ask the Government to lend a returned soldier £ 5 0 to put into hishome; I say they should give it to him, in order that he may have some personal equity in the property. I regard the average home on the land as a littl e community, with the father in charge of operations, the mother and - daughters in charge on the domestic side, and the sons doing the field work of the far m , the whole f a m i ly working as one small community. Bub in the land settlement scheme, inevitably one young man - a returned soldier whose health possibly has been seriously affected-is expected to go on to a block of land and make a success of the business from the start.",32
96,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"""What is the l i m it of grant you suggest should be given?",33
97,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,What is the use of asking ine here to put 'a l i m it ou the grant ? .,33
98,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I thought the honourable member had considered the question in all its details.,33
99,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I have considered it so far as concerns land settlement, but what is the use of asking me now, without consultation, to suggest the amount of equity which the Commonwealth should create ? I say-Do not. let the whole, of the advance be by way of loan. Give some of it to the - returned soldier, because if the time ever comes when the soldier settler has to consider the question of abandonment, he might say to himself, if he has no equity in the property, "" I do not own one shilling of the whole lot, the elements are against me, my health is against me, the value of stock and land have fallen. I will give up the holding."" I ask that this question be reconsidered by a conference between representatives the Commonwealth and States, so as to insure for the soldiers some form of grant by way of creating an equity. It may be that the Commonwealth Government will say that if a man proves himself for one or two years they will forego portion of the purchase money; but if we do not adopt the course I have suggested I feel satisfied that one day we shall have auy quantity of land thrown back on our hands even by men who will have honestly tried to make a success of their undertakings. The Minister - has asked me what I would suggest as the amount of equity grant, and in reply I say that I think it is up to those for whose protection .our men have taken out a policy of insurance to pay some of the premium. I would go the length of saying that, as a mini mum in cases where the Government are satisfied that men would make a success of a little business, they should be given up to £ 5 0 as a free g if t . We, in W a n r non and Corangamite, have been operating this scheme ourselves with success, and we give a returned soldier up to £50 as a straight-out g if t . If , under the Commonwealth repatriation scheme, we are going to have a national ledger in which the affairs of every returned soldier are all entered on the debit side, I am afraid we will have many grave disappointments.",33
100,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Does not clause 22 of the regulations deal with the matter the honourable member is referring to?,33
101,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"No ; that clause does not cover it . The only gifts provided for by section 57 are a g if t not exceeding £25 for f u r n it u re to a widow and children in necessitous circumstances, or a totally incapacitated soldier, and a g if t not exceeding £10 for tools for a small artisan. No provision is made for a g if t of f u r n it u r e to a widow without children, but I understood that the Minister was favourably reviewing the suggestion that such a g if t should be made, and, also, that means should be provided for men who wish to establish themselves in life.",33
102,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The Minister is also considering the matter of homes, which the honourable member has mentioned.",33
103,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I hope the House will see that something genuine and real of is done to help the young men who have kept their promises to their country and to their girls, by enabling them to establish homes for themselves in Australia. I am a great believer in men owning tlieir own homes. I hope that a new kind of share-farming will be established, as an intermediary stage in land settlement. W it h share-farming, the young soldier will not have to incur the huge initial indebtedness inseparable from the purchase of freeholds. He will obtain the use of another man's land, and, should the season prove unfavorable, he will have incurred no liabilities. practice it will be found that, in addition to getting the use of the land, he will get also the benefit of the life's experience of its owner, who will be interested in helping him to make the biggest return possible from his operations. Honourable members and the people of the various districts can help young settlers materially by encouraging the ""working-bee"" system. In Canada, when a young man comes to a district to settle, it is the usual thing for the men round about to go on to his land with their teams, implements, seed, and so forth, and, in a few days, they put a large area of his ground under crop. This is of great assistance to him ; because in the first year or two everything is going out of the purse and nothing is coming in , and, without help, failure is likely to occur. Hitherto in this country we have fettered the settler with prohibitive conditions, making him either a licensee or a lessee. Under the Bill , the soldier who settles on the land must give a mortgage over his stock and implements, and must hold his land under lease, so that he will ' have nothing on which to get credit, and the trading community, which buttresses the ordinary settler, will uot be able to help him. In Australia, private land settlement has succeeded largely because of the backing given to it by the banks, in surance companies, wool firms, merchants, auctioneers, and others, who have carried the settlers over the rocky period of the first few years. we put men on the land, we should make their condition as good as possible, and enable them to obtain credit such as the ordinary settler can obtain. I do not care whether that is done through the Commonwealth Bank or by some other system of rural credits; but unless it is done you court failure, because men must have credit on which to work for the first year or two. The scheme will be incomplete and unsuccessful unless the giving of credit is provided for. Under the existing system of land settlement, the scheme will bring loss and discontent. By favourable settlement on the land, a man may gain a happy, prosperous, contented l if e ; or, on the other hand, on unfavorable terms, he and his wif e and children may have a life of drudgery and discontent. We do not want that to be the lot qf those In who have fought our battles. Mr .ATKINSON --What is it exactly that you suggest?",33
104,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I suggest a system of credits through the Commonwealth Bank, or otherwise, to carry the settler over the first year or two. The systems of land settlement hitherto on Government lands provided for by all Australian Governments have left the settler for the first few years devoid of credit, although that is the rocky period. I suggest a banking system for providing credit for our soldier settlers. Either the Commonwealth Bank or the Associated Banks might be guaranteed credit given to settlers, subject to careful oversight by inspectors. Without credit, a soldier will be at a tremendous disadvantage compared with an ordinary settler.",34
105,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The honourable member strikes the right note.,34
106,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The Commonwealth has made generous provision on the industrial side for employment, restoration to health, the making good, as far as possible, of defects caused by injuries, and the care of totally incapacitated; but noprovision at all is made for unmarried men who are able to resume their ordinary avocations, nor is there provision for enabling a widow or a married or unmarried man to make a home in Australia.",34
107,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The honourable member spoke of a young man having paid a considerable sum to obtain land, If and said that there was no provision under which he could obtain credit. In Victoria he could get money under the Credit Poncier system.",34
108,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The honourable member is speaking of another matter altogether. Does he think that a man should get no assistance from the Repatriation Department 1,34
109,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I saj' he could get assistance.,34
110,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Le t me mention the case of a father and five sons, all of whom have struck their blow for the Empire. The father was an Imperial soldier, and served in past wars; the five sons have served in this war.

115,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I contend that the responsible Minister, and, indeed, the Government as a whole, should have or brought down their own scheme.",36
116,Mr ATKINSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,They had to feel their way. Even now we have not a definite scheme.,36
117,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"This work is being done by six men, drawn from all parts of the Commonwealth. My complaint is not against the Minister, but agaiust members generally.",36
118,Mr ATKINSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I agreed with the GoEstimates. vernment. I gave them what they asked.,36
119,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The honourable member generally does. That is only in accordance with his disposition.,36
120,Mr LAIKDSMITH,WAR PRECAUTIONS,How is it that the industrial side gets everything?,36
121,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,We have nothing.,36
122,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I think the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) is entitled to sayfthat the industrial representative on the Commission has done good work. The Minister, of course, is primaril sponsible for the industrial side of repatriation scheme, which has certainly been well thought out. The Government, the Minister, and the Commission deserve all credit for the generous way the industrial provision has been framed, but it remains to be proved whether tralia can bear it .",36
123,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Is the honourable referring to the question of sustenance?,36
124,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I am referring to financial provision added in addition announcement. to sustenance. It is only fair that I should say that the object which the Government had in view when surer. appointing the Commission was that the scheme should not be what is called parliamentary trol. We know, however, that most of diers, these Boards, in so far as they are trolled by Ministers, are under parliathis mentary control, and a Commission of this description has in it all the elements of politics. It could not be otherwise. It is composed of representatives of the commercial and financial interests of the country, of two representatives of the soldiers, and of one representative of the Australian workers. This is one principle in respect of which I differ from the Government-the Commission's right to frame the policy. I shall conclude with a reference to the financial aspects of repatriation. So far we have not heard either from the M in ister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), the Minister in charge of the Bill in this House (Mr Groom) any authoritative statement as to the source from which we are to obtain the money to enable the Commonwealth to discharge its obligations in this respect.",36
125,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The Minister announced some time ago that sustenance was to come out of revenue, and loans for land settlement out of loan money. Amounts have already been provided for on the",36
126,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I have not noticed them. The first announcement on the subject was made a few days ago by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) .,36
127,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,But what about the amounts on the Estimates?,36
128,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The fact that we appropriate from time to time moneys for repatriation purposes does not show that the obligations of the Commonwealth in y rethis regard are to be met solely out of the revenue. The Acting Prime Minister a few days ago announced for the first time that the funds to provide for the Commonwealth's share of . repatriation were in which to be obtained by taxation.,36
129,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"That was announced in Austhe Prime Minister's Bendigo speech, and also when the original Bill was before the House. I will give the honourable memmember ber the reference in Hansard ",36
130,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I shall be glad to the have it . I do not remember any such,36
131,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,An announcement was also made at the time by the then Trea,36
132,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"If the money is to under be found by taxation, the position wtfi conbe that such money, loaned to the solon repayment will f all back into the congeneral revenue. I have brought forward question for the reason that if the policy of the Government is to provide for repatriation by taxation, then the Government will be helped materially by adopting .my suggestion that, in respect of every soldier's enterprise, an equity should be created. That equity, whatever .the amount may be, should be the g if t of the Commonwealth. Unless that is done, we shall have simply a borrowing and lending scheme under which the soldier will first of all pay interest on the loan he receives, and then, as one of the general body of taxpayers, will have to pay his share of the interest on the money originally borrowed by the Government for repatriation purposes. While in the actual amendment of the Ac t for which this Bill provides, no new principle is involved, some of the provisions of the Act will be - considerably widened. Every half-year there should be submitted to this House a statement of the operations of the repatriation scheme. I propose later on to move an amendment which, if carried, will mean that every half-year we shall have an opportunity to review the subject of repatriation. Repatriation may finally involve an obligation of many millions of pounds, and if we could secure a halfyearly statement, like those issued by the Commonwealth Bank, the Department of the Postmaster-General, and other Departments, we should have what would prove a good guide for, not only the Parliament, but the country.",36
133,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Maribyrnong) [4.55]. - I have listened with very considerable pleasure to some of the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers), but I do not agree with the remark that he made that, on paper, ample provision has been made for the industrial side of this great scheme. We have had a good many schemes on paper before today, but, unfortunately, the Bills or regulations submitted to give effect to sueh paper schemes have often fallen very far short of the actual promises given by M in isters. We are now engaged upon a work which should long since have passed beyond the experimental stage. tried again and again to induce the Government of the day to bestir themselves, and have urged that, side by side with our naval and military operations, we should prepare for the return of our soldiers. To-day, however, we find ourselves with thousands of returned soldiers for the employment of whom very little preparation has been made. Only now are we trying to put our house in order. The Repatriation Department is besieged with returned soldiers, many of whom are unable to obtain, that redress of which they are so urgently in need. Our organization in one of the most important, aspects falls far short of what it ought to be. Might I be"" permitted, without being charged with egotism, to quote some remarks that I made on this subject as far back as 21st October, 1914? That wa3 a fairly early start to make in the direction of repatriation. It is true that in those remarks I did not use the word "" repatriation,"" but I had in mind at thetime the state in which Australian industry would be at the close of the war if we did not organize and encourage our industries, as well as foster the growth of new enterprises. I recognised theni that, without adequate organization, the industrial position of Australia would bea very serious one. Speaking on the motion for the adjournment of the House,, on 21st October, 1914, I referred to a question on the subject, which I had put earlier in the day to the then Prime Minister (Mr Fisher), and went on to say, as reported in Hansard I desire to refer to a matter which, in a sense, is, perhaps, of too much importance to bring up on the motion for adjournment; but I take the opportunity of asking the Prime .Minister whether, in these exceptional times, the Government are taking any action to take the lead in organizing industries. We aregoing to have an amendment of the Tariff, which will help us considerably; but a great deal more can be done in many ways to give a fillip to Australian industries. 1 trust the Government will take the lead in the matter, even if they go to the length of calling men who are worth consulting throughout the Commonwealth into conference, in order that a strong campaign may be instituted in favour of promoting Australian industries. We should endeavour, not only to regulate, organize, and consolidate those already in existence, but also to do everything possible to establish new ones. When the war cloud lifts, which we hope will not be long, I trust AusI have tralia will be so organized industrially, commercially, and in a trading sense that we shall be able to take full advantage of the opportunities that must accrue as a consequence of the war. I hope that every phase of commercial and business life, as well as the employees, will be represented in the conference that I suggest, in order that some organization may be formed with this national object in view, so that we may be able, when the war is over, to take our stand among the nations of the world in supplying those things for the manufacture of which 'we have millions of pounds' worth of raw material in this country.  I am entirely with the honourable member for Maribyrnong regarding the question of organizing industries. Indeed, I go much further, hut I find that there is a constitutional difficulty more or less embarrassing from our point of view. The Government have, however, wit h a view of attaining the object Uiat the honourable member has put forward, asked the representatives of the States to come to Melbourne in about a fortnight or more, to consider all these matters, together with others, with a view of endeavouring to arrive at an understanding or .agreement which will enable us to proceed with any such enterprises, and so help to prevent unemployment at the present time, whilst at the same time developing national industries, which will place Australia, even in times of peace, in a safer position than slie occupies today. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Eodgers) said that ample provision has been made on the industrial side. Whilst regulation No. 88 does outline a number of ways in which we may employ returned soldiers and re-establish them in civil life, I contend that unless we have a variety of industries it will be impossible for us to do all that we should do for our men. I intimated the other day that there are declining industries in our midst, and we have taken few and very short steps in the direction of establishing new industries. If we are to provide a variety of employment for returned soldiers, it is absolutely essential that we should, make greater efforts to establish further industries. I believe in making generous allowance for those who may desire to settle on the land, but every honourable member must know that not more than 10 per cent., or at any rate 15 per cent., of the. returned men will attempt to settle on the land.",37
134,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Fort y thousand have already intimated their desire to go the land.,38
135,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Not 10 cent, of our returned soldiers will engage in land settlement.",38
136,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I am glad to have the honourable member's corroboration of view. But even if 15 per cent, were go upon the laud, we should still have to make provision in some other way the other 85 per cent.",38
137,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The Minister has said that he sought an indication from the soldiers themselves as to how many were likely to engage - in land pursuits, and about 40,000 intimated their desire to do so.",38
138,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The test to be applied is that mentioned by the honourable member for Wannon this afternoon-ho w many of those who go upon the land will remain there? No doubt thousands will give laud pursuits a trial, but when confronted with the initial difficulties that have to be faced by everybody, many, through discouragement, insufficiency of help, or disinclination for the life, will abandon their holdings. That has happened in connection with nearly every class of land settlement. A few years ago I could have taken honourable members to a closer settlement area on the Murray River, about 200 miles from Melbourne, and containing some of the choicest lucerne land in this State, and they would have regarded it as a splendidly-settled district. I question whether one of the original settlers is on that area today. I know that some of them approached the Victorian Government, and, almost at the pistol's point, demanded employment, otherwise they would expose the Government for having brought tliem from the Old Country and placed them on such a wilderness. The honourable member for Wannon is correct in advocating some banking or rural credit system for the assistance of returned soldiers who may go upon the land. Indeed, I think the States would do well, not only in connection with repatriation, to establish some sort of land bank, operated on a complete understanding of land settlement from A to Z. If the figures I have given as to the small percentage of men who will go upon upon the land are correct, we have not made anything like ample provision on the industrial side, because we have not per commenced to build the proper groundwork. The first essential of the successf ul employment of our returned men must be the establishment of a variety my of industries. I know that some of the to soldiers will be well provided for, independent of any repatriation scheme. I for know of one young grazier, as fine an Australian as one could meet in a day's march, who lost his"" arm at the Front, but had his own property to support him when he returned. There will be a number of returned soldiers in similar circumstances.",38
139,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,That is why I thought that we should have to guide us in this debate some statement or classification of the occupations of our soldiers.,39
140,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I agree with the honourable member. The House ought to have been supplied with particulars regarding the number of men who have returned, the percentage of those who have returned to their own properties or business, the number of men otherwise provided for, and the total cost of the scheme to date. Those vital particulars are being withheld at a time when honourable members are engaged in the earnest consideration of very important questions.",39
141,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The staff would require to be doubled in order to prepare the return.,39
142,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Thos e records must be in the Department; otherwise it is in a sad state of chaos. There seems to exist at present a gap between the discharge of a soldier and his oroper repatriation.,39
143,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The soldiers are generously provided for during that in terval .,39
144,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"But through ignorance or some other cause, there are men who are not participating in those benefits. I am now investigating a case of which particulars were given me today. Unfortunately, it is a fact that many returned soldiers who today may look healthy and strong may be tomorrow in a state of almost collapse. That is one of the nroblems we shall have to deal with in connection with repatriation. I know of a man who started manual labour in the Victorian Railways Department, aud worked splendidly for a fortnight. Later, some of his mates asked me to do what J could for the man, because he had completely collapsed, and was unfit for work. I am pleased to say the Victorian Railways Commisioners found lighter employment for him, thereby enabling him to win back his strength and earn a reasonable sum of money until such time as he could return to his normal place in c i / i l life. We shall have to deal with many cases of that kind from time to time. Sooner, by far, should we lose thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds, than that we should inflict hardship on those who have fought so nobly for us at the Front. Therefore, I hope monetary considerations will not deter the Department from doing its duty to our men. The case I am investigating is that of a returned soldier who was discharged because he was considered fit to engage in some occupation. His friends knew that he was not fit to work, and on their making further representations to the Repatriation Department he was again allowed a certain sum per week. A month ago iie was again discharged, and, so far, nothing has been done for him. It may be that he will yet have to wait some time before employment is found for him. We ought to be very careful in the treatment of these cases, and even though the medical officers may be suspicious of what they regard as malingering, they ought to hesitate before discharging a man and pronouncing him fit to work. Even after he is discharged he ought to have an opportunity of going to the Repatriation Department and"" asking for further consideration. Instead of taking a rosy view of the in dustrial side of repatriation activities, T think we shall have the greatest trouble in consequence of the lack of employment when the war is over. We should long ago have set about the business of organizing industries in order to provide employment. I have in hand a copy of The Soldier, the official journal of the Returned Soldiers Association, of the 24th May last, and an article in which the writer discusses what choice of occupation soldiers will make, and to which States they will go, contains this paragraphThe living conditions obtaining in the various States will have a profound eflect in influencing discharged soldiers in the choice of their future homes. Naturally, one of the first questions they will ask themselves is, which State is the best to live""in. That may be an arguable point, but recent developments in Queensland considerably advance the claims of that particular State. Further on the writer says that two considerations will operate with the returned soldier in seeking a State in which to settle down, namely, the seasons, and the class of government, and I quite agree with the concluding words of the paragraph I have just read. Unless I have been wrongly informed, Queensland . s ; doing better for returned soldiers than s any other State.",39
145,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Has the able member facts in proof of that statement 1,40
146,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Yes ; unless my information is wrong. There is no desire to give any party political character to this matter of making provision for returned soldiers. If the Liberal Government in Victoria should make better provision for them than any other State may - do, I would be prepared to grve tbem every credit for it . Credit ought to be given to any Government, Labour or Liberal, that does its duty to returned men. In Victoria, which is said to be the garden State of Australia, we may not have the large areas of land available which can be found in Queensland; but, in the matter of providing employment, we ought to be able to do as well as has been done in Queensland.",40
147,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The difference price of land has to be considered.,40
148,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"That is so. The cost of living is also a big item. I am not a pessimist; but I cannot help thinking that - there are dark days ahead for the Commonwealth, and that they will be darker and blacker unless something is done to organize industry and provide employment, not only for those who return to us, but also for those who are with us now, and wish to remain here, aud for those whom we hope to be able to induce to come here. What will be the use of training men unless they are able to secure employment easily ? No one wishes to see the returned soldier taking the place of the married man who has a family to maintain. Our desire should be to see our old industries so flourishing, and our new industries so firmly established, that we shall be able to train our returned men and put them into new industries, thus avoiding the necessity for displacing men from the positions which they now hold. I give place to no man in saying that we should do everything to make provision for our returned soldiers; but the system now in operation, not only in the Federal Departments, but also in some of the State ' Departments, is to dismiss men wholesale in order to provide positions for returned men. Such a thingshould not be necessary when we have only a limited number of men to deal with, and that it is done merely shows how sadly belated is our scheme of organization. The work of repatriation should have been organized honor- and made ready for the time when our first soldier returned and had to be dealt with. However, that was not done, and the result is that today we are scrambling along trying to make the pace as hot as we can in order to catch up the months wherein we have neglected this important question. New offices have been opened in Melbourne, and they will be crowded, not only by returned soldiers, but also by the dependants of other soldiers who are seeking in formation. We have waited too long' before attempting to deal with this problem, and, unfortunately, we must have these people crowding into the Repatriation Offices in their hundreds. Injustices are bound to occur through hurry, and mistakes will be made which will have to be remedied later on; but, in the meantime, there will be a considerable amount in the of hurt and irritation which could have been avoided. I regret that we did not undertake the scheme long before it was commenced. I blame no particular Government for the delay. In 1914, side by side with our naval and military preparations, we should have set about the organization of the industrial side of repatriation work. It is essential that the two things should proceed side by side. Otherwise there must be chaos in the aftermath of the war. My reading has shown me that in this regard every country is much further advanced than we are. I am speaking of countries with big populations. France has been h it harder than any other country engaged in the fighting; but when the war is over the organization of that country is such, and so far-seeing have its leaders been, that it will be able to demobilize its men and put them into various employments with far less disturbance and dislocation than there are bound to be in Australia, which is 12,000 miles away from the battle front.",40
149,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,It has had previous experience of war and knows what has to be done.,40
150,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"That is true; but we ought to live in the light of other days. We have had no experience of fighting, but we know what the experience of other people has been. What has been the experience in Great Britain? Heroes of Waterloo died in the poorhouse. It was a disgrace to the nation. Why have we not profited by the experience of Great Britain? The slight experience we had in regard to the Boer war, and the manner in which our wounded soldiers were treated, should have been a sufficient lesson to us. Although we have not previously gone through the awful experience of a big war, we cannot put that fact forward as an excuse for neglecting to make provision for our men on their return from the Pront. They will come back in a very determined frame of mind. They will have seen life amidst most tragic surroundings.",40
151,Mr LAIKD SMITH,WAR PRECAUTIONS,They will come back with a love for Australia.,41
152,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I believe it. I want them to come back with a love for the people of Australia. We have been left behind, as it were, as trustees and guardians of their rights and privileges, and of everything they hold near and dear. They carry with them a memory of Australia which has buoyed them up in most trying circumstances, and has helped them to fight their battles. But I want tliem to come back, not to the Australia they left, but to a better Australia. If we cannot have a better Australia for them, I will not blame them if some of them come into the portals of this House and accuse us of having betrayed the confidence which they reposed in us to look after their interests while they were away. What has any Government done in a material sense beyond a very paltry amendment of the Tariff in order to encourage industry and provide employment for these men, or for those who have remained behind? Practically nothing has been done. There has been a lot of talk about a shipbuilding scheme.",41
153,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Does the honourable member believe that many new industries will spring up while the war-time profits tax is hanging over them like a sword of Damocles ?,41
154,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I cannot remember the exact number of millions that represent the revenue which has been provided in Great Britain by the taxation of the excess profits.,41
155,Mr LAIED,WAR PRECAUTIONS,SMITH - How many new industries have been established in Great Britain siuce the war broke out?,41
156,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Many industries have been established - there. Does the honourable member say that the people of Great Britain have done nothing to establish the dye industry, in which Germany was so pre-eminent?",41
157,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The British Government have done it.,41
158,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I am not particular as to who has done it. The fact remains that Great Britain has thrown over her antiquated Free Trade ideas, and today is in a better organized state than she has ever been in her history, and she is better prepared to receive her demobilized men into established industries than Australia will be at the termination of the war. I am glad that the British Government are giving a lead to private enterprise.",41
159,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"A young man who established a foundry in Victoria, finding that he had to pay £600 to the Government as its share of his excess profits, has just decided to close his establishment and commence agency work.",41
160,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The ex-member for Plinders (Sir William Irvine) spoke of the Bill imposing the war-time profits tax as a paltry measure, by which men who were making big profits and enjoying large incomes would not be touched, while men who were establishing new industries would be penalized.",41
161,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The same thing applies in Great Britain.,41
162,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"To some extent it does. I was pointing out that new industries are being established in Great Britain, where the tax is much heavier, and where there is also a heavier income tax to be paid. There is no doubt they are heavily taxed in Great Britain. It is claimed that new industries will not be started because of the imposition of heavy taxation. As a matter of fact, new industries are starting in Great Britain, and very often taxation is a good promoter of industrial enterprise.",41
163,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,You must remember the case of the dyes that you quoted.,41
164,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I quoted it as only one.,41
165,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,It is an important one.,41
166,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"There is, for instance, agriculture, which has been most neglected in Great Britaiin.",41
167,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Good s cannot be placed on the market unless the dyes are made in Great Britain.,41
168,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,That is since the war.,41
169,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,It was forced on Great Britain .,42
170,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"And it ought have been forced on us. During the first nine months of the present financial year we have paid out about £60,000,000 of money in respect of goods coming this country, and a large proportion which could have been manufactured here. If we do not establish suitable dustries we shall not be able to make proper provision for the men who will be demobilized in the future. members opposite tell us that they have thrown overboard many of their old Free our hands. Trade ideas; and I should like to see some distinct evidence of the fact i shape of their urging the Government to should name him. take action. If private people will establish industries, then the Federal and the other Governments of Australia ought to take a hand. That is the in Great Britain in order to supply goods formerly imported from Germany; and private employers. because of that action on the part of some of the most conservative in the Country there has been a great developDepartment ment of private enterprise. Here, howcan ever, we have not made proper provision in this way, not only for our returned soldiers, but for the community genethat rally ; and I see nothing for it but drastic action on the part of the Government, whom all possible help would be given this Parliament. When a previous meathe sure was before us,' honourable members on this side sought to have some amendfrom ments made; and had those amendments been accepted, a great improvement suffers would have resulted in the way of f u r thering such efforts as I am now urging. I agree with by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) about the inadvisability handing over to outside bodies much in Melbourne. work that should be done by Parliament itself, because the further we allow schemes to be removed, the less control we shall have. At the same time, responsibility will be ours, and in future we shall be asked why we, as custodians of the rights and privicannot leges of the soldiers and the people, did not keep in closer touch with these matters. When questions asked here relating to these schemes, information we receive will come from . outside bodies, and we shall have to simply sit idly by while the scheme ministered. If it is not too late, I urge the co-operation of honourable members on both sides to do something for that 85 or to 90 per cent, of the returned men who, I feel sure, wall not go on the land. I . speak more in sorrow than in angerthough those to whom I refer ought to into be held up to public opprobrium-whe n of I say that many in the community have not honoured the bond into which they in - entered to re-employ returned men. The more this bond is disregarded ' the greater becomes the responsibility of ParHonorable liament and the Government, because the more men will be, as it were, thrown on",42
171,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"If I knew one n the employer who had broken his bond I I have made in not quiries, and I cannot find any.",42
172,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Why , even Public Departments have refused to honour their course taken word in this regard. Mr ^RICHARD POSTER - They are not",42
173,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"But private employers Old have been the worse offenders. A Public has the knowledge that it always be brought to book in Parliament, and in this connection we here can exercise more control. I say again some 85 per cent, of the returned men will desire some other form of reto patriation than that of settlement on the by land. Personally, I should prefer to see whole, or the great bulk of them take to country pursuits, because, if we suffer anything, it is from concentration in our"" great cities, and, perhaps, no State more i u this regard than Victoria.",42
174,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"All the States much said are alike, relatively.",42
175,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I do not think so, for of in Victoria about half the population is",42
176,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,It is the same these in South Australia and elsewhere.,42
177,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I Bave every symthe pathy with the desire to settle our rethe turned men on the land, but we have to the face the facts as we find them, and I forget the number of failures I have known amongst heal thy, vigorous men who have taken up country life. My own are opinion is that not more than 10 per cent, the of the returned men would be successfully settled on the land, and the remainder will h ave to be provided for in the way of is ademployment. Heaven deliver us from a position in which men, who have for years carried out certain duties, are discharged in order to make room for returned soldiers! We ought to be able to offer the returned men a variety of congenial occupations, but, as a matter of fact, our.industries are in a more backward state than I believe is the case in any other belligerent country. The iron ore in dustry, the cement Industry, and the establishment of more woollen mills, would provide considerable employment; and there are many other avenues that might be opened up. The Goverpment ought to set to work at once, for without proper groundwork we cannot expect a lasting superstructure.",42
178,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Wide Bay) [ 5 . 3 9 ] quite agree that we should, as early as possible, pass legislation with the object establishing many industries which I think coulcl be carried - on profitably in Australia, and wonld largely assist in the settlement of our returned men. listened with great pleasure to the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rbdgers) ou the subject of repatriation. No man more than the honourable member has devoted time and trouble to this work; and here I may say that if he had been a representative"" of one of the Queensland electorates, a difficulty that seems to be troubling him now would bave vanished. The honourable member 'very properly urges the advisability of making provision for settling soldiers on the land, and expresses his fear that many of the returned men placed on land estimated to be of the value of £2,500 will abandon that land pendent. after bad seasons; and"", considering - the price and conditions, I do not see that we can look forward to anything else. However, there is a remedy that I think I shall be able to make clear to the House. We have a very capable Minister for Repatriation, who has his heart in the pro-» per place for work of the k in d ; and he affords an illustration of the desirability of a parliamentary recess at the present juncture. The Minister for Repatriation, as leader of another place, is kept in liament while he is anxious to enter undisturbed upon ""the work of his Department; and the sooner we get into recess the sooner the scheme can be successfully launched. I have recently had an opportunity of visiting some of the Commonwealth factories, and observing Jiow, wherever possible, employment is given to returned soldiers. I was particularly interested the other day, on visiting the Caulfield Hospital, to see that the whole of those there engaged in turning out artificial limbs had themselves lost limbs in the war. This, of course, insures the utmost sympathy in the work, and it was pleasing to see how these men, themselves fitted with artificial limbs, were able to move about, and quite easily and comfortably do their work. To-day, we have heard of the number of regulations that have been issued in connection with repatriation,' and no doubt we shall hear of many more. We must not forget that, for the first time in the world, - I a scheme of this kind is being launched in a young country like this. In France, of where, unfortunately, there has been long and bitter experience of war, it was only necessary to call into being schemes of the past^. We have never previously I had occasion to consider such a scheme in Australia. We must learn by experience how it may best be carried out, and must frame regulations based on that experience. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor) has stated that a number of the returned men will desire to settle in the metropolitan areas. No doubt that is so, but that difficulty may be avoided if , as the part of our scheme of repatriation, returned soldiers are given the opportunity in rura l districts to make homes for themselves and become indeI f they can be induced to occupy the land, its value will increase very rapidly. There is no reason why Australia should not succeed as the United States of America have done. The people of the United States saw f it to adopt a protectionist policy, which encouraged production, uot only by .the primary, but also by the secondary, in dustries. The United States of America do not command the same variety of productions that we might have in Australia, Par- but there are now some 100,000,000 of people there, whilst we have but 5,000,000 in Australia. There is room in this country for great expansion. I have no doubt that our young men who have shown so much pluck and determination in the prosecution of the war will , when they return, exhibit the same qualities, and succeed upon the land. I do not think it is right to say that, because a certain number of soldiers who have returned maimed or in ill-health do not go upon the land, only 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, of our soldiers will be prepared to do so. The men referred to are physically unfit to go upon the land, and it would be nothing short of criminal to drive them on to a settlement and expect them to make a living there. These men might very well be employed in trades in the metropolitan centres, and provision should be, and is being made by the regulations under the Eepatriation Act for their proper treatment. But I look forward to the time when we shall have from 100,000 to 200,000 soldiers returning who will be physically f it to undertake any work that men can do. Many of our soldiei-3 have already intimated that they would like to go upon the land after their return from the war. No fewer than 40,000 of them have already informed the Minister for Eepatriation that it is their desire to go on the land when they return. It must be clear to honourable members that men who have had three or four years of life in the open will prefer rural occupations to work in warehouses and shops. believe it will be found to be the desire of a great many of our returning soldiers to go upon the land aud carve out an independence for themselves there, as many of the pioneers in the past have done, and they were not of better metal than our brave boys. It has been stated that uo provision is made to enable unmarried men to go upon the land and secure a home. was a member of the Queensland Parliament when regulations were passed, under a Liberal Government, to enable any man who had not a home, but had a little money, say, £ 5 0 or £ 1 0 0 , or land to that value, to obtain an advance three times that value at 4 per cent, twenty-one years, for the purpose of erecting a dwelling. The total cost of mortgage, releases of mortgage, plans for the dwelling and supervision, is only about £ 3 in each case through the vernment Department. Provision was made also that a man desiring to go upon the land and in a position to pay one-fortieth of the cost of the land might a PP'y *° the Agricultural Bank for an advance of £200, which would be paid him as he required the money during construction of his home, for clearing his - Queensland. land, fencing it , or providing water. Under this provision any man or two men working together might do their work for themselves and be paid for it , aud the advance might be obtained for a period of twenty years at 5 per cent. The land to which these provisions were applied was first class land, in good districts, and the price was fixed at from 10s. up to £2 per acre. A further provision was that the settler was given twenty years in which to pay 50 per cent, of the advance made to him, and there was to be no redemption for the first five years, only interest charges, and the balance to be paid in the twenty-first year. I believe that these provisions are in force in Queensland at the present time. But the State Government may require to obtain financial assistance from the Commonwealth Government by way of loan during the war for this work, and for railway construction through Crown agricultural lands. On the question as to whether land is available for returned soldiers, I should like honourable members to know that if I they desire to assist our returned soldiers by placing them in a position in which they may carve out for themselves an in dependence and a happy home, there is no State in which better facilities are offered for the purpose than are offered in Queensland. There is no scarcity of land there. Up to date we have only alienated between 5 and 6 per cent, of the public estate. We have in Queensland no less than 409,000,000 acres unalienated. I Surely out of that area any amount of land may be obtained for a far greater number of settlers than would be represented by the number of our returning soldiers. Unfortunately, some honourable memof bers who live in the southern States do for not visit Queensland to learn what the conditions of life there are. They imagine that the hardships which men on the land have to contend against in Queensland are greater than those which are met with in Go the other States, principally because of the character of the climate. I have had a great deal of experience in Queensland since I was fourteen years of age, and I say that life on the land is as comfortable in Queensland as it is in Victoria. I have lo explained some of the conditions under the which people may obtain land in I have said that they may obtain advances on the of the land, and are not called upon to pay more than 50 per cent, of the purchase money in the first twenty years. Por the convenience of settlers to make their own improvements, advance of -£200 is made, but they may secure another £1,000 at 5 per cent, based upon a valuation of 15s. m the £1. That is infinitely better than having to pay, say, £2,500 for a small area of land valued at from £20 to £40 an acre, and being obliged to pay not only_.interest on that sum but land and other taxation as well upon that valuation, instead of from £.1 to £2.",43
179,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,What interest charged on the first £200 advanced?,45
180,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The interest charged is 5 per cent., but the purchase of the land is spread over a number of years. That system was in existence for some years before I left the Queensland Parlialocality ment. At the time. I left I made inquiries to discover whether under that system the Agricultura l Bank was losing money. I found that so far from losing money under the system, the bank made quire a slight profit on it . If any settler did fail, there was found no difficulty getting another prepared to take up his liabilities and property. So far as vances for the construction of workers' dwellings were concerned, there was not one instance in which there was a loss, though thousands of dwellings were tivation. erected under the conditions I have named. I am sorry that when the Premiers of the States met to consider the matter, Premier of Queensland was the only one who refused to go into the repatriation scheme. This makes it very much harder for any scheme of repatriation to be carried out by the Commonwealth. I The hope some arrangement w'ill made by which the Minister for Repatusually riation could visit Queensland to inspect the lands available for settlement, and come to some agreement with the State Government to secure for returned soldiers land at the cheapest possible rate, facilities for the transport of the produce of the land to market. I should like honourable members io give attention to a scheme which, I think, would be found to be workable. I Queensland at the present time the Govalne vernment are faced with a difficulty, common to the Governments of all the States, in financing the construction of railways to lands available for settlement. desiring An advance by the Commonwealth to the a first Queensland Government for the construction of a railway in the Wide Ray electorate of £1,000,000 would provide sufficient land, in close touch with existing markets, to meet the requirements of at least 15,000 returned soldiers.",45
181,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Would that laud be close to the land that is already settled ?,45
182,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"It would be close to some, and with in a reasonable distance is of all. The only difference between the land which is not settled .and that which is settled is that the former has the advantage of a railway, whilst the latter has not. The lands of which I am speaking are of excellent quality, and the dairying industry in the is an exceedingly prosperous one. Within my own electorate there are no fewer than twelve dairy factories, nearly all of which are of a co-operative character. Consequently, a man does not rea very large capital with which to begin operations there, and has the A g r i in cultural Bank to assist him. His cream is conveyed to the factory for him, and he adis paid for his products, whether they be cream, milk, or cheese, every month. Further, it is always possible to combine dairying with pig-growing and maize culI n the district of which I speak, maize-growing is very profitable. Quite a large number of young farmers from Victoria have settled there, and they have the made more money than their fathers did in this State, and with a far less expenditure. Anybody who journeys through the country of which I am sneaking will find that the settlers are absolutely satisfied. climate is an ideal one in winter, and be not too bad in summer. The settlers work together, they assist in taking-off each other's crops, and, as a result of their general co-operation, they do not feel the scarcity of labour as acutely as they would otherwise do. I and do not know of a single farmer from the southern States who has settled upon these lands and who has regretted his action. That being so, I am sure that our hardy soldiers who will return to us after the war will be equally successful. Years n ago we established Government experimental farms in the agricultural districts of Queensland for the purpose of teaching agriculturists what could be produced on the different varieties of soil to the greatest advantage. But there is no need for sueh establishments today. If our returned. soldiers are settled in the country to which I am directing attention, I am sure that the residents there will be only too proud to assist them, and to show in that way their appreciation of the magnificent services they have rendered to Australia. We know that in Manitoba, some years ago, a scheme was undertaken by which the Government gave to private enterprise alternate blocks of land conditionally upon private enterprise constructing a railway through them. But, now there is no necessity to encourage private individuals to do this. I feel convinced that if the Government of Queensland were asked by the Commonwealth Government to make so much land available in different districts conditionally upon the Commonwealth advancing to it by way of loan the. money necessary to build railways through those districts, the lines would be constructed without delay, principally for the benefit of returned soldiers. Thus thousands of soldiers would be settled in areas where there would be no risk of the land being thrown back upon the Government. Again, men returning from the war would have the benefit of all the in formation which the earlier settlers had to acquire at their own expense. In Queensland there is an Agricultural Department which undertakes the analyses of soils, so that every settler can be told exactly what his soil will produce, and thus the risk of planting something which it will not grow is obviated. Queensland there are available hundreds of thousands of acres of beautiful chocolate soil, such as is to be found at Warrnambool and other parts of Victoria where onions and potatoes are largely grown. There are also big tracts of scrub land, which could easily be cleared by returned soldiers. The first step taken in the cultivation of these lands is to fell the scrub. scrub is allowed to lie until the leaves dry, then, upon a favourable day they are set on fire, and the fire burns off the scrub timber down to the stumps. Maize is then planted,' and most prolific crops are obtained-crop s ranging up to 160 bushels per acre. While the maize is growing, Rhodes grass is planted, and for five years afterwards the settlers keep their dairy cattle upon this grass, which maintains as many as three cows to 2 acres, A f t e r that period, the Rhodes grass is allowed to dry, a fire is put into it , and nearly every stump is burned out of the ground. A f t e r that, the stumpjump plough is used - The cost of preparing this land for intensive cultivation, is, therefore, a very small one, and about 15s. out of every £ 1 of expenditure is provided by the State Agricultural Bank. Thus a man is soon able to show what he is made of, and, as a rule, he experiences no difficulty in getting whatever assistance he may require from the local storekeeper. He is thus enabled to pay, not merely his annual interest and a proportion of his purchase, money, but also to improve his holding to such an extent that farmers fro m New South Wales and Victoria are very glad to give him from £ 8 to £ 1 0 per acre for it . Now is the time to arrange for putting some such scheme into operation, with a view to preparing for those soldiers who will return to us Unscathed' after the war. It is only the able-bodied men who will go upon the land, and we ought to let them have it upon the most favourable terms. Prior to their departure, we pledged ourselves that during their absence we would safeguard their interests in every way, and that, upon their return, adequate provision would be made for them. By doing what I have suggested we shall show them that we are determined to see that these pledges are respected. I sincerely hope that the Minister'will pay an early visit to Queensland, with a view to seeing In whether he cannot make some arrangement with the Government of that State under which these lands will be made available for the settlement of our returned soldiers. The whole scheme ought to be so arranged that those who are now fighting for us overseas may be settled on these lands on the same terms as tens of thousands of men from the Old Country have been settled there. The In other States-for instance, in Tasmania-althoug h they have very fine in dustries established, they have not the land, and they have not got it available at the price that we have. Moreover, they cannot clear their country, because the trees are not of the character that will easily burn, as is the case in Queensland. It is a different class of timber altogether. We do not realise what a disadvantage of that kind is. I would dearly like honourable members representing the other States to visit - Queensland, so that they might see exactly what has .been done by young men who have settled there from other parts of Australia. Honourable members would be well satisfied, then, to do all possible to provide for still more men to follow and take up the good land that is awaiting. A visit of inspection would show that the disabilities that exist in otlier States are unknown there. There are such advantages as the cheapness of the land, and its readiness of clearing; and then there is the fact that nobody has got in ahead and already picked out the best blocks. The areas to which I refer have not been thrown open indiscriminately, but there are huge tracts of good land being utilized for cattleraising, which will remain so right up to the time that the Government throw them open for selection. In this district, namely, Wide Bay, there are 648,000 head of cattle. Those figures alone in dicate the magnitude of the electorate. It is nearly the size of Tasmania, and there is room for a very large settlement, seeing that ""there are still 7,700,000 acres unalienated which are under lease from the Government to those who are now growing stock upon it . W it h respect ' to a great deal of this territory, notices had been given, before the war. for the termination of the leases. Some of those l»ases have lapsed, and the Government are now granting only occupation licences. This systemamounts to the giving of three months' notice, I understand, when the Government can cut it up and make it available for closer settlement. A great deal of the area has been veyed. A railway line has also beeu veyed, but the trouble is that constructhey tion could not be gone on with owing war conditions, whereas but for factor the line would have been built and the land made available for closer settlement. There is no such having to buy that land back or being required to give compensation. for deprivgrant ing a man of his lease. Those areas merely await the construction of the then they can be thrown open for selection Mr Corser. for closer settlement. It is all good and fertile land. All that is required is an arrangement with the Queensland Government by which the territory in question may be made available for our returned boys. They would thus gain an enormous advantage compared with what could be provided for them in any other part of the Commonwealth. I make that statement without fear of contradiction, having traversed that country over and over again. I have spent many years in it, and have followed its development from the time when it contained 2,000 inhabitants to the present period, when there are about 96,000, if you include Gympie.",45

I travelled in a motor over one strip of ground, from one station to another, for more than 12 miles, where there was scarcely a tree to be removed; and my track took me alongside a fine stream.

194,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Melbourne) [7.45] I listened with great interest to the speech made by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), and I think it is well that Victorian members should know what Queensland is doing for the repatriation of our soldiers. I hope, therefore, that the newspapers will make reference to the speech, so that the Victorian Government, which, in my opinion, is doing least of all, may have a stimulus to do more in this direction in order to prevent what I believe will take place, namely, the migration of soldiers and their dependants to the northern State. I have advised my fellow-Victorians, upon their return, that if they want a really square deal as returned soldiers, they should go to Queensland, and that is why I interposed while the honourable member was speaking to ask if it had been publicly stated that the Queensland Government gave a welcome not only to their own men but to every Australian soldier who had offered himself, and was prepared, if necessary, to make the supreme sacrifice in defence of the liberties which we all enjoy. In my judgment, Queensland stands on a pinnacle of what might be termed Australia's gratitude to the men who have offered their services in this war. Next to Queensland, I think, comes Western Australia. I have given somo study to the position in that State, having been twice there this year, and I understand that if a returned soldier desires to go upon the land, but is not able ta do the hard work himself, he can take a mate with him. The blocks are surveyed in sufficient area to support a family, and there is a full description of the timber, the quality of the soil, and other necessary information. When a settler has made £ 5 0 or £100 worth of improvements, he has only to apply to the Government for assistance, and within a week or ten days an officer of the Department prepares a valuation, upon which an advance is made from the Agricultural Bank, so that a returned soldier settling on the land in Western Australia is able to earn wages from the first day he gets his land. I fear, however, that owing to the stringency of the money market caused by the war, the Western Australian Government are experiencing difficulty in financing the scheme. I trust the Commonwealth Government will give all the assistance possible, not only to the Agricultural Bank in that State, but to any other Agricultural Banks that are doing good work in the interests of our soldiers. There is no doubt that the potentialities of Queensland are greater than those of any other State. I remember, forty-five years ago, how the Darling Downs country was spoken of. In my recent visit to the district I verified all that I heard then, and I understand there are other areas of country, equally as good, stretching right across that vast State. I was very glad, indeed, to hear from the honourable member for Wide Bay that a hearty welcome will be given by that State to any Australian soldier upon his return.",48
195,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I think that all the States have even gone so far as to include Imperial soldiers in their schemes of repatriation.,48
196,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I am glad to hear it , but I hope the other States will do better than Victoria has done in the past.  Wannon, do you ? O",48
197,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I am referring to the whole of Victoria. . I look forward to the time when, under an efficient system of land settlement, home farms will be established to bridge that terrible hiatus between the school age and adult years of the rising generation, together with educational institutions in which, according to their mental ability, the girls and boys of Australia will be able to receive efficient instruction in secondary or technical education, or domestic or other callings. I look for the establishment of these "" h o m e "" farmsdescribed by what I regard as the most beautiful word in the English languageclustering around .the agricultural colleges, where all those interested in the various branches of production may receive advice as to cultivation methods and the course to be pursued in the fight against any of those diseases or pests which so often retard success in our primary industries. By this means, I think, it will be possible to deal with that unfortunate army of unemployed which seems to develop, even in the highest form of civilization. How much better would it be if , by some such system as this, we could satisfactorily settle our people upon the l and ; and if , in this we could insure the future of our returning soldiers ? My reading of the various medical journals have confirmed me in the beliief that if a man has merely received what is described as shell shock it may be very difficult indeed, afterwards, for him to earn his living. No one can say what nervous disorders may 'follow upon shell shock.

219,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The cloth is made of pure wool, without admixture of cotton. When this cloth is sold to private factories at 4s. 6d., they can supply suits to the Government for 28s. 6d. Prom these facts, honourable members may judge of the advantage it would be to our soldiers, and to the community at large if the spinning and weaving of cloth were entirely under the control of the Commonwealth. I understand that our Factory submits a tender in competition with outside firms, which cut the price pretty fine, but it can make at a lower rate. When outside work is needed, the mean between the highest and lowest price submitted is taken, and the amount of work to be done is apportioned between the various factories applying for it . I have here samples of handwoven cloth. I regret, however, that the Government countenances what is, in effect, sweating. That is, if the returned soldier who is engaged in weaving is drawing a pension .of 15s. a week, he is not allowed to earu more than 27s., but if he has not a pension he may earn 42s., or 10s. more if a married man, though the pension is deducted even in the case of married men. The excuse for this that the men are learning their trade. They want to be paid 2s. a yard when they become expert in weaving, that is, for the double-width piece. could make 6 yards a day, and thus earn 12s. They should not be fined or sweated by the deduction of their pensions. Near the corner of Queen and Latrobe streets - at 246 Queen-street-the men are making their own looms. I understand that any one with a free wrist can earn his living by weaving. I wish the Minister to allow here what the Red Cross allows in Sydney. Let the men be paid 2s. per yard of double width. The cost of the tweed that is made may be calculated in this way. The sum of ls. 6d. per Clothing yard is allowed for weaving, the wool costs 3s. 4d., the finishing about 6d., and overhead charges about 7d. That works out at 6s. 4d. per yard double width. These woollens are sold wholesale at 15s. per yard, and retailed at £ 1 per yard. One of the greatest buyers of wool in Australia, whose operations have been affected by the lack of shipping accommodation, has accepted a position as wool appraiser to the Commonwealth, and he assures me that this cloth in England would bring far more than 20s. per yard, and I appeal to the Minister to see that these men receive 2s. per yard, without any deductions in respect of any pension drawn by them. I have to thank the honourable member  questions which he put today to the M in ister representing the Minister for Repatriation. He askedHow many returned soldiers are now engaged in hand-loom weaving ? The reply wasSeven in Victoria. His second question wasHow many of such are now qualified workers ? The reply wasProbably two. The honourable member also askedWhat remuneration did they receive as learners, and did this include their pensions t The Minister's answer was- Including pensions, the men receive £2 2s. per week in the case of the single men, and, in the case of the married men, £2 2s. per week, with an additional allowance of 3s. 6d. is per week for each child under the age of sixteen years. In other words', pensions are deducted, single men not being allowed to receive They more than £ 2 2s. per week each including their pensions. Instead of seven returned soldiers now being engaged in hand-loom weaving in Victoria, there ought to be seventy; but can we blame the men for not going on with this work when, if they are in receipt of a pension of 15s. per week, they are not permitted to earn more than 27s. per week in addition?",51
220,Mr MCGRATH,WAR PRECAUTIONS,How can they live on such a wage?,51
221,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I do not know. I should like the ""bosses"" to try to live on the same wage. The honourable member for Echuca went on to askWhat is their remuneration now as qualified workers, and does this include their pensions ? 'Thfc reply wasTheir payment is now being continued as ""trainees. The fifth question wasWere they promised remuneration at 2s. per yard "" plain work"" as soon as they became proficient? The Minister answeredThis hand-weaving school was established by the State War Council, and inquiries from that body have elicited the assurance that no such promise was given. The sixth question wasIs the Department awa.ro that 6 yards per - day is estimated to be a fair day's work, or, ""translated into pay, £3 12s. per week? The answer wasSix yards per day is considered by those who have a knowledge of the industry to be a fair average production. Finally the honourable member asked Will the Government, in fulfilment of the policy of preference to returned wounded soldiers, give first preference to this - industry *y supplying them with all the yarn they require at cost price? I call special attention to the replyThe Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong are making available all the yarn they can spare, having regard to their own requirements for the making of khaki cloth to supply the Army. It is difficult to see how preference can be given except in this way. The explanation of the shortage is that if these returned soldiers would agree to supply only Flinders-lane warehousemen there would be no trouble. They want, however, the right to supply tailors direct, and so to save the public the extortionate profits made by warehousemen. That is why these restrictions are imposed upon their output. It is said that they are interfering with private enterprise. Each soldier could work his own loom in his own house, proper encouragement were given, we could have in a little while, not seven, but 700 so employed. On the three occasions that I visited the Factory there were more than seven men working. There is a gentleman there who can teach any man in three months how to earn his living in this way; but since better wages are offering outside we cannot expect the men to [200 ] remain. I have no complaint to make against those in charge, but I invite honourable members to consider the difference between the pay they receive and the miserable pittances to which these men are restricted.",52
222,Mr RODGEKS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The whole woollen industry can be developed here.,52
223,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I am going to Sydney to inquire into the industry there, and if I find that the small progress made here is due to the responsible officers I shall give them a warm quarter of an hour. Will any one say that it is reasonable not to let these men earn whatever they can in addition to the pensions they receive because of injuries obtained by them while fighting at the Front? The menace of the future is finance. The old historical rules of finance must break beneath the shock of the f r i g h t f u l and stupendous debt caused by this war. The interest on such indebtedness. would enslave the workers for ever. It would imperil our industries by the introduction of a revenue Tariff, and thus destroy the Protectionist policy. Every Australian who loves his country should pledge himself to efficient and real Protection in 1 order to supply every want the human needs. No country offers to the man will ing to work such possibilities as are offering in Australia today. Coming to the question of the insurance of the lives ,of our soldiers, I regret that we are not treating our men as well as the Government of the Dnited States of America are treating their Forces. The National Mutual L if e Assurance Society of Australia Limited has done something to help those of its policy-holders who enlist. An y policy-holder who was in sured before the war is not required to pay any increased premium if he goes to the Front, but in respect of those who have since insured their lives a penalty of from £ 7 10s. to £ 1 0 per £100 is exacted while they are on active service. The chairman of the association, at its annual and, if meeting, in March, 1917, said-rThousands of our policy-holders-exactl y how many it is impossible for me to say-hav e felt compelled to offer their lives in defence of the Empire and its ideals of liberty and humanity. Up to the end of our last financial year 498 had been called upon for the full sacrifice, and our death claims were increased. Notwithstanding these unexpected and, in a sense, unprovided for claims, the total is only 77 per cent, of the expectation. In other words, the anticipated mortality has not been realized. In the December issue of Munsey's Magazine there appeared an article, by A r t h u r Hunter, entitled "" Pensions and Insurance for our Pighting M e n , "" which explained the United States governmental scheme for making just provision for its sailors, soldiers, and their dependants. In that article it is stated that the life of every officer, and private in the United States' A r m y is insured for £800, and, that, in addition, any man may insure up to £1,200 at pre-war rates. I have something now to say in regard to broken promises. The following is a letter which I received from that friend of the soldiers, the late Sir John Madden, shortly before his d e at h My Dear Dr Maloney - I am very grateful to vou for your most kind letter of friendly goodwill ancl wise advice. I quite agree with you that theNation's promise is so deeply graven to our noble and self-sacrificing soldiers that none can bo so base as to deny it reverence to the full. With warm thanks and every good wish, Let me remind the House what Sir John Madden said to our men who went to the Boer war. I was charged at the time with being a pro-Boer, and I was. I thought the war unjust, and said so publicly. I did' nob think thab Britain , as the result of that war, would write one of the most glorious pages in hev history as she did when she gave the two crushed Boer Republics tlieir freedom aud a franchise which even Englishmen in England have not been permitted to enjoy. one fought harder than I did to secure justice for those of our men who returned from the Beer war. They were vilely treated by the State Government, proHe mises made by the Government of the day being scandalously broken. As ing on the point, I propose to read following letter, dated 5th November, 1915, which I received from the late John Madden in answer to an inquiry I made as to a controversy then proceedWas ing:Dear Dr Maloney - I hope that you will forgive my delay in replying to your note of 29th ult., but I have been grea'tlv occupied, I desired to turn up for you the incidents which your recollection was turning. I not, as you seem to think, "" promise as LieuSouth tenant-Governor, on behalf of the Victorian vernment, that soldiers who went to the South Dr Maloney. African war would, upon their return, receive preferential consideration for State employment"" in so many words, but, after informing myself as to the late "" Mr Allan MCLean's views and wishes on the matter, for he was then Premier, I did, after expressing to the Contingent which was leaving for the war, in March, 1900, the admiration and grateful feeling of the people of Victoria, say to the effect that their earnest hppe was for the safe return of them all, and that the Government desired to make Victoria the most attractive place on earth to them, and would see that every reasonable thing which would draw them home after the war, and keep them there in comfort and with means to prosper, would be, so, far as possible, done. Later, a returned soldier, named Williams, wrote to the Argus a letter, which was published on 13th July, 1901, complaining that that promise had not been kept. .[ wrote to Mr Williams, on the 14th July, 1001, a letter, which is 'reproduced in Hansard, volume 98 (1901), at page 1530. That letter was referred to by the late Sir Thomas Bent, who raised a question of privilege in re-' spect of its publication by the Argus, and a debate ensued, which appears in the same volume at page 1529, et seq. Very truly yours, JOHN MADDEN. I have read that letter in case any bonorVery sincerely yours, able member should question my stateJOHN MADDEN. ment that Victoria did not do its duty to the soldiers who returned from the South African war, and, as I showed earlier, has not, in comparison with New South Wales, done its duty to the widows of the men who died at the Front. The Argus of the 24th September, 1901, has a report headed: ""Returned soldier looking in vain for work: A bitter complaint."" It is there reported that ex-Trooper W . E. No Williams, of the Bushmen's Contingent, went to the Railway Department in search of work, and was willing to accept any employment in order to earn a living. was received by one official, who demanded of him, "" What the deuce right bearhave you to get work any more than any the of the other unemployed in the town?"" Then, later, getting a letter from Sir Sir George Turner to Sir Alexander Peacock, . he applied at the Metropolitan Board, and medically examined at Spencerstreet. According to his statement in the oth November, 1915. ArgusThere, to ^ i y amusement, I was told that I the - was disqualified through deafness. That was and the first time. I had ever heard of that. The to medical examination when I enlisted was pardid ticularly strict, and none of the doctors in Africa ever discovered that I was deaf. GoI went to &ee Sir John Madden, after receiving a very kind letter from him, which he has given me permission to make public. He was astonished when I told him I had been rejected on the ground of deafness, and said to me, "" Well, I cannot understand it ; you bear as well as I do."" His letter to me was ns follows :. Dear Mr Williams, I have read your exceedingly interesting and just complaint in the Argus of yesterday. Your recital of my statement to your corps when leaving for South Africa is quite accurate, and it embodied, I am sure, what was then, and, I believe, is now, the genuine feeling of the people of Victoria, as I know it did the feeling of the Government. The service of your corps cannot ever be overestimated, either by Australia or by the Empire. The men of that corps specially answered, with magnificant alacrity, to an anxious call made by the Government of Victoria itself, at a time when most of the glitter was out of the war, and when labour and danger were unmistakably ahead, and Victoria is not the country to forget it. I am sure that the present Government will readily see to it, and I'have written to the honourable the Premier to assure bim that your statements are correct. Believe ine, dear sir, Very truly yours, Most of them have gone back to South Africa in despair, incensed at the Victorian Government for the shameful repudiation of their undertaking. The warnings of the past should niake*us careful of the present and the future. That great man, Sir Johu Madden, is now silent, but as he passes through the shadows. I express towards him the homely good wish, "" May God rest him . "" He fought all the time, and I think every honourable member of this House will fight, for justice for the returned soldier. We are told thab only seven men are employed at the weaving factory; there could be seventy men f u l ly occupied. There is au unlimited demand for the cloth that is being produced. The cost of it is only 6s. 4d. per yard. If it were sold at 10s. wholesale to all tailors, and at 12s. to any one who would like to. buy a length to have it made up by a tailor, there would be a good profit. But the Government will not help these men. I have finished what I rose to say. hope that the repatriation scheme will be carried out so well that the experience gained will be useful in dealing with the unemployed problems in the different States, and in evolving a system which will provide au opportunity to any man or woman who desires to make a living cn the laud. Through the educating, in[200]- 2 fluence of the moving pictures, people know how woman's activities in connection with the land have been extended in the Old Country. We are able to see them working in the fields, and the monthly St. Kilda, periodicals give statistics as to the many 14th July, 1901. and varied callings in which women are now finding employment. One means of insuring a success of the settlement of soldiers on the land will be to make the farms homely, and country life more attractive. Nowadays amusements can be taken to the country to a far greater extent than was possible in the past. There is no little collection of people in a village but cau have its picture show. Mechanics' institutes can be enlarged, circulating libraries can be established, and various obher recreations and amusements can be provided to make country life more agreeable than ' it has been. Country wages will require attention, and the conditions of life generally must be improved. Let the farmer have a fair deal by the fixation of the price of his wheat at the station, and the introduction (Signed) JOHN MADBEN. of the zone system of carriage, and we may then firmly hope that those who go upon the land will prosper. The more the land produces in grain, f r u it , and live stock, the more the railways will pav, and if the Commonwealth and the States will cooperate in this land settlement movement, it should be impossible for it to fail . There may be a few individual failures at the first. If so, let the Government profit by every warning, and of advice that is given, no matter from which side of the House. Let them regard it as prompted, not by antagonism to them as a Government, but by a desire to mend where a fault is disclosed. Let the Government also assure the weaving factory the plentif u l supply 9f wool to which it is entitled, and within two months there will I M seventy men working there, and the example will be followed in all the other States. Any man who has fair eye-sight and a supple wrist can learn to weave. But do not deduct these men's pensions; let them receive the full 2s. per yard, and I I shall be proud to take the glad tidings bo them.",52
224,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Wakefield) [8.40] - The Repatriation Act and this amending Bill are the mere skeletons of the repatriation scheme, and necessarily so. We are giving enormous power to the Minister who has to administer this legislation; that is unavoidable. The Minister is covering untrodden ground. He has to originate nearly everything connected with the repatriation of returned soldiers, and his difficulties are such that he certainly ought to have the - utmost sympathy of every member of the Legislature. I know that the enormous responsibility which we are putting in his hands is essential under existing conditions; he has unlimited power, even beyond the Executive of which he is a member, and Parliament has very little power so far as the extension of the Department is concerned. We have merely to provide for the rudiments of what is to grow into the biggest concern ever controlled by any one in Australia. This trust in the M in ister must continue for a considerable period. It is impossible to estimate all that will be required until we know the proportions that this scheme will u l t imately assume. I know very well that, .from day to day, the Minister is confronted with some new question that arises, and to deal with which no provision has been made. The burden thrown upon the Minister is one that very few men would envy, but it has to be borne for a considerable time, u n t i l he, the Government and Parliament realise something of the proportions of this scheme, and the consequent financial liability of the country. Almost daily, the Minister finds it necessary to issue regulations for the conduct of his Department. siderable number have already been issued, and they are likely to increase enormously. The Minister should look .the matter squarely in the face, and when a fair idea of the proportions of the scheme has been formed by him, he Bhould not overlook the necessity of seeking to make such regulations as he has found necessary from day to day a part of the Statute itself.",54
225,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR PRECAUTIONS,It would then be necessary to pass a B i ll to vary them.,55
226,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Of course. 'The effect of that would be to make Parliament responsible.,55
227,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The regulations are all complementary to the Act.,55
228,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I know that they are; but they give unlimited power to a Minister to deal with an expenditure which may amount to .£40,000,000.",55
229,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Hear , hear ! I am glad that the honourable member sees it .",55
230,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I have seen it for some time. We cannot quote a similar case in the history of Australia.,55
231,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR PRECAUTIONS,O r in the history of the world.,55
232,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The point I wish to stress is that, no matter how the power created under this Bill may be extended from day to day, or no matter how the regulations may be enlarged, it is not the work of this Parliament, nor a work for which we have any responsibility, because Parliament has not legislated upon the matter. Therefore, it is the duty of Parliament, as. soon - as we realise the extent of our responsibilities, and consequent liabilities in connection with this scheme, to incorporate in a consolidating Bill whatever power the M i nister may find it necessary to provide for himself by way of regulations. Whatever can be done by regulation should be provided for within the four corners of an Act of Parliament. It is all very well for honourable members to take up the attitude that the method at present adopted must continue for a time, but I remind them that nothing succeeds lake success. If any one can make a success of this scheme, the present Minister (Senator Millen) is likely to do so; and if he does, his name will be immortalized. If ever a Minister controlling a Department deserved the utmost help and sympathy that can be 'given to him fey A con- Parliament, it is the Minister for Repatriation. I have no desire to lecture any one. I like to do the right thing myself, and expect others to do the same; but I cannot help expressing my feelings without a desire to tread heavily on the corns of any person. There is prevalent an unfair spirit, probably unintentional, in regard to the treatment of soldiers, not only during their period of service, but also upon bheir return. The best that we can do for the man who has come back with a clean record is not good enough for him ; but there is a disposition, particularly outside the House- I will put it that way - to look for trouble, to Canvass it , to go here and there and say, "" Look here, you have been treated unfairly , don't you think you should be treated a b it better;"" or even to put the position in a more discreditable light. The responsibilities upon the Minister are so great, and the difficulties of his task are so varied, and almost innumerable that the least we ought to do is, first, to give him the opportunity to put things straight if they are wrong, and then to give him all the help and sympathy we can. I have often felt that I would like to say this, and that it was necessary for some one to say : that the person who would use a returned soldier for political purposes is meaner than the devil himself. The honourable member for Maribrynong (Mr Fenton) this afternoon, before he concluded his remarks, spoke of the non. fulfilment of pledges given by employers to returned soldiers. I am quite sure that what he said was spoken in a good spirit, but I fear that occasionally complaints, which possibly are intended to be specific, are regarded outside this House as being of a general character. Far from bhis being the case, some of the finest examples of patriotism are to be found among the big companies in Australia.. They have not only made up the difference between the soldiers' pay and the very much higher pay which tlieir employees who have enlisted were drawing, but they have also given evidence of the fact that they have not forgotten the men who have left their service to enlist. They have restored them to their old positions, in mauy cases despite the fact that their health has been so much impaired that they cannot do one-half the work which they could do before they went away to the war. When it is said that employers have broken their pledges, we ought to be told whether those are solitary cases or not. We should not let the impression become general that all employers have been doing this. It is quite possible that some of them have been doing it , but the day will come when it will be known who have done it , and they will receive their reward as long as they live. It will be a wellmerited reward. If there are some delinquents among the employers in this regard there are also some delinquents among Governments in Australia.",55
233,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Hear , hear; I said it !",56
234,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"It is no credit to a Government or to a private firm. A great deal has been said as to the manner in which returned men are to be re-established in civil life, and the most popular idea of doing so is to put them on the land; but that is the most dangerous idea of all, and certainly it is one in which it will be a most difficult matter to form anything like a reliable estimate of cost. First of all, we have to remember that in most cases the trench life of those men who have done their b it heroically, and come back to us after twoor three years' service, has been such as to unfit even the best of them to return to the occupations which they left, but to which I hope many of them will return. The honourable member for _ Flinders (Mr Bruce) will admit that l if e in the trenches has worked such a change in the men that it will take them some time before they can get into collar again in their old occupations, and be as effective employees as they were before they went to the war. The life they have led will also produce in some men a complete distaste for the occupations which they filled prior to going.to the war.",56

It is estimated, he said, that some 40,000 soldiers have intimated such a desire, through the Repatriation Department, and I can quite believe it , because there are enticing opportunities when we hear that for this purpose some of the best land in Australia has been purchased.

We shall not find a large percentage of these returned soldiers successful in culture or wheat growing, in the ordias nary sense of the words.

A much better prospect is presented dairying; and in this branch of country life the men could be kept together under supervision, with butter factories at hand.

287,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Brisbane) [9.25] - There are two very satisfactory features in connection with this measure which heartily commend it to the House. The first is that it is a non-party measure. If there is one question upon which honourable members of this House, whatever their varying political opinions may be, are entirely united, it is to secure a satisfactory and efficient system of repatriation for our soldiers. There will be no> quarrel with the Government in this connection, unless it be that the measures they propose will not go far enough. So> far as the principle of repatriation is concerned, honourable members are agreed. Another satisfactory feature is the splendid rjrogress that has been made by the Government during the eight months' in terval between the time when assent wasgiven to the existing Ac t and the introduction of this amending Bill . The first - Murmeasure was a very timid, very modest, and very unsatisfactory effort to copewith a big question. Evidently the Government discovered very soon, in has their attempt to administer the Act , necessary it was to have in I creased powers, and to largely extend the I scope of this legislation. A step in advance is made in this Bill , and I echo the statement of the Minister when I express the hope that it is but the precursor other Bills to deal with this subject, find because we have yet a long way to, go we shall have accepted full y o u r I believe responsibilities to our soldiers. I should like to .point out, from thea stand-point of the usual statement made in public, that our soldiers are really in Europe defending Australia, and that wehere exist in peace and comfort, enjoying practically all our customary blessings, because of the sacrifices these men havemade, and are making, that if that be recognised as full y as it ought to be, then. Australia belongs to the soldiers. They have bought it and paid for it , many of them with their lives. Many have paid for it with sacrifices, which few of us in this country can realise, and which, perhaps, only the soldiers themselves can. form any adequate conception of. Australia belongs to them, and they can rightly claim that the whole of the resources of this country should be availablefor their support and protection. One thing that is extremely satisfactory to me is that the repatriation scheme is not to be administered by the Defence Department. The experience of this House and the country of the administration of matters affecting our soldiers, either in the enlistment period, in con- nexion with their subsequent oversea service, or their return to*civil life, has been such as not to inspire confidence that thatDepartment would ever satisfactorily handle a repatriation scheme. Its business methods have been proved an absolute failure. In connection with the administration of business affairs, the Defence Department has lost the confidence of the country. It is, therefore, a satisfactory feature that repatriation is to be the distinctive and exclusive concern of one Department. In the Bill now before us, there is an attempt to further develop and extend the organization under the control of the Minister for Repatriation. In connection with the constitution of the various councils, boards, and commissions to be associated with the Minister in future, I have few objections to offer; but there is an omission which might have been supplied. Recently, a number of honourable members have taken exception to the constitution of so many boards and commissions, carrying on quite a number of new Departments created in the Commonwealth, and a request has been made, and, indeed, almost a demand, that honourable members of this House should be associated officially with some of these boards and commissions. The' honourable member for Wannon (Mr - Rodgers) very correctly pointed out that private members of this House have recently been reduced practically to the position of cyphers. They have a say, no doubt, and a vote when wanted and as wanted; but, so far as any influence on legislation, or any direct say in the government of the country is concerned, they have become mere nonentities. I am sorry the Minister in charge of the Bill is not present, because I desire to put before him the suggestion that, in the case of local executives; five members of which are elected by the local committees and two nominated by the Government, the honourable member representing the Federal interests in each district, should be ex officio a member of the iocal committee or executive,",59
288,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The difficulty in connection with that matter is there may be thirty local committees in one electorate.,60
289,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS,We have enough correspondence to attend to in connection with repatriation without that. I am sure that I have plenty of work.,60
290,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I am cognisant of the value and force of both objections. Let me take first that mentioned by the honourable member for Wannon. He says that a Federal member might have t h i r t y local committees in his district, and his objection would have force if the honourable member was to be on every local committee. That could be avoided by making him instead a member of the local executive. There is also provision for district boards.",60
291,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,A.distric t board is in dustrial only.,60
292,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I am aware of that. In regard to the objection mentioned by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), I question whether many honourable members are more aware than I am of the amount of correspondence work which we have to do. I know I get my fair share of it . But this is a question in which we are all keenly in terested. I think we are all anxious to have some direct and active share in the operation of the repatriation scheme. There are many less important duties which we might discard in order to take our proper part in the work of repatriation. It is one of the biggest things Parliament has been called upon to deal with for years.",60
293,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,It is the biggest.,60
294,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I suppose that its cost will run into uot less than,60
295,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Thirt y million pounds or £40,000,000.",60
296,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I was going to fix a minimum of £60,000,000. I feel sure that before we finish it will cost us at least that amount.",60
297,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Can the land be obtained and everything else done for that?,60
298,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"- In some cases it will not be necessary to buy land. That may be necessary in conservative States like Victoria and South Australia, but not"" in other States. 1",60
299,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The honourable member forgets that a large number of returned soldiers will not lean on the Commonwealth for any support.,60
300,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I have a note of that suggestion, and will refer to it later on. To deal further with the interjection of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Tudor), let me say that altogether too much stress is being laid on the question of land settlement for returned soldiers. Some honourable members seem to suggest that land settlement is going to be the main factor in the repatriation soldiers. Personally, I am inclined to think that those honourable members will meet with a severe disappointment. say that regretfully, because I think that perhaps the best thing that could happen to most of the men would be that they should be settled in country districts, and have the experience of a country The greater the number of our returned soldiers that we can induce to go on the land the better it will be for them as well as for the country. But the proportion of them who will be finally and permanently settled on the land will, in my opinion, be very small indeed. must recognise that the majority of our soldiers abroad have gone from our industrial walks of life and that upon their return they will naturally direct first attention to the trades which they have at their fingers' ends-to they know something about. just as capable as are other people of appreciating the fact that the mere going upon the land will not necessarily mean success for them. They know that to settle upon the land one must possess sonw adaptability, and that there must be a reasonable prospect of obtaining successful results. But I would like to stress the desire, which should be recognised by the Government, that the members of this Parliament, as such, do want to be associated in some active way with this repatriation scheme. To be simply the bearers of complaints from soldiers to the Minister for Repatriation and the Repatriation Department will be very little satisfaction to us. On ths other hand, if we are in direct touch with the scheme, we shall all be able to assist both the Minister and the soldiers, and the work of the Department will proceed much more smoothly, if , by reason of possessing a first-hand knowledge of its working, we are able to take such a sympathetic interest in the scheme as will enable the soldiers and the Department to work harmoniously with each other. know of no method by which members can get into touch with the Department other than through the local committees. There are, it is true, State industrial committees, and district rial committees. But I think that local committees offer the wider opportunities for service, and probably will hetter results. Mr Finlauson. fREPRESENTATIVES.J Eepatriation Bill (No. 2).  able member suggests would pave the way for great trouble. I Mr FINLAYSON - I do not know why that should be so. I am very willing to take any active part that I can. ih this repatriation scheme, and I am certain that I am not the only one who is prelife. pared to help the Government. The fact that we were helpers in the scheme would obviate a great deal of hostile criticism  necessity, become political. We Mr FINLAYSON - I do not agree with the honourable member for a moment. I deplore the suggestion of the introduction of politics into a repatriation scheme, their As the honourable member for Wakefield  the things tion of politics into defence matters is They are to lie greatly deplored. The very fact that we were ex officio as members taking an active part in the Government scheme would be an indication that we were prepared to drop our party politics.",60
301,Mr WEBSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Does not the honourable member think it would be a good thing if we had the same amount of unity in regard to recruiting?,61
302,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"If we have not the same amount of unity in regard to recruiting the faul t rests with the Government - If they will put a scheme before the House to stimulate recruiting, and returned will meet the difficulties that confront us in the same way as they have attempted to meet the difficulties in regard to repatriation, they will get similar results. They will get what they sow. But they are expecting to gather grapes from thorns and figs from thistles.",61
303,Mr WEBSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,That is true. We expected to gather grapes from thorns.,61
304,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Then the Government should not sow the thorns. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers)' has _ devoted an immense I amount of time to this question, honourable and has displayed a remarkable knowledge, in principle, of the whole scheme of organization. Prom the very beginning he has taken a keen, active in indus- terest in the subject of repatriation, and, he is unquestionably an authority upon ' it. But there, is no place for him in the produce Government scheme, on the Central Commission, on the State Boards or on the local committees. Yet the House, the country, and the returned soldiers are entitled to the services of at least one member of this Parliament who has some ideas - origina l and practical-of the working out of the scheme. Then there is the honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Bruce). He must possess a fund of in formation in this connection which would be of immense value to the country and to the soldiers. But there is no place for him in the Government's scheme. There is also the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), a returned soldier, ancl others who will be returning. There is no place in this scheme for them. Under it, the only duty of members of this Parliament will be to carry complaints from the soldiers to the Minister, and to act as a sort of "" g o between."" Surely there is something better for us to do than that. A good deal has been said in regard to which State is doing the best for our returned soldiers. Probably we all think that our own State is doing the best. But it seems to me that, in connection with a scheme of this character, we ought to try and get away from the idea of State boundaries. This is a Commonwealth scheme; and while'it is necessary for the Government to enter into some sort of business arrangement with the State Governments-particularl y in regard to land, technical education, and industrial operations-w e .need to realise that the scheme is not for one State, but for every Australian soldier, no matter from what State or from what part of the Empire he may come.",61
305,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I would remind the honourable member that Sir Rider Haggard visited Australia for the express purpose of getting the same privileges extended to Imperial soldiers as are extended to our own soldiers, and that his proposal was agreed to.",62
306,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"That is so. Queensland the Discharged Settlement Act of 1917 provides that A "" discharged soldier"" includes any person who has been n member of the Australian Imperial Forces or of any of the Naval or Military Forces of the Commonwealth raised for service in the present war, or has joined the Forces of the United Kingdom during the war and who has received an honourable discharge. The term may be extended so as to include members of His Majesty's Forces during the present war from any part of the British Umpire or members of the Forces of the Powers in alliance with His Majesty in the present war who have received their discharge before their arrival in Queensland. The term also includes the dependants of any such soldier in the event of his death before he, received his discharge, or at any time within' a period of twelve months after he has received an honourable discharge.",62
307,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"A similar provision, is contained in the Victorian and Tasmanian Acts.",62
308,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Not quite. I think that the Queensland Act is about the widest in its interpretation of any State Act. But if it be wider than the other State Acts, it is, nevertheless, not too wide. It should be as wide as possible, because if we can induce a number of soldiers from distant parts of the Empire to come and settle here, we shall be doing, not only a good thing for them, but a good thing for Australia.",62
309,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Whil e that is so in regard to the State land settlement schemes, tliere is no provision in our Commonwealth scheme for Imperial soldiers.",62
310,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"That is the unfortunate part of it . I intend, particularly, to apply 'that deficiency in the Commonwealth scheme to the Northern Territory. I can quite understand that to settle the Territory is a difficult problem under any circumstances. Probably that difficulty will be increased when it is suggested that we should put men there who have not had a previous acquaintance with Australian conditions; but I have a profound conviction, based on actual acquaintance with men who have been in the Northern Territory, that there are areas of country there which are admirably suited for settlement. May I suggest just one line of production alone? I was reading very carefully last night the private and confidential memorandum which has been addressed to honourable members in regard to the estabIn lishment of an arsenal. Now, one of the Soldiers essential commodities in connection with the manufacture of munitions is cotton. At present, we are importing by far the great bulk of the cotton that is used in Australia. Ye t we have it on undeniable authority that Australia can grow cotton, equal to the best in the world, and that we can grow it easier, because here it is perennial. At the present time, cotton is being grown in Queensland which, for staple and quality, is equal to the best Egyptian.",62

319,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I know that Queensland is trying to do so by the settlementsThere are great possibilities in that. One other reference I - desire to makefrom among the topics that could be drawn from this almost inexhaustible subject. That is with regard to vocational' training. What impresses me is that numbers of the returned soldiers will be so mentally and physically, that it will be difficult to associate them permanently and continuously with any k in d We have all met with or heard of incidents' of returned men, and we must have heen distressed and puzzled in regard to what could be done I to help them to settle down. stance, there was a letter in the bourne press the other day suggesting that when committees are organizing tertainments for soldiers they should avoid anything in the nature of exploa sions or gunfire. We have seen or heard of returned soldiers walking quietly the streets, and upon the occurrence of any loud or sudden noise, they have i stantly ducked their heads, or dropped, or run away. It will take years for to get over the experiences through which they have passed. It is well known that it is not merely at the time that they feel the effects of their experiences. For years they may be haunted. Incidents may recur to them like nightmares. Those men are not to be easily settled down into the ordinary routine life. There will be days when they may be perfectly capable of carrying work, while on other occasions they may he shifty, tremulous, feeble, petent. ' This Bill , more than any other operation in governmental affairs, will require a wonderful amount of sympabut thetic administration. It must he from red-tape, so that if a man wants to sit down, or feels that he must home, he should be at liberty to do and it should not be necessary for him time. to fill in a form or require to get a doctor's certificate. The returned men want to be so sympathetically treated that, 'in carrying on industrial operations, bard and fast rules should not be i m posed on them. I notice with some satisfaction arrangements are to be made with the which happened in Victoria. various hospitals to provide returned men with treatment if they are sick. That is very good, but it does not seem to enough unless it is to cover the services of medical men and the concession of medical consultations at any time and times. It should not be necessary them to have to go into hospital to receive either nursing or medical attention. I deed, one wonders if the establishment national workshops could not be based somehow upon a recognition of the prinfighting ciple that the men should be free to come and go, not just as they wished, but sonably, according to their physical cities. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, said something to the effect that, For in - after having found a job for a man, the Melexperience had often been that he would work for a day or two, and leave; then enanother job would be found, and the process would be repeated. Thereupon, after time, the authorities might well say that they could do no more, and that the along returned soldier would not keep a job after it had been given him. I trust that n - that view-point will not be insisted upon. How often shall we forgive him ? Seven them times? Nay, but seventy times seven. That should dwell with us in the treatment of returned soldiers; and, if at times they are listless, and incapable, and indifferent, then if there are men anywhere to whom we should show sympathy, friendship, and reasonable regard, they are our returned soldiers.",63

322,Mr WEBSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,But would you have and incomno restrictions whatever ?,64
323,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Yes , one. Honourable members may-think I am a faddist, there is one restriction, and it would free get over a tremendous amount of difficulty if it could be enforced. That is, to make go sure that there is no alcohol available so, for returned soldiers anywhere, at any",64
324,Mr WEBSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Ari d outside that, you will would allow them to do as they liked ?",64
325,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"That is going too far. But we should be prepared to con- cede to returned soldiers a great deal that we would not permit to an ordinary that individual. I will cite an extreme case At the time, it h u r t me, and it hurts still, whenever I think of it . A returned soldier committed a crime. He murdered a go far woman. There was no doubt about the fact that he deliberately did so. JEle was tried, found guilty, and hanged. It was all a crime to hang that man, apart altofor gether from the fact that canital punishment in itself is wrong. But the fact was n - that this country had so little respect and of consideration for that man, and for the hell through which he had passed in for us, that there was no sympathetic consideration, and nothing said in reamitigation of his offence. There is not a capareturned soldier who commits a crime for which one could not find a dozen excuses that could not be applied to the ordinary individual. A returned soldier does things which we could not condone, which we should excuse to a great extent ; and this Bill should be so reasonable in its operations, especially in regard to vocational training,' that we should be assured that returned soldiers shall receive sympathetic treatment, and not be bound by anything in the way of hard-and-fast rules. It is suggested that national workshops should be established near the cities, so to permit of companionship among turned soldiers. That is very good; but a number of those men might prefer to live in the country rather than near the city. Why tie them down to vicinity of city life any more than take them all out into the country? Surely there will be enough operations going on to encourage the Government to the option of country or city vocations. There is the Federal Territory at Canhis berra, for instance, with a most delightlation ful climate. I know of nothing better that the Government could do for restances burned soldiers primarily, and for the country generally, than to establish bers of them upon the Federal area. There are opportunities for employment on the land-right away, and for the estabGovernment lishment of one or two national workI shops. The organization of the Arsenal could be hurried on, and there are a dred other activities which might be esvernment tablished there, to provide country vocaand tions. Then, if the men so employed sired a change to the vicinity of city life, they might be giveu their transfer, while those near the city, if they desired a term in the country workshops, might also changed over. My whole idea is to make it as easy to do right and as hard to wrong as can be assured by means governmental machinery. It is very diffitotally incapacitated. cult, of course, to know how to get a bit of human nature and common sense into a Government Department. However, we must try . At a later opportunity I hope to some reference to the rates of pension and to the amounts proposed to be given the men, but I shall leave that for ""discussion in Committee.",64

334,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"The Minister, in second-reading speech, said that regu57 contained provision for assistance to widows in necessitous circumand totally incapacitated soldiers to the extent of a grant of £ 2 5 for the numpurchase of furniture, and that if any further assistance were required it would be given by way of loan.

344,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"It is not a land settlement scheme. Land settlement is a matter of agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, to whom we shall lend money for that purpose.",67

346,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,-Presumin g that the other be reciprocity. Dominions reciprocated. But I am a f r a i d we would find it dimcult to finance a scheme on the scale proposed in Australia.,67

In a report on the subject, published in British Columbia in November, 1915, the following E mrecommendation, which has since been carried into effect, was made: We have recommended that the advantages these co-operative farm settlements be available to "" all returned soldiers."" These settlements are largely subsidized has by the Federal Government of Canada, which is in a position similar to that of our Commonwealth GovernmentWe have made no discrimination, and think should be open to any man who, haa the Empire, either under our own 'flag, of the Motherland, or any of the otlier Dominions. . . . It will be seen, that the problem of providing for these is not in any sense a local matter. It is in which not only all the Provinces of Dominion are equally interested, but which of vital interest to the Empire at large, and we feel that the responsibility and cost of making provision to meet the problem is one which should be shared by all those inI cannot understand why some provision not made for assisting Britis h and other soldiers of British blood to settle on the lands of Australia, and I ask the serious attention of the Cabinet to the suggestion that they be so assisted. Our repatriation legislation places us in a most invidious position with regard to other parts of His Dominions in making no proThat is vision whatever for the settlement of British soldiers, on our land.",67
359,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Havin g admitted that it is right to provide for the settlement British soldiers on our land, should we not make provision for them in other branches of repatriation, they having foregone repatriation in their own land ? and come to Australia to settle?",67
360,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"There is a great deal of force in that, but my object was to draw attention specially to the need of providing for the settlement of British soldiers on our land. Every effort possible should be made to bring that about. In repatriation there are three points of view. We have to consider, first, the interests of our soldiers themselves. agree that the utmost generosity should be shown to those who have fought, or offered to fight, for their country. . We must also do the best we can for the children of our soldiers, and, lastly, we must do the best we can for Australia and its future. These three considerations are a trinity , one and inseparable. We have an opportunity now to reciprocate with other parts of the Empire, and of doing what is of vital importance to this country. In the documents that I have here it is mentioned that Australian soldiers will be as welcome as those of the country itself or of any other part of the Empire. We have an opportunity now to provide for attracting to our shores after the war a' considerable number of men of the best stamp the British Empire had-thos e who have fought for their country.",68
361,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Grea t Britai n will not be able to spare many men after the war.,68
362,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I differ from the honourable member. A f t er the war an immense number of those who have gone from the United Kingdom will want to settle elsewhere.,68
363,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Many of them have made pals of Australians.,68
364,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Yes , and are anxious to come here. So far back as two years ago there were friends of Canada in the trenches circulating inducements to Australian and Imperial soldiers to settle in Canada after the war. Every Province of Canada is eager to secure our men as settlers, and it will te the same with the United States and the Argentine. Every effort will be made by these countries to attract English, Scotch, Irish, and Welsh soldiers who have any disposition to leave the Old Country. Australia will be the one country which will not be able to offer inducements to them, because by our Repatriation Act and this amending Bill we deliberately exclude the Imperial soldier from the benefits of our scheme. [201]",68
365,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Negotiation s for reciprocal arrangements could be opened up while the Prime Minister is abroad.,68
366,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"In this matter the Prime Minister is pledged to the h i l t . Had he not been so busy ever since the beginning of 1917, it is more than possible that our legislation would have contained All provisions of the nature I suggest, and it is not too late to insert them. I take the strongest exception to the Act and to the Bill as they stand. The whole tendency of our repatriation so fa r will be in the direction of attracting persons from the country to the big cities . We do not want the returned soldier to waste his life as a single man. We want every soldier who returns to our shores, if possible, to reproduce his kind. Care should have been taken in this Bill to prevent a returned soldier from being attracted by city l if e ; and, secondly, to place every soldier's home on a solid foundation. I should like every returned soldier to have a home of his own, and we should so legislate that it could never be taken from him either by way of foreclosure on mortgage or by ordinary sale.",68
367,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"In other words, the honourable member says that if a soldier is given the freehold of any property, he should not have the right to dispose of it .",68
368,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Yes ; if we give a soldier a piece of land, or a home, we should make it a birth right which he cannot sell for a n:ess. of pottage. The curse of land settlement in this country has been the failure of the State Parliaments to make such' a provision. Under our land settlement schemes, men are tempted to select a holding, but are given power to realise upon it , so that, in a few years, and while they still have children dependent upou them, they often find themselves deprived of their homes and of the means of creating others. A vital defect in all our land settlement schemes has been the failure of the Government to give a man a holding which he cannot part with. And so with our repatriation scheme. I do not believe in endeavouring to settle soldiers or any other section of the community, on the land, or to provide them with a house, under a scheme which enables them within , say, five years to sell their property to the highest bidder. In some of the finest provinces of Australia, land that was selected in 320acre blocks t h i r ty or forty years ago",68
369,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Is now held by squatters.,69
370,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Quite so; and the fault rests with the State Governments, who allowed the selectors to sell their birth right.",69
371,Mr RODGERS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,Adversit y was the compelling force.,69
372,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Not in every case. I have lived among these people for fort y years and know that what I am saying is correct. An honourable member says, "" Y o u have bought many of them out. "" I have never bought out one, but I have seen the buying-out process going on. A man selects 320 acres, and after a time Bells his holding with a view to selecting another.",69
373,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The honourable member believes in the homestead lease prin- ciple.,69
374,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Absolutely . We shall never succeed in settling returned soldiers on the land unless, as the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) suggests, we adopt the homestead lease principle. The land we offer every returned soldier must be his birth right, and he must not be given power to dispose of it for a mess of pottage. 1 do not say that if , for health considerations, a returned soldier finds it impossible to remain on a block which he has been assisted to purchase, he should not be allowed to part with it , but except in such special circumstances, the power to sell should be denied him.",69

Both the original Act and this amending Bill need to be absolutely reconsidered; they require to be amended root and branch. I am not at all satisfied with this Bill , for I consider it has many defects. I propose to read to the House a letter written by a legislator of great experience, Mr J . Drysdale Brown, M . L . C . , which points out a vital defect in the principal Act , which is not remedied by this Bill . The letter, which is dated 22nd May, readsDear Mr Jowett,- I called at your office this morning to introduce ex-Private Rea, of Stawell, a returned maimed soldier. He has lost his left arm. Mr Bea is married, and the father of four children. This is a typical caseHe has always resided in Stawell, and is desirous to continue to reside in Stawell. He wishes to purchase a dwelling-house with the assistance of the Credit Foncicr Department of the State Savings Bank. Prior to the proclamation of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act 1917, a returned soldier could, under the regulations made by the trustees appointed under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Fund Act 1916, obtain from the State War Council an advance up to £75 to pay a deposit on the purchase of a house, the State Savings Bank Commissioners providing the balance of purchase money up to £300, the whole amount being repaid by agreed quarterly instalments. That is under the State ActThere is no provision under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Actshould not That is the Commonwealth Act nor in the regulations made under that Act, to enable assistance to be given to a returned soldier to purchase a house. Mr Rea wished to ask you to use your influence to have a suitable section inserted in the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Bill NQ. 3, now before the House of Representatives. What'is the use of a Bill which does not the land, include such a provision ? I Mr GROOM - The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) distinctly in the Senate that a housing scheme was not included in the regulato go tions, but was under consideration by the am glad to have that assurance, and hope that this and will be made to the schen-.e. There is too great a to induce people to forsake There a' e some T versus c it y , especially in connection with repatriation, that ought to be very carefully - considered by this House. all our brave men who have fought or tried to fight for their country should have every possible opportunity of re.establishing themselves in civil life. Every returned soldier and every other citizen who makes up his mind to live in one of the great cities will be at a very great disadvantage, especially if he has a large family. There is ample evidence that when people wish to secure cottages or small villas in the city or suburbs, the agent's first question sometimes is, "" Have you any f a m i ly ?"" If they reply that they have, the agent regards the children very - dubiously, and a person with a large f a m i ly sometimes has the utmost difficulty in getting a house.",69

378,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"And unfurnished houses, too. I am assured, by people with tution. families that it is sometimes a matter the greatest difficulty to get houses i city or suburbs, and in consequence many people are compelled to live in flats boarding houses. Their experience seeking that sort of accommodation much, the same; children are sometimes not welcome in boarding house or cottage.",70
379,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS,They are not welcome on the stations.,70
380,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,I know of no station where people are unwelcome if they have families. Families are a thousand times more welcome on the stations than they place are in some houses in the cities.,70
381,Mr TUDOR,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I think the honourable member is doing the landlords an injusno tice. In working-class suburbs like Richmond, Collingwood, Footscray, and Brunswick most people have large famipolitan lies, and landlords must accept them tenants.",70
382,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I do not apply my report marks to all landlords, but what I have said is true of some of them. And their attitude is not unnatural. A house is the property of the landlord, and much as we love children, we must recognise that dence they sometimes do damage property. One of the effects of this most unfortuturned nate state of affairs is a tendency, which is much more noticeable in the cities in the country, for people of all classes l i m it the size of their families. [201]- 2 Another danger that is likely to attend the policy of attracting people from the I desire that country to the towns is in connection with vocational training. I hope that a very large sum of money will be found to be necessary for the establishment of technical schools, schools of mines, and other vocational training establishments. But .' I feel certain that if the present trend of concentrating all vocational schools in the great centres, and, to some extent, ignoring country towns which are in every way suitable, is persisted in , these city establishments will have an enormous effect in attracting people from the country to the cities. Of course the question may be asked, "" If a vocational school is established in a country town, and twenty or thirty men are taught a trade, can work be found for Obviously there are trades and professions in which we cannot hope to find employment locally for every person taught in such an instiThe Universities, for instance, of are attended by large numbers of students n the who are taught professions. Suppose the controlling body of the Melbourne U n i or versity were to say: ""Before we estabi n lish a class for chemistry, engineering, is medicine, or law, we must be satisfied that every student who completes his course will be able to get a living in Melbourne or the suburbs."" What would become of any university or school that adopted such a policy ? I wish to utter a word of warning in this regard. I will not go so far as to say that I would the whole of the vocational schools in the country towns and none in the great cities; but I do say that there should be increase in the number of such establishments in the cities. Already there are splendid technical schools in the metroareas, and in many of the other as big centres. I would not increase the number of them in any of the great seacities; but all new institutions of the kind should be established, as far as possible, in country towns. In this regard the cost of living must be taken into consideration. To-day I had striking eviof the evil that will be perpetrated upon the community and upon the resoldiers if we persist in a.policy of attracting them to the cities. I introduced than to the Minister for Repatriation at o deputation of citizens of Maryborough. Of course, there are climatic and other advantages in living in country towns, and there are evils and temptations attendant upon life in the great cities. This is a most vital question in connection with repatriation. I do not wish to 'even hint at the dangers that will attend returned soldiers if , when they return in large numbers, they are concentrated in the big centres of population.",70

The speakers on the ""deputation informed the Minister that in Maryborough a cottage suitable for a returned soldier or working man can be rented at 10s. per week, as against nearly 30s. in Melbourne or the suburbs. price of bread in that town is 3d. per 2-lb. loaf, and 6d. per 4-lb. loaf.",71
385,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS,What is the price of meat there?,71
386,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"I have not ascertained that, but I shall be happy to do so, and inform the honourable member. Maryborough firewood delivered at the home costs 8s. per ton, as against 30s. per ton in Melbourne. I wish to impress upon the Ministry the absolute necessity for reconsidering their whole scheme and the whole of their ideas in connection with the repatriation of Australian soldiers, in order lo attract the soldiers to the country districts and not to concentrate them in the big cities.",71
387,Mr NICHOLLS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"Macquarie) [10.46]. - I agree with the honourable member in regard to the matter of housing returned soldiers. He has put the case particularly plainly in that connection, but his proposal to allow the whole of the members of the Imperial Forces to come into Australia unconditionally, and enjoy the same privileges as will be given to the Australian soldier, seems to be open to objection unless there be reciprocity between the Commonwealth Government and the Imperial Government. Upwards of 600,000 I m perial men might come into Australia, and. as no provision could previously be made for them, the result might be that the Australian soldiers would be deprived of certain privileges that they would otherwise enjoy. No complaint could be offered if a system of reciprocity should be established in the matter between the Commonwealth and Imperial Governments. I do not think the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) would intend that his proposal should have for its object the flooding of the Australian labour market, with a view to a possible reduction of wages, but that might be the view taken by some unscrupulous employers who employ large numbers of men. has had The housing question is the most i m portant feature of the Bill , and it should receive more consideration than the Minister has apparently given it . There are scores and scores of soldiers who are practically homeless. There is one man in my electorate who is suffering from shell shock. His nerves are gone, and he is in an altogether pitiable condition. He is attempting to rear a family in a cottage of two rooms and a kitchen. His health The still continues to deteriorate, and he may get no relief u n t i l he is able to move to some otber locality, and that probably he will have to do at his own expense.  tions would allow that man a certain At amount for sustenance. He would get 59s. a week. .",71
388,Mr NICHOLLS,WAR PRECAUTIONS,"An allowance of 59s. a week would not give a returned soldier the everyday comforts of life and the medical attention of which he is deserving, and at the same time allow him to maintain a family, when he has to pay the greatest proportion of it to the landlord. Each man should be provided with a suitable home, with proper environment. He should not be placed in a desolate, flimsy structure, worth about 3s. a week. If the house has attractive surroundings, it will make his life a happier one. The sustenance allowance is not sufficient to enable returned soldiers to p it themselves against the system of exploitation' that landlords are carrying out and at the same time rear a family in comfortable circumstances.",71
389,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS,The position is all right in Maryborough.,71
