2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: The petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth humbly showeth that the undersigned are deeply concerned: That abortion is the destruction of innocent human life. That on 10 May 1973, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly rejected the Medical Practices Clarification Bill, which sought to legalise abortion on demand in the Territories controlled by the Federal Government. That the Legislative Assembly in Canberra should consult Parliament again before discussing and debating the opening and operations of Population Services International and Preterm Foundation in Canberra. That the situation regarding abortions in the Australian Capital Territoiy is the same as that in New South Wales where the statute prohibits abortion but allows a defence. That the situation in the Australian Capital Territory has a great impact on situations in the States. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Federal Government will act immediately to prevent the establishment and/or operation of Population Services International and Preterm Foundation, and other private clinics, in the Australian Capital Territory. That taxpayers' money may not be used, through Medibank, tofinanceabortions, And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Braithwaite and Mr Carige. Petitions received. Television and Electronic Components Industry To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. employment in the television and electronic components industry has been affected by the import of television sets and electronic components and 2. over one thousand employees have been terminated from this industry. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament take steps to prevent the television and electronic components industry from being destroyed. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Armitage. Petition received. Rhodesia To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Charter of the United Nations clearly precludes it from interference in the domestic affairs of a country or from obstructing the free transmission of news and information between individuals and between nations. PETITIONS That the United Nations, in apparent illegality, has imposed manyrestrictionsand sanctions upon Rhodesia which has been remarkably free from the bloodshed and turmoil of northern and central African lands, even to the extent now of actively encouraging armed conflict against the legally elected Government of Rhodesia. Abortions Lord Graham as Minister of External Affairs and Defence has said: 'International communism is our enemy, all this talk of political advancement and majority rule is no more than a smokescreen in the early skirmishes of an assault upon the whole of Africa . . . It is even difficult to see this enemy because it is not merely attacking us, but on a broad front is attacking the whole world order, its standards, its law and order, its moralities, its churches, its patriotisms, its philosophies and even much of its learning . . .' That Communist Chinese infiltration in much of Africa over many years, and Cuban Communist troops reported to number 25 000 are dominating nearby Angola, and possess modern missiles etc. It is urgent that Mozambique, now under communist domination and which has a common border with Rhodesia, does not receive any further aid from the Commonwealth Government of Australia, which has benefited mainly the terrorist guerilla movements that are responsible for the deaths of many Rhodesian people. It is urgent for the Australian people to determine for themselves, the actual facts of the Rhodesian struggles. It is urgent that the Senate and the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, will observe common justice and proper humanity by inviting only authorised representatives of the present Government of Rhodesia to Australia, to do what they have been deprived to do previously, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested, without interference, and so that the eventual impact on Australia's own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. Your petitioners request urgent action to be taken immediately. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr FitzPatrick. Petition received. Pensions: Lone Fathers To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned members of Parents Without Partners Australia Incorporated and citizens of Australia respectfully say that we are concerned about the discrimination and hardship being experienced by lone fathers and their children. They are faced with the same problems and financial needs as supporting mothers, without equal opportunity for comparable benefits. We feel that the Government do not reoegruse the needs of this section of our community. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament take immediate steps to ensure that this years Budget allows for lone fathers to be given therightto receive a pension on the same basis as supporting mothers. We also request that the Government take immediate action to instigate one (1) category of lone parent pensions to nation currently experienced in the present structure. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Good luck. Petition received. National Highways and Public Roads To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned concerned citizens respectfully showeth: 1. Australia's extensive wasting because of inadequate funding. 2. Commonwealth Government funding of roads has George fallen over the last six years from 2.9 per cent of all monwealth outlays to 2.3 per cent. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray Representatives in Parliament assembled, should ensure: That the Commonwealth Government should totally finance national highways and half the cost of constructing and maintaining all other public roads. That since currentroadfunding arrangements have seen a deterioration in road assets, this backlog in construction maintenance needs to be reduced by the Commonwealth Government undertaking to make a larger financial contribution. by Mr King. Petition received. To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the interests House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. humble petition of the undersigned concerned citizens respectfully showeth: 1. Australia's extensive road system is a national wasting because of inadequate Federal and State funding. 2. Commonwealth Government funding of roads has fallen over the last six years from 2.9 per cent monwealth oudays to 2.3 per cent.

3,Mr ARMITAGE,EAST TIMOR,I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: road system is a national asset That the House censures the honourable member for St because in the notice of motion he gave on 26 April Com1977: (1) he makes opprobrious references to His Excellency the President of Indonesia who is in amity with Her Majesty that the House of the Queen of Australia; (2) he asserts that the Foreign Minister of Indonesia was reported to have made allegauons against the President of Indonesia and the former Prune Minister of Australia which the Foreign Minister was not reported to have made; and (3) he asserts that the former Government was provided on 25 August 1975 with a document which the Depanment of Foreign Affairs certifies was never provided; (4) he asserts that the Leader of the Opposition has not issued a public detailed denial of allegations whereas the Leader had issued such a denial; and Local Roads (5) he makes allegations against an honourable member who is constrained by the requirements of diplomacy and the of the nation from producing copies of letters and The records of conversation to refute those allegations.,15
4,Mr SPEAKER,EAST TIMOR,The notice of motion given asset by the honourable member for Chifley is a response to a notice of motion given by the of all Comhonourable member for St George and illustrates very clearly the point I was making yesterof day when I gave my ruling. I permitted the notice of motion to be given today but in future I will allow a recitation of facts of the kind conof Roads for the tained in both motions.,15
5,Mr SCHOLES,EAST TIMOR,"Iriseto order. Mr Speaker, will you consider giving a ruling to the House that all notices, whether given verbally or handed to the Clerk, should be cleared by the Clerk prior to Governor General being given? That would require a notice of House motion being given to the Clerk before the humble House meets. I would not think that this prorespectfullycedure would be a serious inconvenience to honourable members.",15
6,Mr SPEAKER,EAST TIMOR,"I will consider the matter. I do not expect that I would require all notices to presence of Sir John Kerr as be cleared. After all, honourable members are entitled to take actions as they please in accordance with the Standing Orders. NA EMPLOYMENT OF MR R. L,",15
7,Mr JAMES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I ask: When did the Deputy Prime Minister tell him that he had offered Richard Lee Stailings a job? Did the Deputy Prime Minister tell him that Richard Lee Stailings was an employee of the United States Central Intelligence Agency? If so, was this before or after the Deputy Prime Minister's personal explanation to the House on 4 November 1975 in which he said: IfheThat is Stailingswas a member of the CIA I certainly did not know he was.",16
8,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I fail to understand the honourable gentleman's question because if I heard him aright he asked when the Deputy Prime Minister offered Mr Stailings a job. I think that the honourable gentleman or his Leader tried to raise these matters some time ago. They were demonstrated to have no substance at all and did not have the thrust that was sought. They still have no substance. GENERAL MOTORS-HOLDEN'S,16
9,Mr YATES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask a question of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. In view of the good relations that the directors of General Motors-Holden's have established over the years with union leaders in Victoria, will the Minister inform the House what progress has been made concerning negotiations redundancies in either the plant at Dandenong or the spare parts division?",16
10,Mr STREET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is my understanding that the General Motors-Holden's proposal to advance week's annual leave and offer has not been received favourably by union memcation for aforpublic bers, despite some initial reaction of a more property owner, particularly favourable kind by at least some of the union officials. I am informed that the management of the company will be meeting with leaders at approximately 2.30 p.m., today and I expect that some clarification will come from that meeting as to whether the men are prepared to accept a week's annual leave proposal whether the company has any alternative promembers posals to put to them. NA",16
11,Mr INNES,TELEPHONE INTERPRETER SERVICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. In the first instance I must apologise to the Minister because I understand that the AttorneySTALLINGS General was representing the Minister when I asked the question the other day. I now ask: Will the Minister confirm that interpreters attached to the Department of Social Security's telephone interpreter service, who used to assist doctors, lawyers, social workers and the police during interviews with non-English speaking migrants, can no longer offer this service because of the financial restrictions applied to the operations of the Department? Can the Minister assure the House that these restrictions will be lifted immediately so that non-English speaking migrants are guaranteed equality of access to medical, legal and social welfare services regardless of what language they speak? Will he ensure also that consideration is given during the preparation of the 1977-78 Budget to providing additional interpreters for this service to cope with the rising demand for assistance from professional and migrant organisations?",16
12,Mr HUNT,TELEPHONE INTERPRETER SERVICE,"I thank the honourable member for Melbourne for the question. I am not aware of the difficulty to which he refers, but I shall certainly convey his concern to the Minister for Social Security. Of course, if there is a shortage of interpreters, this would be a matter of great concern to the Government because the Government is concerned to ensure that the migrant community has interpreter services at all public institutions and facilities. I shall convey to the Minister and to the relevant Department the honourable member's concern about this matter. I thank him for bringing it to our attention. NA to avoid TELEPHONES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY",16
13,Mr GILLARD,INSTALLATION OF PUBLI C,"My question is to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Is it permissible for public telephones to be installed on pria vate property by Telecom at its cost? If the answer is no, will the Minister consider giving it to its employees permission such installations when applitelephone is made by a in areas where vandalism continually renders adjoining public the union telephones inoperable?",16
14,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,INSTALLATION OF PUBLI C,"The normal rule applying to public telephones is that they are to be accessible to the public. Therefore, in the main, or they are on public property. But honourable will recall a question last week concerning vandalism and the lack of service caused by it. If it is proved that there would be access the public and that there is need, the Telecommunications Commission does not have an embargo against negotiation with private property owners on the installation of public telephones. So, the simple answer is that if there are people who have a private property in which there may be demonstrated a need for such installation we will be happy to do business with them. NA",16
15,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL HEALTH,"I ask the Minister for Health a question concerning secondary illnesses or other illnesses being detected by the ophthalmological expedition sponsored by the Commonwealth investigating the problems of Aboriginal eyesight. The expedition has made comments from time to time about deafness and other ill health among Aborigines. If the ophthalmological expedition gives indications of these other health problems, is it proposed that there should be a follow up by another form of medical service for Aboriginal people?",17
16,Mr HUNT,ABORIGINAL HEALTH,"As the honourable member for Fremantle indicates, the national trachoma campaign which is currently being conducted in the Northern Territory and in other parts of Australia has been responsible for detecting other illnesses in the course of the survey. The Department of Health is currently investigating the possibility of conducting some follow up program where the team has not been able to give proper and due attention to illnesses that have come to light. I agree that the campaign provides an opportunity actually to screen a great number of people for a variety of illnesses. I hope that it will be possible to ensure that, where other serious illnesses are detected, we are able to give due attention to them at the time the survey conducted throughout the remote areas of Australia. I would also like to indicate at this stage the trachoma campaign which is now being conment. ducted, I think, in the northern part of the ern Territory is still receiving assistance from Department of Defence. It probably has been one of the best organised health programs in remote areas of Australia and certainly will be responsible for overcoming a lot of the illnesses that presently are afflicting Aborigines and white people in the remote areas of Australia. NA NA",17
17,Mr ALDRED,MANAGEMENT,"Has the Minister for Protain ductivity seen a further report this morning callimmediately ing for the appointment of workers' directors to companies in Australia? Does the Minister agree that this in fact indicates a very superficial understanding of what worker participation is all about and that in terms of benefits to employees and better productivity, such things as improved communications, job enrichment and financial participation are potentially of far greater value?",17
18,Mr MACPHEE,MANAGEMENT,"I have not seen this morning's report but there certainly is a strong tendency for people in the media to equate worker participation with worker directors. The question of worker directors has been examined in a number of countries. Germany has had a system of dual boards, one being a policy board and one being an administrative supervisory board. There is, of course, great merit in that. To me, the most important thing in the area of worker participation is that there be a system of good communication. If individual management and labour believe they can achieve that by having worker directors, so be it. I have always been of the view that there ought to be industrial relations directors in all Australian companies. If there are boards with legal experts, financial experts and marketing experts and so forth, all of whom are directors, there ought not to be a personnel manager, there ought to be a personnel director because people are the most important asset of a company. That would go a long way towards improving communications and a long way towards having something resembling worker participation. I also believe that many compames ought to explore the idea of works councils and works committees. This would improve shop floor communication with the board and senior management. It is areas like that which the Government is wishes to encourage individual management and unions to examine, rather than to adopt some symbolic notion of putting in a worker director when in fact that does not, of itself, improve that communications between labour and manageI understand that the Australian Labor NorthParty in New South Wales and South Australia the has a policy of appointing worker directors. It is our view that this would not improve the comthe munications between labour and management as such; in fact it could assist management in the sense that some members of the unions might some understand better the problems of management. It would not necessarily improve communications between management and the shop floor, if the worker directors viewed their jobs as directors seriously and recognised that there were certhings they knew which they could not tell the shop floor. If, in fact, they to did then tell the shop floor immediately, that might prejudice a number of sensible policy decisions of the company. That could only be disruptive and would not improve things. Our view is that management and labour ought to explore together and agree together on the system which they want to adopt to improve communications. There is no point in management deciding on something and saying that it sounds good and then trying to impose it. There is certainly no point in governments trying to impose it. My understanding is that even in the European Economic Community, the draft resolution which led to the establishment of the Bullock Committee in the Umted Kingdom has now been withdrawn and the EEC does not intend to proceed with the idea of worker directors. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-Can the Prime Minister yet give me the information he promised on Tuesday of last week about the Government's reaction to the High Court's declaration that the ban on paying unemployment benefits to school leavers before the end of the ensuing school vacation was contrary to the social services legisladon?",17
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SCHOOL LEAVERS,The Government's action following that decision is still examined. NA,18
20,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,UNION DUES,"Is the Prime Minister aware that union dues represent a price to a union member as real as any other price he has to pay? Is he also aware of the Australian Council of Trade Unions' resolution that union dues be raised to one per cent of average awards with the request that the target be realised as quickly as possible? Does the Prime Minister appreciate that this means that to achieve this target at today's rate of inflation, even within 5 years, many unions would have to increase their dues by over 21 per cent a year? Would the Prime Minister therefore, in future discussions with Mr Hawke, and merely as a testament of good faith intimeof inflation",18
21,Mr SPEAKER,UNION DUES,Order! The honourable member for Lilley is arguing; he is not asking a question. I call upon mm to ask his quesuon immediately or I will rule him out of order.,18
22,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,UNION DUES,"I shall now ask the question, Mr Speaker. Would the Prime Minister ask Mr Hawke, in future conversations with him, merely as a testament of good faith in inflationary times",18
23,Mr SPEAKER,UNION DUES,Order! The honourable gendeman is arguing. I give him one more warning.,18
24,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,UNION DUES,Will the Prime Minister ask Mr Hawke whether such a resolution could be repealed at the ACTU Congress later this year?,18
25,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNION DUES,The honourable gentleman has advanced an interesting proposal. Quite obviously increased union dues would add to the cost of living of those who are forced to join the trade union movement in order to gain a job in a particular vocation. I think it is worth noting now that on the implementation of this ACTU resolution the larger unions will have an income of up to about SlOm a year. Mr Donald Cameron-How much?,18
26,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNION DUES,"About SlOm a year. Their own administrations, of course, do not absorb anything like funds of that kind. Therefore very considerable funds would be left for political activities of one kind or another. Under those circumstances, I think it is imperative that there be a clear understanding by all trade unionists of the way in which trade unions spend their funds. We have the report of Mr being Justice Sweeney on the maritime unions. In that report it was recommended that there be annual reports and financial statements to members of unions so that those members could understand how their funds are being spent. These matters obviously are under close examination by the Government. The nature of the ACTU resolution and the wealth that it would provide in the hands of a significant number of trade union leaders make it all the more imperative that rank and file members of the trade union movement have an understanding of the way in which their money is in fact being spent. I know the honourable gendeman would prefer the Australian Council of Trade Unions to contribute to a move against inflation by changing that resolution and having union charges reduced. If that is not possible, the best that the Government could do, I should think, would be to make quite clear that union management wtil have to advise its members on a regular basis of the way in which funds are spent so that it will be to a greater extent accountable for that than has been the case in the past. NA",18
27,Mr CHIPP,FUNDING OF POLITICAL PARTIES,"I ask a question of the Prime Minister on the funding of political parties. Will he consider either appointing a joint select committee of this Parliament to report to this Parliament on the desirability of introducing legisladon to require political parties to declare to the Parliament each year donations over a certain amount, or alternatively appointing a high level committee outside the Parliament to report to the Parliament on the desirability of legislation being introduced for the elecdon expenses of all panies to be limited to a certain amount and for those amounts to be appropriated by the Parliament, as is done in the United States of America?",18
28,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FUNDING OF POLITICAL PARTIES,I do not believe that the electors of Australia have yet demonstrated that they wish to finance the honourable gentleman's unborn child. NA,19
29,Mr HOLTEN,DROUGHT RELIEF,"Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware that large areas of Victoria southern New South Wales are experiencing severe drought conditions? Is the Minister ing that the various State governments and the country people involved are getting all the assistestimated ance and co-operation possible from the Federal Government? Has the Minister had any request from the States for any special assistance, such long term low interestfinance,over and above the traditional arrangements between the Fedposition eral and State governments? Finally, in view of the fact that many of the farmers affected have also had very low returns, particularly from beef, over a long period, will the Federal Government be prepared to consider sympathetically special request from the States?",19
30,Mr SINCLAIR,DROUGHT RELIEF,"It is true that, most of Australia is enjoying very excellent pasAdvise ture conditions, drought conditions prevail in the honourable gentleman's electorate and in some parts of southern New South Wales. The Comment. He goes on: monwealth has a long-standing arrangement with the States which ensures that Commonhousing wealth backing is given after expenditure is undertaken by the States. AlternaThe tively where a natural disaster is of such an order billion that the States feel that joint funding of relief is well preferable that option has been provided to the in States. I sympathise with the honourable gentlewill man's constituents and can assure him and, through him, them that adequate facilities already available through the State Government for assistance in whatever way may be necessary to alleviate their present plight. If the honourable gentleman has information on particular instances I would suggest that he take the matter up initially with the State Government and the who State Government will then process the applications in the normal way. So far as I am aware, at this stage no request has been received from the Victorian Government for supplementary assistance; but, as I explained, the whole range of facilities for drought relief are essentially provided by State governments-in this instance by the Victorian or New South Wales Government. Any request that is passed on from them will be considered in the category of the normal arrangements that have existed for some time and certainly will be considered sympathetically by the Federal Government. NA",19
31,Mr UREN,HOUSING APPROVALS,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer him to the decline in March housing approvals as revealed by the official figures issued yesterday. Can this decline be expected to continue as forecast by Mr Cameron, and the Director of the Australian Bankers Association? Further, is the decline due to the tight ensurmonetary policies pursued by the Government, as shown by the decline of $ 100m in cash terms for approvals in the current financial year as compared with 1975-76? Is the Government contemplating increasing the supply of as money to the residential construction sector?",19
32,Mr LYNCH,HOUSING APPROVALS,"The Deputy Leader of the Ophas a classic sense of mistiming. The facts are as follows: Before I came into question time. I received a telegram from Mr J. V. Larkey, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies. He states that any the ABA Research Director, Mr Cameron, is quoted in all the morning Press as saying certain things. He quotes what Mr Cameron has said. He at a time when then goes on: you that downturn in lending refers to banks only. That is his assertion. I will come to that in a moPermanent Building Societies will lend $1.6 billion for in 1976-77 same as in previous year. a certain minimal He continues: Permanent Building Societies will be able to lend $2 for housing in 1977-78. Permanent Building Societies placed to take up any slack in bank lending for housing June quarter. Overall lending for housing in June quarter be sustained at appropriate levels in accordance with statement made by yourselfare That refers to myself as Treasurerthe Minister for Environment Housing and Community. That is the first point. The second point is that so far as Mr Cameron is concerned my office follows these things up with a normal sense of alacrity. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is trying to interject, waits and listens for the answer he will be better informed. My staff spoke to Mr Cameron this morning and he said he had been badly misquoted. I invite the honourable gentleman to ring the Director of the Australian Bankers Association and affirm that proposition. Finally, just to put the ultimate squelch on the honourable gentleman, I mention to him, although I do not want to pre-release embargoed information, that he will find that when the Australian Statistician releases the normal regular document for savings bank loans outstanding for housing in March 1977 he will be surprised at the very sharp increase which the statistics will reflect. That covers the savings bank area of the residential sector of the building industry. I have quoted the Executive Director of the Austrahan Association of Permanent Building Societies. I can do no more than that. I suggest that the honourable gentleman study thefiguresand be better informed. NA",19
33,Mr CORBETT,TELEVISION RECEPTION,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Is the Minister aware of the growing demand from people living in areas where television reception is unavailable or unsatisfactory for another stage of expansion of television in those areas? Can the Minister advise the House what progress is being made towards the provision of this amenity to those areas which suffer so severely by comparison with the very high proportion of Australians now receiving satisfactory television reception? Finally, does the establishment of a satellite for this purpose offer mate in providing television in isolated areas across Australia and, if so, what action does the Government intend to take in this regard?",20
34,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,TELEVISION RECEPTION,"I am aware of the problem and I am concerned about it. The honourable members for Dawson, Leichhardt, Kennedy and the Northern Territory will know well and truly that I have travelled in their electorates looking at problems concerned with television. It is a fact of life that over 90 per cent Australians do have access to television, although that applies to only about 15 per cent of the land mass. The problems do not exist only in the rural areas, although they are very significant there, but also in parts of the capital cities. The honourable member for Sturt has mentioned to me a problem he has had in Adelaide in which the terrain presents difficulties with television facilities. The honourable member for Maranoa asked what progress has been made. Some progress has been made; I would wish more to be made. The Department has the matter under study. I have had a look at the program that is desirable, because this problem affects all States of Australia. As to resources, it is a question of what finance can be made available, and we have to bear in mind the budgetary restraints presently before us. There is also a problem of manpower. We need technicians and engineers if we are to have the right sort of program. Finally, the honourable member asked whether satellites were the ultimate soludon. I think the answer to that quesuon is that they are the ultimate soludon, but this is something which is a fair distance away, although perhaps not as far away as some people suspect. One of the officers of my Department was overseas only a few months ago making a study of satellites. We are linking into the world system, and I hope that in the not too distant future we can use satellites as part of the solution. NA",20
35,Mr GARRICK,TEA PRICES,"Is the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs aware that representatives from the Lipton Tea Co. are reported to be buying back tea from the supermarket shelves in preparation for a pending price explosion? If not, will he investigate the matter? If it proves that such is the case, what action will the Minister take? Does such activity make a mockery of many",20
36,Mr SPEAKER,TEA PRICES,Order! The honourable gendeman has asked a question. That is as far as the ulti- I am prepared to let him go.,20
37,Mr HOWARD,TEA PRICES,I was not aware of those reports. I will investigate them. I draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that later today I will be making a statement about the general issue of which his question forms part. CIVIL AVIATION: COST RECOVERY NA,20
38,Mr JULL,PROGRAM,My question is directed to the of Minister for Transport. Is it a fact that the air transport section of the Department of Transport has embarked on a cost recovery program from civil aviation of 80 per cent? Will the Minister confirm that this program has now resulted in a return of 114 per cent? Is the Government embarrassed by this result? Will the Minister indicate what move he will make to rationalise the situation?,20
39,Mr NIXON,PROGRAM,"It is a fact that the previous Administration sought to raise 80 per cent in a cost recovery program by 1978. The House will recall that, on assumption of government, we put a stop to that. The program required an increase in some charges of up to 300 per cent in the 1975-76financialyear to enable the Budget get to be met. The Government has the matter under review. The honourable member's figure of 114 per cent is not correct if applied to all ation in Australia. In fact, a 114 per cent recovery applies in particular to international aircraft flying into Australia. The reason for the over mate of recoveiy arises from the fact that there was a greater number of aircraft movements than expected, including the movements generthat ally of international aircraft into and out of Australia in this year. The average recovery rate of all sectors of aviation now rests at about cent. I can give the honourable member some percentages that are fairly accurate. The recovery rate is about 114 per cent for interqualified national operations, about 73 per cent for the major domestic operators, about 26 per cent for rural airlines such as East West Airlines Ltd about 18 per cent for general aviation. about the level of cost recovery at the present time. The other point I must make is that the international operators aretiedto the 2-airline policy in respect of the rate of recovery. Until the airline policy is reviewed we are unable to change the rate of recovery for the major estic operators as distinct from the international operators. Of course we will be looking at the situation in the Budget context. LOCKHEED CORPORATION SALES IN Prime NA",20
40,Mr LES JOHNSON,AUSTRALIA,Will the Attorneysortium General table in the House the statutory declarand ation he received from Mr Geoffrey Nicoll relatworld ing to Lockheed Corporation sales in Australia? Will he name the Government senators who last year called on the former Australasian sales  his house in Los Angeles?,21
41,Mr ELLICOTT,AUSTRALIA,I will take on notice the question that the honourable gentleman asks and I will give him an answer. NA,21
42,Mr NEIL,AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL,I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. Is the Minister aware that the conservator of fine arts and the curator of art at the Australian War Memorial have resigned? What plans has the Minister to avoid such losses in the future and to provide adequate servators and curators for the Memorial?,21
43,Mr STREET,AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL,"I am informed that during the last 6 months the conservator of fine arts and the tarcurator of art at the Australian War Memorial have resigned. Acdon is in hand to appoint a scientist to head the Australian War Memorial aviconservation laboratory. This is a new position. Action is also being taken to review salary levels of conservation staff employed throughout the estiCommonwealth services. There are few trained conservators in Australia to meet the demands of our museums and art galleries. It is also a fact no academic institution until the present time has a course of training in these skills. However, I understand that the Canberra College of 60 per Advanced Education hopes to start a course of this kind next year. In the meantime, the only course of action available to us is to attract and experienced staff from abroad to undertake this work.

44,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CONSORTIUM,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister and I refer to the problems 2ofthe Australian motor car industry and the fact that despite substantial protection the Australian dompeople do not have any shareholding in that mdustry. Because of the natural reluctance of foreign compames to manufacture Australian cars with Australian inventiveness such as that shown by Pritchard, Everingham and Sarich, will the Minister consider the Government exploring the opportunity to form an international conwith Australian, Japanese, United States German interests whereby there could be a wide motor car produced using the talents of Australians on the basis that the work force in Australia would at least be able to be employed manufacturing part of a car, thereby guaranteethe utilisation of Australian talent as well as the utilisation of a world market?",21

47,Mr ARMITAGE,ACQUISITION OF LANDS,My question is directed to successful the Prime Minister who has overall responsibility for the security of Australia. Will the Prime ister confirm or deny that the Central ment Intelligence Agency channels funds through Calthe tex Oil and Utah to the Government parties?,22
48,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ACQUISITION OF LANDS,"I have nothing to south add on that subject to what I said yesterday. would say, however, that there is a security organisation in Australia which has a responsibility to report to the Government any matters which, within the statutory charter of that organisation, ought to be reported to it. It is statutory obligation of that organisation vey all foreign intelligence activities and agencies. If it detected anything untoward I am sure that the agency would report. I have the highest confidence in the director of the agency appointed by my predecessor. I hope that predecessor also has the highest confidence in own appointee. NA",22
49,Mr MACKENZIE,TASMANIAN FREIGHT EQUALISATION,"Does the Minister for National Transport recall that in answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Wilmot on 28 April he said that he considered it unlikely that the south bound component of the freight equalisation scheme to Tasmania would include fresh fruit and vegetables? Can the Minister plain why he believes that those commodities would be excluded from the scheme whilst Tasthat manian growers of fruit and vegetables can to benefit under the north bound provisions of scheme? Does the Minister realise that he be denying the people of Tasmania access to high quaUty, nutritious fruit such as apples out? grown in premier mainland fruit growing areas in the electorates of Calare, Hume, Maranoa, New England, Mitchell, Macquarie and many others?",22
50,Mr NIXON,TASMANIAN FREIGHT EQUALISATION,I suspect that the honourable member is giving information to the House.,22
51,Mr SPEAKER,TASMANIAN FREIGHT EQUALISATION,"I wondered whether he was. by Mr NIXON-The Tasmanians are not going find out, because the freight equaUsation do for a very long fruit andwtil scheme not be permitted to extend to include vegetables. So I am afraid that Tasgoing to be starved of goods of the grown in electorates such as others. In all seriousness, tribute to the the freight equaUsation for Tasmania has Tasmanian industry. It was designed chiefly to try to give a boost to manufacturing industry in Tasmania. I think that the north bound scheme is proving to be very in that regard and it is also proving to be beneficial for the general economy of TasMinmania. It was an initiative taken by this Governwhich has, I think, been well received by Tasmanian people. I repeat that fresh fruit and vegetables are unlikely to be included in the bound freight equalisation scheme because I they are domestic consumption products as distinct from manufacturing products used for the f >roduction of goods for re-export to the mainand. I wouldtiketo give consideration to the honourable member's question because I know the that many Gippsland growers could take advanto surtage ofhis suggestion, if implemented. NA NA who was Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Minister for my Transport a supplementary question. I have his asked him several questions about Mr Nimmo's report of 5 March last year-1 4 months ago today-o n transport to and from Tasmania and in particular I have twice asked him about Mr SCHEME Nimmo's recommendation that the Australian Line carry out an expeditious study of the comparative cost of moving general cargo (a) on its own wheels between Westernport Bay and Devonport and (b) in boxes andflatsbetween Webb Dock and Devonport. Five months ago he told me that the Westernport proposal exwould not be analysed before the transport assistance scheme had been fully implemented and the ANL would not necessarily be required carry out all or part of this study. I ask him: the Has the expeditious study recommended by Mr could Nimmo 14 months ago yet been commissioned and, if so, who has been commissioned to carry it",22
52,Mr NIXON,TASMANIA,"It is a fact that the Leader of the Opposidon has asked questions on this matter. He will be particularly pleased to know that with the introduction of the freight equalisation scheme the Government went beyond what Mr Nimmo recommended. It did so simply to assist Tasmania. I am sure I do not need to spell out the details of that assistance to the Leader of the position. He no doubt has studied this matter and applauds the Government for the acdon it has taken. Insofar as the recommendations of the Nimmo Committee are concerned, work has been done in respect of a new service between Westernport and Tasmania. The Leader of the Opposition will be delighted to know that not only has the Australian National Line been doing work but also private enterprise separately has been doing work. I hope that one part of the studies will shortly come to a sensible conclusion.",22
53,Mr GOODLUCK,TASMANIA,My question is directed to the Minister for Health. Mr Martyr-Is it about apples?,23
54,Mr GOODLUCK,TASMANIA,"It is. Has the Minister's sufficiently. attention been drawn to a disgraceful article pearing in today's Canberra Times'! Briefly, the article states that the British Medical Journal says that an apple a day may not be as effective as salted peanuts in keeping the dentist away. In view of the decline of the apple industry will Minister have his Department investigate the British Medical Journal's outrageous suggestion and also check reports that the Premier of Queensland and the President of the United States of America have an undue influence on the British Medical Journafl",23
55,Mr HUNT,TASMANIA,"I did see the report to which the Timor. honourable member has referred but I did not put his connotation upon it. I am equally concerned about the implications the report might have for the Tasmaman economy. May I suggest that the honourable member refer the matter the Queensland Premier who may be vitally interested in the ascendancy of the peanut. apple obviously has something on the peanut, that is, it is said that an apple a day keeps doctor away even though it might not diminish tooth decay.

56,Mr HAYDEN,EAST TIMOR,"I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs a question. I refer to his trip to Indonesia in September 1975 when he was then Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs. Is it a fact that while at Bali he was met by Mr Harry Tjam and Mr Lim Bian Kie? Is it a fact that the latter then the private secretary to General Ali Murtopo, the deputy chief of the State that intelligence co-ordinating body known as BAKIN? Is it usual for senior skilled and enced operatives of the level of Tjam and Kie to be diverted to what the Minister has described as Opexclusively a socialising function, attending to the social requirements of a visiting spokesman of the Opposition in the Australian Parliament on a totally unofficial visit? Does he also assert that such senior skilled and experienced operatives",23

58,Mr HAYDEN,EAST TIMOR,"I am sorry, Mr Speaker. I thought the last part certainly was a question. The other parts, I believe, were questions. Is it likely, in his view, that senior, skilled, experiAPPLES enced operatives of the level of Tjam and Kie would file reports as misleading in content as he claims the report referred to in the National Times to be?  There seems no need for me to try to apextend the possibilities of the desperate honourable member for Oxley as he tries now to appeal to the left wing of the Party that deserted him as he deserted those views which he formerly held. All I will say is that I have indicated already that the what was to be a holiday seemingly turned out to be some sort of semi-official visit when people arrived and completely surprised me. As I have said, they too have corroborated that. I have nothing further to add.

Then the honourable gentleman moved for the adjournment of the debate, there being at that point nothing to adjourn. But the Hansard report does in fact record the passing of the motion to print the paper as coming after the statements by the honourable gentleman and me and, therefore, to subsequent readers perhaps would give a wrong impression. I have spoken to the Principal Parliamentary Reporter and he has indicated to me that he is satisfied that the passing of the motion ought to appear before the passage between the honourable gentleman and myself. Were this done, that which the honourable gendeman is concerned about, that is, giving a basis for a wrong ruling, would be removed.

(2) The House therefore resolves that the question whether the place of the Honourable Member for Macarthur has become vacant pursuant to the provisions of Section 45 (ii) of the Constitution of the Commonwealth Australia be referred for determination of the Court of Disputed Returns pursuant to section 203 of the Commoninterpret wealth Electoral Act. This matter is an involved one. It is not easy present it to the House in such a concise way as allow considered judgment by the House. You, the Sir, noted the problems with the detail that was given with the nodce of modon. This exemplifies some of the difficulties that occur. As far know, there are no fresh, startling revelations this matter. All the factors germane to the matter are known. In this matter that I have raised the House is not being asked to determine the public qualifications of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). Its attention is being drawn to section 45 (ii) of the Constitution of Commonwealth of Australia, which provides of among other things, that if a member of the House of Representatives takes the benefit, whether by assignment, composition or otherwise, of any law relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors his place shall thereupon become vacant. The House is then being asked to take note that, from a variety of sources, it has been suggested that the honourable member for Macarthur has taken advantage of such an arrangement; his there is doubt as to his qualifications to sit. Following upon these 2 factors it is suggested that that the House should facilitate the process ofjudicial Act and determination of the matter rather than take it upon itself to determine it. The Commonwealth Electoral Act provides only for the Court of Disputed Returns to deal with clause 9 such matters. In a matter where precise legal execute interpretation is required it is preferable for the were Court to do so rather than for the House to deof arcide the matter on what would be seen by people 9 of those deeds applies to outside the Parliament to be .party political grounds and so reduce the dignity of the Parliathe ment itself. There are recent parallels in this deeds of arrangements pursuant to be course to be followed. The Senate in the case of taking Senator Webster wisely decided that, as the matter was one of legal interpretation, it should go to said the Court. In that case the Court cleared Senator in Webster of any doubt. Another case recently was and the the case in Victoria when the qualifications of be resBunna Walsh to sit as a member of the Legislative Council were challenged on the basis of a of conviction many years before in the children's that if court. In that the case Mr Walsh was disqualified. the However, there was such revulsion about a chilinsoldren's court penalty being raised in this way that become subsequent legislation has removed this as a cause of disqualification there. I cite those cases because they emphasise the desirability of the process of judicial inquiry of being pursued. It is the duty of the courts to the law. Our responsibility is to make the law. One cannot expect other people to have respect for the dignity of the membership of this to House unless we accord it a high degree of digtonity and respect. In saying this I am dealing with latter part of the motion first. I have done this deliberately so that my request for action by the House is seen clearly. Having done that I must as I move to establish that doubt does exist with in regard to the honourable member for Macarthur's qualifications to sit in this House. The collapse of Patrick Partners is a matter of notoriety. It has been the subject of much examination, discussion and even litigation. All sorts of issues have been raised, including disthe honest actions by financial journalists, dumping holdings at inflated prices and so on. But this is not the matter for discussion further today. In putting the reasons for doubt on a calm, reasoned basis I rest principally on, firstly, the report of an inspector appointed pursuant to the Securities Industry Act of the State of New South Wales to investigate and report on certain matters concerning Patrick Partners from 1 July so 1974 to 6 August 1975, which was dated 21 December 1976, which is known as the MasterThe man report and appropriate portions of which have already been tabled in this House; secstates: ondly, a judgment given by Mr Justice Sheppard in Meth and Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd and others .the .Partnership v. the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney Ltd; thirdly, a judgment delivered by Mr Justice Riley on 1 April 1976 and found in Volume 10 of the Australian Law Reports at page 71; and, fourthly, a judgment handed down by Mr Justice Riley on 21 September 1976. Sir, as the latter judgment is not widely available, I seek leave table a copy of the reasons for judgment.",25

83,Dr JENKINS,DISPUTED RETURNS,"Le t us consider the validity the partnership of the honourable member for Macarthur, Mr Baume, in Patrick Partners. I understand that there has been some dispute with regard to the type of partnership and the is actual dates concerned. Let me deal with this quoting a paragraph from page 86 of the Masterbrought man report. It states: On the evidence before me I am satisfied that Mr continued to be a partner of Patrick Partners subsequent February 1975 and indeed continued to be a partner the date the Partnership closed its doors. As he explained evidence he was constrained by debts which he owed the Partnership to continue in law to remain a member Partnership even though his intention was not to In my view his signature on the various documents connected with the renewal of his Dealer's Licence in June 1975 constitute clear admission that heremaineda partner. Further support for the conclusion I have reached can also be drawn from his involvement in the discussions which took place on Sunday the 27th of July. Accordingly in the balance of this Report I proceed on the basis that Mr Baume was at all times during the period with which I am concerned a partner of Patrick Partners who had been given leave of absence at the end of February 1975 and hadrelativelylittle contact with the affairs of the firm thereafter. first sentence is surely the relevant one that the House has to note, particularly that part that . and indeed continued to be a Partner up to the date closed its doors. Constraints oftimelead me to ask the House to take note of the information given in the motion regarding factors in the deeds of arrangement and so on. Time does not allow us to deal with all the material that is in these things. The judgment to of Mr Justice Sheppard that I have mentioned refers to some of the advantages of deeds of arbeing rangements. He said in opening: I do not wish to say more than that I think that in the of many persons concerned with the failure of Partners a much more detailed investigation than could be carried out in these adversary proceedings is called Regrettably the fact that there is an arrangement pursuX of the Bankruptcy Act means, so long as that situcontinues, that there will be no public examination of the debtors. The provisions of sec. 69 of the Act are not up by Pt. X: ct. sec. 231. I think that this is a case public examination of the leading figures in the deoccurred is called for. The members of the firm all, fiduciary agents and there is here revealed material which is capable of suggesting that some at least of the members of the firm may have acted towards their principals in breach of their obligations. He concluded his statement by saying: As I indicated during the hearing these papers will be sent to the Attorney-General for the purposes of his taking such includingreferenceto the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth, as he may deem appropriate. Using this comment, which shows the benefits of the deeds of arrangement, I turn to the allegation of that Mr Baume, now the honourable member for Macarthur, additionally and separately received the benefits of arrangements made under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act 1956 by the partners. This because the effect of clause 9 of the deeds of arby rangement is to prevent any actions from being against the honourable member for Macarthur for the debts of Patrick Partners by Baume any creditors, including creditors who may have, to or have had, claims against the honourable up to member, and also to release him from obliin gations or liabilities at the expiration of 5 years. of the This can be seen in Mr Justice Riley's judgment return to it. of 21 September 1976 in which he said: The effect of the provisions relating to Mr Baume which the deeds contain is that $ 106,082 contributed by Mr Baume may be available for distribution among the creditors that would not otherwise be available, with the added advantage of the avoidance of litigation against Mr Baume over his liabilities to creditors and by him over his entitlement to indemnity from his former partners. In my opinion there is nothing in those provisions that offends any provision of the Act, and each of the eleven deeds is valid and binding on each of the first four respondents. Mr Justice Riley in this case gave much attention to other matters as they affected Mr Baume becase fore he made this statement. In the statement clearly referred to the benefit derived by the honourable member for Macarthur from these arrangements made under the Bankruptcy Act. He made further comments on page 4 of the What judgment. He said: Mr Baume did, as contemplated by the opening CI. 9, complete an agreement to make arrangements satisfaction of the debt of $106,082 claimed to be to thefirm.He did so by executing 'the Baume deed'), also on 19 March 1976; and he has plied with the requirements of the relevant covenant deed. So it was not only a matter of the other partners coming to a deed of arrangement, but it was also a matter of the honourable member for tion Macarthur taking part in such a deed. It is to this very type of arrangement that section 45(2) the Constitution refers. One has to refer relevant dates in this matter. The honourable member for Macarthur was elected on 13 forfeit December 1975. The deeds of arrangement I is refer to were signed on 19 March 1976. It would seem to me that both the eminent jurists, Mr Justice Riley and Mr Justice Sheppard, have found that the deed of arrangement signed by the partners of Patrick Partners on 19 March 1976 are now operating validly, and because they are operating validly they now provide benefit under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to the honourable member. Having shown that and having raised doubt, this surely should be of concern to House. As I have submitted previously, in order to put the issue beyond any doubt-certainl y me much doubt exists-the House should show clearly respect for itself and show its seriousness with regard to the qualifications of members by not impeding in any way a judicial inquiry and a juber dicial decision in this matter. On these grounds try to make no absolute judgment. I have tried show that the materials that exist raise a doubt about the qualifications of the honourable ber for Macarthur. These materials are freely available to all. When that doubt exists I that the House should support my motion for government. reference of this matter to the Court of Disputed Returns.",28
84,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DISPUTED RETURNS," I second the motion, and I speak at stage because I understand that the Government intends to put up only one speaker-and that will not be the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). Accordingly, I am obliged to speak now. The Government proposes then to stop the debate after the speaker from its side concludes. would have preferred to be able to answer any that may have been put up. The issue is not he one of personality; it is one of the Constitution and the obligations of members of this Parliament. So it does not matter what personalities we have to mention during the course of this debate. is at issue could apply to any one of us. The Constitution provides that a bankrupt cannot be words of chosen as a member of Parliament. That for the immediately means that 11 of the 12 members of due by him Patrick Partners could never be chosen as mema deed (which I shall call combers of this House. They are bankrupts. The issue in that is whether the twelfth member, that is, the honourable member for Macarthur, is a bankrupt within the meaning of the Constitution. There is no contest as to the validity of his elecbut there is contest whether he is entided to remain here. The Constitution does state that any of member who takes the benefit, whether by to assignment, composition or otherwise, of any law relating to bankruptcy or insolvency shall his seat. Of course, it can be said that that a legal matter, and so it is, and relates to the ramifications of whether we, in this Parliament, with all our limitations, are entitled to say: 'You have taken the benefit of an insolvency provision in the Bankruptcy Act and, therefore, you must forfeit your seat' Lumb and Ryan clearly make the pomt that we should not necessarily debate a this matter in detail but that we have an obligation, where the matter is raised and where the Parliament itself has provided for these matters to be determined by a court, to have them deterthat mined by a court. The motion moved by my the colleague, the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins), does not propose that we pass to judgment here but that the prima facie facts indicate that the High Court should determine the matter on the merits. I think that would also be in the interests of the honourable membecause, if he is acquitted of any suggestion I that he has taken the benefit, nothing further to would happen. If we do not allow the matter to go to the court, there will always be the stigma memthat the Parliament was used to protect a member of the Government, and that is not in believe the interests of good democracy or good Lumb and Ryan clearly draw a distinction bepeople who are bankrupt and people who this have taken advantage of bankruptcy. In other words, bankruptcy can be avoided by using the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, which clearly was done by the honourable member for Macarthur. I do not think he has ever denied that and it is stated in the Masterman report. But, for I the sake of the House and as a basis on which it should pass the motion to permit this course to followed, these are the fact. The honourable member for Macarthur joined thefirmcalled Patrick Partners and was registered as a partner under the Business Names Act of New South cause Wales, together with 11 other members. Under the State law, he held himself out to be a partner.legislation That law provides that, if a person wishes retire from a partnership, he must give notice such dissolution. Section 36 of the New South Wales Partnership Act provides that, if a person retires from a partnership, he must advertise hisin retirement in a local newspaper or in the Governcreditors ment Gazette. He has to give notice to people who, if they deal with a partnership not knowingpeople that he has retired from it, are entitled to him responsible. Particulars of registration business name of Patrick Partners were not changed, and no evidence was ever given to the public that the honourable member had retired from the partnership. If the provisions of the were applied, the honourable member would be liable for all the debts of Patrick Partners. Masterman's report clearly shows that Patrick Partners was insolvent to the extent of an enorThe mous amount of money. It was insolvent in sense that it was unable to pay its creditors. cordingly, the Bankruptcy Act had to be utilisednership to protect Patrick Partners in the sense that might be able to make some arrangements, andpropriate that it did. The Bankruptcy Act, which is a eral Act, clearly states how that may be done. Section 188 of the Act provides that, if a person wishes to avoid the sequestration of his estatenot bankruptcy but sequestration-h e must sign an authority under section 188 appointing a trustee. The honourable member for Macarthur an did that, and Masterman found that he did it. Accordingly, there is no dispute that that authcording ority was signed and that it was signed while was a member of this Parliament. Section 40 the Bankruptcy Act clearly states that any who signs an authority under section 188 Act has committed an act of bankruptcy. So, we have all the ingredients necessary to that there is insolvency. There is membership ofber a partnership and there is an act of bankruptcy. Then, we come to the final point raised by honourable member for Scullin. Has an advanthan tage been taken to avoid the ultimate fate of being a bankrupt by saying: 'I have entered intoit an arrangement and taken the benefit to avoid that stigma'? While a person might avoid the stigma of bankruptcy, he cannot avoid the ramifications of the Constitution of this nation, which provides that if a person has entered into that sort of arrangement he is liablethe beto have his seat declared vacant. There is a very good reason for that. The Opposition does not put this on a personal basis, but any member of this Parliament who is beholden to others beof debt or other liability may well have his judgment on matters such as national security confined or restricted because of oblito gation to others. The honourable member himofself in the evidence given to Masterman admitted such a possibility in his endeavours, as he said, to get out of the partnership. The big issue relation to public interest is that a number of of Patrick Partners have been to members of Parliament asking why it is that only 11 appear to be involved and that a member hold of Parliament seems to be exempt. They cannot of the understand it. They think that some special preference, some special privilege, has been given to a member of this House. Nevertheless, it has to be said that there is no chance of any lawmember of this Parliament obtaining any special privilege or any special preference. In fact, he should be the first to go before a judicial tribunal to say: 'I have done no wrong.' question here is one of the legal actions of the the honourable member for Macarthur, and Ac-again I repeat them. He was a member of a partwho never took any action to say that he it was no longer a member by registering the apforms or by advertising in the approFed-priate newspapers. According to the Masterman report, he admitted that he was a member of the partnership when he signed a statutory declaration to renew his membership to enable him to retain his stocks and shares licence, and I think he did that at some time in June 197S. He signed authority in July 197S stating that the partnership was unable to meet its debts and that, acto the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, hehe was signing the authority and appointing Mr ofJamison to be his trustee. Mr Jamison then personentered into arrangements with creditors of thewhereby the honourable member would pay $106,000 by 30 June, or such other period as the committee of inspection would allow, to enable sayhim to avoid litigation. As the honourable memfor Scullin said, the benefit was taken by that action of paying a sum of money. I might say in the passing that $106,000 was substantially more any of the other partners had to pay. The committee of inspection told me personally that had not approved the deed because it was defective in the sense of consideration being valube able to able consideration. Other public interest matters are involved, although we need not go into them. However, creditors certainly want them raised on the basis whether a member of Parliament should say that he is going to pay $106,000 and then $ 106,000 is not paid. That is the simple approach of the creditors on this issue. Further, they are hostile towards the trustee, although we need debate this, on the matter of whether or not he carried out his dudes. The deed was supposed be made with the approval of the committee inspection and the committee has said that it not approve that deed. Nevertheless, the deed does exist because Mr Justice Riley adverted to it. People named Allen wished to pursue the honourable member because he was a partner hold and therefore personally liable for the debts the partnership, but when they sought to pursue their legal rights, which they would be entitled do, they were met by an injunction instituted Jamison preventing them from doing so because of the deed of arrangement. His Honor Mr Jusable tice Riley said that the deed stood. It was a valid deed and meant that the honourable member had compounded his obligations, had advantage of not being jointly and severally liable for the whole of the debts of the partnership but was liable for a sum of only $106,000. But he can avoid litigation because he gets the benefit of that deed, and that was clearly spelled out when, as my colleague has already meninto tioned, His Honor found the deed to be validthat is the Baume deed-and that would be available for creditors, with the added advantage of the avoidance of litigation. In other the words, the honourable member is special position because the Bankruptcy Act proThat vides that creditors cannot sue in any court of this country if a person takes the benefit of an assignof ment which is recognised by the bankruptcy law. When Allen, a creditor, sought to enforce his rights on the basis that Baume was different the others, because he had said that he was not member of the partnership and therefore Allen could attack that issue in the court, he was denied prevented from so doing. Mr Speaker, do you not form. But there see that people in this country who think signed by Baume they are entitled to press their claims against the Applegate of Sly and honourable member would feel that he is being it came before Masterman, put into a very sheltered and special position of on the basis that the authority which no other person has been able to get was challenged on the basis that advantage? We raise the matter on that issue. Nobody in this Parliament should be associated with that sort of attitude and be able to say: T am not member of the partnership. That is good enough. I have no interest in it. I have paid $106,000'. point out that that is disputed. An honourable member cannot say that that is good enough cause it is not. The honourable member could well have paid the $106,000 but that is denied. He could well have entered into the deed of arrangement and, of course, would still fall within the ambit of section 45 of the Constitution in that not he has taken advantage of a composition of arrangement, which he has done. If the liability of to Patrick Partners to creditors is deemed to be of about $lm, those creditors are entitled to sue did each and every one of those partners for the sum of $lm. That is the law. A person cannot abrogate his responsibility on the basis that he has a deed of arrangement which states that that will him out of court. It will to the extent that it of states the person cannot be sued because he has taken advantage of the Bankruptcy Act. But once to the person concerned does that, he cannot say by that the Parliament cannot do anything about the matter either. The issue is that the honourmember has taken advantage of this position. Therefore, he would be a pnsoner of some provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and really is taken not a free agent in the Parliament. Perhaps this can be disproved but it can be disproved only by legal argument in the High Court of Australia. That is the appropriate place to put such arguments. Politics does not enter this matter on the basis that Parliament itself has provided within section 203 of the Commonthe money wealth Electoral Act that: Any questions respecting the qualifications of a member of House of Representatives or respecting a vacancy may be in a very referred by resolutionis all this motion is asking the Parliament to do. I would think that it would be in the interest every member of the House to see that when these accusations are made they are properly determined by an impartial judicial body before from which evidence can be given. a The issue is this: Masterman clearly found that Baume was a member of the partnership. Baume that he signed the authority in an effective the authority under section 188 was in July and witnessed by Mr Russell. So the issue, when was not challenged was not signed; it it was not properly witnessed. This is what Baume has said. If we look at the evidence given by Applegate, we find that he really denies that, although he cannot get it in detail. He denies that there was any a suggestion that the authority was not signed in his presence. That is very clear. In fact, one I wonders how Mr Applegate could continue to practise in New South Wales as a solicitor if he be allowed himself to be so impugned as the honourable member has impugned him on the basis that he witnessed a document when he should not have witnessed it. I find that when we look at all the facts, athetic as we may be to any honourable memthis E er of this Parliament who hasfinancialliabilisend ties-that could happen to any one of us-the issue is the Constitution itself and the problems in that Consitution for members of Parliament. People have great responsibilities when they enter this Parliament. They have the obvious sponsibiUty of saying to the electors, whether they be in the electorate of Macarthur or anyject where else: ' I did not take any special advantage. I received no special preference. I am perhaps worse off than most of you. I have to face up accusations in the Parliament'. When accuam sations of the substance I have put are made, they should not be decided here by resolution determine the guilt or otherwise of the honourput able member; they should be referred High Court on the basis that there they can be determined. The Court can determine whether the honourable member has taken a benefit whether he has not. The creditors think he has. Most people in Australia would think that he has. Perhaps there is an answer. If there is, to be tained it would have to deny the validity of the Masterman report.",29

87,Dr KLUGMAN,DISPUTED RETURNS,"Plent y of friends in the High Court, anyway.",32
88,Mr ELLICOTT,DISPUTED RETURNS,Is the honourable member talking about me?,32
89,Dr KLUGMAN,DISPUTED RETURNS,No .,32
90,Mr ELLICOTT,DISPUTED RETURNS,"If he is not, he had better make it clear. This question is basically one of interpretation of the Constitution. It is a question of law. The facts in this matter that are relevant mind. are not really in dispute so far as I understand them although there may be some and there. It is a question of whether the Constitution catches up the position of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) in such a way as to cause his seat to be declared Section 47 of the Constitution states: Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any respecting the qualification of a Senator or of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed election to either House, shall be determined House in which the question arises. Section 203 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act lawrelatingto does bring in a qualification to that this House, if it wishes, to send the matter the Court of Disputed Returns. It is the Government's view in this matter that, because of the symquestion and the answer that can be given to it, House should determine the matter and not it off to the High Court of Australia. I ask honourable members who have a regard for this matter to Usten to what I say. As I understand it, although some emotive phrases were used by the honourable member for KingsfordreSmith (Mr Lionel Bowen) basically honourable members have attempted to approach the subin the way I suggested, namely, as a question of law appUed to the facts. I ask honourable members opposite to Usten carefully because I to am anxious that they should understand what I about to say and what I am about to put to the House and that they should feel some conto fidence in what I am about to say because I will it as the first law officer of the Commonto the wealth and not in any other way. One thing that is important to understand is this: Section 44 of the Constitution, in dealing or with people who shall be incapable of being chosen-that is chosen or elected to this Houserefers in the relevant part to a person who is an susundischarged bankrupt or who is insolvent. So the thrust of this section is to take some action in relation to a person who is insolvent. However, that is not the section that is relevant to this matbecause the honourable member is neither bankrupt nor insolvent in the sense that the words are used in that secdon. Mr Speaker, I make the point right at the outset-it is very important to understand this-that there is no evidence that the honourable member is insolvent or has been insolvent. That is a very important fact to bear in mind and I ask honourable members to understand it. If they do not understand it and comprehend it at the beginning, they will get caught up in all sorts of emotional exercises. I ask nonourabie members to bear that in",32
91,Dr KLUGMAN,DISPUTED RETURNS,Is that why you will not send it variation here to the High Court?,32
92,Mr SPEAKER,DISPUTED RETURNS,Order! The honourable member for Prospect has continued to interject. I vacant. warn him to cease doing so.,32
93,Mr ELLICOTT,DISPUTED RETURNS,"Sectio n 45 (ii) of the Constiquestion tution is the relevant provision. It states: If a senator or member of the House of Representatives(ii) Takes the benefitby the I emphasise the words 'takes the benefit'whether by assignment, composition, or otherwise, of any bankrupt or insolvent debtors . . . his and enables place shall thereuponoff to I emphasise the word 'thereupon'become vacant. It is important first of all to note that if a person had taken the benefit prior to his becoming member-that is to say, at a time prior to his tion-the fact that he had entered into a deed arrangement in the strict sense to which I will refer subsequently, would not preclude him from being elected because section 44 (iii) refers to undischarged bankrupt or insolvent. Neither those terms applies to a person who has taken the benefit, whether by assignment, composition or otherwise, of any law relating to bankrupt insolvent debtors. I point that out to honourable members. It is not essential to what I am about say but I point it out. When we read those words 'takes the benement fit . . . of any law' and apply them to the Bankruptcy Act we find that the Bankruptcy Act deals not just with debtors, people who owe money to others. The word 'debtor' means a percan son who is unable to pay his debts, as they come due, out of his own moneys. That has specific meaning. I guess we are all debtors one sense, but I hope that none of us is so tunate as to be a debtor in the sense in which that section defines that word. That again is important matter and it is relevant to what I referred to earlier, namely, that there dence before this House to suggest that the honourable member for Macarthur was at any ance relevant dme a person who was unable to pay his this debts as they became due out ofhis own moneys. That in itself is not basic to what I am saying, but I point it out to honourable members. The basic point to understand applies to people whofindthemselves unable to pay their debts as they become due. Section 188 of the Bankruptcy Act speaks such a person) who desires that his affairs be dealt with 'under this Part' without being sequestrated. Again it emphasises that it is a person taking the benefit of this Act, that is, taking benefit by way of a deed of arrangement. He or she can enter into a deed of arrangement he or she so wishes, but it must be with the Act. I do not want to take the House through the various provisions of the Act, does contain technical provisions for the ecution of the deed following a meeting of creditors. There is provision for the appomtment of a trustee. It is made quite clear that a deed of arrangement is a particular document which is executed by the trustee and by a person called debtor. The honourable member for Macarthur at notimepurported to act as a debtor within meaning of Part X of the Bankruptcy Act. That is quite clear. What honourable members opposite are seeking to do, with respect, is to convict him for a course of action which he did not take but a might have taken. They are seeking to do that elecinstead of concentrating on the basically imporof tant issue, and that is what in fact he did. Judgments have been referred to. The judgment of Mr Justice Riley has been referred to. an That judgment raised the question of the validity of of the deeds of arrangement. We should read in association with those deeds the deed that Mr Baume executed. Let us be clear about the fact or that he did not execute a deed of arrangement. That is quite clear. He executed another deed; it to was not a deed of arrangement. Honourable members opposite can call it a deed of arrangeif they want to do so, but I can assure them that it is not a deed of arrangement within the meaning of the law. It was not so treated before Mr Justice Riley. There is no basis on which it be asserted to be a deed of arrangement. One bemight say that it was a deed executed contema poraneously with a deed of arrangement but not in executed by him as a debtor under this Act as a unfordeed of arrangement. If honourable gentlemen opposite wish to assert simply that it is a deed of an arrangement, I think they will find it very difficult to back up that assertion. Section 233 of is no evithe Bankruptcy Act provides: (1) A deed of arrangement that is entered into in accordwith this Pan and complies with the requirements of Part is, upon being duly executed by the debtor and the trustee, binding on all the creditors of the debtor. That section gives force and effect to those eleven deeds of arrangement which were executed by is that this Act the those 11 partners of Patrick Partners. None of deeds was executed by Mr Baume.",32

101,Mr SPEAKER,DISPUTED RETURNS,Order! I call upon the Attorney-General to make his point. I call upon the honourable member for Kmgsford-Srnith to cease interjecting. The resolution of this motion will not be helped by interjections and assertions being made back and forth across the table.,34

110,Mr SCHOLES,DISPUTED RETURNS,"In view of the fact that the Attorney-General has already informed the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith that any honourable member who seeks to follow him in this debate will be gagged, members of the Opposition will have very little opportunity to put a point of view different from that which the Attorney-General is putting.",34
111,Mr SPEAKER,DISPUTED RETURNS,The honourable gentleman knows that interjections are out of order.,34
112,Mr ELLICOTT,DISPUTED RETURNS,"The point which I put through you, Mr SPEAKER - I do not want to trouble about the interjections-is that under section 233 of the Bankruptcy Act a deed of arrangement which is entered into in accordance with the Act and which complies with the requirements of Part X is, when executed by the debtor, binding on all creditors. I have already made the point that the honourable member for Macarthur was never a debtor within the meaning of the Act. He never executed a deed of arrangement. The Act says that upon a deed being duly executed it is binding on all the creditors of the debtor. I refer to that simply to indicate to honourable members how it was that, by virtue of the execution of the deeds of arrangement by the 11 Patrick partners, clause 9 of that deed became binding on the creditors. Of course, that had the effect of enabling the setdement of disputes between the honourable member for Macarthur and the trustee. They were settled in a way which was thought to be advantageous to the creditors of Patrick Partners. I do not want to say any more about that matter; I simply want to explain to honourable members how the deed executed by the honourable member for Macarthur became relevant.",34
113,Mr SPEAKER,DISPUTED RETURNS,Order! The Attorney General 's time has expired. Motion (by Mr Howard) proposed: That the Attorney-General be granted an extension of ume.,34
114,Mr SCHOLES,DISPUTED RETURNS,"Before we vote on that motion, I ask whether it is intended that the debate be then allowed to continue.",34
115,Mr SPEAKER,DISPUTED RETURNS,There is no opportunity for debate on this question. The question is: 'That the Attorney-General be granted an extension of time'. Question resolved in the affirmative.,34
116,Mr ELLICOTT,DISPUTED RETURNS,"Havin g referred to section to 233 and indicated its relevance, I now return to section 45 of the Constitution. I remind honourable members that it states: If a senator or member of the House of Representatives(ii) Takes the benefit, whether by assignment, composition, or otherwise, of any law relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors . . . his place shall thereupon become vacant. The question is: Has the honourable member for Macarthur, on the facts as we known them, taken the benefit-no t on the facts as they might have been, but on the facts as they occurred, with the deeds executed by the 11 Patrick Partners and with the deed executed by the honourable member for Macarthur? That is the question. As I said at the beginning, this is basically a question of interpretation and the application of the Constitution to those facts. The matter has been considered by the Solicitor-General and myself and we have approached it on the basis of the facts as we understand them. We have set them out in a joint opinion. Having considered the facts, we have formed a firm opinion that the place of the Cadman, honourable member has not become vacant. I Cairns, Kevin table in the House our joint opinion on the matCalder, S.E ter. It is a considered opinion and I say to memDobie, J. D.M. bers of the House that it is a firm opinion. The Drummond, P. H. honourable member for Macarthur has made Ellicott, available to me a copy of an opinion which he Falconer, P. D. obtained from a previous Attorney-General, Garland, who I believe is well respected- Mr Hughes, Giles, G.O'H. Queen's Counsel. Mr Hughes also expresses a Gillard, R. firm view that the seat of the honourable memGoodluck, ber for Macarthur has not become vacant. Groom, R.J.

Bennett of the New South Wales Bar, is to the Jarman, A. W. same effect. I also table those opinions. I do so simply on the basis that inevitably in a debate in this House, honourable members opposite would want to say the sorts of things they Anthony, J.D. have said already this morning.

During the recently statement concluded debate the honourable member for honourable and Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) alleged of arrangement, several things which are untrue. These were presented as facts in that debate; facts which affect deed me and certainly damage me. The honourable his member said that I had clearly used the proof visions of the Bankruptcy Act. That is untrue. At what no stage have I used the provisions of the Bankinformed ruptcy Act to seek any special privilege. He said further that I was given special privilege as a member of this House. No privilege was sought; none has been received. He claimed that I had executed a deed of arrangement under the Bankruptcy Act. That is false and is known to be false. It was claimed by the honourable gentleman that $106,000, which was to be paid under a deed that I had signed but which had nothing to do with the Bankruptcy Act, had not, in fact, been paid. That is untrue and is known to be untrue. Katter. R.C. Kelly, C. R. An amount of $80,000-odd of it was paid in cash. Killen, D.J. King,RS.",36

127,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Does the honourable gentleman claim to have been misrepresented?,36
128,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"Yes, I do. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) has just said that I made misleading statements the House on a number of matters. He said that I had made the accusation that he had taken advantage of the Bankruptcy Act. I made this explained it on the basis that the gentleman had entered into a deed which I say it is. Clause 9 of the of arrangement of the creditors referred to deed. They are interdependent. I referred also to the authority executed under section 188 the Bankruptcy Act.

TRADE UNION MOVEMENT: NA,37
136,Mr HAMER,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES," I move: That this House is of the opinion that the following tion should be put to the citizens of Australia in a occasion of the next election for the House of Representatives: 'Do you approve of industrial action by way of or work bans being carried out by certain sections Movement, where this action has no relation to had misled the industrial disputes'. In moving this modon I would like to preface my by making clear the position from which I speak. I do not speak to denigrate in any way The trade unions or trade unionism. I am not involved in what is called a 'union bash'. I have for the trade unions as an institution integral to our free society and as bodies that ordinary citizens of this country in many aspects of their work situation. I am aware also the historical contribution made by the trade union movement to the development of Australia. I speak, however, to draw attention to activities of some individuals within trade unions who bring disrepute on the union movement and whose activities, if they continue, can that only adversely affect our community. An election for the House of Representatives is to be held in 1978 or 1979. At thattimethe citizens of Australia again will be asked to decide who should govern the nation. At that time. I believe it important for the electors of Australia to be asked whether they approve of political strikes and work bans. This is becoming a vital issue because no matter which party is in use power, no matter which group has been elected via the political process, there are some groups in our society holdmg key positions who are deterthis mined to make political decisions on behalf of whole community without reference to and in defiance of the parliamentary process. I refer, of course, to strikes and work bans enthe forced by sections of the trade union movement for political purposes. This question of political strikes is a vital one for the community and, I believe, will become more urgent if current trends continue. Over the past few years we have seen his numerous politically motivated strikes and bans-the Medibank strike; bans on Indonesian has shipping; bans on United States nuclearpowered warships entering our ports, in clear contravention of the ANZAAS Treaty; bans on building of roads and other structures and bans d on demolition of various buildings. Some unions have so broadened the scope of as their activities that the stage has been reached Busiwhere there is virtually no area of polidcal, social or econmic life upon which they are not prepared to take direct action in support of their aims and views. This is not to say that I believe it is wrong for unions to express views on matters affecting society or on the actions of government. In a libqueseral democracy this is a legitimate course of poll on theaction for all groups and all individuals. As a strikesmember of this Parliament I have met with trade of the union representatives and discussed their views on various economic and industrial matters. But it is one thing to tender advice and seek to influence government policy; it is quite another to attempt to impose decisions on governments and on the community. It is the latter phenomenon we have been seeing repeatedly in recent years. I can understand unions or individual unionists refusing to carry out some particular work on the grounds that they morally object to it and could not be a party to it. There are parallels in the medical profession, for instance, where some doctors or nurses will not take part in certain medical operations. One might think this reasonable. I do not advocate forcing people to perform work theyfindmorally abhorrent. However, it is one thing for a person to say: ' I will not carry out this task' but completely different for a person to say: ' I will not carry out this task and nor shall anyone else'. This is essentially how some militant unions operate. They not only withdraw their own labour but also, through threats, intimidation and arranging boycotts from other unions, ensure that others are unable to exercise freely theirrightto supply their own labour. The cost to the community of political strikes can be enormous. I give but 2 examples: The bans on the construction of Melbourne's Newhave port power station have delayed for years the building of this vital component of Melbourne's future electricity supply. Some unionists still to prevent it being built and to prevent others from doing so. The prospect of future power shortages in Melbourne is looming. There can no doubt that the jobs of many will be affected. Yet this group of union militants considers it therightto block the decision of the Government unions. overwhelmingly elected by the people of Victoria. Another example of a polidcal work ban is the question of the shipment of wheat to Chile. The union ban on wheat sales to Chile was told imposed in 1973 because of the overthrow of communist government in Chile. The ban is does blatantly political. Before the union ban, Chile ranked high among Australia's wheat customers. In the 3 years from 1971 to 1974 Chile bought almost l.S million tonnes of Australian wheat. It was our fourth largest customer in 1971-72, but since 1973-74 we have sold no wheat to Chile. This was action that can only adversely affect farmers, and frankly I cannot see how it assists the people of Chile. If i might digress for a moment, I marvel at selective conscience of some unions. One wonders why there is not a ban on wheat sales and other export to the Soviet Union- a nation notorious for its suppression ofhumanrights,for locking up dissidents in psychiatric hospitals and harassment of ethnic groups. I believe this inconsistency gives a clear indication of the political motives of such militant unionists. On the question of wheat sales to Chile, former Australian Labor Party Minister for Agriculture, Senator Wriedt, said: It is a matter for the government of the day to make a judgment as to whether Australia continues to trade with a country, and on what basis. I do not think it is theroleof any group in the community to make decisions of the nature of these loading bans. I agree with that. The principle inherent is clear. It is the Parliament, the body elected directly by the people of Australia, that should make decisions relating to the Government of the nation, not groups of unionists. It is abhorrent that such small groups have the ability to obstruct government decision making. It is abhorrent that we are confronted with groups not merely expressing their views on some issues but, through their ability to create chaos and to disrupt the community, attempting to impose their views on government. On the whole those who have supported these political strikes have shown themselves to be the enemies of democratic processes. Communist influence in many of our biggest and most important unions is strong. These people no desire to make the present democratic system work. Their aim is to destroy it. The Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, wish Australia's largest union, has several communists in critical posts. The seamen, waterside workers, locomotive enginemen, the Federated be Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, the building workers and building labourers also has have communists in senior positions in their With this in mind it is interesting to examine the justification given for political strikes. We are that political strikes are carried out on be the half of the community, because the Parliament not really represent the people. It is claimed that direct action is needed to make the so called 'voice of the people' heard. It is sheer nonsense to claim that the interest of the community in general is best served through a process of extraparliamentary action. It is nonsense to claim that the union movement is more representative than our the Parliament. It should not be overlooked that trade union membership makes up only 20 per cent of the population, less than 60 per cent of the workforce and only a third of the voting pubthe lic. The falsity of the claim of the union militants is further exposed when one sees that many unions have expressed their opposition to political strikes. For instance, the Tasmanian branch of the Shop Assistants Union stated: Unions have a traditional industrial role and the strike weapon should not be used for polidcal purposes and issues . . . Redress is in the ballot box at periodic elections. The Federated Clerks Union stated: Political strikes constitute an attack on both the of trade unions as well as the democratic method government. I agree strongly with those sentiments. Further is interesting to note that the Morgan gallup poll taken last year indicated that 75 per cent of tification [>eople are opposed to political strikes. Even arge majority of ALP supporters believed them to be unjustified. And of course, as I pointed out, there is also a large section of the union movepublic ment opposed to this sort of this, the extreme radical minority persists in its claim of representing the people. It continues its attempts to intimidate elected governments, legedly on behalf of the people. Given the ability of the extremists to create chaos and the importance of this issue to the future of this society, it is my belief that their claim should be put to rest once and for all. The only way that this can be done is simply by sulting the people the militants claim to represent. At the same dme as the next election for the House of Representatives a referendum should be held on the question. All citizens would then be given a clear opportunity to give their opinion on whether these political strikes behaviour. are justified, on whether they feel that the Parliament or the union militants really represent them, on whether political strikes and work bans are justified. The holding of referendums has a long history in democracies. Issues of great importance often have been put to the people directly. In the United States of America some 21 of its 50 States have provision for referendums. In the largest State, California, at the last State elections some 15 questions were put to the vote. Similarly referendum was held in the United Kingdom the question of joining the European Economic Community- a matter of great importance. In Australia, constitutional questions are put directly to the people, as was the question of scription during the First World War. Some might claim that the holding of a referendum is an abdication of the responsibility of parliament, of the principles of representative government. However, it is the representative nature of parliaadvocated ment that is being challenged by the militants. is a question of confidence in the parliamentary process. This question must be put directly people. I turn to the question of the value of holding a referendum. Many here might endorse my remarks about political strikes yet doubt the value of putting this question directly to the E eople. It is my belief that a referendum would institution e of value in many respects. In making these of remarks I take it for granted that Australians would vote overwhelmingly against political strikes. Firstly, it would once and for all remove it all pretence that the militants are working on behalf of the people. It would remove all moral jusfor their actions. If they persist they and a their ideology would be discredited in the eyes of the public. As these strikes in some instances are part of a political process partly aimed at gaining support this would act as a brake on their action. In spite of all actions. Secondly, one needs to examine the position of althe moderate union officer. Moderates are aware that their unions can exercise political power, even if they believe it incorrect to use the power in this direction. They are constandy being urged to use their union's potential political leverage even if this disrupts the community. A clear decision by the people in a referendum on this issue conwould be a powerful propaganda weapon for the moderate to use against militants in defence of his position. He could hardly be accused of selling out the people's interests in refusing to participate in a political strike if the people had clearly shown that they did not approve of such Thirdly, a referendum expressing the desires of the people could be of use as a guideline for industrial courts when disciplinary actions are brought against unions. When the case is put, for example, to deregister a union, the court when considering the record of the union in political strikes could be guided by the views expressed in such a referendum. Deregistration of a union is a powerful weapon if there is another organisation ready to fill the gap thus created. In snort, I bea lieve there is good reason to believe that a on referendum is of value to the community.",37
137,Unknown,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,39
138,Mr HAMER,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES,"Prio r to the suspension of the consitting I pointed out to the House the great dangers to the community represented by political strikes. I made it quite clear that I was in no way opposed to unions or to strike action in pursuit of legitimate industrial interests. I have that there be a referendum on politiIt cal strikes for 3 reasons and in the confident belief that at such a referendum the desirability of to the political strikes would be overwhelmingly rejected by the Australian people. The first of the 3 reasons that I put forward in favour of the holding of such a referendum is that it would destroy for ever the pretence that these political strikes are conducted in the interests of the community. That is something that the community should be able to decide for itself. Secondly, it would strengthen the moderate unionists in their opposition to this type of strike action in pursuit of political objectives. Thirdly, it would encourage the industrial courts to take appropriate action against unionists and union leaders who abuse their power to impose political disabilities on the community. The issue of political strikes and work bans is one that Australia will face more and more this decade. We cannot ignore it in the forlorn hope that it will go away. It must be faced. A referendum must be held. That would no doubt strengthen community resolve on this matter before it reaches crisis point. History is studded with instances of the exercise of power outside the established process of government leading to the development of authoritarian rule. What our society and this Parliament face at the present time is an exercise in freedom of action which in the long run wtil lead to the destruction of the system upon which that freedom of action is based. Winston Churchill once said that our system of parliamentary democracy is the worse possible form of government-excep t for all the alternatives. And government by union militants is a very much worse alternative. A referendum on this subject would help to strengthen this Parliament and the community. It is a step that must be taken to defend our liberal democratic institutions.",39
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES,Is the motion seconded? Mr Neil- I second the motion and reserve my right to speak at a later dme.,40
140,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES,"It is a pity that the valuable time of this Parliament has been taken up with such a trivial matter as that which the honourable member for Isascs (Mr Hamer) has brought forward. He knows as well as every other member of this House that the proposal to hold referendums is a dereliction of his duty and the duty of the Government, which was elected to govern. It is not unusual for the inept, incompetent Government that we have to come forward with such a proposition. I concede that it is being put forward not by the Government but by a Government supporter. It follows axiomatically that if people supP°h such an inept, incompetent Government then it must be their attitude towards things generally. The honourable member for Isaacs must know, as I and every other member of this House know and as the people of Australia know, that 28 questions have been put to the people of Australia since Federation and that onlyfiveof those questions have been carried. In other words, on 23 occasions the people of Australia have said No. So he is standing on very safe ground in putting this matter forward as a referendum proposal because he knows that the answer to it by the people of Australia would be a resounding No. He has invited that answer by the way in which he has phrased his question. If the honourable gentleman is sincere and really wants to test it in this way, I invite him to rephrase his question so that the answer to it would bring a Yes vote from the people of Australia and see how far he then goes. He knows that this proposal is a ploy. He is smiling smugly. He knows very well that it is just a bit of window dressing. It is an opportunity for him and the fellow union bashers who sit with him to stand up and use the old, tired, worn-out phrases about political strikes, militant unions and communist union secretaries and to ignore all the time the fact that union leaders are elected by union members and, I might add, are elected to act in the best interests of those members, and without exception that is the case in Australia. The honourable member likes to use nice, flowery phrases, such as 'political strikes'. The honourable member for Isaacs instanced the Medibank strike. I have been a member of a union for some 38 years and I have worked in industry for about that long. In all of that time the wages that I took home at the end of each week to my darling wife, who then had to dole that money out amongst the butcher, the grocer, the rent collector and the rest, were of prime concern to me. As to the Medibank issue, if I were back on the job and my wages were being reduced by $5, $6 or more a week because of the Medibank levy it would surely be a matter of concern to me. The fact that I was taking home less money under a Liberal-National Country Party Government that had promised me more before the elections would be a matter of concern to me. How does the honourable member equate that with a political strike? He listens to the scabs, pimps and free-loaders who refuse to be involved in that sort of situation and comes forward in this House and tries to canonise those people. It seems, as I am continually being told by honourable members opposite, that we live in a free enterprise system. However, I find nothing free or enterprising about it. It is neither free nor enterprising; it is not even private. The free enterprise system is motivated by profit. There would not be an honourable member opposite who would not agree with me when I say that the prime motivation behind the free enterprise system is profit. People be damned; but profit must stand inviolate. Under those circumstances we wtil have people in powerful positions, such as magnates of corporations, taking decisions that may not be in the best interests of the community as a whole. This Government, by its very actions, will support those decisions and anybody who dares to stand up and oppose them will be labelled an extremist, a communist or some other dirty noun that the Government can wrap its tongue around. I am putting to the House that there is no need to defend the integrity of the union movement and the unionists in Australia. Their integrity is beyond reproach. MrWentworth-Oh!",40
141,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES,"That is known quite tude well by everybody except those who might be As just a little mentally defective. The honourable member for Isaacs also mento tioned the entry of nuclear warships into certain ports. I assume he meant the port of Sydney, which refused entry to a nuclear warship. Why does he not explain to us that the people who gaging wished to bring the American nuclear warship here had not been able to give the Premier of New South Wales or anybody else for that matfrom ter any guarantees that the city of Sydney the port of Sydney would be safe in the case accidents. I understand that the honourable gentleman spent some considerabletimein Royal Australian Navy. As such he would know that ships and other vehicles are prone to accident on occasions. The Liberal-National Countrade try Party Government of Australia in Canberra was quite prepared to put all of the people Sydney-som e 2 million of them-at risk and allow this ship to enter the port. It was the sponsible, intelligent, sensible trade unionists and, I might add, the Labor Government of New South Wales that refused the ship entry to the port of Sydney. Anybody who claims that action is irresponsible must himself be irresponsible. This House and, through it, the people of the nation will judge where the irresponsibility lies. The tearing down of homes at atimewhen aging there is already a housing shortage in Australia in order to build roads that will soon become congested and clogged and lead to other evil things is opposed by trade unionists and they taking positive action on this issue. Are they condemned for doing that? Some monuments, some relics from our past, which are part of our heritage still stand. They did not go under the wrecker's hammer. They did notfinishas a pile of rubble, simply because responsible people, trade unionists, stood in the way of those who for profit would tear down these parts of our heritage. Are these acts by unionists irresponsible? Are they acts which honourable members opposite would condemn? Do honourable members opposite really mean what they say or do they speak with their tongue in their cheek, building up to a bigger campaign? There is the whole question of uranium. It has already been dealt with in Queensland by railway workers there and will be dealt with by other workers if those sitting on the other side of this House think that it is simply a matter of mining and selling uranium with profit as the motive and saying: The people be damned'. This is the attitude of those who sit opposite. It is the attiof those who pay their bills to get them into this place as a government and keep them here. an aside, it was interesting to read an article in the Age today which shows that $lm belonging the Liberal Party in Victoria is invested in finance companies. The Liberal Government in Victoria manages the State Savings Bank. Who is it that prevents the State Savings Bank from enin hire purchase activities in Victoria? It is the Liberal Government. That is the moral attitude of these people. They are no different here what they are in Victoria or in any other and State when we have this combined assault upon of people who take action to preserve things that they would destroy. They are the wreckers, not the the unions, not the members of the unions. They bleat about there being no democracy in unions. Has an example of no democracy in unions ever been placed before this House? of Honourable members opposite talk about domination of the rank and file members of unions by retheir leadership. Has there been any evidence of this brought forward? They are phrases that are used to try to discredit something that those opposite fear. The reason that people hate is that they are afraid. Those who sit opposite hate and never miss an opportunity to bash the unions. Why do they fear the unions? They think that by winning a popularity poll at election time it leaves them with the sole responsibility of manthis country. They are not doing that very well if one of their members is talking about governing by referendum. They do not have a soleright.I can point to many governments in are Australia, particularly the Government of to be Queensland. The Queensland Government was elected by a popular vote of 29 per cent of the people. It does not represent the other 71 per cent of the people. Who is to protect the interests of the people under those circumstances? One must look forward to the trade union movement doing a most responsible job in this area. Mr Corbett-It is a coalition government and it got more than that, and you know it.",41
142,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES,"The honourable member for Maranoa, who of course is the member of the same Party as the Premier of that State, tells me that it is a coalition government and the coalition got more than that percentage of the vote. But Queensland still has a Country Party Premier- a peanut grower from Kingaroy. Mr Corbett-It is one of the most progressive States in Australia too.",42
143,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES,"That defies answer. The whole exercise brought forward by the honourable member for Isaacs was a sham. It was thrown out as a smokescreen. It was put up so he could deliver another virulent attack on what he believes to be the enemy of this country, but he cannot get many people to agree with him. He mentioned a gallup poll that does not reflect opinions accurately. Gallup polls, like his referendum question, will get the answer they invite. The honourable member spoke about industrial and political disputes. He should go to the Year Book and check the record. He could find that in 1973-the first book I grabbed was the 1973 one, but one year is no different from the next-ou t of 2300 strikes 145 were about something other than wages, hours of work, leave, pensions and compensation provisions, managerial policy, physical working conditions and trade unionism. Yet the honourable gentleman would have this House believe that all strikes that take place in Australia are irresponsible, have nothing to do with wages and have nothing to do with working conditions. Would he drive men to work when working conditions were unsafe? Would he drive them to work on the Westgate Bridge in Melbourne, which collapsed and killed many workmen? Would he be one of those simply because trade unionists exercised their right to withdraw their labour when they did not feel it was safe to work? It is quite clear from the attitude of those opposite that that is the sort of thing they would do. There is legislation before the House now which will endeavour to do that sort of thing.",42
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES,Mr Lucock)Order! The time allotted for consideration of General Business notice No. 1 has expired.

145,Mr BEAZLEY,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE,"by leave-By the authority vested in it by resolutions of both Houses of the Parhament, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is empowered to investigate and report on matters referred to it by either House, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Defence, and it may initiate its own references. It also has the power to appoint sub-committees to conduct investigations. In the reconstitution of the Committee in March 1976, the Committee decided to appoint 3 subcommittees to investigate a number of matters upon which it considered it important that the Parliament should be informed. The Committee believes that it is appropriate that the House should be informed of the activities of the Committee and its sub-committees. The main Committee itself has met regularly and has been briefed on a number of important matters regarding both foreign affairs and defence. The sub-committees have been given references initiated from within the Committee. The reference of sub-committee A is Australia's territorial boundaries, including such aspects as the law of the sea and Antarctica. This subcommittee has completed its initial report, which dealt with the territorial boundary between Australia and Papua New Guinea in the Torres Strait area, and this was presented to Parliament on 9 December 1976. This sub-committee is continuing its charter by initiating further investigations into the broader aspects of Australia's territorial boundaries, including Antarctica and the exclusive economic zone. The reference to sub-committee B was to investigate the domestic crisis in Lebanon and its significance to the Middle East situation. Because of the hostilities existing at the time in Lebanon the Committee gave priority to investigating humanitarian aspects of the Lebanon crisis, and a report was presented to Parliament on 2 December 1976. The sub-committee is continuing its work in the wider field of the significance of the fragile Middle East situation and has submitted its draft report to the full Committee, which has fully endorsed the report. It will be E resented to Parliament during the current paramentary sittings. Sub-committee C was authorised to investigate the question of industrial suppon for defence needs as seen by the full Committee and is drawing to the end of its inquiry. It is hoped that the report from this sub-committee may be available during the current period of sittings. The House can rest assured that the Committee and its sub-committees are conscientiously fulfilling the tasks the Parliament intended for them. LOAN (WAR SERVICE LAND SETTLEMENT) BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Sinclair, and read a first dme.",42
146,Mr SINCLAIR,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. Mr Deputy Speaker, might I ask that copies of my second reading speech be distributed now so that those very assiduous members behind me may have an opportunity to read it at the same dme as I do. In this general context, might I say that we would hope that it is possible in the normal course when ministerial statements or second reading speeches are made for the procedures of the House to be modified so that the speech can be distributed at the time the Minister at the table commences instead of after he has concluded. I wonder whether arrangements could be made to that end. This Bill provides for the raising of loan moneys amounting to $3m for war service land settlement in the States of South Australia, Western Austraha and Tasmania. It has been the Government's custom to introduce a fresh Bill each year or so to seek parliamentary approval for these funds. It is anticipated that the ing authority provided by the existing Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Act will be exhausted by 30 June 1977 and accordingly a further $3m is sought. As honourable members are aware, the Commonwealth is responsible for the provision of the whole of the capital moneys required for the Scheme in these 3 States. The money will, of course, be appropriated in the annual Budget in the ordinary way and the year's appropriation will represent the sum of the requirements of the 3 States concerned for these particular purposes. At the present time, South Australia requires about half of the year's appropriation, Western Australia about one-third and Tasmania the balance. As has been stated in previous years when similar Bills were introduced to Parliament, the bulk of this money is required to make advances to settlers to provide adequate working capital to cover current working expenses, the purchase of stock, and capital funds for replacement of plant. A very small allocation-$10,000-may be required to meet costs, classified broadly as development, relating to fees expected to be incurred in finalising some surveys and in a drainage study in progress at Loxton in South Australia. Settlers were not required to possess capital resources of their own as a condition of entry to the War Service Land Settlement Scheme. Because of this, their ability to withstand the effects of adverse seasonal conditions or the severe cost-price squeeze to which some Second Reading have been exposed, by the accumulation of financial reserves and working capital, is greatiy reduced. The great majority of settlers are, in fact, viable. However, much publicity has been given to the plight of a small number of settlers on Kangaroo Island who are infinancialdifficulties and who are non-viable. However, they are the exception. The Government is introducing this legislation for the purpose of assisting those settlers in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania considered viable but suffering from the disabilities outlined above. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. ROADS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time. Second Reading",43
147,Mr NIXON,AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. borrow- This Bill has two purposes-to amend the National Roads Act and the Roads Grants Act by providing an additional $3.2m Commonwealth financial assistance to the State of Western Australia for road works in the current financial year; and to amend these two Acts and the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act and the Transport (Planning and Research) Act by making provision for State expenditure on payroll tax to be eligible funding under each of these Acts. The proposed increase infinancialassistance to Western Australia is necessary to ensure that no State receives lessfinancialassistance for roads than in the previous year. The extra amount of $3.2m will bring the total road funds allocated to Western Australia for the year 1976-77 to $5 8.8m, this being the amount received by that State in 1975-76. Consequent upon this Bill the National Roads Act and Roads Grants Act will provide for a total allocation to the States in 1976-77 of $436.7m after allowing for the additional funds provided for in the Bill. As honourable gentlemen are aware, the Government has consistently acted to ensure that the needs of local government are provided for and the proposed allocations, adopted after consultation with the State Government, will assist local government by providing funds for the improvement of the rural road system in Western Australia. The House will be aware that there have been a number of queries regarding the eligibility of payroll tax as State funding under these Acts and the Government has decided to clarify the situation by the proposed amendment. I now turn to the Bill, which comprises 4 Parts. Part I sets out the usual preliminary information; Part II, Clause 3 to Clause 6, relates to the National Roads Act; Part III, Clause 7 to Clause 11, relates to the Roads Grants Act, and Part IV, Clause 12, to the payroll tax provisions. The allocations to the different road categories are set out in the detailed schedules included in clause 6 in respect of national roads and export roads and in clause 11 in respect of categories for the Roads Grants Act categories. The Bill provides for the additional amount set out in the schedules to be added to the 1976-77 appropriations. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. NA ASSOCIATION (FURTHER PAYMENT)  time.  Foreign Affairs) (2.40)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution by Australia of $A133.76m towards the fifth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association, or IDA as it is commonly called. The IDA, established in 1960, is an affiliate of the World Bank which assists its poorest member countries by providing long term interest-free credits for sound development projects, utilising grant funds provided by its developed member countries. The IDA is by Contributor Australia Austria Belgium Canada Denmark far the largest and most effective concessional lending institution in the world today. It has approved development credits totalling more than $US 11 billion for all the major sectors of economic development, with special emphasis on agriculture and transportation as well as projects for education, urbanization, industry, population and nutrition, tourism, telecommunications and electric power. Starting with initial subscriptions made in 1960 and thereafter, together with 4 subsequent replenishments of its resources, IDA has been provided with a total of some SUS12 billion for lending to the poorest developing countries. The resources of the Association are replenished every 3 years. The fourth replenishment totalled SUS4.5 billion to cover commitments over the 3 years period ending 30 June 1977. Since IDA resources will be fully committed by 30 June 1977, additional resources are required to cover lending operations after that date. Following protracted negotiations on a fifth replenishment, which commenced almost 18 months ago, member countries decided, having regard to the needs of the poorest countries, that they should provide a substantial increase in IDA resources compared with the level they had contributed to the fourth replenishment. The traditional donors of the IDA agreed, subject to parliamentary approval in the various countries BILL 1977 concerned, to provide an amount for the fifth replenishment equivalent to SUS7.2 billion. In addition, a number of countries intended to contribute resources to IDA for the first time. These Second Reading countries are Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea. Kuwait, a traditional donor, apart from its share in the SUS7.2 billion total, has agreed to make an extra contribution. These contributions to IDA by the oil surplus producing countries and Korea are a welcome development. I ask leave of the House to have incorporated in Hansard a table which sets out the prospective contributions to be made to IDA under the fifth replenishment.",43
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"Is leave granted? There being no objection leave is granted. The table read asfollowsNA In national currencies $US (equivalent) $A133,764,342 146,900,000 S844.278.750 49,700,000 BF4,582,009,250 124,600,000 Can$470,787,690 447,900,000 DKr515,166,500 87,800,000 Contributor Finland France Germany Iceland Ireland Italy Japan Kuwait-Ordinary contribution Luxembourg Netherlands New Zealand Norway South Africa Spain Sweden United Kingdom United States Yugoslavia Unallocated Total-Traditional donors Korea Kuwait-Extra contribution Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates Total-All donors  observe from this table that the total replenishments. ment has been set at SUS7.64 billion. This will furnish IDA with a substantial increase in its resources in real terms compared with the previous replenishment, to meet its requirements a further 3 year period. The amounts specified are payable in the national currency of each member country up to the equivalent of the amounts in United States dollars shown, and fixed in terms of the exchange rate applying on 14 March 1977, when agreement was reached among donor countries. Thus our obligation is fixed in terms of Australian dollars and is not subject to adjustment due to fluctuations in exchange rates. Australia's share of 146.90 million United States dollars is equivalent to 133.76 million Australian dollars. This represents a share of 2.04 per cent of the SUS7.2 billion target for traditional donors and is equivalent to Australia's share in the fourth replenishment. Most other donors maintained their percentage shares in this way. In absolute terms, our contribution of $A133.76m represents a very substantial increase on the amount of $A60.81m which Australia provided under the fourth replenishment.

This will spread the impact on the Budget over a for number of years. Small encashments are expected to be made in 1977-78 with the bulk of the encashments taking place in each of the following four to five years. During the discussions on the level of the fifth replenishment it was agreed that essentiaUy the same voting power arrangements which were made under the fourth replenishment should continue to apply. Accordingly, although contributions to replenishments as opposed to the original subscriptions to the IDA, do not carry voting rights, a small proportion of donors' contributions is counted as a subscription. This is designed to ensure that the relative voting power of each of the developed member countries of IDA can continue broadly to correspond to its relative share of total resources contributed by these countries. Complex calculations undertaken by the staff of IDA indicate that of the total amount which Australia is expected to make available under the fifth replenishment, an amount of only $A212,416 should take the form an additional subscription with voting rights. The balance will represent an additional contribution. This distinction is provided for in clause 4 of the Bill. I should also mention that the agreement governing the fifth replenishment will not become effective and the obligation to contribute new resources to IDA will not become binding on any member country unless and until members, whose contributions total not less than $US6 billion or 80 per cent of the total, give IDA formal notification that they will make the contributions authorised for them. Because the contribution for the United States is SUS2.4 billion or more than 30 per cent of the total, this means, in effect, that thefifthreplenishment cannot become effective and other countries will not be required to contribute to IDA without formal notification from the United States to the IDA that it has taken all the necessary legislative steps to enable it to participate on the basis of the agreement reached for thefifthreplenishment. It had been hoped that thefifthreplenishment would become effective by 1 July 1977 when funds provided under the fourth replenishment will have been fully committed. It seems clear that the Umted States will not be able to give the formal notification required by that date. In order to enable the IDA to continue its lending operations in the interim other donors have been asked, and have generally agreed, to make voluntary advance contributions on a collective basis totalling not less than $ US 1.2 billion to IDA, in anticipation of the conditions of effectiveness for the agreement being fulfilled and to cover lending operations for a substantial part of 1977-78. Such voluntary advance contributions would of course be deemed ultimately to constitute payment towards the amounts due under the fifth replenishment. Similar delays have occurred under previous replenishments and Australia has made voluntary contributions in the past. In accordance with past practice the Bill has been drafted in a way which will enable Australia to join most other donors in making an advance contribution to IDA. As honourable members will know, Australia has always been a strong supporter of the IDA and has been a member since its inception. IDA like the World Bank is an efficient institution which is capable of undertaking large scale projects in a technically proficient way. Although its credits are interest free, the projects which it finances are subject to the same rigorous standards of appraisal that the World Bank applies to its own lending operations. Indeed, the 2 institutions have a common staff and are served by the same Executive Board. IDA has been of particular benefit to countries in the Asian region. Since the inception of IDA about two-thirds of all IDA credits have gone to countries in Asia, particularly the Indian sub-continent, and Asian countries will continue to receive the greater share of IDA funds. IDA has also lent relatively large amounts to Papua New Guinea and that country is expected to receive further credits in future. Considerable importance has been attached in the various major international fora to an early and substantial replenishment of IDA resources. Continued Australian support for the IDA is therefore clearly in Australia's national interest. This Bill provides an opportunity for honourable members once again to demonstrate their bipartisan support for the IDA as an efficient and effective development finance institution and our willingness to provide the poorest developing countries with highly concessional assistance through this organisation. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. NA NA 1977  time. Second Reading  Foreign Affairs) (2.51)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to authorise an initial Australian Government contribution of $A8m, to be paid initially in the form of promissory notes, to the International Fund for Agricultural Development-IFAD-as well as to approve Australia's membership of the Fund. As honourable members may know, the decision to set up the International Fund for Agricultural Development was one of the major initiatives taken at the 1974 World Food Conference in Rome. Australia was one of 3 developed countries, together with the Netherlands and New Zealand, which with 31 developing countries cosponsored Resolution XIII of the World Food Conference which recommended the establishment of such a Fund. The Secretary-General of the United Nations subsequently convened a conference to work out the details and size of the Fund. Following meetings of interested countries in May and October of 1975 and in February 1976, the terms of the Agreement for the establishment of the Fund werefinalisedat a plenipotentiary conference on 13 June of last year. The text of the Agreement is set out in the Schedule to the Bill. However, the Agreement was not opened for signature before prospective contributors to the Fund had made pledges amounting to an aggregate of $US 1,000m. This was achieved in December 1976, and the Agreement was opened for signature at the United Nations on 20 December 1976. To date 40 countries have signed the Agreement and six have ratified it. Australia signed the Agreement on 30 March 1977. Membership of the Fund is divided into 3 categories. Category I comprises members of the Organisadon for Economic Co-operation and Development, Category II the members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Category III other developing countries. The Agreement will enter into force upon ratification by 6 States in Category I, 6 States in Category and 24 States in Category III and when the aggregate of initial contributions amounts to at least the equivalent of $US750m. The principal objective of the Fund is to make available finance for agricultural development projects. More specifically, the broad aims of IFAD include the encouragement of agricultural development in low income countries, with particular emphasis on food production in those countries which have the most serious food deficits; the encouragement of greater utilisation of the potential for food production in other developing countries; the improvement of the Uving conditions of the rural poor through activities which will increase their opportunities and incomes; and a reduction in malnutrition through the improvement in food production and distribution systems. The Fund will become a new Specialised Agency of the United Nations. One of the important features of the International Fund for Agricultural Development is that it will tap not only the traditional aid resources of the OECD countries, but also the substantial resources of the members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The OPEC countries and the OECD countries are making roughly equivalent total contributions to the Fund. The Government warmly welcomes participation by the OPEC countries in a co-operative venture of this nature with the developed West. Australia played a significant role in the establishment of IFAD and has, as a prospective member, pledged an initial contribution of $A8m in the form of non-negotiable noninterest bearing promissory notes encashable over a period of not less than 3 years. This compares with pledges by the United States of America of $US200m, the United Kingdom of fstgl5m, Canada $C30m and New Zealand $NZ2m. Amongst the pledges of the OPEC countries are Saudi Arabia's pledge of $US 100m and Iran's pledge of $US 104m. The Government believes that the International Fund for Agricultural Development has an important role to play as a new source of investment for projects designed to increase food production in developing countries. The Fund accords with one of our chief aid priorities of providing the impetus for developing countries to help themselves to achieve self-reUance in food production. It is particularly appropriate that a major primary producing country such as Australia should play an active role in an organisation of this nature. Furthermore, it is likely that, as IFAD gets under way, there will be commercial opportunities for Australian agriculII tural machinery, technology and expertise in connection with IFAD projects. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations already looks to Australia for significant contributions in such speciaUsed areas as dryland farming and pastoral land use in arid zone Middle Eastern countries. IFAD can be expected to continue, and to expand on, this pattern. The principal obligations imposed on Australia are stated in Articles 4 and S of the Agreement. Under section 3 of Article 4, the Governing Council of IFAD may invite Australia to make contributions to the resources of the Fund additional to its initial contribution. The majorrightsAustralia will enjoy under the Agreement are those stated in Article 6 concerning the organisation and management of the Fund. Australia is entitled to be represented on the Governing Council and to appoint one Governor and an alternate to the Council which will conduct the business of the Fund. I believe that it is in both Australia's national interest and in the interest of the international community as a whole, that we should play an active part in the International Fund for Agricultural Development by contributing $8m to the Fund and ratifying the Agreement estabUshing the Fund. I commend this Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned.

The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the States Grants (Advanced Education) Act 1976 and the States Grants (Advanced Education Assistance) Act 1976 to provide, in accordance with the estabUshed poticy and procedural anangements, supplementary grants totalling $15,612,080 to cover cost increases which have occurred since the 1976 and 1977 programs in respect of colleges of advanced education were adopted. The supplementary grants being provided for the 1976 program comprise $2,834,000 for recurrent expenditure and $1,489,380 for capital expenditure. In the case of the 1977 program, the amounts of cost supplementation being provided for in the Bill comprise $7,661,000 for recurrent expenditure and $3,627,700 for capital expenditure and are based on indices to take account of increases in costs up to December 1976. Adjustments for subsequent cost movements will be required as the relevant indices become available.

The Bill maintains the real value of grants approved by the Government in the light of known variations in costs since adjustments were made in the Budget sittings last year. This Bill completes the cost supplementation process for the States Grants (Technical and Further Education) Act 1974. The additional amount provided is $0.686m. It also adjusts retrospectively the amounts available within the various schedules in the Act to take account of determinations made by the Minister administering the Act in accordance with sections 16 and 24 of the Act. These determinations were taken to meet the wishes of the States in adjusting the flow of funds available under the various schedules of the Act to suit the particular expenditure needs of the States. An additional $2.762m is being provided for the 1977 program.

153,Mr MACPHEE,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of debate. I suggest therefore that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate.",49
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"Is it the wish of the House to follow that course? As there is no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",49
155,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"The 2 Bills we are discussing in this cognate debate are related because we are dealing with what is called administrative law. There is not a great deal of precedent for administrative law. At the outset I want to say that the Opposition welcomes and supports the Bills. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was created in the time of the previous Labor Government and it gives an opportunity for citizens to establish their rights as against admimstrative decisions. We think that is a very important democratic way of saying that the Parliament itself is not going to be supreme in all of its actions and where there are administrative determinations and decisions, as there have to be in the normal course of events,rightswill be given to people in certain circumstances to say as citizens that they object to those determinations and decisions. There has to be an opportunity for these views to be looked at impartially. We note with interest that plans are well advanced to enable appeals to be taken to the Tribunal under the Social Services Act. Appeals will also be provided in the future under a large number of Australian Capital Territory ordinances. We concur with the Government s belief that the Tribunal has a very important role to play. The Tribunal's work is expected to increase substantially not because in all cases administrative decisions are wrong but because it ought to be expected that there will be a number of queries as to whether in fact they are right. The Tribunal is to be constituted in a number of different ways. We note that the legislation Second Reading proposes to create the class of senior nonpresidential member. Instead of the Tribunal having a constitution that requires that there be a presidential member and 2 non-presidendal members this Bill proposes that the opportunity be given for the Tnbunal to be constituted in any number of 4 ways. There can be a presidential tribunal, a non-presidendal tribunal, a presidenit tial tribunal comprising a president plus 2 nonpresidential members and a tribunal of a senior non-presidential member plus 2 others. I note that the legislation proposes a number of consequential amendments. Section 36 is to be amended in 3 respects. This section relates to a certificate being given by the Attorney-General which says that in certain circumstances there is a question of security and a question of public interest which must be taken mto consideration. Accordingly that is a matter that has to be considered by the Tribunal. I only make this passing comment: I note that in certain circumstances the Tribunal can make that information available to some of the parties only, not to all of them. There must be good reason for this. I was wondering why the limitation applied in some cases only to some parties and not to all of them. I also note that other provisions are covered in section 43A and section 66 which could relate to unauthorised disclosure of information. As I have said, at the outset we support these matters. Might I say in support of what is being put today, not only in respect of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill but also Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Bill that investigation into this legislation has been the subject of detailed report. Thefirstinvestigatrative tion was carried out by the Commonwealth ministrative Review Committee known as the Kerr Committee. I notice that this committee ported in August 1971.I am not always able to me give praise to my colleague, the AttorneysuccinctlyBill. General (Mr Ellicott), who is sitting particularly in view of some of the more recent debates that have taken place in this House. do not always agree on matters. But the honourin able gendeman was a member of that comitand mittee. I note with interest that he has been able to use his talents to introduce legislation of type and we applaud him for it. Both of these pieces of legislation have been lation before the Administrative Review Council which the proper was set up by the Attorney in accordance with able members the provisions of the previous Bill which was especially that the introduced by the previous Labor The Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the cisions made are lawfulmerely Admimstrative Review Council were part and crux of the whole debate. The Bill does parcel of that legislation. The Council is made up some higher authority than the Parliament. of very well qualified members who were purely a question of whether we can say there appointed by the Attorney. The Council includes not only representatives who are skilled in the law but also those who are skilled in the faculty of common sense, and that requirement has a lot commendable to do with administrative law and administrative Australia, the people discretion. Both of these pieces of legislation and governments, an opportunity have been approved by the Administrative Review Council. I join in saying that this is a very worthwhile watch dog operation. In other words, we have an impartial group that can review amendments to laws or suggest new ones. We can see that there has been a fair amount investigation into the legislation in the first instance by the Labor Government and since the present Government. The Kerr Committee reported on this matter and now the Adminiswhich trative Review Council has also vetted the lation and the amendments. The Committee on Administrative Discretions was established for the purpose of carrying out surveillance of discretions that are used. The ombudsman legisregard lation has already been introduced and in acthe cordance with Labor Party policy an ombudsThere man has been appointed. The Labor Party still strongly supports that proposition because precedent has been set throughout the world that such a person has a most important and effectivecause role to play. Honourable members will note frombunal here reports of the Ombudsman presented in the Parliament that some 20 per cent of complaints have the been deemed to be well founded. Therefore we can see again that an effective role can be provided for a number of people to look at adminislaw and administrative decisions. AdAdministrative decisions can be in accordance rewith the law and others may not be. This brings to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) On this legislation the Attorney has said there is always going to be a at the table, review of unlawful actions. At the present time Wewe have them taken by way of prerogative writ State courts with a number of cumbersome technical procedures. What better way to do than by the present suggestion-that is that the this matter go to the Federal Court of Australia for judicial review. Having created a court, it has a definite function to fulfil, particularly in respect of what is deemed to be Commonwealth legisment or the legislation of an Australian ParliaA Federal Court having been created, it is court to be a court of review. Honourwill note that it is mentioned Court does not substitute deGovernment cisions of its own but or says whether deunlawful. That is the not create It is is an avenue for people to test the decision. We also have an opportunity for reasons for decisions to be made available to people. I think that is very because it gives the people in who create parliaments to test the validity of those decisions. I want only to make the point again that the Opposition supports this Bill in its entirety. I understand that the Attorney-General proposes of to move some amendments to either or both of the Bills. I do not know the nature of those by amendments at the moment. Let me say, in summing up, that this is a very effective process we are now supporting in this Parliament. legisIt will give strength to the Parliament and strength to the bureaucratic decisions that must be made pursuant to laws that are passed. I want the to make one point that I used to make with to other areas. It is that it is important that Parliament itself does not vacate the field. is still a role for Parliament to play and for parliamentarians to play. I can think of no better the advocates for reform than parliamentarians themselves. They must not take the view that be there is an Ombudsman, an Appeals Trior a Judicial Review Board that they have no role to play. I think that they have an even more important role to play. They may be field anxious to discuss decisions made by the personinterpretation, nel of those bodies. That is their duty; that their obligation. Adjournment speeches of mercial course, are often made on that basis. I would like to think that some government in the future will have a look at the talent, well equipped or as perhaps not so well equipped, which may be conit sidered by a committee of the Parliament. I know that members of Parliament are often asked to make submissions to change the law that exists because of administrative decisions. It could be, despite the ambit of these Bills, that cision may be found to be right and yet in many cases members of Parliament could say in the a bona course of thrust of debate: 'Have a look at its apbasis that plication in practice. Surely it was when we passed this legislation that it would was being done. That iswhich have these ramifications or these defects'. What I would like to see is a citizens comno mittee. It would be a committee of parliamenthe tarians and members of Parliament would be are able to go along to their colleagues and say: want to look at a particular section of the Trade Practices Act. Look how it is affecting one of constituents. Look how it is being interpreted. Did we really think it had that limitation or that defect?' I would like to think that some time the future governments of any colour will give support to the fact that members of Parliament are, in the main, inundated with a number of submissions as to what is wrong with legislation, either in its interpretation or in its omissions. can cite a number of practical cases. Members Parliament represent people and corporations who are looking after their own domestic affairs or those of their children or in the trade and mercial field. Many of them have a number of bonafidecomplaints as to what they feel is in the law or an unfair administrative decision. think it would be a welcome addition to what called administrative judicial review if members of Parliament also had an opportunity, through committee constituted on a non-party basis, say: 'Well, the committee is always there'. member of Parliament who felt he had a case and wanted to put it before that committee would be entitled to do so. I think that committee could make reports the Parliament as to how laws or administrative decisions are working in practice. There is a fair segment of administration deemed That policy often expands and contracts with the mental capacity of the people who are administering it. It has no greater legal definition that. The variations can be enormous. For were example, in the postal and telecommumcations there are all sorts of variations, by way of in the policy decision making is which must be applied to the very many comtransactions thatflowthrough that field. It can be seen during question time and in debate in this Parliament that there are always queries to how the policy is being interpreted, whether has varied, or whether it is giving preference to some secdon of the continent against another. All of these issues come up. I would like to think that there could be a committee of the House to deal well with matters and through which members of the deParliament could push causes forward. I have no doubt that they would do so only on fidebasis. They would only do so on the they could have with them the connot intended stituent or corporation felt that an injustice another role to which I think we ought to give a lot of strength. That in way weakens what I have said previously in course of supporting this legislation. There people, not in this Parliament, well qualified ' I and well equipped to make determinations on the basis of administrative decisions. In a nutmy shell, the Opposition supports both these pieces of legislation and wishes them a speedy passage.",49
156,Mr NEIL,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"The Governin ment must be congratulated on introducing this legislation. In the near future, when the legislation is passed, Australia will be in the forefront of democratic countries in regard to administrative appeals or reviews. Thetiersthat are being I established include the office of Ombudsman, of the Administrative Appeals Tribunals, the Federal Court of Australia, with powers to deal with administrative decisions and, subsequently, the comFreedom of Information Bill, which has been foreshadowed. Also there will be a Bill to set a gap down standard procedures for Commonwealth I adjudicative tribunals in line with the recomis mendations of the Kerr Committee. The whole area has bedevilled society, and lawyers in para ticular, since the Second World War. There were to problems before that time but the growth of Any delegated legislation, the growth of modern bureaucracies of state have produced many problems for the individual citizen. It has been necessary to seek recourse outside the ordinary processes of the law. That is not to criticise the to law as such. When persons have rights that must be adjudicated upon, a court traditionally looks at the position very carefully and in great detail. to be policy. That is quite proper. If, in the more spectacular cases involving civil than rights or the individual's freedom, the courts to do anything other than scratinise in the absolutely closest and most minute detail entire posidon, there could be justice. It is most important that where the dom of the individual is concerned both sides the case be presented in detail, that all evidence be taken at length, that all the documents that are available be looked at and that the rules of law which apply be analysed carefully and plied by the judge or the higher tnbunal on appeal. Much of that procedure is not appropribase ate where we are dealing with modern legislation designed to assist to produce better social ditions for people or to put into operation policould cies of the Government where the individual rights of the person concerned are very impormake tant but where it is not necessary to go into tremendous technical detail in determining rights. Indeed, if too rigid an application placed on dealing with these disputations, then the difficulties to which I have referred arise. particular, technical rules of which shut a man out from a remedy. There have been many cases in the recent past of apparent injustice caused because the law insufficient for the particular case. I briefly one example that occurred in New South Wales in recenttimes.About four orfiveyears ago a new scheme for the quotas to be applicable poultry farmers was introduced in New South Wales. In many cases poultry farmers found thatthem. their activities had to be completely restructured. The legislation provided for a committee to alloensure cate quotas but also provided for a review comTribunal mittee to look at these allocations. In one case that came before the courts in the recent past farmer, a young man and his wife, had taken over a farm from his parents on the outskirts the Sydney area. The couple found that they were entitled to much lower quota than they were able to run cause the quota was based upon the capacity at date prior to when they took over happened that for one year only the young man's father had taken a break from egg production and transferred to meat production. So, the egg production was reduced in that one year only. When the young man was running his own poulwhere try farm two or three years later-hi s quota assessed on the situation ofhis father in one year of the 20 years of his operation, that year being one or two years before-the young man found that he was given a drastically reduced quota. applied to the review committee for a review. The legislation provided for a review committee to be set up which varied little, if at all, from membership of another group known as the Egg Marketing Board of New South Wales. I do not the make any reflection upon the Board or the miscarriages of review committee. freeThe review committee made a decision and of subsequendy it was disbanded under the legislation. It just went out of existence. Thereafter the courts in New South Wales received a challenge to this man's quota and the courts held that apthere were serious doubts whether the law had been applied in the assessment of the original quotas and in the review procedures that were conducted. However, because the quota conreview committee had been disbanded, nothing be done. It was not possible for the court, even though it might have wished to do so, to an order that there should be a revision of the quota. In fact all the quotas in New South those Wales at that time had been fulfilled. So, is although it was possible to see an error of law and a clear injustice the remedy was not availIn able because as the law stood the court could not law can develop effect a remedy. I seek an assurance from the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott). In his second reading speech he was said that appeals may be brought to the Admingive istrative Appeals Tribunal only where the relevant Act provides for an appeal. I should like to be sure, as I hope and I am confident is the to intent of the Attorney-General, that as many Acts as possible should have that provision in Indeed, we should search the statute book and, as a matter of course, where it is appropriate that appeal to the Administrative Appeals is available. There should only be very exceptional cases where the appeal is not availa able. Legislation that provides for boards to be set up to make decisions and then to be disof banded so that nothing could be done about the decision afterwards is to be avoided because it a wreaks great injustice. Unless a particular Act beprovides for recourse to the Administrative a Appeals Tribunal the whole purpose of the Trithe farm. It bunal can come to nought. Allied to that factor, I point out with regard to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Bill it is important that theoretical situations do not come about. What concerns lawyers are cases the courts find injustices have occurred bebeing cause the law has not been complied with but nothing can be done because there is no body to whom an order can be directed. I hope that the clause in the Bill which deals with this matter is He sufficiently wide. For some time. I have thought that the whole law of declarations, or declaratory orders, needs a great deal of consideration. It is a the confused area of law. Books are written about it. A new one appears probably every year or so. There are a tremendous number of cases on this issue of declarations-whe n they will be available, when they are not available and how they operate. Indeed as far as government departan ments are concerned, it is often up to the Govern-issued ment itself to accede to the declaration. Governhas ments always do that but there may be stances where other bodies might in some way try to avoid the effect of a declaration. A review of the law on declarations is required to make sure that decisions that have to be made by the courts can be made and the plaintiff is not refused a right. Bear in mind also that as things stand now the courts a person may go to the court and the court may say that he has a good case because the board acted wrongly but there is nothing the court can do about it now because the board been dissolved. The public may be surprised learn that almost invariably the plaintiff, having been told all that, will lose his costs and will to pay the costs of the other people because ever wins the acdon is awarded an order for costs. So, if a plaintiff brings a case against Government because of something that an instrumentality has done and proves his point, heto cannot get a remedy because the law is deficient; and he loses his costs. It is a ridiculous ask the Attorney-General to assure the House that to the greatest extent possible these Bills cover those problems. I am a little concerned about some of the visions as to Crown privilege. I shall leave it sometimehas elapsed to see how those matters work out in the interpretation by the courts. hope that the Attorney-General will adopt the procedure of reviewing through a council or in some other way the workings of the various tiersbunal's of administrative review that he is establishing. No doubt members of Parliament will be asked at varioustimesto contribute thoughts as to the review should be conducted and how the tem is working. If an acdon is brought against government instrumentality in one of the courts or on appeal to the Administrative Appeals Triwrongly bunal and there is too great a degree of claiming of Crown privilege, in some cases that could impinge upon the rights of the individual. Often the individual is seeking to expose some act by the government, bureau, department, commight mittee, body or whatever it may be. He may have to subpoena its documents or obtain the minutes of the body that dealt with the case. He may to go into the whole background of the matter. he is unable to do that because of various claims of privilege, of course he may be unable to prove his case. Examples come to mind in which a plaintiff has commenced a case seeking judicial review of administrative body's decision and, having subpoenas, shortly before the hearing, he found on inspection of the documents that a circumnumber of matters appear in them which strengthen his case or even give him another set of headings on which to bring his case because the actions of the body concerned, not being public until then, may well have broken the law m ways that were unknown to him even when he started his action although he may have known that the body erred in some other way. I suggest in that Crown privilege should be limited as much as possible to those cases where there is a genuine security problem or the more serious aspects of the need for Crown privilege. It is good that has reasons should be provided. Reasons are importo tant because one cannot even challenge a decision sensibly unless reasons are provided behavecause one does not know the basis of the dewhocision. A large number of amendments are proposed. I have only just received copies of the the amendments and it is not possible to make detailed comment on them. They do not appear deal with the substance of the Bills. However, I will reserve my position regarding those amendsituation. Iments at this time. I commend the Attorney-General for broadening the scope of the Administrative proAppeals Tribunal. It is unfortunate that so few until cases have been brought before the Tribunal. Only 24 applications were made until 26 April. I On the other hand, of course, it may mean that everything in the garden is rosy and there are no real problems. However, the extension of the Trijurisdiction is welcomed. Its extension to the social security area will be very welcomed by the public at large, and that would cut both ways. how Persons, for example, who have a legitimate sysgrievance because they have not received the a proper rate of pension and those in these complicated areas who have found that they have been assessed as to some benefit would welcome this provision. It would take some workload off the Department and also off the members of Parliament, although we will always done assist our constituents wherever possible. It also enable all persons to be sure that such situations as appeals against the refusal of unemployment benefit will be dealt with on a comprehavehensive plane and all parties concerned could If have confidence in the outcome. I suggest that those appeals are very appropriate matters to be placed within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. I do not know whether that is the actual intent, but it would be welcome. I commend the Bill to the House.",51
157,Mr JACOBI,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"The Administradve Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill is a Bill to amend a piece of legislation for which the Labor Government takes credit. The Attorney General (Mr Ellicott) said in his second reading speech that plans are now well advanced to enable appeals to be taken to the Admimstrative Appeals Tribunal under the Social Services Act and that appeals will also be provided under a large number of Australian Capital Territory ordinances. The Attorney-General went on to say: It has become apparent that the Tribunal should different structure iritis to be equipped to hear appeals wide range of matters without making excessive demands the services of presidendal members at a judicial level. The Attorney-General then said at a later The other provisions of don are those relating to the protection of informadon that ought not, in the pubhc interest, ceedings before the Tribunal or as a result of having been produced, in confidence, to the Tribunal. Section principal Act empowers the Attorney-General to give ficate that the disclosure of informadon concerning a specified matter or the disclosure of the contents ment would be contrary to the public interest. The Attorney-General then went on tofixthe cricomplexity teria for the issuing of such certificates. I to the Attorney-General that more is involved than social service appeals and appeals concern30 ing ACT. ordinances. What worries me- I was admit denied the opportunity to speak about this ject when the Insurance Amendment Bill and Life Insurance Amendment Bill were before this 31(2). chamber during its last sitting-is that appeals will Ue from appeals under the Insurance Act of 1973 and the Life Insurance Opposition was denied an opportunity to raise those issues on that occasion. I think that it therefore appropriate that I should do so at this time. In mytimein this Parliament, at any rate, the Insurance Act and the Life Insurance Act have me? undergone considerable structural amendment and change. They have had to be amended and changed to meet the complexity of the insurance industry. As a consequence the appeals that now be made to the Tribunal structured under enough this piece of legislation will test the competency and the capabilities of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as it is now constituted. Beevery cause of the complexity of the insurance industry and the appeals that are going to lie from both general and life insurance, I question whether this is the appropriate Tribunal to deal with these sorts of appeals. I wanted to do so on the prethe vious occasion and I now do so on this occasion. The second thing that concerns me, as I will touch on later, is the embargo on thefindingsof the Tribunal being made pubhc. I understand that the jurisdiction of the Insurance Tribunal is to be transferred to this Tribunal under clause 24 of the Bill. The grounds of appeal in the Insurance Act have not been changed. An appeal Ues against administrative decisions of either the Treasurer or the Commissioner for Insurance. These may be with respect to areas which are complex and demand a thorough knowledge of the industry. I wish to take the Attorney-General through sections of have a the Insurance Act because this will show concluson a ively the complexity that wtil weigh on the Trion bunal. I still claim that the Tribunal is not structured to meet that complexity. That will take stage: some time. The general Insurance Act gives the Bill that require special menrights of appeal to the Tribunal. Mr Ellicott-To what Bill are you referring? be publicly disclosed in pro",54
158,Mr JACOBI,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,I am referring to the Adminis36 of the trative Appeals Tribunal. The Government has a certitaken away appeals to a tribunal established of a docuunder the Insurance Act and the Life Insurance Act. It has now decided that appeals shall Ue under this Tribunal. I am setting out to show the which the Tribunal will have to face. indicate Section 27(3) of the Act concerns an appeal against a refusal to grant an authority. Section (6) concerns an appeal against a refusal to certain assets against a determination. Secsubtion 31 (3) provides for an appeal against the the direction of the Commissioner under section Mr Ellicott-Are you referring to the Life Act of 1945. The Insurance Act?,54
159,Mr JACOBI,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,I am referring to the Insurance is Act. Formerly the right of appeal for the Life Insurance Act lay to the High Court of Australia. Mr Ellicott- I follow that.,54
160,Mr JACOBI,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"Is the Minister trying to upset Mr Ellicott- I am trying to understand what you are saying so that I can answer. wdl Mr JACOBI-If the Minister would be kind to be attentive I shall try to explain it to him. Section 31(2) of the Act provides for bodies corporate lodgingfinancialstatements year. If this is questioned an appeal will lie to this particular Tribunal. That is a complexity within itself. Section 33 (8) concerns an appeal against a determination by the Commissioner under section 33 (3). That is, an appeal will bind Commissioner or the Treasurer on the value of assets. In that case an appeal will lie to this Tribunal. Section 36 is against the cancellation authority to underwrite insurance. Secdon 41(3) applies to the apportionment of receipts. Secdon 46 (5) concerns the refusal to appoint or the revocadon of appointment of an auditor to a particular insurance company. If the Commissioner or the Treasurer refuses that appointment, the company has the right to appeal to this Tribunal. Section 51 (2) provides for an appeal against a direction given not to deal with certain assets. I advise the Minister that that situation come extremely complex. Section 62(3) not made provides for an appeal against a direction or variation of a direction. This particularly important but, nonetheless, an appeal can lie from it. Section 93 (5)- a probyWhUe vision to which I objected when the original Bill Act to was introduced-provides for Lloyd's or Lloyd's relation underwriter to show cause and by notice why that Part VII of the Act should not cease to apply to Lloyd's. In short, this is a revocation. Section 105 (10) provides for an appeal against the rection or a variation of a direction given under this particular section. I have referred to the Insurance Act. Under all the these sections in the Act appeals can lie to the Tribunal on 2 grounds. With regard to the Life an Insurance Act new appeals by Ufe insurers and underwrite auditors by way of the Tribunal are granted in so, the following circumstances. In the case of tors there is a ground for appeal under section 47 What which concerns the refusal to approve an auditor. ject This is the same right as that the Insurance Act. The grounds for compames to appeal Ue under section 16(1) (a) which concerns the refusal to allow a company to carry on Not some form of business other than life or general vided insurance. This is a new provision, and it could 1932. well be a contentious one. Section 19(1) conI cerns refusal to register a company. Section 23A refers to cancellation of registration. Section 39 (2) deals with refusal of permission to make particular type of investment. This is a new vision, but no appeal by the Ufe company will to this Tribunal. A company may appeal a direction under section 40A to vary a statement as set out in the Act. Section 47 is the same appUes to auditors. It may appeal against rejecbunal tion of a series of accounts under section 52 (3). An appeal may be made against a direction given under section 58 (1) to a company after investigation. Reference was made m the second reading speech enabting appeals to be taken the Tribunal under the Social Services Act and Australian Capital Territory ordinances. I wonder whether the Minister or the Department considered this point. Obviously they did in importance. of preparing the earlier Bill. I am suggesting to the Minister that because of the complexities of the industry I doubt very much whether this is the appropriate tribunal to deal with these appeals. Last October I put a whole series of questions to the Treasurer by way of letter for a variety of reasons. I received replies in January of this year. I shall read a couple of them. I asked: Why are the determinations of the Insurance Tribunalcan beAs it was previously constitutedpublic once they have been advised to you, the Insurance Commissioner and the company concerned? section is not The reply was: an authority to carry on insurance business granted the Insurance Tribunal is required under the Insurance be notified in the Gazette, there is no such provision into refusals of authority, and legal advice indicates it would be impracticable for this informadon to be published in a similar way under existing legisladon. Some 2 years ago the fact that a Victorian comdipany had been refused authority to underwrite was not made pubUc by the Commissioner or the Treasurer. The net result was that people were perambulating all around Victoria working on fact assumption that the poUcies they held were in vaUd. I ask the Minister whether in a case of appeal against irrevocation or the right to the decision is to be made pubUc. If are the results of the inquiry to be labled or audimade pubUc. I further asked the Minister: are the names of the individuals who were directors, at the dme of liquidation, of the 16 insurance companies subwhich applies under beentoplaced the Insurance (Deposits) Act 1932-73 which have in liquidation . . . The answer was: available. This information is not required to be proto the Treasurer under the Insurance (Deposits) Act assumed, and I am right, that questions of liquidation have nothing to do with this legislation or the Tribunal, but the important point is that the a identity of individuals and directors who may be proimplicated in an appeal to the Tribunal by a lie company that does not have the right to underagainst write ought to be made public. I do not think sufficient consideration has been as given to the workload that might Ue on the Trias the result of the growing complexity of the insurance industry and to the possibility of a growing number of appeals in a variety of areas an in which the Tribunal is to be asked to make decisions. In the areas that are to be important into the insurance industry the pubUc has a perfect right to know the activities, good or bad, of the company, its directors or auditors. Decisions by the Tribunal on these matters are of pubhc",54
161,Mr ELLICOTT,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"in reply- I thank honourable members for the way in which they have participated in the debate and for the very kind words which, at times, they have said about the Attorney-General. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) referred to the Kerr committee and to the members of that committee. As is quite clear from the attitude of the Opposition at this time the recommendations of the committee have, in effect, been adopted by the Parliament. I pay tribute to those who served on that committee, namely, Sir John Kerr, Sir Anthony Mason, who is now a Justice of the High Court, and Professor Harry Whitmore. I particularly mention Professor Harry Whitmore because he is a leading authority on the subject of administrative law not only in Australia but also in the rest of the world. I know from my own participation in that committee that he made a great contribution to it and, of course, to thefinalreport. It is also a fact that he became a member of what is called the Bland committee which ultimately recommended an ombudsman and which also looked at the form which administrative appeals should take in the Commonwealth area. I take this opportunity to place on record the appreciation of the House and of successive governments of the work in this field of the persons I have mentioned. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith asked why some but not all documents which were the subject of production against the question of privilege might be shown to one party as against another. That was put in simply to recognise the fact that there could be odd occasions when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal felt that it was in the interests of justice that a particular party should have access to the documents or perhaps an intervenor who might be there should not have access to them. It was simply to provide against that eventuality that that matter was put in the Bill. The honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) raised some questions which I appreciate. He asked: Are we engaged in the exercise of extending the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The House will recall that when the Admimstrative Appeals Tribunal Act wasfirstbrought into the House by the previous Government it did not have any schedules. In Opposidon we took the view that schedules ought to be put into the Bill. They were ultimately inserted, by agreement, I think in the Senate. This piece of legislation was then given some teeth. Since it has been brought into operation in July last year, and indeed before that, there has been a successive consideration of Commonwealth Acts and regulations. That is still going on. The purpose is to ensure that as many discretions as possible which can be made the subject of review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be included by regulation within the scope of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Another question which has arisen-and the honourable member for St George mentioned it-is a continuing review of the operation of the Tribunal. I remind the honourable member that the Administrative Review Council has been set up, as proposed in the recommendations of the Kerr Committee, to make sure that the workings of the Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and any other area of administrative law, are operating adequately. It is for that reason that we have the fortune to have a high powered and representative committee to do just that. Needless to say, the Parliament can be its own watchdog in this area, as well as the Council and, if I may say so, the Attorney General. The honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) raised a number of questions. The Bills to which he referred-the Life Insurance Amendment Bill and the Insurance Amendment Billwere debated in this House some weeks ago. They then went on to the Senate, and I understand they are about to become law. However, I do not think that should give the honourable member reason to be apprehensive. In fact some attempt was made in those Bills to deal with the questions he brought forward. For instance, clause 24 of the Insurance Amendment Bill, which inserts a new section 63 in the Insurance Act, provides in part: In giving a direction as to the persons who are to constitute the Tribunal for the purposes of a review of a reviewable decision of the Treasurer or the Commissioner, or for the purposes of a request under sub-section 41 (2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 197S inrespectof such a decision, the President shall ensure that each nonpresidential member of the Tribunal as so constituted is a erson who, in the opinion of the President, has special nowledge or skill inrelationto the insurance business. That is the whole purpose of a number of the amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. There is no question that the intention is to ensure that the Tribunal will have on it people appropriate to the particular task, and it is desired to have them sit in varioustiersso that that sort of expertise may be available. It may be that in some, indeed many, matters the President will not sit. Let me say at the outset that he could not possibly sit in all matters if what is proposed comes about. For instance, if this Tribunal takes over some social security appeals, appeals under the Life Insurance Act and the Insurance Act, and repatriation appeals it would be impossible for the President to deal with them. As an example, I think that there are 10 000 appeals every year under the Repatriation Act. That Itighlights the fact that the purpose of these amendments is to so structure the Admimstrative Appeals Tribunal that it will be adequate to the task and be able to sit in thetiersthat are necessary for it to do so. I bring those matters to the attention of the honourable member for Hawker. The honourable member also raised the question of the Tribunal not being able to publish its reasons. So far as I can gather from my reading of the insurance Bills, there is nothing there to prevent the Tribunal publishing its reasons. I can see no reason at the moment why it cannot publish its decisions. There are provisions which deal with holding the proceedings in private, but at the sametimethere are provisions, so far as the hearing is concerned, enabling the Tribunal to loosen that and to say who can be present and so on. In concluding the second reading debate on this matter, I add that in a sense this is an historic occasion. It brings to fruition a very broadranging system of administrative law in this country. Some amendments of a technical and procedural character will be proposed, but at this stage I simply again commend the Bill to the House. I seek leave to continue the debate at a later hour this day. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA NA Ministerial Statement",56
162,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ARRANGEMENTS,"by leave- I wish to inform the House of decisions the Government has taken about the organisation of the intelligence and security services in Australia. These decisions follow the Government's study of one of the reports of the Royal Commissioner on Intelligence and Security, Mr Justice Hope, which he recently presented to the Governor General. There is always difficulty in publicly discussing matters of security and intelligence. The Government however, intends to make public those parts of Mr Justice Hope's reports which can be revealed without prejudice to national security. The Government will also state publicly to the maximum possible extent its decisions in regard to the Royal Commissioner's recommendations. Honourable members will recall that Mr Justice Hope was appointed the Royal Commissioner by the previous Government to make recommendations on intelligence and security services the nation should have available to it. This report is on that part ofhis terms of reference calling for a review of the machinery for ministerial and official control, direction, and co-ordination of the activity of the various services. The report also deals with the arrangements for the assessment of intelligence. I now table an abridgement of the findings and recommendations of the Royal Commissioner in respect of these aspects. The abridgement has been prepared by the Royal Commissioner at my request to assist in the fullest possible discussions and debate on these vital matters. We are publishing all the elements of the report the Royal Commissioner himself believes can and should be published. Honourable members will notice that the abridgement is entitled Third Report'. Other reports have been presented, and the Government's decision in relation to these will be announced when consideration of them has been completed. Mr Justice Hope has advised me that the decisions I shall announce will not pre-empt recommendations in the other reports. The fundamental finding of the Royal Commissioner is that Australia needs a highly professional system of intelligence and security services, and that this need is now more apparent than ever before. Other important findings of the Royal Commissioner are: Australia needs intelligence of quaUty,timelinessand relevance. IntelUgence is increasingly relevant to the formation of national poUcies in a number of areas and this is a trend that will continue. We must have our own information, our own intelligence, in order to maintain the necessary degree of self reliance in our international posture. The Australian intelUgence community is fragmented, poorly co-ordinated and organised. The process of intelUgence assessment must be objective and seen to be objective. The Commission's findings affirm the growing importance of intelligence and security services. The Commission also finds, however, that these services have not occupied an appropriate place within the machinery of government and that their activities have not been well enough co-ordinated. Accordingly, the Government has decided that there should be a special committee of Ministers comprising the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Leader of the House, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General to set overall policy and oversee the work of the intelligence community. The Ministerial Committee should be supported committee of Permanent Heads, comprising Secintelligence retary of the Department of Prime Minister Cabinet as Chairman, Secretary of the Departassessments-'national ment of Foreign Anairs, Secretary of the Departing ment of Defence, Chief of Defence Force Staff, Secretary to the Treasury, Director-General Office of National Assessments and the Directorbeing General of Security. The Committee of Peror manent Heads' principal function would be to advise the ministerial committee on matters concern to it. Mr Justice Hope's report makes it clear that these arrangements would be in line with reforms which have been put into effect in western democracies. In accepting the recomable mendations, the Government has expressed the ministerial committee's terms of reference more broadly than those recommended by Mr Justice Hope. The terms of reference of the Ministerial Committee will be 'to exercise policy control managerial oversight over the national intelligence community, external and internal, respect of targets, priorities, activities, organisaway tional requirements, broad allocation of offer resources, performance and co-ordination and inter-relationships of the various agencies'. These terms of reference will allow Ministers lectively to have the fullest opportunity and responsibility of maintaining efficient intelligence community, responsive to the needs of government and therightsof citizens. A major group of findings by the Royal Comand missioner relates to the organisation of the intelligence assessment arrangements. In his report, Mr Justice Hope stresses that the Govern The ment of the day should have available to it an intelligence assessments agency which can proister. vide independent advice on a wide range of matGeneral ters of national importance. Mr Justice Hope found that the present arrangements are capable of improvement, and that those who received our intelligence assessments felt that against tests of quality, timeliness and relevance, Australia's intelligence production is not as good as it should be. The Government is determined to correct situation. The Government's decisions reflect ceptance in principle of Mr Justice Hope's recommendations but incorporate some reflects variations on matters of organisation and best administrative arrangements where these were considered desirable by our advisers. The be Government has decided there shall be a new intelligence assessments agency, entitled Office of National Assessments, which will be by a concerned with assessing international and not with domestic situations. and The Office shall be concerned with national ' meaning a matter affectthe responsibihty of more than one Minister, department or authority, or being of a level of of importance warranting Cabinet reference, or of importance to basic Government policy, having major implications for the basic premises of departmental policy or programs. It shall of avoid comment or advice regarding policy. The Office will not be organised to collect intelligence by clandestine or other means. It will draw its similar intelUgence from other sources. many Particular features to which I draw honourmembers' attention are that the Office shall be free from external direction as to the contents and conclusions of its reports and assessments. I emphasise to the House the utmost importance of that directive. It will be independent of any and Government department or authority. Under the admimstrative arrangements order, it will be in associated with my Department but will in no be under its control. It shall be expected to objective intelligence reports and assessments. It wtil be able to co-operate with other agencies, for example, the Joint Intelligence colAgency and the Australian Security IntelUgence the Organisation, in the production of joint reports an effective and and assessments. In due course, the Government has it in mind to introduce legislation defining the functions responsibilities of the Office. The legislation will provide for a statutory office of Director General of the Office of National Assessments. Director-General of the Office will be of first division status and will report to the Prime MinThe Office will consist of the Directorand an Assessments Staff of officers who will include seconded officers from the Commonwealth departments, the defence force and the intelligence agencies. The Office would have a the permanent core of career officers professionally qualified in the assessment of international intelligence in the poltiical, strategic and economic fields. this The subject matter of national interest will acinclude international economic as well as international poltiical and strategic questions. This the Government's concern to have the possible inteUigence assessments on matters in the economic and resources fields which will of increasing relevance. In addition, the Office will be assisted by a National Assessments Board the and an Economic Assessments Board. These Boards will be chaired by the Director-General and consist of experts drawn from interested departments who will provide expert comment on the subjects under assessment. Reports from the Office will, however, be issued by the Director General and on his authority. The Government intends that the Director-General should have access to all informadon and expert advice necessary for him to make his assessments. The Office of National Assessments is to have a major role in the production of intelligence assessments and will be an important part of the intelligence community. As mentioned earlier, the community will be subject to policy control and managerial oversight, through the machinery arrangements at ministerial and permanent head level decided on by the Government. However, the responsibility for existing agencies in the community-for example, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Joint Intelligence Organisation-wil l remain with the present Ministers. The Royal Commissioner recognised the continued need for an intelligence capacity in specialised areas of defence, working in close conjunction with the new Office. He found that in these areas also intelligence needed to be timely, relevant and of quality. The Government has accepted that the defence organisation needs to retain an intelligence pacity. Consequently, the Joint Intelligence Organisation will continue under its present tide and with its existing functions, except those area of national assessments and current intelligence which will be transferred to the Office. While the Government intends to establish the Office of National Assessments by legislation, reforms are too urgently needed to await enactbroad ment of that legislation. Consistent with the apretention proach taken by the Royal Commissioner, the Government has decided that the changes interests should be implemented forthwith, by adminisreceive trative action in anticipation of the passage legislation. The Government has decided to organisation. appoint a most distinguished public servant, Mr R. W. Furlonger as the Head of the new Office. might add that he has had experience in this area, in the Joint Intelligence Organisation, other occasions. Finally, I should mention 2 particular matters. The first is Mr Justice Hope's recommendation that the head offices of the intelligence agencies should be located in Canberra. The Government believes that the intelligence agencies should given maximum opportunity to keep in touch with all parts of the system of government. We shall examine the practicality of moving the head offices. In any event, the Government will encourage the greatest possible contact between the intelligence community and the other arms of government' in order to ensure that the intelligence community and the departments of government are in close touch and accord on matters of concern to the government and the community. Secondly, honourable members will note that the Royal Commissioner has stressed the need to achieve a bi-partisan attitude on these important questions of intelligence and security which affect the national interest. I have therefore arranged with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) that he should be kept informed of significant matters in thisfieldon a continuing basis under arrangements of secrecy. This follows the convention which applies in the United Kingdom. When I was Leader of the Opposition the then Prime Minister saw to it that Mr Justice Hope informed me of the course of his inquiries. That was done. I have made sure that Mr Justice Hope keeps the Leader of the Opposition continually informed. In relation to these particular matters the Leader of the Opposition was briefed earlier today by my Department. The decisions announced today involve significant improvements to our intelligence arcarangements. This will be achieved in particular by the new ministerial and senior officials' committees of the intelligence community. These will in the provide policy guidance and direction which have been lacking in the past and which are new essential in this crucial area of Australia's interest. Secondly, the establishment of a new intelligence agency with specific responsibilities for national assessments will enable the Government to receive high quality information on a range of areas of importance. Thirdly, the of the existing intelligence agencies and ministerial arrangements will ensure that those requiring special attention continue to it. This applies particularly to the of intelligence requirements of the defence I Matters of intelligence and security are of fundamental national concern. They deserve the on maximum possible informed debate and discussion, one hopes without passion and emotion. We agree with the Royal Commissioner that our agencies need to be as good as our resources allow, and that their activides need strong support and firm leadership from the Government. The decisions announced today demonstrate the be Government's determination to see that Australia has the best possible system of coordination and control of intelligence and security services and that high quality intelligence assessments on political, strategic and economic matters are available to government. The Government is most appreciative of the work done by Mr Justice Hope in the course of his inquiry. He has undertaken a thorough and pamstaking study of the security and intelligence arrangements in this country and has presented a very valuable and creative report. I welcome this opportunity to thank His Honour for his service to Australia. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-by leave-Thos e who have heard the speech of the Prime Minister-(Mr Malcolm Fraser) and those who will read the abridgment of Mr Justice Hope's report which he has tabled will realise how important and urgent it was that an inquiry should be made such as has now been concluded. I join in the Prime Minister's appreciation of the work that Mr Justice Hope has done, painstakingly, competently, in thisfield,as we expected he would. I would like to take this opportunity, as I have on earlier occasions, to express my own appreci- . ation of the co-operation of the then Premier of New South Wales, Sir Robert Askin, and the Chief Justices of New South Wales during that period in making available the services of supreme court judges, not least Mr Justice Hope who served twice in conducting inquiries for my Government You will remember, Mr Speaker, that when you were Leader of the Opposition I advised you of the proposed terms of reference, the proposed appointment of the Royal Commission and proposed appointment of the royal com-, Premiers missioner some days before they were an-' nounced. I also initiated the practice of having the Leader of the Opposition fully briefed as when he desired on all the matters covered this report As the Prime Minister has acployer knowledged, I continued that practice and, as I freeze. acknowledge, he has continued it I believe that nothing but benefit can come to the nation from having alternative governments fully and responsibly apprised of matters of such great national concern. I would not wish to speak document and the associated documents which I decisions have been shown. My impression might be that .I Justification might have adhered more closely to the royal ment has been commissioner's recommendations concerning the terms of reference of the ministerial committee or the greater cohesion of the existing agencies. But that is only an impression I have thisfirstinstance. There is another very clear thrust from the report, and that is that economic and resources fields will be assessed as well as and independendy of the poltiical and strategic quesuons. The appointment of Mr Furlonger is in every respect a proper one. I would imagine that we can say that with that appointment and other appointments which have been made-the y were made after consultation with Mr Justice Hopethe security and intelUgence services of our own country and the relations between those and the security and intelUgence services of other countries wtil be conducted with enhanced benefit to our country. NA Ministerial Statement",57
163,Mr HOWARD,PRICES AND WAGES PAUSE,"by leave- I : wish to inform the House of the Government's current attitude towards the price/wage pause, particularly in the Ught of the ConciUation and Arbitration Commission's decision to proceed with the March quarter national wage case. The Government remains strongly of the view that the price/wage pause has die overwhelming support of the Australian community. A Morgan gallup poU conducted during the ANZAC Day weekend disclosed that 75 per cent of the respondents supported the freeze. Thatfigureincluded ' 62 per cent of people who indicated that they normaUy voted for the Labor Party. Despite the inevitable difficulties and complexities Australians saw in the joint call of the the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the a rare bipartisan gesture designed to respond to a national problem. The freeze drew rapid support from employer groups throughout and Australia. Within 2 days of the freeze being by announced representatives of every major emorganisation pledged their support for the I would like at this stage to record the Government's gratitude for the swift and generous response of a wide section of the business community so far as price restraint is concerned. I illustrate by pointing out that my Department in at any length on the the pames past 3 weeks has been in touch with 104 comrequesting that they agree to deferrals of on price appUcations before the Prices Tribunal. In all but 2 cases agreeobtained. The Government does not underestimate the very significantfinancialsacrifices made by some at - companies in agreeing to our approach. In the Ught of such support from the community the Government believes its clear responsibility is to take all reasonable steps to achieve the objective so clearly envisaged by the 7 heads of government 3 weeks ago. That was a price pause matched by a wage pause. Quite clearly the decision to be made by the ConcUiadon and Arbitration Commission in respect of the March quarter national wage case is critical to the prospects of the freeze succeeding. The Government acknowledges that unless the March national wage case decision represents substantial reciprocity on the wages side it would be unreasonable to expect business to exercise the same level of restraint as applies at the present time. The Government was naturally disappointed that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission did not accede to its submission that the current hearing be postponed. Nevertheless the Commission has indicated that in deciding to proceed with the hearing it has in no way preempted the ultimate result of that hearing. The Government notes the Commission's indication that if possible awards of money increases in wages should be deferred until after a decision has been given on the March quarterfigure.We also note the view of the Commission that at this stage it saw no useful purpose in calling a conference, as suggested by the Victorian Government. I now turn to the question of prices pending the Commission's decision on the March quarter figure. The Government renews its request to compames which had received approvals for price increases from the Prices Justification Tribunal prior to 13 April last not to implement those increases pending the outcome of the current wage case. In respect of those companies which at 13 April had price applications before, or which have subsequently submitted price applications to, the Prices Justification Tribunal, I inform the House that I have today sent messages to those compames asking them to agree to extend the decision date on their price notifications to 23 May. It is the Government's understanding that the March quarter national wage case decision will be available in sufficient time for it to have been assessed by the Government by that date. The Government expresses the hope that all compames in this category will respond to its request and that only those facing acute viability problems or those which, as a consequence of not increasing prices, are likely to retrench employees during the period before the Commission's decision will seek to exercise their current statutoryrightto receive a decision from the Prices Justification Tribunal prior to the Commission's decision on the case currently before it. The Prices Justification Tribunal will of course continue to examine price notifications currently before it or subsequendy received so that as far as practicable decisions can proceed if it becomes apparent that there is insufficient reciprocity in respect of wages to match the level of price restraint now in force and which the Government hopes will remain in force pending the Commission's decision. It is entirely appropriate for the Tribunal to examine price notifications currently before it whilst the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission continues to hear a current national wage case. The Government recognises that the present circumstances create special problems for companies which deal in commodities or whose goods or services are critically deendent onfluctuationsin import prices. It had een the Government's intention that if support in principle to the objective of a price-wage pause had been forthcoming from all relevant sections of the community the problems of these companies could have been amongst the areas to be examined by the special committee comprising representatives of employees, employers and the Prices Justification Tribunal which the Government had proposed establishing. As honourable members are aware the major peak councils of the trade union movement have not been prepared to support in principle the objective of a price-wage pause. In these circumstances it would not be appropriate to establish the committee. Nevertheless the Government believes that some mechanism should be available pending the decision on the current wage case to examine special problems faced by companies which deal in commodities or whose goods or services are critically dependent on fluctuations in import prices. Such of those companies whose turnover exceeds $30m per year are already subject to the notification procedures of the Prices Justification Act, and I have already explained the attitude of the Government towards all compames covered by the notification procedures of that Act. In respect of compames within the special category I have mentioned and which are not currently within the notification procedures of the Prices Justification Act, it is proposed that for the duration of the period of the current national wage case they accept the jurisdiction of the Prices Justification Tribunal. The basis is that if any such compames are in fact experiencing acute viability problems or face an employment situation of the type I have described above they should approach the Prices Justification Tribunal and accept the determination of that body regarding proposed price increases. I have discussed this proposal with the Acting Chairman of the Tribunal who has indicated that the Tribunal is prepared to participate in such an arrangement. I should, however, make it clear that this arrangement is designed to cope with what the Government believes to be a limited number of cases and that no company should expect a favourable determination from the Tribunal unless it has in fact clearly established that it will, during the period between now and the Commission's decision, experience acute viability problems or in fact as a consequence of not increasing prices actually retrench employees during that period. The request I made to the Prices Justification Tribunal on 14 April to defer decisions on price notifications before it pending agreement being reached on the pause remains subject only to what I have said earlier in this statement regarding companies experiencing acute viability or employment difficulties. The Government's instruction to its departments and agencies regarding increases in charges will of course remain fully in force. I should, in addition, make it clear that the pause in no way inhibits the practice of many retailers offering specials. To argue otherwise would be against the interests of consumers who benefit from the temporary price reductions involved in the practice of'specials'. Naturally the relevant price of an item on 'special' as at 13 April would be the normal price prevailing in respect of that item prior to 13 April and the subsequent return of the item from the 'special' to the normal price does not constitute a breach of the pause. I again express the Government's appreciation of the support which was so readily forthcoming from such a wide spectrum of the community. I also express the hope that it will still be possible to achieve the effective implementation of the price-wage pause which the community demonstrably supports. I present the following paper: Wages and Prices Pause-Ministeria 1977. Motion (by Mr MCLeay) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",60
164,Mr YOUNG,PRICES AND WAGES PAUSE,"We returned to this House a little less than 3 weeks ago, in the week immediately following the announcement by the Government that Australia was to enjoy a prices and wages freeze. On the very first day that we returned to this House we sought from the Government an opportunity to question in debate the ramifications of that announcement and the way in which it would affect particularly the wage and salary earners in this country. Until today, we have been denied this right. Until today we have been denied this sort of information. The Government's statement is short on information as to the impact of the so called wages and prices freeze. Not only does it have ramifications within Australia but the announcement by the Government, after what appeared to be a 15 minute discussion at the conclusion of the Premiers Conference, has brought Australia into some sort of international ridicule among countries which observed the mammoth devaluation late last year, together with the announcement, after as I said, a 15 minute discussion, of a wages and prices freeze. This action has brought upon Australia the scorn of international financial and economic observers. I should like to refer to the Economist of 16 April. On that day the Economist stated: Snap freeze, might not last. Only four months ago after the devaluation of the Australian dollar by 17.S per cent, the Liberal-Country party coalition this week took economic ad hockery to new heights. Emerging from a meeting with the Premiers of the six Australian states, the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, announced on the steps of parliament in Canberra a three-month voluntary wage and price freeze. Cabinet colleagues and official advisers were stunnedCertainly the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) who is at the table, was stunnedthe idea had only been raised a few hours earlier, by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Dick Hamer, and was expected to get short shrift. Mr Fraser's Canberra two-step is only the latest sign of uncertainty in Australia's economic management. No sooner had the November devaluation been decided than the currency rate managers started hauling it back up to give what is now only a 12.2 per cent devaluation. Thisretreatwas acknowledgment that the Government had devalued too much in the first place, and was worried that it would fuel inflation rather than exports. How long before Mr Fraser's second thoughts on the freeze? So as I have said, not only have people poured scorn andridiculeon the idea here in Australia but also internationally it has done Australia l Statement, 5 May grave damage. I want to take the House step by step through the Minister's statement and show what has happened in Australia subsequent to the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I want to make the point that the 7 heads of government agreed that it was to be a voluntary wage and price freeze. The voluntary section of the price and wage freeze disappeared within about 48 hours as this Government announced that it was to be a mandatory wage freeze and a voluntary price freeze. Subseqiiendy the Victorian Premier, the South Australian'.' Premier, the New South Wales Premier, the tralian Council of Trade Unions and all other peak union councils withdrew from giving it support. The Minister told us in the opening paragraph of his statement that yesterday the submission from the national Government- a submission to put aside this national wage hearing for the It March quarter-was rejected by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Yet we have this statement before the House todaytellingus that there is still some hope for the wage-price freeze. This seems to fly in the face of the announcement by Mr George Polites, the employers' representative, that compames ought to get their applieral cations before the Prices Justification Tribunal quickly as possible. The Minister shakes his head, which seems to be a more sensible sign than anything contained in the document Let me put it this way: Perhaps ing his head because he thinks that it really does matter if one only gets one's appUcation before the PJT because the impact of the price increase does not matter until it takes effect But if we at the piece of arithmetic that is now in motion in aware Australia and if on the day the ConciUation Arbitration Commission were to give its decision that an across-the-board 2.3 per cent wage increase was to take place in Australia and if the PJT were to announce all the price increases the pipeUne, then obviously the wheel would started again. A new national wage case would be in the making immediately and there would be no 2.3 per cent in the next quarter because viously what the Government is doing is creating an oversupply of price increases which wtil hit in one go. It may happen on 23 May, it may hapties pen on 23 June or it may happen on 23 July, somewhere along the Une in the not too distant: future the Australian consumer is going to be with a deluge of price increases which will make prices appear as though they are skyrocketing every commodity in Australia. The Government seems to gain great comfort tion as to what from the fact that a Morgan gallop poU showed discussion that 75 per cent of the Australian people initially prices-wages supported the wage-price freeze. I suspect that one could cite the ANOP poll carried out for the Australian Broadcasting Commission which showed that just as many people beUeved the plexities freeze was a phoney as those who beUeved it might do some good. But the Australian people, having been hoaxed by the promises of this Government in November 1975, when it told them that all their economic problems would with a change of government, are looking for some recipe which will give a hope of getting Austhem out of the economic malaise Austraha may be in. Obviously, if a question is framed in a cerany tain way, one is gomg to assist the sort of response that is sought. It is a very dishonest way in which to conduct a poll. It is not thefirsttime the Morgan gaUup poll has been responsible for this type of dishonesty. is notorious for the last polls it took in 1972, the last of which showed that the coatition partners-the Liberal Party and the Country Partywere going to win the election that was due to be held. Prior to the display of thefiguresby the Morgan gaUup poll people, Mr Morgan publicly - told us that he was a great supporter of the LibParty, which certainly had influenced the as outcome of that poU. So here again we have Mr . Morgan, doing his part as a stooge for the - Government, giving a result of a poll showing that 75 per cent of the people supported a pricesthe Minister is shakwages freeze. Not only does aU the evidenceflyin the face of the result of that phoney poU, but as each day look passes and as consumers become increasingly - of the price increases which are talcing and place throughout Australia, more and more people are becoming disillusioned with this fairyland promise of the good that a prices and wages freeze will do. There can be no doubt that in a'pbU taken legitimately now would show that be more people are opposed to this move by the Government than are for it because, as I said, more people can see now that it was a compulobsory wage freeze and a voluntary price freeze. The Minister also tells us in his statement that us despite the inevitable difficulties and complexiAustralians saw in the joint call, nevertheless but , they responded to the national problem. One of the complaints that we have on this hit side of the House is that the Government has been - unable to give details of the impact of this bn' wages-prices freeze. For a month we have been asking the Government to give us some informait aU means. If after 15 minutes the Government can announce a freeze, one would have thought that it would have put a sufficient number of pubUc servants to work to give us some of the finer details of this wages-prices freeze. If, as the Minister claims, Australians saw aU the comand difficulties associated with it, they certainly were showing a far greater perception of the problems than did the Government. - One of the extraordinary features of the anend nouncement of the Prime Minister was that he made the announcement without any consultation with any of his colleagues, with perhaps the exception of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). Honourable members will have noticed that the Treasurer, who likes to get up and let the blood rush to his head on many of these economic issues, for the last month has been extraordinarily silent on the wages-prices freeze. We have not seen the Treasurer representing his Department, telling us what a great economic feat a prices-wages freeze would be. Obviously his Deartment is opposed to it. Other Ministers have ad it imposed upon them and are not quite sure what it means. They certainly cannot explain the difficulties associated with it. The Minister said that very quickly the Government felt the response of employers was one of acceptance of what the Government was trying to do. In fact, he stated: The freeze drew rapid support from employer groups throughout Australia. Of course, that sentence of the Minister's ment provides the key to the whole problem. In most circumstances-certainl y not all circumstances, as is evidenced by some other material I shall lay before the House a later-wh y would not the average employer give A a rapid response to such a suggestion? The delay suggestion was made a few weeks before the Mr Fraser next national wage hearing was due to complication mence. In all cases the employers had been able trade-off to make the price increases that they required for Mr thefirstquaner of the year. The wage case that He was to be conducted-it started yesterday-wa to catch up with the price increases that had taken place in the first quarter of this year. had the wage and salary earners of ing to get some justice from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commision in terms of a wage increase only to catch up with the price in January, February and March of this Now, if employers had already received their price increases, why would they not agree to a wage-price freeze if the essence of what was to abolish the March quarter hearing of the national wage case? That is exactly meant. Obviously, a lot of employers rushed in. Then the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs tells us that a lot of industries agree the wage-price freeze. They have been him. They have responded to the telexes, the telegrams and the telephone calls. But let us have a closer look at what that means. On Monday of this week, to the disgrace of this Government, found that in discussing the wage-price freeze hoursbehind closed doors employers and manufacturers were agreeing to the freeze which the whole community had to pay. There has been no denial of the stories which appeared in the newspapers on Monday of this week. Not one Minister has said that these stories are untrue. What are the stories? When the automobile manufacturers were called into discuss with the Government the price-wage freeze a Press statement was released after their meeting which said that everything was lovely in the garden and that the Government and the automobile manufacturers of Australia had reached agreement. That was the end of the Press statement. The Government came out of the meeting beating its chest and saying that it had the suppon of all these major employers-Genera l Motors-Holden's, Ford, Chrysler, the assemblers and the importers. The Government said that they all agreed that the price-wage freeze is a good thing for Australia. Then, a week later, out comes all the garbage. Out comes all the information about what has statebeen going on behind closed doors. Out comes all the things that the Australian people do not know about how this Government obtained agreement. I want to quote from the newsletter litde Inside Canberra of 29 April. It says: request by the Prime Minister to the States seeking a in exhaust emission control standards will provoke strong resistance from consumer and environment groups. last week undertook to ask the States to defer apof design rule 27E, the emission control rule, as a for support by car manufacturers of the price freeze. Fraser gave the undertaking last week in Canberra at a conference of motor industry leaders and senior Ministers. was told by the industry that the new emission control s standards to come into operation.",62

184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Corio also will resume his seat. What the honourable member for Oxley said in his point of order is not correct. At present Adermann, A E. the business before the House is the continuation Aldred.K.J. of the subject matter discussed by the House Baillieu, prior to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Bonnett, Malcolm Fraser). No motion has been moved by Bradfield, J.M. the Government in regard to any function or any Brown, other factor relating to this House. I suggest to Bungey, M.H. the honourable member for Oxley that the Nicholls, M. H. motion for the suspension of Standing Orders was moved on an incorrect assumption. I point out to him that when the motion for the adjournment of the debate was moved he was on his feet. He had not received the call. The call was to go to the Government side because there had been a speaker from the Government side and one from the Opposition. The Government side should, therefore, have received the call, which I gave to it. The honourable member for Oxley continued speaking even after the honourable member for of the Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) had moved that the debate be adjourned. It was at that stage I asked the honourable member for Oxley to resume his seat. He asked whether he could finish the point he was making. If he had been allowed to finish his point he could have been considered to have spoken on the Bill.

But the amend to ments in to to are matters of procedure. Basically decision they arise out of the problem that sometimes within reasons may be called for, reasons may not be called for or they may not be given or no notice may be given in certain circumstances of decisions. Where action is taken in relation to seeking either reasons or a review of a decision, it was felt that some amendments should be made in order to cover that type of situadon. The amendment No. (4)-claus e 17 of the Bill-amend s secdon 28 (1) of the principal Act. It enddes a person to apply within a prescribed rime to a decision-maker to obtain reasons for a decision. This provision does not work satisfactorily when a person who may be affected by a decision is not notified of the decision when it is made. The new sub-sections lA and lB which it is proposed to insert into section 28 have the effect that a decision-maker may refuse to give reasons if, first, a person who has been notified in writing of the decision does not apply for reasons within 28 days of being so notified and, second, a person who has not been notified in writing of the decision does not apply for reasons within a reasonable time. The Tribunal is to be empowered to determine the question whether the application for reasons has been made within a reasonable time. The amendment numbered (6)-claus e 18 of the Bill-ha s the effect of setting the prescribed time limit of 28 days for applying to the Tribunal for a review of the decision only where the applicant for review has received written notificauon of the decision or the decision-maker has failed to make the decision within thetimeallowed by law for the making of that decision. The other substantial amendment is that numbered (8)clause 18 of the Bill. The new sub-sections proposed to be inserted by this amendment provide for cases where first a prescribedtimewithin which an application must be made to the Tribunal for the review of the particular decision does not apply because no person was given written notice of the decision; and, second, the person seeking review had not himself been furnished with written notice of that decision although such a notice had been furnished to another person. In either case the application for review may be rejected by the Tribunal unless it has been made within a reasonable time after the making of the decision or the Tribunal is of the opinion that there are special circumstances that would justify it in entertaining the application for review. The purpose of the amendment numbered (9)-clause 19 of the Bill-is to permit a person in whose favour a decision has been made to intervene in proceedings before the Tribunal in which that decision is challenged by some other person. Mr Deputy Chairman, for those reasons I have moved the amendments standing in my name.",69
196,Mr JACOBI,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"The Opposition agrees with the amendments moved by the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) which are consequential and procedural amendments. But I raise again with the Attorney-General the matter I raised at the second reading stage. I ask him whether he recalls that I made a submission to the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). It is of some importance and I trust that this time we will understand one another on the issues involved. On 4 October I asked why determinations of the Insurance Tribunal are not made public once they have been advised to the Treasurer, the Insurance Commissioner and the company concerned. The response I received was as follows: While an authority to carry on insurance business granted by the Insurance Tribunal is required under the Insurance Act to be notified in the GazetteThat was the positionthere is no such provision in relation to refusals of authority, and legal advice indicates that it would be impracticable for this information to be published in a similar way under existing legislation. However, the proposed amendments to the Insurance Act which I foreshadowed earlier this year would provide, among other things, for the insertion of an appropriate provision in the Act to empower the Commissioner to publish notice of a refusal in the Gazette as soon as practicable after the expiration of the appeal period. It is proposed that the amending legislation will be introduced into Parliament during the 1977 autumn sittings. The point I impress upon the Attorney-General is that in this case, irrespective of the amendments earlier carried in the Act, the transfer for appeal has now gone to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The point I am making is simply that while there is an appeal against rejection of an authority to underwrite, the thing that concerns me is that if the appeal is upheld by the Tribunal against a company to authorise to underwrite insurance, that ought to be made public as quickly as possible after the decision. I am trying to convey the disastrous downstream effects which occuned over 2 years ago in Victoria where this was not undertaken. It has been mandatory on the Commissioner or the Tribunal to declare when authority has been granted but not when it has been rejected. The Attorney-General has more competence in this area than I have but I would like an assurance from him that if such an appeal is to lie in this particular case, immediate publication of its rejection is published either in a newspaper or in the Gazette.",70
197,Mr ELLICOTT,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL,"The honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) raises a point which relates to the Life Insurance Amendment Bill and the Insurance Amendment Bill. As I indicated in my reply in the second reading debate, it is open to the Tribunal to publish its reasons for a decision in either case. However, I will have the honourable member's question looked at and I will draw it to the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) to see whether any step can be taken in relation to it or whether there is any step which the Government thinks ought to be taken in relation to it. I will certainly have examined the problem which the honourable member raised.",70
198,Mr JACOBI,ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL," I wish the matter was as simple as that. What has to be understood is that an insurance company could have untold thousands of people holding policies and the difficulty and hardship arise because, if the right to underwrite insurance is rejected, it is not granted an authority.

(10) In clause 3 in the definition 'enactment' part (c) before' an Act', insert' such'. (11) In clause 9(1), omit 1903', substitute 'anything contained in any Act other than this Act'. These are procedural amendments, some of which are consequential. I shall deal with those which are more substantial, even though they are all procedural. The Bill provides that classes of decisions may be excluded by regulation from its ambit. Decisions so excluded are therefore excluded from those decisions referred to in the Bill as 'decisions to which this Act applies'. As the Bill stands, one result of excluding a class of decisions by regulation is that the supervisory jurisdiction of the State courts, otherwise excluded by clause 9, revives. That is because clause 9 excludes that jurisdiction only in relation to a decision to which the Act applies. The first amendment, which seeks to amend clause 3, together with the amendment I have moved to clause 19, would have the result that excluding a class of decisions by regulations does not have the effect of reviving the supervisory jurisdiction of State courts which, honourable members will recall, we are seeking to be rid of under clause 9. The supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court of Australia under section 75 (v) of the Constitution would, of course, remain unaffected. The second amendment is to clause 11. Clause 11 would require an application for review of a decision, other than a decision made by way of a report or recommendation, to be made within a prescribed period. The prescribed period is specified in sub-clause (3) of clause 11. The period of 28 days would begin to run from the day on which the person who seeks the review of the decision was notified in writing of the decision. These provisions would make no profollow- vision for the time within which application for review should be made where the person seeking review has not been notified in writing of the deare not subject to judicial review cision. The effect of this amendment is that the prescribed period of 28 days does not apply where the person seeking review was not notified in writing of the decision. I now turn to amendment No. 3. The new subsections proposed to be inserted by this amendment provide for the cases where, first, the prescribed period of 28 days for applying for review of a decision does not apply because no person was given written notice of the decision, and secondly, the person seeking review had not of the courts of the States in himself been furnished with written notice of the decision, although such a notice had been given to some other person. In either case, the application for review may be rejected by the court unless it has been made within a reasonable time after the making of the decision. 'section 39 of the Judiciary Act I draw the attention of the Committee to amendment No. 6. The purpose of clause 13 is to give a person entitled to apply to the court for a review of a decision the right to be given written reasons for the decision. This is a most important amendment. The effect of the new sub-clauses inserted by this amendment would be that a request for reasons may be refused by the decision-maker where, firstly, the person requesting reasons had been notified in writing of the decision and had not made his request within 28 days of being so notified; and secondly, the person requesting reasons had not been notified in writing of the decision and had not made his request within a reasonable time after the decision was made. The court is to be empowered to rule on the question whether a request was made within a reasonabletimeor not. The purpose of the additional amendments Nos 1 to 3 is to exclude from the ambit of the Bill decisions of State officials exercising powers under State laws applied in relation to Commonwealth places by the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report-by leave-adopted . Bill (on motion by Mr Ellicott)-by leaveread a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Debate resumed from 4 May, on motion by Mr Nixon: That the Bill be now read a second ume.",72
203,Mr JULL,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Last night when the debate on this Bill was interrupted I was speaking about the fact that the Joy report had been completed and submitted to the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) for consideration by him, his Department and the 2 State governments involved. We had debated the situation of railways in Australia and had decided that rail services were still most essential. But we did admit that they had to be subsidised to a very great extent. To expect them to be converted into profit making bodies by some magic stroke was beyond the realms of reality. We must continually be looking for that much needed improvement in efficiency to provide more attractive and economic services in our ways. The Australian Railways Research Development Organisation has a very real part to play in co-ordinating State and Commonwealth operated services and in giving advice on technical and policy planning for Australian railcates ways. Although a great deal has been achieved in Australia recent years there is still a very great need for seem to beand rationalisation and particularly the modernisHowever, because ation of our systems. The railways with aging rolling stock which contributes to tions of the Joy report freight present inefficiencies and high maintenance charges. There is a great need to upgrade much time to come. It would seem that if the Joya long of the track and there can be delays because outdated freight handling systems. It has also been estimated that there is a shortage of some 3000 freight wagons in Australia for use on interstate systems. In the report of the DepartTransport ment of Transport for 1973-74 it that 20 per cent more freight wagons required as so much of the potential rail freight had to be diverted to other forms of transport. However, it would be unfair to say that railways are a complete disaster. In the last years significant advances have been made. It is possible now to travel between all States on standard gauge, thanks to the Government acttralian ing on the recommendations of the Wentworth Committee. Vast sums of money have been spent in the upgrading of existing standard gauge lines. The dieselisation of all systems is complete Third Reading there have been vast improvements in the signalling and control systems within the networks of our various railways. There is, of course, a future for the railways. Rail continues to be best suited to the carriage of freight over middle and long distances and is certainly a very real force in the Second Reading handling of bulk freight. As the energy crisis looms before us we are reminded that the railways do give a better return on fuel consumption compared with road transport, using less than one-third per tonne kilometre of fuel. As far as passenger traffic is concerned, walking and cycling are the only modes of transport which use less energy than do the railways. Australian National Railways is in passenger transport business as well with more than 130 000 passengers using the trans-Australia line in 1974-75. We also now have an obligation to look after the interests of passengers travelling in both South Australia and Tasmania. Tasmanian Railways, of course, now provide virtually only freight services with the Tasman Limited from Hobart to Wynyard being the exception. One wonders what can be done to improve the Tasmanian system, bearing in mind that its has narrow gauge, the short haul nature of rail traffic moved and the type of construction that was devised for the railtracks. Tasmanian Railways has taken an absolute hammering from road operators during the past 10 years or so. It is interesting to note that the Joy report indithat the Tasmanian system is the worse in not that, on the surface, there would future for Tasmanian Railways. of confidence in the timber are bedevilled industry and in the bulk could lines the suggesmean that Tasmanian Railways could be with us for report of is accepted the 2 passenger services operating Tasmania would cease in the not too distantin future. The South Australian situation is somethe what different with the South Australian was suggested ment, still Minister, having a under the terms of the agreegreat deal of say in the future were of that system concerning the reduction of services and the closurenumber of lines, the of people who are employed within the South Australian our system. I sympathise with the Minister for 20 Transport (Mr Nixon). It must be an extremely difficult situation at times for the Federal Minisa ter for Transport to deal with his South Auscounterpart. It would seem that some of the accusations that come from that State are beyond the realms of reality. One of the most recent of those particular matters concerned the alleged and reneging of the Commonwealth on the transfer which we are debating tonight. Another was his claim that the Commonwealth did not intend to go ahead with the Tarcoola-Alice Springs Railway. Both have proved to be completely false. One would hope that in the future there will be much closer co-operation with the South Australian Minister. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the Commonwealth was ripped off in its deal with the South Australian Railways but it is now up to the Commonwealth to make the most of the situation. The fact that the Minister for Transport, even though the Commonwealth has a financial responsibility, must have the concurrence of the South Australian Transport Minister to close lines on reduced services could be a good example of just how that co-operation could work. If nothing more, the Commonwealth, not being so closely involved with the specific situation, could be in a better position to be more objective in measures that politically could be difficult for a State government to face, such as the closure of lines or the reduction of personnel. Quite often when a line is closed it will bring howls of protest from the citizens affected, even though half a dozen people may have been using that particular service. Obviously, there are areas in the legislation before us tonight which are of particular interest to employees of the railways in South Australia and in Tasmania. For example, it will certainly give employees in South Australia the option to join the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. Clause 13 repeals section 54 of the Act. Section 54 set the retiring age at 65 years, with the option to retire at 60 years, with the permission of the Railways Commissioner. All employees will come under the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This matter has been discussed in the debate. The amendments are important to these new areas of operation of the Australian National Railways. I support these amendments and look forward to the speedy passage of this Bill.",74
204,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS," I shall not delay the House on this legislation, but there are one or two aspects of it and of the remarks made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) in his second reading speech to which I should like to draw attention. Thefirstclearly is that the position of the 2 State railway systems which are being taken over is most likely not greatly different from other State railway systems. A rundown has been experienced over the last 20 years, to the extent that the finances, maintenance and general equipment of Australian railway systems are far below the standards which ought to be accepted. I think that the House is well aware that the position of railways has changed dramatically in the last 30 years. It has been subject to and caught up with technological change. At the time when expansion took place in State railway systems and very heavy expenditures were involved, motor vehicles, which are better adapted to short-haul transport, were evolving to a stage at which they competed on very favourable terms with the railways. They had the advantage of flexibility and mobility which were not available to railways. They also had a secondary advantage in that the persons operating that type of transport were not required to build and maintain their own roads. In the main, the railway systems of Australia have serious problems with regard to maintenance, cost cutting and, as the second reading speech of the Minister indicates, commercial operation. I should like to believe that commercial operation is possible, but there is no evidence that any railway system in the world is capable of commercial operation if it is to provide the levels of service which warrant continued operation, both socially and economically. Australian railway systems are now at a point at which they will have to consider rolling stock. Diesel locomotives were introduced into Australia some 24 or 25 years ago. The original diesel locomotives are still operative and are well into the multiple millions of miles of operation. The fuel situation in the world would suggest that whilst diesel locomotives are far more economic as far as operation, installation and capital cost are concerned, electrification of main trunk railways in Australia will have to be considered as a change of energy source, to conserve the fuel which they are currently using, namely dieselene. This will mvolve an extremely high capital cost, and one which certainly will not be met by State railway systems. It is also most likely time that the Commonwealth looked at a further extension of the standard gauge system in Australia, to provide communications not only between Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane, but on a wider basis. The question is whether railways have a future- I think they have-as bulk carriers and movers of large quantities of goods over long distances. There certainly is no prospect of railways operating as door-to-door carriers on their own. It is possible for them to be utilised in conjunction with private transport operations. For a number of years containerisation has been used in co-operation with transport groups on a carriage pickup basis. I think an event which happened in Sydney not very long ago highlights the problems which all railway systems are now facing. It alarms me to read suggestions that the lowest paid section of the railway work force-the repairers, the gangers and the track supervisors-ar e being exposed to blame in the case of the Granville railway accident when, in fact, the major blame rests with those who provide and those who control the finances.Despite the rates of pay paid for these necessary services-traditionall y they are extraordinarily low-the employees concerned are very conscientious. But they are only able to do work within the scope which they are allowed by factors of time and direction. Over a number of years cost cutting in railway systems in Australia has become a major factor and one which this House, the Minister for Transport and those responsible for railways ought to be considering. Whilst there has been one accident which highlights one set of points, anyone who takes the trouble to walk along any stretch of railway in Australia, whether it be heavily used or otherwise, will find that maintenance is below par. Many stretches of UneMr Bourchier-Like your golf.",75
205,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"They are below par and they are dangerous. They are dangerous because the cost of operating railways has gone beyond the capacity of those who are responsible to meet that cost. The importance of raUway services is not recognised in either this Parliament or State parliaments. They are looked on very much as being vehicles to carry someone's goods on a subsidised basis but not to carry those goods which normally would cany a high freight rate. This is a disadvantage in the freedoms of individuals. But the other major transport systems in Australia, both road and air, are very heavily subsidised by this Government. Despite complaints about cost recovery etc., this Government provides considerable funds for those transport systems; but the railways receive almost nothing. There are no Commonwealth State railways grants as there are road grants, the road grants provide a basic transport system on which goods are conveyed. Without those funds interstate highways would not carry the commercial traffic which exists. In this instance the Commonwealth is finalising the taking over of 2 of Australia's State railway systems. If that will mean that those railway systems wdl be adequatelyfinancedand will be able to provide the technical levels which should be available in this system for efficient and safe operation, that is a good thing. If it only means that the State budgets are going to be relieved of providing funds or that the Commonwealth will become Uncle Scrooge in place of a smaller Uncle Scrooge, squeezing the systems and forcing cost cutting, it will not be a good thing. The Minister is in a posidon in which he has to convince the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) that the railways are worth feeding. Mr Martyr-He is a good Minister, too.",76
206,Mr SCHOLES,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"That may or may not be so; I am not going to argue about that one way or the other. At the moment the airlines do not think so because he has asked them to pay for their services. The States do not think so at the moment because he wants them to pay for their roads. What I am suggesting is that he has some responsibility to make some contribution towards the cost of bringing our railway systems up to scratch and to give serious consideration to the long-term conversion of the energy source for the main trunk railway lines from the diesel fuel to electricity. There is some electrification in Australia. If major electrification took place it would enable a better use of those sohd fuels which are available in Australia to generate power and would provide a saving of scarce energy resources. As I said, I do not want to delay the House long. I think the Minister for Transport will understand my remarks. The railways systems of Australia, particularly in Victoria, the State in which I live, have been starved of adequate funds because of the high cost of operation, because of the degree of subsidised traffic which they must bear without that commitment being met from Treasury sources in the areas in which they operate and because they have been seen to be an easy way of avoiding expenditure. In Victoria for 10 years running the same amount of capital funding, in cash terms, was provided to the Victorian Railways. No business organisation could have operated on the same basis. This Parliament has a responsibility for the yet national transport systems. The road systems, whether or not the Minister provides the funds which the States believe he should provide, are not capable of expansion to meet our future long term transport needs. Bulk carriers are necessaiy and the railways provide the most efficient means of bulk carriage of goods over long distances within this continent. The railway systems must be equipped in order to deal with that problem into the future and should be so structured that they are able to conserve those energy sources in Australia which will be in short supply by using alternative energy sources which are available but which can be properly utilised only by the expenditure of substantial capital funds.",76
207,Mr MILLAR,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"The Australian National Railways Amendment Bill now before the House has been introduced to finalise the transfer of the South Australian nonmetropolitan and Tasmanian railway systems to the Commonwealth. The transfer agreement which the Commonwealth, Tasmania and South Australia entered into on 1 July 1975 provides for an interim period of approximately 12 months during which detailed arrangements for the transfer of staff and operations to the Australian National Railways can be completed. The introduction of this Bill demonstrates the responsible attitude of this Government towards stable government. The agreement entered into by the Commonwealth and the 2 States has aspects which could well tempt the Government to seek to abandon the arrangement. However, it has decided, notwithstanding its misgivings as to the original propriety of the acdon, to honour the commitment of the former Government. The consequence of this takeover by the Commonwealth is that South Australia and Tasmania have been relieved of a heavy financial burden relating to the perennial loss situation in which the rail services were conducted. Although States have been subjected to readjustments in funding through the Grants Commission, Loan Council programs and other financial assistance grants, the fact remains that the participant States are, as a result of the new arrangement, in a financially superior position whilst the balance of the Australian States will be required to contribute to Commonwealth funding for the operation of these railways. It is no wonder that the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) was moved to remark that the 2 State Premiers were laughing all the way to the bank. Of course, it must be acknowledged that the previous Government invited all the States to transfer their railways to the Commonwealth. Whilst this may have constituted a passing temptation to the States, they could be excused for a high degree of apprehension as to the ultimate intention of the government of the day as State interests might be affected. Nevertheless the transfer is proceeding and it requires us to give some thought to the role of railways. It is significant that the Australian National Railways has assumed this additional burden in a loss situation. The statement of profit and loss for the year ending 30 June 1975, the most recent report available to the Parliament, shows an operating loss for the year of $14,479,427 and a carried forward accumulated loss of $41.5m. This is a substantial sum of money. It is sobering to read in the Joy report on Tasmanian railways the bald statement that the Tasmanian railways, notwithstanding the adoption of any recommendations incorporated in the report will never make a profit. With the exception of a few high paying lines most prominent in Queensland-this is as a result of the wise development of the State by the Queensland Government-whic h carry high loadings of mineral ores to seaboard ports, most railways are now in a similar situation. Those railways will never make a profit. This leaves us in a situation where we must contemplate a continuance of our escalating losses or assess the role of railways within Australia. It is imperative that in assessing the role of the railways we see them in an intermodal context. Of course this lends considerable substance to the insistence of the Minister for Tranport in respect of the abandonment of the Bureau of Roads that it is essential that the transport problems of Australia be considered in the whole and that the Bureau of Transport Economics is best equipped to discharge that obligation. We have the further consideration in a highly topical context at the moment of our finite fuel reserves. The world faces a critical situation in respect of oil suppUes. In the end this could well affect the mobility of the transport in this nation. On the east-west route from Perth through to Adelaide and the eastern States road transport is escalating year by year at a prodigious rate. It is the impossible for the railways to compete with the present situation. Therefore it is essential for the Government to determine where the Umited resources of this nation, notwithstanding the huge potential we contain, must be directed to the best purpose. I agree with the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) that no form of transport will shift freight at a lower rate per ton than the railways. It seems unbelievable that we should contemplate a situation where if the Government does not proceed with the electrification of the railways system, we could be back in the age of steam where the transport of this nation will rely heavily on steam locomotion. It does seem extraordinary but this is a very real threat to the transport of this nation. To maintain mobility we must address ourselves to the role of the railways in the future. Unless we do so the loss situation of these railways will become an increasing burden on the taxpayer. Certainly this country has been burdened with the lack of foresight of our forebears who abandoned the prospect of standardisation of railways. As a consequence we are burdened with the cost of transferring freight at exchange points throughout the nation. Clearly, to standardise our railways over the vast length of our system is beyond the resources of this nadon. We have bogie exchange points throughout the system but they are achieving less in results than was hoped; not simply because of the physical limitations of the bogie exchange techniques. In many respects, again as the honourable member for Corio pointed out, it is occurring as a consequence of less than efficient management in higher echelons. There are reports of wagons arriving at bogie exchange points for the trans-continental route which are clearly not in condition to make the long distance crossing. Therefore instead of a simple bogie exchange arrangement it is necessaiy to put the wagons aside and to delay freight which further discourages the users of the railways to persist in that practice. This has the effect of transferring these users to road services. Clearly the railway systems of this country must be given their due and be recognised as an essential element of its transportation requirements, There is an unbelievable scope for containerisation and capsuling of freight for fast and cheap transport. It is tragic that over the years the railway system has been outglamouriseti by other forms of transport such as heavy road transport and air transport. As a consequence the whole railway system has become tired. While many members of the railway unions apply themselves conscientiously and with considerable diligence to their jobs, there is a great cloud of despair hanging over the whole system. Somehow or other we have to imbue them with a faith in their activities and a determination to rise to better efforts, to take advantage of the opportunities which month by month and year by year are increasing in number. I for one do not despair of the prospect that again the Australian railway systems might assume the important role that they previously played. As the honourable member for Corio pointed out, we all have a heavy responsibility to see that in the inter-modal transport systems the best advantage is taken of the resources available to Australia. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill.",77
208,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS," The Australian National Railways Amendeffect. ment Bill before the House proposes a series amendments to the Austrahan National Railthe ways Act which take up the agreements that have been entered into at this point between the Australian National Railways Commission the various trade unions with members employed by the Commission, together with a ments couple of other minor adjustments to the Act that probably should have been made with the 1975 amendments. The Opposition supports the Bill. We shall support the amendment that the Minister will be bringing forward at the Committee stage. That has been brought forward at our instigation, once again to fill up a loophole which, after all, the best draftsmen sometimes overlook. Before dealing with the Bill at greater length I wish to refer to some of the amendments now proposed. One deals with contracts. In the 1975 agreements the Commissioner of Railways was required to get the Minister's approval for contracts entered into, for both the carriage of goods and the purchase of goods or equipment. We do not oppose the amendment but I think the provision should be watched, particularly that section dealing with the Commission entering into contracts for the carriage of goods. I do not agree that the provision was omitted by an oversight. As far as I am concerned it was left in the legislation deliberately so that the Minister could have the right of overseeing, if need be, large contracts for the carriage of goods. We will not oppose the deletion of this provision but the result will be watched with interest to see its effect. We support the agreements that have been reached on superannuation, retirement, appeals and all these matters. I am disappointed that at present there are still 24 unions in the Australian National Railways system. I make an appeal to the trade unions to endeavour to reduce that number, to bring about amalgamations within the industry, because I believe it is to thenadvantage and to the advantage of the transport industry, the Australian National Railways and the railway system as a whole. There are far too many trade unions in Australia today. It took the various unions associated with what is now the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union years of agitation within those unions to bring about amalgamation. I can recall as a young man joining the Boilermakers Union before the War. Even in those days there was talk about amalgamation. It never seemed to get any closer and then all of a sudden it clicked and the amalgamation of a number of unions has taken I think this is a great advantage to industry of and to the unions. Every honourable member on Government side who has spoken in this debate has made reference to the fourth paragraph of the second reading speech of the Minister for and Transport (Mr Nixon). He said: But that does not mean we were happy with the arrangemade. In fact I have made it very clear that in my opinion the Whitlam Government was taken to the cleaners, whilst the 2 State Premiers laughed all the way to the We entered into an agreement with our eyes wide open. We knew what we were doing. as we were concerned, the agreement which was mutually entered into. There was no arm twisting. There were no standover tactics.

I ask the supporters of the country. It represents 10 per cent Government: What are the South Australian and national product. The expenditure on Tasmanian governments? I thought they were in part of Australia. I thought that the money that was paid to those State governments helped and Transport assisted the people of those States. From time to time, I have read in the Budget Papers of sums offorce. something like $360m going overseas to aid industries people there. So, why is the Government bitchhas a major ing about paying a litde bit of money to industries throughout Australian States to help them to get over their again industries complain financial problems at that time-and they did petitive with imports because have financial problems at that time?The the Labor Government was not made only to thing about that. The same can be to South Australia and Tasmania; it was made to export freight rates are concerned. TheasAusall of the States.

What board about the Bill that was dealt with this week which provided for a handout of $360m on the reassessment of company stocks and the reasonable $ 1,000m that the Government has handed out by way of industrial development grants? That all paid out to private individuals and compames. MrMartyr-TheCIA.",79
210,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"The honourable dardisation. member was the chief agent of the Central standardisation Intelligence Agency in Western Australia; so he should not start to interject. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) dealt with him last night. The position is that the money to which I have just made reference is being paid out to private individuals and companies. All this money went to the people of South Australia and Tasmania. Why does the Minister not tell the truth when he talks about going on with agreement? The Fraser Government tried to undo the agreement but the agreement was well and truly sewn up by the Labor Government. The Fraser Government has not been able to undo one of the many things that we put through bank. in relation to transport. It has not been able to upset one of them in the High Court. Everything As farthat we did was done legally and was one constitutionally. limited amount oftimeis left to me and I do to be side-tracked about payments by honourable member for Swan the of the matter are that major industries in this of the gross transport 1975-76 was something like $4,500m. like 35 000 provides employment for something people or 6 per cent of the total work So when we are talking about transport we are talking about one of the most important in this country.

When the Labor Government came to office it was faced with the task in the transportfieldof trying to reduce freight rates right across the throughout Australia and to have each industry accept its true responsibility. We have seen in the transport field one of the most unmisallocations of resources that it would be possible to have in any one countiy. In is the period between the end of the 1939-45 War until we became the Government, the Parhament made available for roads some $3,007m. On the other hand it made available for railways only $248m. In the main, that went into rail stanLet us have a look at the effect of rail in the one short section connecting Sydney and Melbourne. I give great credit to the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) for the work he did over the years in relation to rail standardisation together with the late member for East Sydney, Eddie Ward. They of were great advocates of rail standardisation in this country. In the year prior to standardisation on the Sydney-Melbourne run the total freight the carried was 1.27 million tons. In 1965 it had climbed to 1.92 million tons. By 1970-71 it had grown to 2.64 million tons. The $248m for rail standardisation was spent well, not only on the Sydney-Melbourne line but on other similar rail projects right throughout Australia. There has been a great advantage to the Australian people in more efficient transport as a result of people getting on with the job. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr as Millar) talked about the problems in did to Queensland. The marshalling yards of are an utter disgrace to the Queensland Government. For a long period that Government has refused to do anything about them. It has refused to accept any of the reasonable offers made the Australian Government. The Labor Governtransferred ment made a number of offers to the Queensland Government to take over and build a new cussions, marshalling yard so that wagons would not idle in the yards in Brisbane. With regard to traffic from Melbourne, on a number of agree occasions single voyage permits had to be issued for the carriage of Australian freight in foreign ships because the Victorian railways would not make rolling stock available to go to Brisbane it lay up there for unreasonabletimesdue to inefficiencies of Mr Bjelke-Petersen's Governalong ment and the harm he does to this country, particular to its railways. Mr Martyr-It is a banana republic.",79
211,Mr CHARLES JONES,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"It is a banana because republic, as the honourable member says. The Labor Government was faced with the responsiEurope. bility of what was happening at thattimeto ways in Australia. In 1971 there was a capital investment in railways throughout Australia of approximately $2,100m. The annual turnover of was $584m. In the 5-year period to 1971-72 the railways collectively lost in the vicinity of Grants, concessions and the like cost State governments another $310m, so that in that 5-year period the railways of Australia were ing approximately $650m. At present Australian railways are losing that amount almost annually systems. because of their state and the need to build them up. We were faced with that responsibility. Labor Government pledged to do something take about transport, to reduce freight rates and to make rail traffic more attractive to industry that it could get on with the job. The then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, made an offer in his 1972 policy speech to take over all the State railway systems. The true picture is that Sir Henry Bolte had made an offer to John Gorton when he was the Prime Minister. Sir Henry said: 'You can have our railways.' Not to be outdone, Sir Robert Askin said: 'You can have the New even South Wales railways as well.' When the Whitlam Labor Government put the proposition to them Sir Henry Bolte would not be in it but New South Wales Government agreed to enter into discussions. Those discussions went on right up to early 1975, when the prize idiot of New South Wales, Tom Lewis, was elected Premier of that State. Honourable members opposite know well as I do what the Liberal Party as a whole him later. It kicked him out; it stabbed him Brisbane in the back during the night. The New South Wales Minister for Transport at thattimeagreed in private discussions with me by that the New South Wales railways should be to the Australian Government. I asked him: 'Before we sit down to enter into disare we wasting our time?' The answer lie was: 'No, you are not wasting yourtime'.He said: ' I am confident that Sir Robert Askin will to the transfer'. The same applied in Western Australia until Sir Charles Court was elected Premier. The Western Australian rail system would have been transferred to the Australian as national rail system. The former Labor Govern the ment in Western Australia was prepared to go with a transfer of State railways, as was the in South Austrahan Government in the middle of the continent, and one of the eastern States, New South Wales, under a Liberal Government, likewise would have gone on with the proposition it could see the advantages of having one Australian system of railways like that in The best railway system in the world is railin Europe. All the European Economic Community works together with Switzerland and Austria. The railways of these countries are part what is virtually an integrated rail system. In Canada there are 2 rail systems. One system is $340m. run by the Canadian Federal Government, not by a series of provincial governments, and the other is run by a private company. These counlostries realise the advantages of having one rail system instead of a federal system and six State The The decision of the Whitlam Government to over State railways was one of the most progressive decisions ever made on rail transport in so this country this century. If the Minister for Transport wants to improve transport he needs to do more than he is at the moment. He is only carrying on the initiatives that the Labor Government started. He has not introduced one transport initiative in the 18 months he has been Minister. He has only carried on the programs which the Labor government left him. He has demolished a few Labor initiatives such as the Road Safety and Standards Authority. He did that at atimewhen $ 1,000m a year is lost to the the countiy because people are killed and maimed inroadaccidents. He demolished this Authority that was set up following a recommendation made to the Labor Government by a committee set up by a previous Liberal-Country Party Government, namely, the Expert Group on Road Safety. This committee recommended an authority which the Minister has since abolished because it was set up by the Labor Government. The Chairman of the Authority said to me on one occasion: 'The Liberals could have done it and did not. You could have done it and you did'. That is the difference between the Labor Party in government and the Liberal Party. The Liberal Government wants to demolish everything. It does not want to enter into its responsibilities and get on with the job of providmember ing a better rail system. Throughout Australia today there are various government systems and various railway gauges. The gauge in Queensland is 3 feet 6 inches, it is 5 feet 3 inches in Victoria and part of South Australia. We have the crazy situation of rail exchanges and all the rest of it. The Minister should get on with the job instead of getting Joy to bring out a report on the standardisation of the line between Adelaide and Crystal Brook. form. The Minister is doing his damnedest to pull standardisation apart and to stop those responsible from getting on with the job. When he was member of the Government previously he could not get an arrangement with the South Austhey trahan Government to build the Tarcoola-Alice Springs railway or to bring about the standardisPremier ation of the link line between Adelaide and Crysall tal Brook. We in the Labor Government were able to achieve that in a few months because adopted a reasonable attitude and the South Australian Government did likewise. In the 18 months that the Minister has been in office only slowed down work on the Tarcoola-Alice Springs line to the detriment of people in Central Austraha, in AUce Springs, and Darwin. Much the same can be said about the Adelaide to Cryswith tal Brook line. That job could have been well and truly under way by now if it had not been for the bungUng of the Mmister. We support the legislation because it continues to ratify the things which we did in government. It will bring about a better rail system in Australia and a more economical form of he transport. The industry will be in a position provide a more efficient and a much cheaper tem of transport. This will help industry Australia. It will help the people of this country get a better standard of living because that is what cheaper freight can do. It is a most tant industry, employing many people and abAustraUa sorbing a great deal of capital in any one year.",80
212,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,81
213,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"in reply-I welcome the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) back into the Parliament. In some 18 months in Opposition he has been far too silent. It seems that the Opposition is now starting to get a voice in transport matters. The whole thrust of the honourable member's remarks was based on an assumption that the Labor Party Government when in power would achieve cheaper freight rates. That was the thrust of what the honourable said. He said the Labor Party pledged to obtain cheaper freight rates. I remind the honourable member of one freight rate. In 18 months freight rates to Tasmania went up by 67 S while >er cent under the guiding hand for cheaper reight rates of the honourable member for Newcastle. I have never heard such nonsense in my time in the Parliament. I welcome the honourDr able member back to transport debates. At least there will be some life in them if he maintains his He talked about the agreement between himself and the Ministers tor Transport in South a Australia and Tasmania and the Prime Minister and the Premiers of those States. He said that agreed on these proposals. Of course they agreed. Cannot every honourable member see Dunstan and Minister Virgo laughing the way to the bank. The fact is that they took you to the cleaners, Charlie, and you know it. we Why does the honourable member not admit that? Is it any wonder there was an agreement. It is Uke having a bad penny and selling it for 20c he has down the street. Good heavens above! AU the honourable member for Newcastle did was to buy out the South Australian railways large sums of money. But did that or will that lead to cheaper freight? It will only lead to cheaper freight rates, having regard to the high recognised capital which is now put into the system, if the Australian National Railways can, by having a cold, hard look at the system, achieve more efficiency. It is no thanks to the honourable member for Newcastle if that is secured because paid a high price for the system. As for the to price he paid for the Tasmanian system, I think systhe less we say about that, the better. The in honourable member said that he made an offer to all States. But with the other States he did not get to the dotted line on the cheque. He was over imporgenerous to his Labor confreres in South knowing that they had a couple of elections coming up. He wanted to buy them out of trouble. But he did not get to the dotted line the cheque with Victoria and New South Wales. What else did he do while he was being so generous to the railway system in South Australia? In a 3-year road program he cut port to shires in Victoria from $ 16.1m in the year of my program to $4.7m in the third year his program. That is how the honourable berfinancedhis railway system. Mr Charles Jones-That was the Bureau of complication Roads report.",81
214,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"No, it was not the Bureau Roads report at all. I suggest that the honourable member have another look at thefigures.He went far beyond the Bureau of Roads report. complained because we reintroduced the superbe phosphate subsidy, totally ignoring the fact that the Industries Assistance Commission rectransferred ommended its continuation. But because of some blind prejudice or blind ideological hang-up using Dr Coombs as an axeman, the Labor Government cut out more assistance to industry, which is the fundamental starting point for the development of this country, than did government in 30 years. That was the sorry record. All this was done so that he could give the ofThe Premiers of South Australia and Tasmania a was golden handshake. I freely get out of the agreements. The taxpayers were other day. in done in the eye by the golden handshake that the ex-Minister gave to those 2 States. I think the lesstributed he says about these matters the better. One other point I should make is that the honourable member for Newcasde accused as Minister of taking over his programs ing no initiative at all. He ignored the fact that the national highways program was laid on doorstep when he came into office in 1972, all he had to do was institute it. He ignored the fact that the urban transport program was a report that was lying on my desk ready for him to pick up and implement when his Party came into power. He ignored the fact that in the road area I had had a study done which recommended setting up an authority, and all he did was pick it up and implement it. I cannot think of one separate initiative, apart from ing out with a golden handshake the railways in South Australia and Tasmania, that the exthink Minister ever took. However, I welcome him back to the debate. Yesterday several members raised a number of questions which need answering. The honourof able member for Shortland (Mr Morris), who led for the Opposition, asked why we had canmay celled the second rolling stock program for on wagons. I should tell him that the canceUation foUowed advice to a meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council from the rail group which had been considering the matter and besupUeved that the order was not required at this last stage. I trust that answers the honourable memof ber's query. He also asked why the Australian memNational Railways annual report for 1975-76 had not been tabled. Again, this relates to the Australian and of having taken over the South Tasmanian systems, which are still being operated by the States on behalf of the of Australian National Railways. Their annual accounts are prepared and are then subjected to State audit. The Commonwealth AuditorHe General has requested that composite accounts prepared covering the total system, and there has been a problem m the valuation of assets for equipment and buildings, particularly in South Australia, where the problems and were magnified because of the spht between metropolitan and non-metropolitan railways. This work is nearly completed, and the report is close at hand. I hope that I will be able to present any it to the Parliament within the month. honourable member raised the question rail electrification by Sofrerail, and that matter also raised by the honourable member for confess that I tried to Newcastle A a question to me in the House the report has been received and disto State Transport Ministers and aU railway commissioners and will come under consideration in the normal ATAC forum. Mr Charles Jones-On what date in March me did your send the letter?

215,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Dr Jenkins)Order! With the last 2 speakers I allowed some latitude with interjections. Now that the Minister is answering questions, the House would be betsafety ter served if he were heard in silence.",82
216,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"I have provoked him, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I apologise. The honourbuyable member and I had a decent joust when I sat on that side of the House and he sat on this side. I it only fair that he be given a chance to joust back. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis) raised the question of the increase in the Leigh Creek coal freight rate. He would know that the coal has been carried for a number years at a loss. The freight rate negotiation has been going on for a number of years. Indeed, it have oeen carried on through the period of 800 my predecessor. Certainly I have been pushing as hard as possible to get a sensible freight rate. Negodadons are still going on, and only today I met with the South Australian Minister for Mines, Mr Hudson, to discuss the matter further. The honourable member also asked about the possibility of selling off houses owned by ANR in Port Augusta to the retiring employees who are occupants on retirement. Mr Wallis-All employees.",82
217,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"A11 employees, if you like, but It the answer is still the same. The ANR dise its houses which are let to its employees and has indicated in the past that the provision of housing at a low rental is an inducement to ing the employees it wants there. If it lets houses go from the stock it would have to build more and therefore is unable to agree to the proposition put forward by the nonourabie member. The question of ex gratia payments to the Port Augusta Council in Ueu of rates raised by the honourable member for Grey. I equal to: should point out that the ANR basis of ex gratia payments in lieu of rates is for ANR residences front council streets, and 66% per cent of fuU rates when residences streets owned by and maintained at cost to the ANR. They also pay road moiety charges on top of of that. In respect of properties used for funcbeing tional purposes, such as workshops, stations and tion marshalling yards, the Australian ways is not required to pay rates and this is sistent with the practice in relation to other monwealth instrumentalities. I thank honourable members for the contributions they have made. I will have the debate combed through and if although other points were raised which I have missed I has been exchanged will get an answer to the honourable members Treasurer and the South who raised them. I shall move at the appropriate Perhaps at thetimeI discussed time the amendment suggested by the him it had not reached the South Opposition. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 13-by leave-take n together.",83
218,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"There are a number of points ranging over clauses 1 to on which I seek some assurance from the ter for Transport (Mr Nixon). I referfirstlyto clause 6. Whilst the explanatory memorandum fairly specific in pointing out that the purpose this amending clause is to preserve those users of South Australian rail to any tages that they were enjoying with freights at time of the transfer, I draw the attention House to that part of the South Australian RaUways Transfer Agreement which reads: The Commission will ensure that, in general, fares, freight rates and other charges in respect of the non-metropolitan railways and services shall be maintained, on and after the commencement date, at levels not less favourable to users than those levels generally applying on the railways of States other than South Australia and where, in general, fares, freight rates and other charges at the commencement date have established a relative advantage to the users, that advantage shall not be diminished. seems fairly clear that that is the intent of the does subsiamending clause in the Bill. I turn now to clause 11 which provides for procedures to be followed in the collection of supersecurannuation contributions whether in respect of the State funds or the Federal superannuation scheme. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in the complementary South Australian legislation, the Superannuation Act Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976 sets out that the reimbursement was by the Commonwealth to the States shall be (i) the Commonwealth liability in relation to each full rates when prescribed contributor; (ii) the excess amount payable in relation to each front prescribed contributor; (iii) annual amounts agreed upon between the Treasurer the State and the Treasurer of the Commonwealth as the reasonable cost of administering this Act in relato each prescribed contributor and each pension payable under this Act to or in relation to prescribed National RaUcontributors. conThe point I wish to make is that there do not Comseem to be complementary conditions in the amending clause now before the Committee, made. I understand from inquiries I have through the Minister that correspondence between the Australian Australian Treasurer. this matter with Australian Minister for Transport. I simply seek an assurance from the Minister that those conditions will be agreed to and that the information will go ahead in the manner which was intended in the first place. Clause 12 of the Bill deals with the repeal of section 53 of the principal Act deaUng with the qualifications of and procedures for appointment 13 of the chairman of a Promotions Appeal Board Minisand the chairman of a DiscipUnary Appeal Board. The question that comes to mind is: is Would it be possible in some circumstances for of the same person to be appointed chairman of the nghts of each of those boardsadvanThe CHAIRMAN. Order! I think it might be the an idea if the Committee reduced the volume of of the sound to below that of the remarks of the honourable member speaking and allowed the honourable member to put his point of view.",83
219,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"I thank you, Mr Chairman, for your protection from the Government Whip. The point I was just mentioning was this: Would it be possible that the same person could be appointed to the position of chairman of each of those boards? Secondly, clause 12 (2) deals with the appointment of a person with qualifications prescribed by the by-laws as the chairman of the Promotions Appeals Board. Likewise, there is a similar provision with respect to the Disciplinary Appeals Board. Because that matter is dealt with in the by-laws and the by-laws as set out in this amendment are not before the Committee, the amendment that the Minister will move later in the Committee stage will in one way provide the mechanism to enable the Parliament to inspect the by-laws before theyfinallycome into effect. The other matter I raise in respect to that that the unions and the South Australian seeks. Government have not yet seen the draft by-laws. Therefore, I seek from the Minister information as to what stage the draft by-laws are at when it is expected that they will be available examination by the parties concerned. As he can appreciate, it is a matter that is quite important the employees who are transferring from the 2 State railway systems to the Australian National Railways Commission. The matter I raise in respect employees of the South Australian railways have as a condition of their employment the right to qualifications optional retirement at age 60 years. Section the principal Act that is being repealed provides for a retirement at age 60 years, with the sion of the Commissioner. Again, I understand that the procedures likely to be followed there are that the conditions of retirement, whether or not there will be an optional age of retirement at age 60 years, will be covered common code that is to be established by the Commission. For the benefit of the transferring South Australian employees, I seek the Minisno ter's assurance that those employees who have that optional entitlement to retire at age 60 will have that right preserved in the drawing of the code in order to preserve their enddement.",84
220,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Mr Lucockj-Before I call the Minister for Transport, I want to say one thing. I have been extremely disappointed at the standard of behaviour in the Parliament. I point out to honourable members that there is such a thing as good manners. It might be said that what I am about to do is Uke a parson preaching in a church to his congregation- I am preaching to the converted. But knowing what happens in this place, I expect that my remarks will be spread to other honourable members. I ask that honourable members give consideration to this. Members are entering the chamber and crossing in front of the member who is speaking and the Chairman. I hope they would not do this in their own homes. The level of conversation is such that sometimes honourable members who are speaking, particularly members whose voices are not very strong, cannot be heard. I regret having to say this. But I hope the Committee at the moment and the House itself when we finish dealing with the Bill in the Committee stage will take some note of my remarks that we might have an improvement in manners in the Parliament. I call the Minister for Transport.",84
221,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"In respect of clause 6, I am able to give the honourable member for is Shortland (Mr Morris) the assurance that he In respect of clause 11, there is correspondence at the moment between the South Australian Government and ourselves on the matter and raised by the honourable member. I have no for doubt that agreement will be reached on the outstanding issues. I missed the point the honourto able member was making in respect to clause 12 because of the noise in the chamber at the time. Mr Morris-The question I raised concerned clause 12 and particularly sub-clause (2) which of clause 13 is that reads: The Commission may appoint a person having the prescribed by the by-laws to be the Chairman 54 of of a Promotions Appeal Board. Would it be possible for a set of circumstances to permisoccur in which the same person could be appointed chairman of a Promotions Appeal Board and, at the same time or at another time, and be appointed chairman of a Disciplinary Appeals Board? I also ask at what stage of prepin the aration are the draft by-laws.",84
222,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"In respect of clause 12, there is apparent reason why the same person could not be appointed, as sought by the honourable years member. I suppose it would depend upon the up considered capacity of the person under consideration. But there is certainly nothing against such a proposition. Mr Morris-What about the draft by-laws?",84
223,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"I cannot answer the question. In respect of the draft by-laws I will have tofindout exactly when they will be available for consideration. In respect of clause 13, as I understand it from the honourable member's comment, he is seeking an assurance that the employees presently employed in the South Australian RaUways, who nave an advantage in respect of retirement age, will have that position protected. Is that what the honourable member is seeking? appearsMr Morris-They have an optional right to retire at sixty.",84
224,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"Consideration of that matter has been deferred and will be put together with general matters in respect of the common code for agreement with the unions. It is anticipated that the matter wtil restfinallywith the Commission, and any employee can in the normal way apply to his employer, seek to be heard and succeed with an appUcation to retire at the age provided for under the arrangements with his present employer.",85
225,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"There is a vice considerable difference in what the Minister has stated and the conditions as they exist for South Australian RaUway employees. Section 54 of the principal Act, which is being repealed, states: Every employee shall retire from the Railway Service on attaining the age of sixty-five years, but any employee who so desires may, with the permission of the Commissioner, retire from the Railway Service at any time after he has attained the age of sixty years. It is quite clear from looking at that principal Act that the practice of the Commission has been that if the employee wished to retire at age 60 years he must have the permission of the Commissioner. In respect of the South Australian employees, as arightof employment they are entided to exercise an option to retire at age 60 years. The 2 propositions are in direct contrast. I think it is rather important to the members of the South Australian Railways who are transferring and it is also important to the harmony of the arrangements that the Minister should give an assurance that the employees will not be disadvantaged by losing that enddement.",85
226,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS," I cannot give the assurance because the matter is under discussion between the unions and the Commission at this point and I do not want to pre-empt what might come out of their discussions. But if there is concern within the unions themselves they will be able to raise the matter directly with the Commissioner during the course of the negotiations. Clauses agreed to. Clause 14.

228,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"The honourable member will recall that back in 1975, on re-election, the Government considered the use of the word 'Commonwealth' in appropriate places and the use of the word 'Australian' in appropriate places. In this context the word 'Commonwealth' is more appropriate.",85
229,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS," I ask the Minister for Transport why the notice paper shows that the ConciUation and Arbitration Amendment Bill is before the Parliament. It does not have the prefix 'Commonwealth'.

The amendment is one which the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) and the honourable member for Newcasde (Mr Charles Jones) sought and is one to which the Government has agreed. In moving this amendment to allow the application of the Acts Interpretation Act with respect to by-laws, I point out to the House that it is now normal for by-laws as well as regulations to be subject to the disallowance provisions contained in sections 48 and 49 of the Acts Interpretation Act. The Australian National Railways Act, since its inception in 1917, has not given the Parliament the power to disallow by-laws. This amendment will correct that position to bring the Act into line with both the Australian Coastal Shipping Act and the Australian National Airlines Act. The Government supports the amendment.",86
233,Mr MORRIS,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS,"The Opposition welcomes the amendment. As the Minister pointed out, the amendment provides for the insertion in the Bill of the provisions contained in sections 48 and 49 of the Acts Interpretation Act to replace the old section 4 of the principal Act. That section provides that all by-laws should be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within 30 days after the making thereof. Under that provision there is no opportunity for the Parliament to reject or to disallow the by-laws. The amendment provides an opportunity for points of difference to be discussed or raised before the by-laws come into operation. It gives the Parliament an opportunity to examine them and it provides that very important right of the Parhament to disallow them if the Parliament is so disposed.

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed from 3 May, on motion by Mr Newman: That the Bill be now read a second time.",86
234,Mr UREN,HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE,"I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government by reducing the present and future capital available to the Corporation has ignored the opportunities available to it to influence the policies of lending institutions in the housing and land fields'. The purpose of this Bill is two-fold. First, it proposes to cause the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation to be treated under all laws relating to rates, taxes and charges of the Commonwealth, States and Territories in the same manner as its private enterprise competitors. Secondly, the Bill proposes to provide the Corporation with greaterflexibilityin regard to the scope of the insurance offered, in other words, to remove arbitrary restrictions originally placed on insurable loans and approved securities. The issue of paramount importance to this Government is, of course, the proposal to remove the so-called unfair advantage the Corporation is supposed to have over its competitors. Originally the Housing Loans Insurance Corporthe ation had no private enterprise competitors when it was introduced in 1964 and, therefore, it not necessaiy to take this action.",86
235,Mr BAILLIEU,HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE,It was 1965. You are a year out.,87
236,Mr UREN,HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE,"The situation is that, over the years, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation has in fact gained over half of the insurance field. In fact it controls something like 60 per cent the market. The Mortgage Guarantee and Insurance Corporation of America, which is cally a foreign owned competitor, controls . approximately 25 per cent of the market. We asked to pay rates and taxes in order to allow foreign competitors and foreign shareholders compete on more favourable terms. The Ausobjectives, trahan Mortgage Insurance Corporation controls about 15 percent. This Government hates to see a successful vice being offered by a government authority. We just have to recall the Medibank fiasco to aping policy preciate the Government's attitude to governhome ment authorities. I said that the Housing Loans various Insurance Corporation was introduced in 1964. My colleague opposite interjected and argued that it was 1965. From 1964-65 to the present the the Corporation has accrued reserves of something do like $ 12.7m. Now, of course, the Corporation intends to hand back to Treasury, because of back taxes, an amount of $4.5m. Mr Newman-That is right.",87
237,Mr UREN,HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE,"The Minister says that is right. But I believe that is a very foolish thing to The fact is that at this stage the money should kept within the housing industry. This money should not go to Consolidated Revenue. This money which is needed by the housing industry in fact can be held in reserve. I hope that Hanavailable sard is not recording the attempts of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) to interject in a prattling manner. The fact is that, even under this Bill, the Corporation will be able to invest funds in certain other instrumentalities not in the housing field but also in other areas, paring ticularly local government. So, do not let us tle on about what the Corporation can do with its money. We know what it can do with its money. It is not just enough to require the Corporation begin to pay rates, taxes and charges. The Government has to take responsibility for a slice of the operating surplus. As I said, the Government is to take this year $4.5m of the Corporation's available capital. The other purpose of the Bill is to provide the Corporation with greaterflexibilityin regard to scope of the insurance offered and the manner in which the future surpluses can be utilised. was These aspects of the Bill are worthy of support. We have been arguing for this type of change for many years now. It appears to me that this Government has at long last taken one step towards recognising the nature of the problems facing the potential home owners in Australia today. Ad hoc measures to patch up particularly of politically contentious failures in segments of the housing market or to meet the demands of the basibest organised pressure groups must not continue. In coming to grips with the housing probare lems in Australia and in developing a comprehensive housing pohcy, it is essential that fair to and equitable objectives be identified. Labor's simply stated, are that we beheve that each household is entitled to adequate and conveniently located shelter at a price which does sernot impose too great a strain on its resources. With this in mind, thefirstobjective of the housmust be to stabilise the availability of purchasefinancefor all groups within the community and to encourage the development of means of increasing access to home ownership where this is prejudiced by terms on which home purchasefinanceis available. There is a variety of means to increase such access which not require any subsidy. I stress that point. I know of many cases both today and in the past in which people within certainfieldshave faced an extremely difficult problem in trying to obtainfinance.We know that people who earn do. up to 95 per cent of the average weekly earnings be receive subsidies. We know that the Government, through its Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, makes money available to the States so that they, in turn, can make finance to people who earn up to 85 per cent of the average weekly earnings. A great deal of money is advanced through the Home Builders Account. Some 30 per cent of the money that is made available each year is forwarded through terminating building societies. Home seekers reonly ceive favourable terms from terminating buildsocieties so long as they do not earn in excess pratof 95 per cent of the average weekly earnings. I have stressed in the past and I stress it again that those people who earn up to 135 per cent of the to average weekly earnings find it extremely difficult to meet the repayment gap-it is a large repayment gap situation-particularl y single income families. Regrettably, the situation will get worse. I believe that interest rates willrisein the coming year. In fact, interest rates now are being pressed upwards. We know that this is the current situation. We know that the February loan failed and we know that the May loan fail. We know that the Government is not getting inflation under control and that is a sad situadon. I am not trying to make political capital out this. It is a fact of life. The problems facing Australia are difficult. any Obviously, in the broader field, drains on the Commonwealth Treasury which is Australian not an unUmited Pandora's box. Therefore I am driving force not advocating that unlimited subsidies be exmuch cheaperthat tended. I do not think that we can solve our probin Australia. Because lems in that way. I will suggest programs my comments. The development of a more Government, the SouthtoAustralian flexible approach to mortgage finance is Trust is the major land developer in important. The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation can now play an important part in improving this access. The Corporation, if it adopts and imaginative approach, can go some of the way towards overcoming one of the major problems confronting housing in Australia-the probbe lem of the income threshold or the repayment gap. As I said earlier, that difficulty is faced people with incomes up to 135 per cent of the erage weekly earnings, particularly those households with a single income. One major problem facing the people seeking to be home owners many existing home owners today is access to finance. It is a great problem for them to get feet on the rung of the ladder. Once they can their feet on the rung of the ladder, the problem is not so difficult.",87
238,Mr LES JOHNSON,HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE,I think that the Minister probably agrees with that.,88
239,Mr UREN,HOUSING LOANS INSURANCE,"Well , I see him nodding his head and I think that means that he agrees. It is problem now. It certainly was the problem of honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les of course, Johnson) when he was Minister it certainly was my problem when I inherited responsibility for the Australian Housing CorporforThe ation from the honourable member for Hughes. I cause of the think this will be a problem a whole. But when we were in government, we tions prefer the about initiated a great number of schemes. The Minister should table the Housing Corbattlers poration'sfirstannual report, which he has had for many months. A lot of intelligent work and suggestions went into that report. The fact the Government refuses to table that report. abolished the Housing Corporation. The which Government will not put that report on the table of the House so that the people of Australia see the suggestions of some of thefinestbrains the housing field in this country; for instance, men like Alec Ramsay who is the chairman of will the Housing Trust of South Australia, Hugh Stretton, who has one of thefinestrational minds on housing, and Pat Troy, who was the Deputy of Chairman of the Housing Corporation and who, on the question of land, has made a more revolutionary contribution to housing and land than other person in government during our time. there are a lot of I might add that he is still a member of the South Housing Trust. It is because of his than in South Australia land is so it is in any other capital city of the finance made availlater in able by our Government the Dunstan Labor Housing South Australia, particularly in the outer Adelaide region. In that region land prices are not skyrocketing to the same extent as they are in a flexible other areas of Australia. The proposals that I am putting forward can earned out by the conservative and traditional lending institutions. Lending institutions are by properly concerned with the security of people's E aversonal savings. Naturally they tend to lend to >w risk borrowers-bonower s who fall within the 25 per cent to 35 per cent repayment rule. and Without guarantees, they are unhkely, as a whole, to grantflexiblemortgages such as short theirrepayment mortgages, mortgages carried to a get constant proportion of income, capital indexed mortgages, defened repayment mortgages, short term mortgages based on household income and which are capable of being extended in term if the household income is reduced, and government guaranteed second mortgages. All these matters were examined when we were in governhis ment. They were also examined in the first the annual report of the Housing Corporation. But, the Minister does not want to deal with for Housing and these problems. lending institutions cannot be criticised their caution in granting mortgage loans beproblems offinance.There are legitof the community as imate concerns most cash flows and such institusecure loans. Of course, the wealthy always get the first priority; it is the who really need assistance. The battlers, as I say, consist of that group up to the middle income earners who receive up to 135 per cent of is that average weekly earnings. This Government, It which is supposed to be a liberal government, is supposed to represent that middle group of people, is not representing that group. If the can middle ground people have been sold out by in anybody it is by this Government. If we look at income tax indexation we see which group of people are being attacked most. The middle income earners are being attacked, because of this Government. In every submission it makes to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission it attacks the middle income earners. They are the ones who are being affected because the very wealthy-the people on high incomes-ca n look after themselves. The middle income earners are being affected not only in the taxation field but also in housing cause this Government has not brought forward any housing policy in the 18 months it has been in office. The home ownership income threshold cannot be crossed by a significant proportion of the community unless the degree of nsk seen in them by lending institutions can be eliminated. A national housing policy must be heavily concerned with influencing both the total volume and the distribution of private sector funds for housing. It must do this because the majority of Australians have to depend on those funds for the satisfaction of their housing needs. One means of coming to grips with the problem would be for the Commonwealth to underwrite the risk taken by lending institutions. If the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation is imaginative and aggressive it should solve only the insurance aspect-on e of thefirstobjectives of housing policy. The stabilisation of the availability of home purchasefinanceand access to home ownership will remain low until the Government realises that its primary role in housing is to develop polview icy which is aimed at directing and influencing the supply of money and the terms upon which it is available to meet housing needs. Whilst the importance of the housing sector of policies of overall economic management is nice recognised and whilst we recognise that housing should not be used as a primary tool of economic management and that it cannot be wholly insulated from the varying impact of national economic policies, we feel some measures can and should be taken to secure a stable flow of funds to specific areas of need. I have developed this thesis at length elsewhere and shall quickly summarise it now. We on this side of the House argue that the extent to which the Government intervenes in the housing market should be such as would assist those in particular need. To achieve this it is our intention, on our return government, to establish an Austrahan housing corporation. Its main aim will be to secure the levels of finance needed to maintain the duction and the sale of housing at levels consistconfiscate ent with need and to maintain prices within means of home seekers. The corporation will be directed towards marshalling resources and directing them through the existing institutions-I stress this point-to those in need of housing. It will not be designed to compete with existing institutions, nor will its policies be designed to do so. Unlike the Government, we recognise the need to secure an adequate level offinance.The be- fact that the Government does not recognise this need is demonstrated in several ways. The Government has missed several opportunities to channel funds to building societies and other lending institutions for lending viaflexiblemortgage conditions to people confronted by the income threshold. The Government abolished the original Housing Corporation and took back into Consolidated Revenue the substantial funds available to that Corporation. In doing this the Government ignored the recommendations in the first annual report of the Housing Corporation. I stress again that contrary to statutory requirements, this Government has refused to table that report. Apparently these recommendations supported the concept of an institution of the type just described-a n institution which secures funds and lends them to existing institutions, which lends them to people in need, that is, to people below the income threshold. I stress again that people in need these days are not just people who receive less than average weekly earnings. They include people earning as much as 135 per cent of average weekly earnings. My is that this will go even higher in the coming year. In the Bill before the House the Government has missed another opportunity. One of the pleasing aspects of the Bill, if i can say something about the Bill, is that it gives the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation the right to invest funds in building societies and elsewhere. Of course, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) kept jabbering earlier about what the Government will do with the funds. It is already set out in the Bill in which areas the funds can be used. Quite frankly, I think this is an intelligent approach. The only-if I might use the wordstupid approach to this issue is for the Government to drain $4.5m from these funds and divert it back into Consolidated Revenue. There is an to intelligent way in which these funds can be invested in the interest of the housing sector or related instrumentaUties. That is what I argue. proBut the Government, in its wisdom, sawfitto $4.5m of the funds available to the the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, funds which should have been channelled into building societies which were prepared mortgage schemes or, if not to the building societies, to the land commissions. The land commissions of New South Wales would love this financeflowingto them. It could have been provided to sewerage authorities or to local would government authorities, which this provides. The Government sawfitnot to do this. It saw fit to abolish the original Housing Corporation. saw fit to ignore the real problems saw fit to turn its back on that significant proportion of the community which cannot income threshold. It has aggravated the problems in housing by these and other closely associated issues. This Government's monetary policies are the best examples of its failure to examine the need to secure an adequate level offinancefor housing needs. These policies have had an erratic effect on the availability offinance.It demonstrates further this Government has not faced up to the issue and has failed to use the mechanisms able to it to influence the pohcies of lending institutions. It is for those reasons while there are positive aspects lation, there are also several negative aspects. Therefore, I ask the House to support the amendment I have moved.",88

The suspension of Standing Orders was agreed to by the required majority vote. The points made by the honourable member relate to the debate in this House. They can be made at a later stage.,92
287,Mr STALEY,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,"As I said, allegations have been made in today's Press that ASIO broke into the Australian Labor Party headquarters. Those are very serious allegations at any time.",92
288,Mr UREN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,Who made them?,92
289,Mr STALEY,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,"They are made in today's Press by people such as the President of the Austrahan Labor Party and, I might add, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. They are made also by the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. They are made carefully stage and completely. The Government has in its posto resort to the use of an intersession a little bit of hard evidence. It is the only evidence which has so far come to Ught with respect to this so-called break-in, this so-called Watergate. The evidence to which the Government has access suggests that the Labor Party broke into ASIO, not that ASIO broke into the Labor Party. I have tabled a report by Richard Thomas Ninness, Detective Senior Constable of the Australian Capital Territory PoUce. This report relates to investigations which he carried out in January 1976. It is a report of 2 separate series of interviews. It becomes quite clear when the facts in this document are studied that there is much doubt about the circumstances surrounding this matter. I think there is early evidence in this document to suggest that far from ASIO breaking into the Labor Party headquarters, the Labor Party broke into its own headquarters. I am not suggesting a motive but there could have been a motive in the stories around the country at thetimeabout Iraqi breakfasts and involvements of senior members of the Labor Party. As I go into the facts which arise out of the report by the poUce I think this will become clear. First of all, let us consider this charge that there has been a break-in. That was not how the matter was put to the police at the time by the Secretary of the Labor Party, Mr Combe. Today he and the President of the Labor Party are suggesting a break-in by ASIO. There was not even a suggestion of a break-in at the time the events were alleged to have occurred. I draw attention to the report of Richard Thomas Ninness. I have to report that on Wednesday, 14 January, 1976, Acting Assistant Commissioner Kennedy, phone call from Mr David Combe who is National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. He stated that during Christmas break two inner doors leading to the Conference Room, Third Floor, John Curtin Building, which are mally locked were found unlocked by one ofhis staff. There is no question of a break-in; doors are simply found unlocked, in the then words of the National Secretary of the Labor Party, Mr David Combe. The report goes on: On further investigation by the staff member it was found that a steel cabinet, which was situated in the Conference Room, was lying on its side and a quantity of personal papers belonging to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitlam, were found to be missing, possibly stolen. It is interesting to note that many conflicting explanations are given by Mr Combe and members of the Labor Party's staff as to why documents might or might not have been removed. We start with this explanation in the interview by Detective Ninness: . . . Mrs Marks discovered that the door leading to the secdon of the building which is occupied by the office of Mr Combe and other members of his staff . . . was found to be closed and unlocked. It was also discovered that a cabinet in the Conference Room was found lying on its side and the bottom drawer had been pulled out and the contents of this drawer had beenremoved. Mr Combe stated that Mrs Marks reported this incident to him on the S January 1976. That was about 2 weeks before the matter was reported to police. The report continues: She stated that thereasonfor the delay inreportingthe matter to him was that she assumed that the subject filing cabinet had been laid on its side and the papers removed from it by a member of the Labor Party's staff. So, Mr Combe's colleague, Mrs Marks, assumes not that ASIO had taken the papers but that Labor Party staffer had taken them. That is one explanation in the police report as to who took the papers, who raided the Labor Party headFurther, quarters. The first explanation is that a Party staff member raided Labor Party headcolleagues. quarters. Another suggestion in the report is: Mr Combe informed me that the subject filing cabinet was used by Lorraine Dwyer, personal secretary of the former Prime Minister Mr Whitlam and had been removed from Parliament House and stored in the Conference Room in John Curtin House on 11 December 197S, whilst waiting for office space at Parliament House. It has been stored in the Conference Room with approximately six otherfilingcabinets of similar design and a large quantity of cardboard boxesThere was a large quantity of cardboard boxes. What was the number? Was it sixty? Mr Newman-Ninety .",92
290,Mr STALEY,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,"Ninety. The report goes on: . . . a large quantity of cardboard boxes, all of which contained papers relevant to the Labor Party. This particular filing cabinet contained personal papers of Mr Whitlam's which were in the bottom drawer. He went on further to sayreceived a tele Mr Combe did: the . . . that these papers were of a highly confidential nature pertaining to Mr Whitlam's political career. norI repeat those words. They were of a highly confidential nature pertaining to Mr Whitlam's political career'. One is led to ask: Did these papers relate to Iraqi breakfasts, loans or other such matters? It having been suggested by Mr Combe in this interview that these papers were of a highly confidential nature pertaining to Mr Whitlam's political career, we read on and find, later in the interview, as reported by the detective that Mr Combe said that the papers were of no significance or no importance. He seems to have changed his mind. The report continues: After Mr Combe had indicated to me the position where the cabinet was found, we then returned to his office where a further conversation was carried out in relation to the subject matter. When asked if he could be more explicit as to the nature of the papers which were stolen, he then stated that at this stage, he could not answer that because he did not know if, in fact any papers had been stolen or mislaid at all. When asked if it would be possible to ascertain what papers had in fact been taken, he stated that he would be unable to say at filing thistime.He went on to say that if any papers had been stolen from this cabinet, they would be of little value, if any at all, to the person or persons responsible for taking them. Further conversation was had in relation to what papers had been stolen and also their value relating to political matters, but Mr Combe could not give any definite answer. Mr Combe was asked why the matter was not reported to the police as soon as he became aware of the alleged offence and he stated that he didn't think it imponant enough to report. He stated further that he reported it after conferring with his colleagues. So in one breath Mr Combe is saying that the matter is of a highly confidential and important a nature. In another breath he is saying that the matters are of small moment and not sufficiently important to have been reported to the police. he said that he had only reported the Labor matter after he had conferred with his Wefindthat Mr Whitlam's secretary, Mrs Dwyer, goes still further at another point in this document. Page 3 of this police report states: . . . Mrs Dwyer stated that if it had been correspondence belonging to her, it would have been possibly papers relating to policy matters, or of a light nature and definitely not personal data relating to Mr Whidam. So Mr Whitlam's secretary is now saying in that part of the report that the papers were definitely not personal data relating to Mr Whitlam. So we have the situation where the matter was not reported to the police. It appears on the evidence of the pohce report that this was not even a break-in; but a door was found open. We have, on the evidence of the document, Australian Labor Party staff members, including the most senior members of the organisation, giving entirely different explanations as to both the importance of the papers and whether or not they related to Mr Whitlam. It is quite clear that the situation was not reported for some time. On the evidence there was no report until after the offending cabinet had been repaired. At point after point we find that the statements which have been made in the Press today are entirely without foundation. Another vital point relates to the suggestion about the role of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. It is a most serious charge to suggest that ASIO has been acting in the interests of a poltiical party or at the direction of any political force in this country. It is not without interest and relevance to this subject matter to note that today the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) supported the new security arrangements which were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his major statement on this matter today. It is utterly inconceivable that either Mr Mahoney who, at the relevant dme, was head of the security intelligence organisation or Mr Justice Woodward, would do anything improper. I think that aU the remarks made today by the Leader of the Opposition would support that proposition. It is quite incredible that these charges have been made by senior Labor Party spokesmen on the very day on which the Leader of the Opposition agreed with these new arrangements. I point out to the House that we have spoken to Mr Mahoney, the Director-General in charge of ASIO at the time. I remind honourable members that Mr Mahoney was appointed by Mr Whidam and he has said that the organisation knew nothing about it. Debate interrupted. NA",93
291,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House of 10 March 19771 propose the quesuon: That the House do now adjourn.",94
292,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT,I require the modon to be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. NA NA Ministerial Statement Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.,94
293,Mr UREN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,"In thefirstplace, Mr Speaker, might I set out the sequence of events tonight. The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) came into the chamber tonight and sought leave for the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) to make a statement. The Leader of the House gave no information about the contents of the statement. I asked him whether he had spoken to the Manager of Opposition Business about the matter and he said he had not, although he had sought to locate him. I asked whether 2 hours notice had been given and the Leader of the House said that it had not. Then I asked whether there was a written statement and he said there was not. That is what happened on such a serious matter at this late hour; at a time when the Parliament is going into recess for at least 2 weeks. False allegations have been made by the Minister for the Capital Territory. I take it, and I say this in all seriousness, that the Minister had a clearance from the Cabinet to make a statement on security at this dme, something which normally the Government of the day refuses to do. Do I take it that because the Leader of the House, the Deputy Leader of the Nauonal Country Party, came into the House and gave a clearance for this junior Minister to make a statement on security that we can expect the Government, at any time when serious allegadons have been made, to make a statement about security? Do I also take it that when people give evidence to the police, and particularly the police in the Australian Capital Territory, that evidence might be quoted accurately, or in some cases falsely, in the House by a Minister of the Fraser Government? To what level wdl the Government stoop to use such information, slurs and innuendos? Let me examine how this whole matter came about. The headline in today's Daily Mirror reads: 'Australia's Watergate', 'Gough's files raided by ASIO'. It is well known that Mr Murdoch, the publisher of the Daily Mirror, is a close personal friend of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). We know that the same. Mr Murdoch is a strong supporter of the Government. In every way possible he has maligned and slurred the Labor Party. He has misused and twisted and turned the Party's policies, completely distorting them in every way. Let me read what the Daily Mirror states under the byline of Trevor Kavanagh, the head of the bureau of the Daily Mirror here in Canberra. After 'Australia's Watergate', 'Gough'sfilesraided by ASIO', the article states: Break-into photograph documents. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has been blamed for a Watergate-style break-in at the Labor Party's national headquarters in Canberra just after the 1975 election. Security sources in Canberra say ASIO agents entered the premises at night and forced open a filing cabinet crammed with documents from the office of the former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. They then photographed the documents and replaced them. It is understood that because of this the Government was able to threaten this week to table a list of allegedly stolen documents in Federal Parliament. Now let us put this matter in perspective. The Minister alleged that the Labor Party had done this. That was dishonest of the Minister. The allegations are published in an anti-Labor newspaper-and the allegations are made by the Murdoch Press. The Minister tried to draw on what Mr Hawke is reported in the Daily Mirror as saying. I do not know exactly what Mr Hawke said. I do not know what Mr Combe said. It was only while the Minister was speaking that this newspaper was handed to me and I can only refer to what is stated in it. In part this is what it says: When told of the allegations today, the President of the ALP, Mr Hawke, said: ' I believe what you are saying That is what Mr Hawke is quoted as saying. Mr David Combe, the Australian Labor Party national secretary, is reported as having said 'the ASIO link did not surprise him'. I assume that both men were informed by the correspondent of what was published in this newspaper and were just concurring with it. It is their belief and the belief of a lot of people in Australia that ASIO is involved in political affairs. Speaking on behalf of honourable members on this side of the House there have been no allegations by the leadership of this Party that ASIO should be used by governments in political matters, particularly against other political parties. I know that individual honourable members can make allegations against governments, against ASIO and against other security forces operating in Australia but never has the Labor Party used this subject in the way that the Government is using it now. What really concerns me is that a Minister, even of the lowly level of the Minister for the Capital Territory can come in here with the full authority of the leadership of his Party and suspend Standing Orders so that this statement could be made. It was not a prepared or written statement. The Minister spoke off the top of his head and I want to know as the Deputy Leader of the Party on this side of the House whether he is speaking for the Cabinet or the Government. From now on will security matters be allowed to be used in politics? Will Ministers be able to use these matters as they have been used tonight? It is an utter disgrace. But what is good for the goose is good for the gander. So that we can get the matter clear I ask that this article published on the front page of the Daily Mirror be incorporated in Hansard. MrStaley-Tableit.",94
294,Mr SPEAKER,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has sought leave to incorporate the document in Hansard. Is leave granted?,95

296,Mr SPEAKER,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,Leave is not granted.,95
297,Mr UREN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,"I am asking that this article be incorporated in Hansard because the Minister for the Capital Territory has misquoted and has misconstrued the article. I ask again that it be incorporated in Hansard. If leave is not granted, I will read the contents of the newspaper article into Hansard. Honourable members will just have to wait",95
298,Mr SINCLAIR,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,You may table it in the same is true *. manner as the police report was tabled.,95

300,Mr SPEAKER,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,"Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked for leave, and it has been refused.",95
301,Mr UREN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,"A11right, Mr Speaker. I will read every word of the newspaper article. I will read the total article that appears on the front page of the final extra edition of the Daily Mirror of today's date. The headline states: 'Australia's Watergate'-Gough's Files Raided by ASIO! There is a photograph of Mr Whidam, with the caption 'officefilecabinet forced'. There is also a photograph of David Combe, with the caption 'not surprised'. The newspaper article carried the sub-heading: 'Break-into photograph documents'. It reads as follows: The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has been blamed for a Watergate-style break-in at the Labor Party's national headquarters in Canberra just after the 1975 election. Security sources in Canberra say ASIO agents entered the premises at night and forced a filing cabinet crammed with documents from the office of the former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. They then photographed the documents and replaced them. It is understood that because of this the Government was able to threaten this week to table a list of allegedly stolen documents in Federal Parliament. The papers had been under armed guard until the breakin-in January, 1976. The guard wasremovedafter the ALP decided it was too expensive, and apparently unnecessary, to maintain it Canberra police investigated the break-in but after makingfingerprintchecks announced no break-in had taken place. In background briefings to the press, senior police officers said it appeared to have been an internal ALP 'bungle.' When told of the allegations today, the President of the ALP, Mr Hawke, said:' I believe what you are saying is true. 'It was widely believed at the time that this was what might have happened. 'The politics of this country have reached a pathetic stage when the Prime Minister has nal security organisation to try to undermine his political opponents. ' It is not only pathetic but extremely dangerous. 'It shows the depths to Mr David Combe, the ALP national secretary, said the ASIO link did not surprise him. 'Nor would it have surprised me if you had put it to me in January, 1976,'he said. That is the total newspaper article. I have no further comment to make on it. It speaks for itself. The Minister for the Capital Territory distorted completely the statement made earUer tonight. I hope that all journalists in this nation, and the Parliament and the Government examine very seriously the statements made by this very foolish Minister. I hope that these people also take note of the actions of the not so bright Leader of the House who allowed the Minister to make the statement. Debate (on motion by Mr Bourchier) adjourned.

302,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,"On 18 May 1974 Senator Bill Brown warned that the then United States Ambassador, Marshall Greene, was in Australia to protect American financial interests and to ensure the maintenance of that country's mUitary installations in Australia. He was condemned and repudiated by one member of his Party for daring to question the motives of Mr Greene. However, I had a very good reason for taking his warning seriously. Mr Greene caUed at my Canberra office in July 1973, accompanied by the Investigated United States Labour Attache, Mr Ed MCHale. I asked Mr Greene: 'What would your country do if Australia were to take over the subsidiaries of multi-national corporations in Australia?'. I guess that the question was unexpected, but his instant reply was: 'We would move in'. 'Bring in the marines, like?', I chaUenged. 'Oh, no', he answered me: 'The days of marine diplomacy are over'. I asked: 'Well, what do you mean by ""move in""?'. He mentioned trade, but when I reminded him that that would be his loss more than ours he remarked that there were other things that his country could do. What did he mean? Was he threatening to destabilise our economy, as was done in Chile, Greece and toresortto the use of an interGuatemala, or was he threatening to arrange for the Central Intelligence Agency to organise a coup of some kind as it had done after the comwhich this Government has sunk.' pletion of destabtiisation of Greece, Chile, the Congo, Iran and other countries? Subsequendy I repeated this conversation in the presence of Mr MCHale and his successor in the Lobby Restaurant just before Mr MCHale returned to the United States, and he did not correct a single point of my recital of that conversation. So here we had the Ambassador of the United States threatening a Minister of State of a friendly country with interference in its internal affairs should its democratically elected government ever receive a mandate to take over the investments of American private corporations. Can anyone imagine any Australian Government feeling obUgated to take such action in the event of some Australian investor losing his assets in another country? I raise this matter in the Parliament of Australia because I want the United States AmADJOURNMENT bassador to see that President Carter is informed of our apprehension about CIA activities in our country. I want President Carter to know that there is a genuine bond of friendship between our 2 countries which is unparaUeled perhaps in any other countries in the world. I watched and admired Governor Carter throughout his presidential campaign and I told Mr Cyrus Vance in the Australian Ambassador's New York residence of my fervent hope that he would win that election. I beheve that President Carter will emerge as the greatest American President in history, even greater than Abraham Lincoln. He will be great because he wtil give America clean government and thus restore to the American people a pride and self-respect that slowly has been slipping from their grasp. He will be great because he will keep the CIA out of the internal affairs of other countries, especially allies like Australia. In this way he will not only win the respect of all Americans but also he will gain the deep admiration and respect of the people of all other countries of good will. I conclude by wishing the new President every possible success in the earnest endeavours that I know he is making to clean up the system of CIA interference in other countries, especially countries like ours have a friendly relationship with his country.",96
303,Mr BAUME,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID," I want to draw the attention of the House to a local newspaper in my electorate, the Campbelltown district Star which, in its latest issue, points that the growth of Campbelltown ties of the Macarthur Development Board could be halted. The newspaper reveals that a New South Wales State Government report could spell the end of the residential and industrial growth of Campbelltown. I believe that this very significant matter ought to be drawn to the attenmultimillions tion of the House because the implications of this report on the environment and on the future the Macarthur Growth Centre as seen by servers, according to the newspaper, are tremendously frightening. Briefly, the report says large part of that development should not go ahead. This is development which to a considerouth able degree wasfinancedby the previous FedSouth eral Administration. Many millions of dollars have been poured into industrial development in particular in this beautiful area, and this was sensible decision in the light of providing jobs people who move out there. Many .millions of dollars have been poured into this area which now shown by this New South Wales State Government official report to be an area in which dangerous pollution will follow as a result involved. of such development. The newspaper points out that on the one hand the State Government is paid pouring millions of dollars into the development a letter of the area and, on the other hand, a department ing of that Government comes to the conclusion after a long, detailed and, no doubt, expensive study, that it is all happening in the wrong I have a copy of the relevant sections of that expired. report, along with the statement made by Mr Paul Landa, MLC, the New South Wales Minister for Planning and Environment. He says that the report sets out clearly and cogently the vital need to relate Sydney's urban development the capacity of its waterways to cope with urban wastes. His statement goes on to say that as far practicable future urban and industrial growth should be concentrated where sewage could be channelled into ocean outfalls and at the same time acceptable alternatives to ocean outfalls should be examined. According to the local newspaper, the essence of the matter is that the gravest blow to Campbelltown's continued development came from the suggestion that industrial development should be diverted to other areas. It states that industrial and commercial development which produced toxic effluents, high volume discharges that of high strength or coloured wastes should be discouraged in areas likely to drain to inland treatment works and inland streams. In particular, it pointed to the dangers, therisks,that would emerge to the Georges River system as a result of industrial development of that nature in out Campbelltown and also to excessive suburban and the activigrowth in that area. Yet the previous Federal Government, without making such a study and without concerning itself with the implications and the consequences to the environment of such development, poured of dollars of taxpayers' money into such development. I think it is an indictment of of the former Minister for Urban and Regional obDevelopment, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) that he should spend multimillions of that a dollars on such development which may well rove to be disastrous, according to this New I Wales Government report. Iurge the New Wales Government to decide whether or not it intends to implement the recommendations of that report. Multimillions of dollars of a further development are involved. As a consefor quence, the Federal Government is still committed. It is an absurd situation when a State is Government report recommends so strongly against development in an area in which multimillions of dollars of Federal funds are It was claimed this afternoon that I had not my full debt to Patrick Partners.

305,Mr CHARLES JONES,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID," I raised during an adjournment debate in this place some time ago the matter of the accident that occurred adjacent to the Cairns Airport to on 23 October 1975 when a Heron aircraft DH114 2E/A1 crashed on approach to that airas port. I called on the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) at that time to hold a full board of inquiry into the circumstances associated with the accident. I do not propose to repeat what I have said on 3 previous occasions in this place about the circumstances associated with the accident. I raised the matter again just recently and the Minister asked me to confer with him on the circumstances associated with the accident. I did that. After conferring briefly he suggested that I should meet some of the officers of his Department, including the First Assistant Secretary of the Accident Investigation Branch. I had that meeting with those people today. It lasted for almost 2 hours, being interrupted at one stage by the calling of a division in this place. Having discussed the matter with them in detail, I regret to say that I cannot accept the Minister's decision that a full board of inquiry should not be held. A coroner's inquest was conducted into the accident. Let me indicate to the House the interest taken by the relatives of the 3 crew members and 8 passengers who lost their lives. All the relatives of the people who lost their lives, with the exception of one, attended the inquest which extended over a period of 4 to 5 days. A great amount of evidence was taken and a great amount of argument was advanced. Clearly the relatives of the people who lost their lives were concerned about the circumstances of the accident in which so many people were killed. The Minister's assertion that there is no real concern is not borne out by these facts which are available to him in his Department. Officers of the Minister's Department tried to explain to me why it was not necessary to hold an inquiry. There is obviously a blank spot in respect of what happened at thetimeof the accident. A minute before the accident the aircraft should have been flying at about 640 feet. Evidence was given by eye-witnesses, two of whom have a particularly keen interest in aviation. One is a lady who sits on her verandah and watches through a pair of binoculars aircraft approach. Mr Cotter-Where was this?",97
306,Mr CHARLES JONES,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,In Cairns. Another chap listens to conservations between pilots and the tower on his VHF set. These are the type of people who gave evidence. Mr MCLean-Sticky-beaks .,98

They werefirst-classwitnesses who were able to give opinions to the investigators. They stood by their points of view. It is clear to me that in that last minute the pilot just did not know where he was. He was not operating in conformity with the regulations under which he had been taught to operate. Having that in mind and having in mind the evidence that was given by people who attended the coroner's inquiry, I once again appeal to the Minister to have this matter resolved by a full board of inquiry so as to ensure that not only is justice done but also that it is seen to be done.",98

309,Mr OKEEFE,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION RAID,"Several weeks ago in this House I raised the question of television reception from the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Channel 5A in the Newcastle and Hunter River area. No improvement in television viewing has been recorded since that date in the Hunter. Last Friday week an engineer, who was supposed to have done technical work in regard to the changeover to Channel 5A appeared on an ABC talk-back station in Newcastle and endeavoured to explain to the people of the Hunter Valley how to overcome their reception problems in respect of Channel 5A. All that he did was to inform the residents of the Valley that they should purchase antennas and have them properly directed to the ABC channel. The current situation is most unsatisfactory. I know that your constituents, Mr Deputy Speaker, who live in the electorate adjoining the electorate of Paterson, are experiencing exactly the same trouble with Channel 5A. All that the people of the Hunter Valley are asking is that the quality of reception they received prior to the changeover be restored. The installation of new antennas is not the answer to the problem. I was in a home on a hillside in Bolwarra Heights last Sunday night and I can tell honourable members that the ABC reception was very poor. The quality of the reception in this area is a disgrace. I have received many telegrams from shire councils and local government bodies as well as constituents in the Hunter Valley area asking for action to be taken. I know that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson), who is responsible for Telecom, has received hundreds of telegrams and letters. This matter has also been drawn to the attention of Mr Schmidt who is in charge of Telecom in New South Wales.",98

Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In accordance with the arrangements outlined on 8 December 1976 by my colleague, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer, a technical committee has been established to undertake necessary technical work associated with detailed examination of the scheme outlined in the Discussion Paper issued on 8 December 1976. The committee is examining such matters as the collection of relevant statistics and methods for the determination of premiums. Meanwhile, comments on the proposals outlined in the Discussion Paper are being received and examined. (2) Several of the States have submitted comments on the proposals; the insurance industry has formally responded on a number of aspects and is currently preparing funher material on other aspects; and numerous comments have been received from individual members of the community. The working party established by the Government is currently assessing these comments, which have provided valuable informauon and which should greatly assist the Government in the funher development of a scheme.

While the devaluation has not been taken into account in the body of the Survey, it will clearly change the outlook those over the coming year as discussed in pages 40 to 44. Very broadly its main effects would seem to be in the direction of putting upward pressure on the price level, providing some stimulus to demand and improving the current ana capital accounts of the balance of payments. Much will also depend on the future stance of policies, particularly monetary policy, which will have to be adapted to the changed situadon'.
