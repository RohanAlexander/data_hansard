3,Mr FISHER,COCOS ISLANDSNAVAL,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [2.35] - Wit h the permission of the House, I wish to make a statement regarding the recent successf u l action of H . M . A . S . Sydney off the Cocos Islands, which, for greater accuracy, I shall read. It is as follows: NA HMAS. SYDNEY. About noon on Monday, 9th November, a telegram was received at Navy Office from Cocos Island stating that a three-funnelled warship had arrived off the island and was landing a party of men in boats. Communication with Cocos immediately ceased. It was realized at Navy Office that this must be the Emden, and efforts were at once made to get into touch with Sydney, then believed to be in the vicinity of Cocos islands. An urgent telegram was despatched to the Perth Radio Station, forwarding a code telegram, to be made on the highest power of which this station is capable, with the . "" en clair"" preamble, B. M. FERGUSON, "" Very urgent! do not reply."" followed by the Governor General. Sydney's call sign and the telegram informing her of the Emden's presence at Cocos Island. No further information was received until 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 10th inst., when the Eastern Extension Company brought to Navy Office a retelegram received from Cocos that the Sydney was engaging Emden, and that Emden was a wreck on the north of Keeling Island. This news was confirmed half-an-hour later by a telegram received by the Naval Board from the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the China Station, stating that the cable from Perth to Cocos was out of order, but that the one between Cocos and Batavia was still working. He reported that on the night before Cocos Station had managed to send a short message on extemporized instruments that Emden had been engaged by a British cruiser, but that the result was not yet known, and that the German landing party had seized the schooner and left the island. The Commanderin-Chief stated that later information had been received from Cocos that Sydney had arrived there and that Emden was wrecked on the north coast of the island. He added that he was informing Admiralty. A more complete account was received on the morning of Wednesday, 11th. It was then ascertained from Cocos by a telegram forwarded by the courtesy of Mr Webster, Adelaide representative of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, that Cocos had temporarily restored communication, and was able to supply further particulars. It appears that Emden arrived at 6 a.m. and sent three boats with a landing party, consisting of three officers and forty men, with four maxims. The island immediately sent out an urgent wireless call for help, which was received by Sydney just before the installation was smashed by the Germans. The landing party had apparently just completed their work of destruction, and actually put off to the ship, when the Sydney hove in sight. The Emden at once put to sea, leaving her boats behind. On clearing the island the Emden apparently opened the action on the Sydney, and it is stated that her shooting was at first excellent, but after she had been under fire from the Sydney her shooting fell off considerably. It is gathered that Sydney must have poured an accurate and deadly fire into Emden, as the latter very soon lost two funnels and a mast, whilst the whole of the after part of the ship was on fire. The action lasted an hour, the Emden being then apparently in a sinking condition and completely on fire. The captain evidently decided to beach the ship, as she is reported to be wrecked on the north of the island. The Sydney received very slight damage, the casualties consisting of three killed and fifteen wounded. The names have not yet been reported. After Emden was beached Sydney picked up the doctor of Cocos Island and his assistants and proceeded to the help of the Emden. The result of this visit is not yet known. The German landing party seized two months' provisions and made off in the schooner Ayesha. The manager of Cocos Island station reported that they had been well treatedby the Germans, and ..were all well. The following are the particulars of Sydney and Emden:Sydnetf-lAght cruiser; .5,400'tons; speed, 25 knots; - armament;, eight: 6;in. guns, four 3pounders - - VESSELS. Emden-Ligh t cruiser, 3,600 tons; speed, 24 knots; armament, ten 4.1-in. guns. The Sydney has recently come out of dock, and has, therefore,'an advantage in the matter of speed. In addition to these statements, we have 1 received from all quarters telegrams of congratulation. Amongst them. I may mention the following- ' From the Secretary of State for' the Colonies. "" Please convey to your Government my hearty congratulations, complete success achieved by HMAS. Sydney m putting an end to the career of the Emden."" Telegram received by the Governor General from merchants of Kingston, Jamaica. "" Hearty congratulations Sydney's naval victory. Hurrah for Australia !"" Telegram received from Henry Marks, Suva. ' "" Australians in Fiji congratulate Commonwealth first naval victory."" There is a host of other telegrams from within Australia and from ' individuals outside the Commonwealth, hut I do not think I need trouble the House with them. I have only to add that I do not think there is a soul in Australia but feels very-happy indeed that such an opportunity arose, and such a success has followed the first serious naval action by our own ships.",6
4,Mr FOWLER,DESTRUCTION OF EMDEN BY,"Does not the Prime Minister think that some commendation should be communicated to the operators of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company for their alertness in sending, before their equipment was smashed, the message that resulted in tfie destruction of the German cruiser Emden?",7
5,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF EMDEN BY,"Where so many have done so well, I refrained from specially naming any individual or individuals. am sure that the people of Australia, while having pride for the victory gained by the Sydney over the Emden, are sorry indeed that the success was not attained without,, at least, three casualties by death and fifteen by wounds. pleased at the event, we sorrow for the sufferers and mourn. the killed; but nevertheless these are the consequences of war. ..Undoubtedly, the Government are grateful for the alertness and capacity shown by the officers at Cocos; and, acting on the suggestion . of the honourable member for Perth:, we shall take suitable action to convey to the parties concerned the feelings expressed in this House. NA",7
6,Mr JH CATTS,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"I should like to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether it is a fact, as reported in the i Sydney press, that the stevedoring of prize vessels has been let by contract to a German firm; if so, will the Minister give the House information on the subject?",7
7,Mr TUDOR,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"As soon as I saw the statement in this morning's newspaper, the question .having arisen before I assumed office, I had the file looked into and a short statement made out as to what 'the procedure has beenOn the 15th August last, Collectors of Customs were informed that if the agents of the detained vessels were willing to undertake the. work of discharge of cargoes it should be intrusted to them,. but the person undertaking the chief responsibility must not be an enemy subject; in case the company were not represented by a British firm and had no responsible British or neutral subject in its employ, it would be necessary to make other arrangements, and in that event Collectors were to consult with the President of the local Chamber of Commerce before deciding to whom the work should be intrusted. I understand that was the arrangement made by our predecessors, and that procedure has been followed by the present Government. It""happens that the headquarters of the two German shipping firms are in Sydney, but in other capitals the agents of those. companies are British subjects. I understand that the man in charge of the Sydney head office is a British subject.",7
8,Mr JH CATTS,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,Is that a fact?,7
9,Mr TUDOR,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,I understand so.,7
10,Mr BRUCE SMITH,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"Is the Minister of Trade'and Customs aware that a full I list of the shareholders of the company in question, which goes by an Australian name, has been published in the Sydney press, and that the whole of the shares are held 'in Hamburg by Germans, and, therefore, that the' workof dischargWhile ing the cargo of prize vessels has been in trusted to a German firm ? ",7
11,Mr TUDOR,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"I haye .not seen the Sydney papers, but I sawthat statement in the Melbourne Age today.",7
12,Mr BRUCESMITH,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"If the M i nister finds that this company, which is under an . Australian name, is wholly made up of German shareholders, so that whatever profits may be made out of this work will go to Germany, will he take steps to cancel the contract and give it to an Australian firm?",7
13,Mr TUDOR,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"Yes . I was not aware of the fact until I saw the newspapers this morning. Although the honourable member knows it, I can assure him that I am as keen an Australian as he is. RAIDS ON BUSINESS OFFICES.",8
14,Mr THOMAS,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,Is the Attorney General yet in a position to make a public statement in regard to the raids made by the Military Forces on the offices of the Broken Hill mining companies?,8
15,Mr HUGHES,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"I should be glad to supply the information desired by the honourable member, but I prefer that the question be postponed until tomorrow, when I shall be in a better position to make a full statement. SHIPMENT OF FRUIT.",8
16,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"In view of the fact that' shipping communication with countries overseas is likely to be, to some extent, disorganized, on account of vessels being utilized for the conveyance of troops to the seat of war. will the Minister of Trade and Customs make inquiries to ascertain if such disarrangement of the shipping service will interfere with the ordinary shipment of fruit from Australia to England?",8
17,Mr TUDOR,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"As soon as I found that - a number of vessels were required by the Defence Department, I made arrangements through the Transport Committee - that every one of those vessels which had refrigerated space should be loaded with - refrigerated cargo when taking troops to Europe. Vessels were not to depart with :their holds empty if cargo was available. In addition, the Government have communicated with the British Government, .asking if there isany vessel in any part - of the world adjacent to Australia available for service between Australia and England, as I understand there is plenty - of produce offering for export. OLD-AGE PENSIONS. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will the Prime Minister state whether, in view of the prevailing high cost of living, he proposes to take any steps during this session towards increasing the old-age pen=sions?",8
18,Mr FISHER,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"That question will receive consideration, together with all other questions of a like nature, when the Budget is submitted. LEAVE OF ABSENCE. Motion (by Mr FISHER) proposed - That leave of absence for two months be granted to the honourable member for Bendigo on account of ill-health.",8
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,Is that possible? The honourable member has not been sworn in.,8
20,Mr SPEAKER,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"That is purely a question of law, not of parliamentary procedure.",8
21,Mr FISHER,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,The same course has been followed in the Victorian Parliament in similar circumstances.,8
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,It seems an extraordinary procedure to give leave of absence to a man who is not yet a member of the House-h e not having been sworn in.,8
23,Mr JH CATTS,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"He is sick, at any rate.",8
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,"I hope the honourable member will not suggest that I am objecting to this unfortunate member being granted sick leave. I very gladly concur in the motion, but I hope it is not beyond the province of any honourable member to raise a question which affects the rights and privileges of every member of the House, anH is,'indeed, a protection of the particular member concerned. I only hope that the honourable member for Bendigo will have no further need for such leave, but will be soon amongst us restored to his wonted health and strength. Question resolved in the affirmative. EXPORT OF FROZEN MEAT. Mr,.RICHARD FOSTER -,As the refrigerating space for meat awaiting export, is completely crowded so far as South Australia is concerned, I would like to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs whether boats are likely to be available at an early date for the export of frozen meat to the United Kingdom? Mr TUDOR. - As the honourable member knows, the Government, apart from the requirements of the Defence Department,' have no power to charter boats, but in regard to the boats chartered by the' Defence 'Department for the transport-of troops, instructions have already been issued that they must take, as far as they can, refrigerated cargo, and that all the cities of Australia must haye an equal chance to secure the space available-the whole of the produce must not go from one port. Those are the instructions I have given to the Transport Committee, and they are being acted on. Unfortunately, however, owing to the drought, a lot of stock has been hurried to the market for killing, and this has caused a glut. If honourable members have any suggestions to make to meet the situation I shall be pleased to hear them. PRICE OF SUGAR.",8
25,Mr SHARPE,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,Will the Attorney General say if it is possible to do anything that will prevent the Colonial Sugar Refining Company from raising the price of sugar to the public?,9
26,Mr HUGHES,STEVEDORING OF PRIZ E,I think not. NA,9
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES TREASURY,"There is a statement appearing in both Melbourne papers this morning to the effect that the Premier of New South Wales is placing on the Adelaide market Treasury Bills at the rate of 5 per cent, for an amount of £2,000,000. Is the Prime Minister aware of that fact, other than from his reading of the newspapers, and does he consider it to be a breach of the agreement arrived at at the late Premiers' Conference, by which agreement any State was precluded from borrowing other than for renewals ?",9
28,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES TREASURY,"I am not officially aware of borrowing of any kind whatever by any of the States. I have handed to the Leader of the Opposition a copy of the agreement entered into between the States and the Commonwealth at the recent Conference, by which agreement the Commonwealth finds the money and the States borrow from the Commonwealth under certain conditions. If these conditions are not complied with, the Commonwealth is on its part under no obligation to comply with the agreement. NA DEPARTMENT. TELEPHONE ATTENDANTS : CALLS : CBE JOINTEBS.",9
29,Mr RILEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have received a letter from Sydney stating that the hours of the telephone girls have been increased. The hours these girls worked were reduced while Mr Austin Chapman was Postmaster-General, and they have remained the same for six years, though I understand that there was an attempt to increase them during the time MrFrazer was Postmaster-General. I ask the Postmaster-General, is ib a fact that the hours of these girls have been increased ?",9

In all the other States the girls work 37 hours per week. The new arrangement in New South Wales does not lengthen the hours; it simply puts the girls in the State on the same footing as those in other States.",9

Also, in view of the fact that the statement has been made by the Postal. Department that these men have been dismissed because they have served nine months, will the Postmaster-General inquire how it is that other men who have had three years' employment as temporary hands have not been dismissed in place of those who have had only nine months' employment ?",9

We have taken every possible action in the matter.",10

How long will it be before these vessels - can be put to such a use?",11

55,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE,I believe that it would not be in the public interest for me to make any statement until I am in a position to give full details of the whole transaction. I ask honourable: members to bear with me. I cannot give now the whole of the details; but I promise the House that I shall make a full and ample statement of the whole transaction at the of prize vesearliest possible date.,11
56,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE,"Does the Prime Minister propose to lay on the table of the House, or to make public, the document which he said, a little while ago, he had given to the Leader of the Opposition, containing the conditions of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the State Governments in relation to loans?",11

69,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE,"Without any desire to harass the Prime Minister, I wish to say, following on the question of the honourable member for Bourke, that there seems to be one matter that some honourable members are afraid of.

75,Mr SPENCE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"We shall be prepared to provide a register and an officer to attend to it, if the subscribers will pay for this being done; 'but, I think, not otherwise. I may say that some of the statements that have been made in this connection have been very carefully scrutinized; and a check shows that the Department has come out accurate every time.",12
76,Mr JH CATTS,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"I ask the Postmaster-General if there is any truth in the newspaper statement that he intends to increase the telephone charges. If so,, will the honourable gentleman give Parliament an opportunity to discuss his proposals by embodying them in a Bill?",12
77,Mr SPENCE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"There is no doubt that we shall have to increase the telephone rates, but there will be ample opportunity for the discussion of proposed alterations.",12
78,Mr ORCHARD,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"As the Postmaster General treated my previous question with a lightness somewhat foreign to him, I ask him if he considers it reasonable that telephone subscribers should have no opportunity of checking the accounts furnished by the Telephone Department to ascertain whether they faithfully represent_ their indebtedness or not. Would he, irf ordinary business life, tolerate such a system as is imposed by the Department to ordi- on telephone subscribers ?",12
79,Mr SPENCE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"The Department presents its accounts in the ordinary business way. Will the honourable member show how a subscriber could keep a record, or properly check the departmental the record ?

83,Mr FLEMING,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"Is the Prime Minister correctly reported as having stated at the Lord Mayor's dinner that there are now no parties? Is he also correctly reported as saying that during this week the Government propose to introduce the Initiative and Referendum Bill? Does the Prime Minister think that that is a non-party measure, or does he think that the war has come to an end?",13
84,Mr FISHER,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"I consider that the initiative and referendum, and the granting of larger powers to the Commonwealth, are non-party matters-that they are national and not party. My reference at the Lord Mayor's banquet was to the fact that the Mother Country, with Australia, is now at war; and it was in that connection that I said there are now no parties.",13
85,Mr MASSYGREENE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"Is it not a fact that the referenda submitted to the people by the Labour party on the last occasion were endorsed by the Hobart Labour Conference, and made part and parcel of the party programme?",13

87,Mr ANSTEY,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether it is not the policy of the Government that the unemployed in. Australia shall not be increased by further dismissals from the Public Service of the Commonwealth?,13
88,Mr FISHER,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"It is the policy of the Government to increase employment wherever men can be profitably employed, and not to make any dismissals where such a course can be avoided.",13
89,Mr ANSTEY,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"I wish now to ask the Postmaster-General whether he is aware that at the outbreak of the war the services of a number of temporary employees in his Department, who were due for dismissal, were retained, under instructions - from the lute Government, and that they are still being employed, although other men have been dismissed since the present Government came into office?",13
90,Mr SPENCE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"No , I am not aware of that.  of the statement made by the Prime Min"" that it is not the policy of the Government to increase unemployment, will the Postmaster-General take steps to reinstate the meu I have already mentioned on the necessary work they were doing ?",13
91,Mr SPENCE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"Thes e men cannot be reinstated until their turn comes without displacing the permanent men engaged on this particular class of work. They are, I believe, cable-jointers, and there is only a limited amount of work for them; but they will get tlieir chance of any other work.",13
92,Mr MATHEWS,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"In view of the declared policy of the Government during these depressed times, will the Prime Minister take into consideration the fact that there are thousands of men waiting for their turn, while others have been employed for a longer time than that to which they were entitled?",13
93,Mr FISHER,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,The only fair and just rule in times of stress is to give every Australian citizen a share.,13
94,Mr MATHEWS,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"Exactly , and not keep one lot employed all the time.",13
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,Every Australian citizen-?,13
96,Mr FISHER,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"This must, of course, always be limited by the statutory declarations by Parliament.",13
97,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"When the Prime Minister says that he is going to give every Australian citizen his "" turn,"" is he going to do that consistently with carrying out the policy of preference *to unionists ?",13
98,Mr FISHER,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"There is no inconsistency between my statement and preference to unionists. Other things being equal, unionists will get preference.",13
99,Mr FENTON,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"Are the terms and conditions of temporary employees of the Government provided for in the Public Service Act, and are those employees under the control of the Public Service Commissioner ?",13
100,Mr SPENCE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"Certainl y they are under the control of the Public Service Commissioner; bub the matber is more complex than honourable members may think. The Act provides that such men can be employed for only six months, and sometimes they are given another three months. Then they must go off, so that others may have a turn.",13
101,Mr FENTON,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,That is the rule laid down under the Public Service Act.,14
102,Mr SPENCE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"Yes , but certain employees, particularly those engaged on line construction, are exempt from the rule, and remain continuously in the employment of the Government. Men who during their temporary employment have qualified for permanent employment by passing examinations complain when others are retained for longer than six months, claiming that as they have qualified they should be given their turn, with a view to obtaining permanent employment.",14
103,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,I draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the fact that Mr. Higgins has expressed the view that the practice of exempting certain classes of employees from the operation of the rule forbidding temporary employment for longer than a certain period is ultra vires.,14
104,Mr SPENCE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,"I do not think that Mr Justice Higgins has said that the practice is ultra vires, though he has cast a doubt on its legality.",14
105,Mr JH CATTS,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,Every Government has done what is complained of.,14
106,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,TELEPHONE AN D TELEGRAP H,Undoubtedly . NA ON TROOPSHIPS.,14

Air. JENSEN - No . Every soldier is allowed a certain quantity a day, but the supply is under very strict control. MURRAY WATERS AGREEMENT.",14
108,Mr SAMPSON,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,Can the Prime Minister inform the House when he will introduce a Bill to ratify the Murray waters agreement?,14
109,Mr FISHER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,I have told the State Premiers that as soon as their Parliaments have passed Acts to ratify the agreement a Bill will be introduced into this Parliament. They are the parties immediately concerned.,14
110,Mr SAMPSON,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,Why wait for the State Parliaments?,14
111,Mr FISHER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,The party which is making the gift should be assured of the bona fides of the parties to which the gift is being made.,14
112,Mr SAMPSON,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"Will not the Commonwealth expenditure under the agreement be expenditure on public works which will be the property of the Commonwealth? What justification, then, is there for postponing the ratification of the agreement in the manner proposed ?",14
113,Mr FISHER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,This Parliament should not commit itself to an undertaking for which the States that are also parties to the agreement have not obtained statutory authority. Last week the Premiers concerned unanimously agreed to the course which I have mentioned.. It was understood' that Commonwealth action should follow the Justice action of the States. THE BUDGET.,14
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,I ask the Prime Minister when. we may expect the Budget? A month ago the right honourable gentleman told us that it would be ready within about a month.,14
115,Mr FISHER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"My anticipations have not been realized. The war expenditure and the general difficulties of the financial situation warrant me in saying that it will be probably three weeks before the Budget will be delivered. I could make a financial statement earlier, but I think that I shall be able to deliver a complete Budget statement about three weeks hence. MUTILATION OF SHADE TREES.",14
116,Mr GROOM,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,I ask the Postmaster General whether instructions cannot be given to prevent the mutilation of shade trees by the men engaged in erecting telephone lines? I have already brought the matter under the notice of the Prime Minister. Is the honourable gentleman taking any action in this connection?,14
117,Mr SPENCE,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,The instruction has been issued to those concerned that they are to be careful not to injure shade trees unnecessarily. Of course the Department must have power to keep the lines clear of obstructions. GRANT TO BELGIUM.,14
118,Mr FISHER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"In connection with the grant of £100,000 to the Belgium Government, the following cablegram has been sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is dated London, 6th November, 1914, and the message transcoded readsWith reference to your telegram 27th October, Belgian Minister has asked that following message from King of the Belgians may he communicated to your Government:-"" I am deeply moved by the extremely kind resolution of both Houses, and very grateful for the assistance which the Commonwealth so generously offers to Belgium in the terrible crisis through which it is passing. I beg the Commonwealth of Australia to accept the thanks of the nation and of its King ALBERT."" I lay the document on the table.",14
119,Mr JH CATTS,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"Will the Prime Minister also lay on the table a copy of the message sent with the grant to Belgium, or let us know what the'message was?",15

121,Mr JOHN THOMSON,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Does he approve of reducing the rate of rent from 10 to 5 per cent, on amount of salary, charged to postmasters for use of quarters provided by the Department? 2. If so, when does he intend to give effect to such reduction? 3. Will similar reduction be allowed to non-official postmasters' who occupy Government premises?",15
122,Mr SPENCE,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. No. I am informed that the present rent deduction does not nearly represent the true rental value of the quarters occupied, the amounts deducted ranging from a minimum of 4s. 7d. per week to a maximum of 19s. 3d. per week. Of a total of 1,059 officers in charge of post-offices, 897, or nearly 85 per cent., pay a rental charge of from 4s. 7d. to 15s. 4d. per week, the latter sum being paid by postmasters at a salary of £400 per annum. 2 and 3.

ORDER OF BUSINESS Motion (by Mr FISHER) proposed- ' That the Orders of the Day be postponed until after the Notices of Motion, Government business. Mr. JOSEPH COOK: (Parramatta) [3.35] - I take this opportunity of suggesting to the Government that it is about time we knew what the business of the session is really to be. It seems to me that there is no sense or point in one party in the House agreeing to whatever the Government desire to do upon the plea of non-party arrangement and non-party attitude, under the overpowering and overshadowing influence of the war, if the opportunity is to be used by the Government, under cover of the exceptional circumstances, for the purpose of furthering what are purely party ends and a purely party policy.",15
127,Mr HUGHES,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,There is nothing of a party nature in these notices of motion.,16
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,I do not know whether that is so in regard to the first one. That may raise a very serious controversial question.,16
129,Mr HUGHES,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"The first may be, not the other five.",16
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"I do suggest to the Prime Minister that there is no use in making an appeal to members on this side of the Chamber to dispose of this allegedly non-party business, if it is only to clear the way for the consideration of business which is purely of a party character.",16
131,Mr HUGHES,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"""We are not asking for anything today beyond the formal stages.",16
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"This is a convenient time to raise the whole question. Is it not time that the Government put their cards on the table? When asking for non-party treatment of the tremendous issues arising out of the war, is it not fair that they should put their programme on the table, and tell the House and the country, and the Opposition to whom this appeal is made, and rightly made, in ' the circumstances, what they propose to do?",16
133,Mr FENTON,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,It is all in the Governor General's Speech.,16
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"Is that non-party? The honourable gentleman, himself, has supplied a case in point. The Prime Minister on Monday evening declared again and again, as he had done many times previously, that there were no parties in these days.",16
135,Mr FENTON,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,So far as the war is concerned.,16
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"The statement was, I think, a general one, and at the very moment when the right honourable gentleman was making the assertion that there were no parties, the honourable member for Maribyrnong was claiming that the Labour party would not be doing its duty if it did not urgently and immediately nationalize the iron industry -,",16
137,Mr FENTON,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"Hear , hear!",16
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,Is this a piece of canting humbug and clap-trap that honourable members are indulging in?,16
139,Mr JENSEN,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,There are no parties in relation to the war.,16
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,I see. Then does it mean that we are to plunge into party warfare in regard to these other measures ?,16
141,Mr JENSEN,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,What did you say in September ?,16
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"I said then what I say today. We did not go to the but country talking all this nonsense about stopping the elections as honourable members opposite did. Now they have been returned to power, and they got thousands of votes",16
143,Mr SPEAKER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,Order ! The right honourable member must confine his remarks to the motion.,16
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,But this motion raises the whole question of the attitude of the Government towards the business of the country.,16
145,Mr SPEAKER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"The right honourable member will not be in order in discussing things, that took place during the elections.",16
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"Wit h all due respect to you, sir, I think that I am in order in discussing them in so far as they relate to the conduct of the business of the House. Honourable members made a piteous appeal to the people of Australia that this was no time to raise party issues. That was the appeal of the Attorney General repeated time and again.",16
147,Mr SAMPSON,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,It served his purpose. He got thousands of votes.,16
148,Mr SPEAKER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"Order ! Just now I called the honourable member for Parramatta to order for the very line of conduct he is now repeating. If I allow him to proceed, I can see the possibility of an endless discussion on a matter that is not before the House. Therefore, I must order the honourable member not to follow that course.",16
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,I do not see how else I can discuss the matter. I desired to discuss for a few minutes the general attitude of the Government in the light of the declarations they have made. Here is a proposal to put through six first readings and introduce six Bills before proceeding with Supply.,16
150,Mr HUGHES,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,That statement is not in accordance with fact. We do not desire to do that.,17
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,I understand that the honourable member desires to move for leave to introduce these Bills.,17
152,Mr HUGHES,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,Quite so.,17
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"And one of them, at any rate, the honourable member admits to be of a controversial character.",17
154,Mr HUGHES,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,But we do not desire to introduce either that or the Bill referred to in notice of motion No. 2 today.,17
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"I am merely taking advantage of this opportunity to discuss the Government's declarations before the country, the business they propose to deal with, and the proposals actually before us.",17
156,Mr SPEAKER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,That is not the question before the House.,17
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"It is time that the Government told the House and the country what are their proposals for the session. We on this side are here to help them to the fullest possible extent, and to raise no unnecessary debate regarding any of these matters relating to the ordinary business of the country and to war preparations and proceedings. There is no party along those lines, but I hope there is to he something reciprocal in this arrangement. While we are helping the Government to put through this business, the Government ought not to take advantage of that attitude on the part of the Opposition to bring down a controversial programme when we have helped them to clear the decks for it. I submit that such a procedure would not he fair, but would be the essence of unfairness. And I invite the Prime Minister to tell the House, if not now, at any rate at the earliest possible moment, what his intentions are. I cannot see why he should not tell us now. The right honourable gentleman knows what is in his mind, and I suppose the Caucus has come to its decision. The Government are therefore in a position to state what their programme of business is. We expect them to play the game with us, as we have tried to play the game with them so far this session, and as we contemplate playing it for the remainder of the session in all that relates to ordinary public business and the safety of the Empire and the measures found necessary to that end. Now is the proper time for the right honourable gentleman to make a statement in the direction I have indicated.",17
158,Mr FISHER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,All I desire to say to the right honourable gentleman is,17
159,Mr WATT,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,Will the Prime Minister's reply close the debate on this motion 1,17
160,Mr SPEAKER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,It will. Does the honourable member desire to speak ?,17
161,Mr WATT,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"I do not desire to speak immediately after my leader, but it seems to me that there should be a fuller opportunity for discussion than the right honourable gentleman's attitude would seem to leave to honourable members.",17
162,Mr HUGHES,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [3.45] - Perhaps I may be allowed to say a few words before the Prime Minister replies. I am a little at a loss to know what the trouble is. We are not asking for any favour at all, nor had we thought to impose upon the good nature and kindly feeling of honourable members opposite. What we propose to do is to enable the House to conduct the business of the country. If we do not pass these motions today, judging the future by the past, we shall be left without a legislative feather to fly with tomorrow afternoon.",17
163,Mr WATT,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,That is nothing new this session.,17
164,Mr HUGHES,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"It is surely not an unlaudable desire on the part of the Government that we should have some business to go on with. It is proposed that we shall go so far with the first notice of motion as to carry the motion without introducing the Bill. We have the same intention in regard to No. 2, whilst the other four Bills may be taken up to the second-reading stage, so that honourable members may have an opportunity of seeing them. The last four Bills are clearly of quite a non-party character; they are mostly formal, and would probably take not more than ten minutes to dispose of. Therefore, I do not think this is quite the place to hang up that elegant little homily to which the right honourable gentleman has just treated us.",17
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"If they are non-party in character, and will go throughin ten minutes, there is no urgency aboutbringing them in now.",17
166,Mr HUGHES,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"I may say that I went through all these measures with the Leader of the Opposition, and he knows their contents just as well as I do. They are profoundly uninteresting to the ordinary member, and even my right honourable friend yawned when I was explaining them to him.",18
167,Mr WATT,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"Balaclava) [3.47] - The honourable the Attorney-General has suggested that the Government are making no appeal to the Opposition for goodnatured accommodation, but, as a matter of fact, he did not speak quite truly. Being - acquainted with parliamentary procedure, we know that the Government are asking for a concession from the Opposition as to the way in which they duct their business. And I think the opportune appeal of the Leader of the Opposition is a reasonable one, viz., that if we consent to convenience the Government in the conduct of their business in the way suggested, they, in turn, should tell us what work we shall have to do this session. This motion really proposes the arrangement of the business sheet, and, naturally, when we start a session with such an elaborate programme as was contained in the Governor General's Speech, we desire to know what' measures mentioned therein are going to make their appearance, and when they are to be taken. I do not know whether the Prime Minister is in a position to make a declaration on that point, but it seems to me that there is nothing unreasonable in the request of the Leader of the Opposition that honourable members should know what business we are expected to do.. It is perfectly clear to even a novice on either side that we cannot get through the programme outlined in the Governor General's Speech, even if we were to sit for twelve months. That programme appears to me to have been drafted for a quinqennial Parliament.",18
168,Mr SHARPE,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,That may apply to a State Parliament.,18
169,Mr WATT,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,It applies to all Parliaby ments that act with similar fatuity.,18
170,Mr SHARPE,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,We have passed a bigger programme than that in past Parliaments.,18
171,Mr WATT,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"There were giants those days, no doubt; but, speaking with twenty years' experience of parliamentary life, I beg leave to doubt whether even with the most amiable co-operation of the Opposition ib would be possible to put even 20 per cent, of the programme of the Government inbo statutory operation within twelve months. Apart from the appeal of the Leader of the Opposition to the Prime Minister, to let us know whether this is to be a non-party session or not, if there are to be controversial measures-and one is to be introduced today- I say that the Government should let us know what they are to be, and when they will be inbroduced, so bhat we can be ready for them. The humour, amounting almost to cynicism, of the right honourable gentleman in designating his Initiative and Referendum Bill today a non-party measure caused amusement shall con- on both sides of the House.",18
172,Mr FENTON,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,Some honourable members opposite have said the same thing.,18
173,Mr WATT,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"Yes , there were a few incautious admissions made on both sides. Ministers will find generally a resolute determination on the part of some of us against any proposition to legislate upon that matter this session. I am here, not to fight the Government on non-essentials, but to help them through a war session, and I ask them to wait for non-essentials till some other session. I hope that the Prime Minister, who is surrounded with such unique and grave responsibilities as confront him and his colleagues' today, will not think that we on this side are taking up an improper and fighting attitude. I , with a number of others here, am prepared to help him.",18
174,Mr FENTON,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,Would you postpone the Tariff?,18
175,Mr WATT,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,No . I think the honourable member for Maribyrnong will realise the difficulty facing his party in regard to the Tariff-in the matter of that terrific conflict between Victoria and New South Wales.,18
176,Mr SPEAKER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,Order ! The honourable member must speak to the question before the Chair.,18
177,Mr WATT,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,But for the incautious and improper introduction of the subject the honourable member I would not have alluded to it. I did not rise in any fighting attitude. My sole desire is that we shall have an early intimation of the busiin ness nature of this session.,18
178,Mr FISHER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"Wide Bay-Prime Minuter and Treasurer) [3.52] - I have no complaint to make regarding the statements of the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members who have spoken, but I wish to make a correction. 1 presume that the Leader of the Opposiof tion has gained a wrong impression conthose cerning some statements reported to have been made by me the other night when speaking in the Melbourne Town H all responding to a certain toast. I did not say, nor have I ever said, that any noncountry party question existed outside the matter of the war. The Leader of the position must not attribute to me anything except what I have said. the I wish the representatives of here to know that the Government are pledged to carry out their programme as a consistent duty, but that their first duty is to help in every way possible to secure victory to Great B r it a in and her Allies. I am sure both parties, whatever their differences may be, will co-operate in that way. The proposal today is to alter the business-paper, and thus enable the preliminary stages of certain Bills to 1914. be taken early, so that they may get to the printer. I do not wish to unduly press the Opposition for concessions. If they feel it their public duty to do certain, things, I have no reason for complaint. We shall endeavour during the session to meet their convenience in every an possible way. So far as we can see at present, it is unlikely that Parliament will be able to rise for the Christmas holidays u n t i l about the middle of December.",18
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"That is only a month ahead, and there is no Budget yet. ActThat",19
180,Mr FISHER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"I hope, under the cirGeneral cumstances, that a fair l y long holiday be convenient to honourable members. Mr Speaker and others coming from distant States knew, in the early days of Federation, the difficulty of a short adjournment over the Christmas holidays. We knew hew difficult it was to get back to our homes. The Budget will be delivered at the earliest possible moment. I am sorry it is not available almost immediately, but it will certainly be produced within twenty days from now. No action on the part of the Government is intended to prejudice the future attitude of the Opposition. I shall be pleased to have their co-operation; the Government will be very happy to co-operate with honourable members opposite where assistance can given. The timeto declare the policy of Act 1905. the Government is when the Budget is produced. The protection of the people of Australia is almost equal to the matter protecting the Mother Country and allied with Great B r it a in .",19

182,Mr FISHER,SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR,"The business of the will go on-that is, that which we think is in the interests of the CommonOpwealth.

191,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Yes. .,20
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I suppose that, although we are passing these things in a piece-meal way, they will all be brought to account in a general statea Bill for an ment made to Parliament.",20
193,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Certainly , in the Budget.",20
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,And I hope that there will be a special Estimate for this extraordinary expenditure.,20
195,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I can promise that.,20
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"There is not much to complain about in that regard. I merely wish to call attention to the abnormal conditions in connection with our finances. Here we are at the fifth month of the financial year, and yet the Treasurer tells us that he will not be ready to deliver his Budget until, possibly, the sixth month is nearly ended.  not the right honourable gentleman's Government get a double dissolution?",20
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It goes without saying that, from the point of view of honourable members opposite, we are to blame for everything. It is our fault that Australia has not got, amongst other things, the tin-pot Navy which the Labour party proposed. ",20
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Le t me lay once and for all a very old b5gy. My honourable friends opposite, despite the continued asseverations of their leader, never go on a public platform outside without taking for the Labour party credit for the naval preparations in Australia. Why, sir, this very note was sounded by a Minister only a night or two ago.  too.",20
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"In order that the public may know it, let me place on record the fact that the proposal made by the right honourable member for Wide Bay, on 30th March, 1909, was that we should have, in the first place, four ocean destroyers, each of 1,300 tons. Those were to be his four big boats. The Emden could have knocked every one of them out of the water. The other boats which my right honourable friend proposed ""we should have were sixteen destroyers, of the improved River class, of 700 tons each. We were to have sixteen of these cockleshells careering around the Australian coast.  the right honourable member was going to take into the bush.",20
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"They were so small that they could have heen taken into the bush-so small that we have not one of them today. The Labour party themselves are heartily ashamed of that proposal. It is time this nonsense on their part ceased. The warships that are now protecting Australia were not of their proposition at all. Their proposal was that we should have the fleet of vessels I have just described. The Emden, the Scharnhorst or the Gneisnau could have dealt with the whole lot of them, and sacked our cities as well. This, then, was the Labour party's programme-this their tin-pot Navy - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - We do not",21
201,Mr JH CATTS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,rAn d the right honourable member for Parramatta wanted to take up a collection at the time.,21
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I shall tell the honourable member what we wished to do. We desired, in the first place, that a Dreadnought should be built at the earliest possible moment.",21
203,Mr JH CATTS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The right honourable member was against an Australian Navy at the time.,21
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,There is not a tittle of truth in that statement.,21
205,Mr JH CATTS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,It is the truth. The right honourable member and Mr Deakin wanted to take up a collection.,21
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It is as true as anything else that the honourable member says in this House. I was always against the proposal to which I have referred, garding it as foolish and useless; hut I was always in favour of adequate naval protection, both here and elsewhere. After fill, the whole of our naval preparamatter tion would not amount to much if it were not for the great British Eleet which is bottling up the fleet of the enemy. But for that Fleet overseas, keeping watch and ward over us, even today, we should have fifty or sixty Emdens let loose on us, and my honourable friends opposite, and, indeed, all of us, would be very sorry for that. ",21
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"For naval defence where it is for the great fabric of Empire, I and those who sit with me have always been in favour of a generous contribution.",21
208,Mr JH CATTS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Not always. The right honourable member at one time favoured an Australian Republic.,21
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Does the honourable member desire to raise that question? Does he wish me to remind him of the company he is in over there? I think he had better let the question alone.,21
210,Mr HIGGS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The right honourable member's party raised it at the last general election, and thus succeeded in bringing about the defeat of Arthur Rae.",21
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I do not think so.,21
212,The CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I must ask honourable members to discontinue these interjections. begin these discussions, and I should not have introduced this matter today if I had not been called upon to. answer the statements and claims that are made by honourable members opposite. The fact remains that the vessels which we have here, and which are doing such gallant work in the defence of Australia, were arranged for at the Imperial Conference, which was attended by Colonel Foxton.",21
213,Mr CABB,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,He attended it only oy accident. Senator Pearce had been appointed to attend the Conference.,21
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It was not an accident. The facts are on record, and may be seen by any one. When my honourable friends opposite lay claim to the vessels of the present Australian Fleet as being part of their naval programme they demand that which cannot re- be substantiated by the facts.  them as long as they do the work?",21
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It does not a bit. Why, then, did the honourable member interject as he did a little while ago? Both sides may lay some claim to credit for the Fleet. This question of the defence of Australia should not he a party matter. I wish now to point out that this is the third Supply Bill for the. current financial year. Before the double dissolution, to which the honourable member for Maranoa had alluded, we passed a Supply Bill for £3,060,000, covering three months. The present Treasurer has passed one for £3,227,000 covering the month of October; and that now before us is for a sum of £2,367,000. Add to that the Belgium grant of £100,000, and the Loan Bill for £2,000,000, which has been circulated",21
216,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,It is to provide works-to raise money to carry on the transcontinental railway.,22
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I take it tnat the right honourable gentleman obtained leave to introduce that Bill seeing that it has been in circulation for some weeks. Does he propose to so on with it?,22
218,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Leave has not yet been granted, but a Bill is often circulated for the information of honourable members before leave is obtained.",22
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Quite so. The amounts which we are voting, in this piecemeal way, in anticipation of the Budget, soon to be delivered, I hope, total £10,754,000. Every one knows, however, that the circumstances are extraordinary, and I make no complaint whatever in regard to these expenditures. The right honourable gentleman can have as many more of these Bills as he feels he ought to have, in so far as they relate to the war preparations that are now proceeding. There is one proposal, and it was referred to this afternoon by the honourable member for New England, which I much regret was not brought to fruition long ago. I allude to the pensions for the Expeditionary Forces. That should have heen one of the first matters to be dealt with.",22
220,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,We shall bring it in at an early date.,22
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I do not pretend to know the reason for the delay. Before the men left our shores we were under a moral obligation to let them know the exact conditions under which they were proceeding to the war. Members of the Imperial Forces, both officers and men, know exactly what they are facing. The latest proposal, I read, is to increase the pensions of the soldiers. I think that the British Government might very well do so, having regard to the small amount which they are paid over there. We can afford to be more generous, ana 1 hope we shall be. When we left office there was in existence a draft pensions scheme.",22
222,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I think that the right honourable gentleman's Government agreed at the first Conference to a uniform proposal.,22
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"That was only as to the pay of the troops. There was a draft pensions scheme in existence when for we left office, but I do not pretend to know what is the reason for the delay in shaping it and putting it before Parliament.",22
224,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,It will not be long delayed.,22
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I suggest that the Government expedite this matter so that the men will know exactly what they are to expect. It is only fair to them, and particularly is it due to those dependent upon the men who are going out to fight our battles for us, that they should know what we propose to do for them. We have made an excellent beginning in connection with the war, and I hope that it is only a beginning. The war, if I know anything about it , is going to be a very long one. All the experts agree on that point, and so long as the war exists we are under obligations to do our very utmost;-to the last soldier we can send-to see it to a successful conclusion. We have sent away one expeditionary force of 20,000 men. Three months have elapsed since the war broke out, and I should like to know whether the Treasurer can indicate what course the Government are going to follow so far as the future of the war is concerned. I see that Senator Pearce said the other night, at the Town Hall, that already 42,000 soldiers had been provided for. I do not know how he makes up that number, and would like to see the details; but, so far, only one expeditionary force of 20,000 has left the shores of Australia. This, it seems to me, is very far from being a sufficient contribution, in view of the tremendous war in which we are engaged. Great Britain has 1,250,000 men under arms; and I understand that she is asking for another 1,000,000. If there is a rich prize in this war it is Australia; and I should say that Germany would rather, many times over, have this country tomorrow than she would even Great Britain.",22
226,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Do not mention that in public.,22
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I am trying to show what we have at stake. I am not quite sure that we realise the position; or, if we do, we are not expressing it as yet in the number of men we send oversea. Compare our numbers alongside the men from the rest of the Empire, or with those of our Allies, and we see at once that our contribution is a very small one. I am now merely urging the Government to get on with the recruiting of more men, so as to give Australia adequate representation in the theatre of war. It is no use sending the men in such small numbers that they are killed as fast as we send them; it is far better to send as many as possible at the outset, so as to make as respectable a show as is in our power, because this must be infinitely more effective than dribbling men along later on. I know, of course, all the difficulties of equipment, and I am not making the slightest complaint, but urging the Government to see that nothing arrests them in the course they have set out for themselves, and to send another force or two as soon as ever circumstances )ermit. Servia, who is fighting for her { ife, has a population of only 4,500,000, and she has 500,000 in the fighting line, while Belgium, with a population about as large as that of Canada, has all her available men under arms. Great Britain is arranging to have 2,250,000 men at the front, and Australia, with ii ninth of the population of the Mother Country, should, on a proportional basis, have considerably over 200,000 men in the field as our share in this mighty struggle of life and death. I know that it costs a great deal more to send troops from Australia than it does from any other place, and I am not suggesting that we should send 250,000 men at this moment, though I think that we should do that sooner than see the battle lost. We should, no doubt, aim at something considerably less than. that for the present, but Australia ought to make a powerful contribution to the fighting strength of the Empire. My idea is that the Government should get the equipment from wherever they can. Senator Pearce gave utterance to an admirable sentiment the other night at the Town Hall when he said that our Forces should be equipped from head to heel in Australia; and that would be all very well if we could do it quickly.",22
228,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,It is the most effective way to give assistance.,23
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It is, whenever it is possible to give it ; but I do not think that even this consideration ought to hinder the despatch of troops. We must not wait for equipment, but must do what we can, and in the quickest possible time. If we can get our equipment here, so much the better; and I hope we may be able to continue to do so. But we ought not to wait for the equipment; that is the point above all others to he regarded. The greater the effective force in the field in these early stages, the shorter will be the duration of the war, and less the loss of life in the long run. The Prime Minister must not understand me as making the slightest complaint, but as merely expressing the opinion that our efforts should he accelerated very considerably, because this will prove the cheaper, and better, and safer for all concerned. I had intended making some re- marks regarding the Imperial loan; that is to say, if it is an Imperial loan. The Prime Minister has not told us, and I do not think he has told anybody, where he is getting the money; and that is the peculiar part of the transaction. This is, I think, the first time in the history of parliamentary government when such an important matter of public expenditure and public finance has heen made a solemn and profound mystery.",23
230,Mr FISHEE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,It is not a mystery; there never was a war of this kind before.,23
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"We are not discussing the war, but the £18,000,000 to which reference has already been made; and the Prime Minister is under obligation to tell the country all about it at the earliest moment.",23
232,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I shall, too.",23
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"What the mystery is about the borrowing of £18,000,000 I do not pretend to know. The facts regarding it have already appeared in the newspapers, and everybody knows them; and it seems to me to be foolish for the Prime Minister to play the mystery man when the heads of other Governments are telling the public all about the situation.",23
234,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The information will be authentic when we get it here.,23
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It is authentic now. Mr Holman has already told the people of New South Wales the amount he is to get-roughl y a little less than £8,000,000. This has appeared in the newspapers in New South Wales; and Mr Holman has told the public, in addition, that he is entitled to about another £1,500,000, making a total of about £9,000,000 altogether. Sir Alexander Peacock has also made known to the public his part in the transaction; and, therefore, I cannot see - why the Prime Minister affects this silence. It is certainly a novel attitude for a Treasurer to pretend that there is any mystery about a matter that is of public notoriety from one end of Australia to the other.",23
236,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The Prime Minister is a Scotch ""oyster,"" and cannot be "" opened.""",24
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I do not think there is anything "" Scotch"" about it , but what the mystery is I should like to know. There is only one other item in the schedule of the Bill to which I should like to call attention, namely, £1,000, under the head of ""Miscellaneous,"" for the administration of the Bureau of Agriculture. We have no Bureau of Agriculture, and, as yet, no statutory authority to establish one; indeed, there is no Bill before us. It seems strange to be providing money in a Supply Bill for a Department that has not yet been created; but perhaps the Minister of Trade and Customs may be able to give us some explanation.",24
238,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I think the right honourable gentleman is rather in favour of a Bureau of Agriculture.,24
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I am in favour of putting through a Bill at the earliest possible moment providing for a scientific Bureau of Agriculture.,24
240,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The sooner we get an Australian Bureau of some kind the better it will be.,24
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Quite so, but does this item 'in the schedule get us any ""forrader""? Is it proposed to introduce a Bill immediately? If not, why does such an item appear in a temporary Supply Bill of all places? I could stand such a proposal if we were considering the Estimates, and it was thought that the money might be required within the year; but this is merely a monthly Supply Bill.",24
242,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The item may be associated with the bitter pit.,24
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"But there is another item in the schedule connected with bitter pit. In any case, it is not - usual to introduce policy proposals in a monthly Supply Bill ",24
244,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I quite agree with .the honourable member.,24
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Does the Prime Minister know why the item appears ?,24
246,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"No , I do not.",24
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I have nothing further to say at present. But, I say again, I hope the Prime Minister will expedite the despatch of the expeditionary forces. The wastage in war is, I believe, about 60 per cent, per annum, so that what we are now doing will just about keep 20,000 of our men effective in the field. We ought to try to give a fillip to recruiting in Australia at the earliest possible moment, and send along men with such equipment as we can procure, so that we may take a worthy and adequate share in the great war being waged for our safety, as well as for the safety of the whole of the Empire. The pensions proposals are, I think, long overdue; and I suggest that the Prime Minister should let us know definitely something of the scheme, which ought to have been introduced and passed through both Houses long ago. This is only due to the men on their way to the front; and I think it would give a tremendous impetus to recruiting if it were known that adequate provision was to be made for dependants.",24
248,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.35] - The Government are fully in sympathy with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition regarding the duty of the Commonwealth in furnishing an adequate number of efficient soldiers to help to bring about the early termination of the war. Towards this end we are training officers who will be able to lead the Forces required.,24

251,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The Minister of Defence is endeavouring to make the Forces that go from this country as efficient as they can be made, but I have not discussed with him the matter about which the honourable member asks. I am in duty bound to reply to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, though I suggest the unwisdom of discussing too particularly what we propose to do.",24
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,There is no need for secrecy as to the number of men to bo sent.,25
253,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I think that there is.,25
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Did not the right honourable gentleman read the statement made hy Lord Kitchener the other day?,25
255,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The statement that Lord Kitchener wants 1,000,000 more men has not been communicated to us officially, and what is desired of this Government will be so communicated. We have not been backward in providing equipment, and all Australians will be pleased to know that no other, part of the Empire, including even the Mother Country, is so well provided in this respect.",25
256,Mr FLEMING,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"That statement is easy to make, but hard to prove.",25
257,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Thos e who know most about our position are proudest of it, and all share in the credit. The Leader of the Opposition omitted to mention that this Commonwealth is the only Dominion under the Crown that has provided a fully-equipped naval unit. It has also, in conjunction with New Zealand, provided soldiers for the capture and defence of enemy territory in the Pacific. The burden we have shouldered is greater than that of any other Dominion, the cost of maintaining the Navy alone being far greater than the expenditure undertaken by our senior sister Dominion, Canada, in the despatch of Expeditionary Forces. I make this comparison merely to show that the Commonwealth has no need to apologize for what it has done. We have established factories that have been, and will be, of the greatest value to us.",25
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"If the right honourable gentleman refers to the Small Arms Factory, I say that it is not much to he proud of. It has been a great disappointment so far.",25
259,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"There are other factories connected with the Defence Department. Before the Budget speech is delivered, the Government will introduce a Bill to provide for military pensions. It is for Parliament to determine what the pension scheme shall be, so that the Government may make provision for it in the Budget. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the pensions should be adequate in view of the sacrifices made. We have provided pensions for the relief of persons in other walks of life, and there is little difference, so far as the suffering and misery entailed is concerned, between loss of life on the battlefield and failure in the industrial warfare. I do not intend to discuss the origin of our Navy, and who first conceived the idea. Undoubtedly our defence at sea was the subject of the severest controversy five years ago, and, happily, as experience has shown, the right decision was arrived at. The Premier of New Zealand, who, three years ago, strongly opposed the establishment of local navies, now is in favour of them. I believe, though I am expressing my own view only, that the strength and unity of the British Empire will be increased by a wider distribution of armed forces on the sea, with greater autonomy. If this increase of autonomy is granted freely and cheerfully by the Mother Country, the striking force of the Navy will be increased, and mobilization can be undertaken more quickly than at the present time. That view is supported by independent and capable observers who have visited this country. Their conclusion is that while unity of command is necessary, there must be a larger delegation of executive power if we are to make the best of our Naval Forces. I hope that the time is not far distant when other parts of the Empire will see fit to fall into line with the Commonwealth in the matter of naval defence. After what took place OD Monday, local criticism of the Australian Navy should cease. That Navy is believed in and supported by all the citizens of the Commonwealth, whatever their political party may be.",25
260,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Darling Downs) [4.46]. - I am sure that we would all like the outside world to know that Australians are absolutely united in their policy of defence at sea and on land. Whenever the Liberals have been in power or in Opposition, they have protested against attempts to make political capital out of the defence policy, and I hope that the Prime Minister's lead will be followed by all members of his party, including the Minister of Trade and Customs, credit being given to all who in their various spheres of action have assisted to build up our Australian defence. Only the other night the Minister of Trade and Customs claimed that our Navy is practically the result of the Labour party's efforts alone. That is the effect of what he said, and I have read no correction of the newspaper report of his speech. Then, in a manifesto issued prior to the last election, the Labour party claimed to have originated our scheme of land and naval defence. Whatever political parties may claim in this connection, nothing could have been done had not the taxpayers shown their willingness to make the necessary sacrifices. Had any protest come from the taxpayers, political parties could have done nothing. I agree with the Prime Minister that the controversy as to which political party should have the credit for our defence should end, but before leaving the subject. I wish to put on record, in an unpartisan manner, one or two statements of fact. In 1902, when the Barton Government was in power, a report on Naval Defence was obtained from Captain Creswell, who recommended the establishment of an Australian Navy, to consist of four cruisers, whose equipment he set out in detail. In 1903 a debate took place in this Chamber, in which many honourable members participated, as to whether we should continue the Imperial contribution or make a beginning with an Australian Navy. If honourable members will turn up the debates they will see that Liberals, like the honourable member for Angas and others, took up strongly the idea of an Australian Navy.",25
261,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,That was before you joined the Fusion party.,26
262,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Again , in August, the Government. 1905, Captain Creswell put aside the posal for cruisers, and suggested a ""Unit of cruiser-destroyers, torpedo boat-deby stroyers, and torpedo boats-thirty-tw all ; and in August, 1906, when second Deakin Government was in power, Australia. he reported in favour of a scheme of intended .three ocean destroyers, sixteen destroyers of the River class, and five torpedo boats, twenty-four vessels in all. In 1906 a Conmovement going. ference of the Commonwealth Naval Officers' Committee was held, and they made a recommendation that the U n it through the House? should consist of four ocean-going destroyers, sixteen coastal destroyers, four first-class torpedo boats. On the 26th member September, 1906, Mr Deakin adopted first instalment of the Naval Officers' Committee's report, comprising twelve 22nd May, 1908boats in all , namely, eight coastal destroyers and four first-class torpedo boats. Then, in 1907, the founof dation was laid by one to whom of naval all Australia is indebted for his work in the formulation of an Australian Naval policy. I refer to the policy propounded by Mr Deakin at the Imperial Conference in 1907. Mr Deakin there discussed the principles with the Admiralty, and those who consult the despatches will see clearly that the foundation of the agreement, as regards the control of the Navy, which agreement our friends opposite consummated, was then laid. I am dealing now with the claim that the Labour party originated the Australian Naval policy.",26
263,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The Labour party sat behind the Deakin Government at that time.,26
264,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"T have no desire to in troduce partisan feeling. On the 13th December, 1907, was delivered in this House, by the then Prime Minister, one of the most complete statements upon land and sea defence ever delivered in this Parliament. Mr Deakin set out a proposal for six destroyers, nine submarines, and two depot ships, making seventeen boats in all. At the conclusion of that speech the present Prime Minister congratulated Mr Deakin upon it . The honourable member for Wide Bay saidThe subject is a big one, and I do not think I have ever heard the honourable member to greater advantage. With such a subject, and with such a speaker, I have no doubt that when the time comes for the people of this country to defend themselves they will respond as he desires. I offer the Prime Minister my congratulations upon the manner in which he has set forth the defence policy of proThe Government of that day went fur ther. There was placed on the Estimates, the Prime Minister of the day, a vote o in of £250,000 for the purpose of prothe viding for the coastal defence of The Deakin Government to proceed with that policy. They submitted the proposal to the House, and did their best to get that",26
265,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Did the vote go,26
266,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The vote of £250,000 and was appropriated, but the honourable for Wide Bay thus exthe pressed the views of himself and other honourable members on that proposal on If I understand the position correctly, the Prime Minister purposes tying up a quarter a million of money in some way that I do not quite appreciate. Whilst I am in favour defence and the establishment of an Australian Navy at as early a date as possible, there are other things that, in the opinion of the electors and of this House, have a prior claim, and that this House has declared to be urgent. Th© Government had to yield to the pressure of the House, and Mr Deakin then said that he would simply have the appropriation, but that not a penny of the amount would be expended except with the consent of the House. He was allowed to appropriate £250,000,' and to place it in a trust fund, but not one penny, was to be expended until details of any proposed expenditure had been submitted to Parliament. On 22nd May, 1908, Mr Deakin s a i d It is to be devoted to a special purpose, and to be expended only when Parliament shall approve of some scheme of naval construction to be laid before it. The honourable member for West Sydney and others pressed the point, and Mr. Deakin further statedNot one penny of this amount will be expended except with the assent of this House to the way in which it shall be expended. The Deakin Government went out of office, and a Labour Government came into power, and during recess, without having submitted a scheme to Parliament, they called for tenders for ships, using the plans and specifications which had been specially prepared hy Mr Ewing when Minister of Defence in the Deakin Government. Those are the facts. Then, on the 30th March, 1909, the Fisher scheme was announced at Gympie, namely, four ocean destroyers, sixteen destroyers (improved River class) in addition to three already ordered, and one vessel armed for police duties, making a total of twenty-four, exactly the same number as had been recommended hy the Commonwealth Naval Officers' Committee in September, 1906. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports asks, "" What about the Dreadnought episode?"" At that time matters became critical with regard to the Empire.",26
267,Mr FISHEE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,It was after that.,27
268,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Somewher e about that time the international situation became critical, and several members of the Liberal party suggested that a Dreadnought should be offered by Australia in the same way as one had been offered by New Zealand; but, at the same time, they made it perfectly clear that that offer should not in the slightest degree interfere with the proposal for the establishment of an Australian Navy. That point was made clear beyond all doubt. The Labour Government were defeated that year, and the third Deakin Government' came into power. An offer of a Dreadnought was then definitely made by the Liberal Government, and these despatches contain telegrams in which the Deakin Government offered a Dreadnought, or its equivalent, to the Empire, whilst at the same time they announced their intention to proceed with the creation of an Australian Navy.",27
269,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,But there was to be no Dreadsiiought here.,27
270,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It is true that the Dreadnought, or its equivalent, was offered to the Empire, wherever it might be required by the Imperial authorities.",27
271,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,In the North Sea?,27
272,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Whereve r it was required.,27
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Rea d the' cable.,27
274,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The cable is not in accordance with the declarations made in public. . Mr GROOM - I will quote the cable in a minute. In the meantime the Government of the day announced clearly that, so far as they were concerned, they desired a conference with the Imperial authorities upon the whole question of naval defence, and were quite prepared to consider any proposal made by the Admiralty as being requisite for the naval defence of Australia and the Empire. Colonel Foxton did go to the Imperial Conference to represent the Australian Government, and bases were arrived at between him, on behalf of Australia, and the Naval authorities with respect to a Fleet Unit, which is the Fleet Unit in Australia today. That is clearly shown in the Imperial Conference's report. It was suggested that Australia should provide a Fleet Unit, to consist of one armoured cruiser of the Indomitable class, three unarmoured cruisers of the Bristol class, six destroyers of the improved River class, and three submarines of the "" C "" class. That was modified later on by an agreement with the Admiralty in 1912 that our Unit should consist of one armoured cruiser of the Indefatigable class, three second class protected cruisers of the Weymouth class, six destroyers of the improved River class, and two submarines of the "" E "" class. A motion for the establishment of the Fleet U n it was submitted in this House by the present Leader of the Opposition, and was carried, and that was the first parliamentary approval of the scheme. In December, 1909, the then Government despatched a cable to the Imperial authorities ordering the present battle cruiser Australia, which is the vessel we are all so proud of today. .There is no doubt about these facts, and the same cablegram definitely stated that the three cruisers, now known as the Sydney, the Brisbane, and the Melbourne, were to follow. This is all ancient history to most of us, but it is necessary to put the facts before the public, because, day after day, statements are made which would make it appear that the Labour party were the sole originators of our present Australian Navy. It stands to the credit of the Labour party !that they accepted the policy advocated by the Liberal party. That is the reason why all Australia is behind the policy. It is an Australian policy, belonging to neither one side nor the other. I promised honourable members that I would read the cable that was sent by the then Governor General, Lord Dudley, to the Secretary of State on the 4th June, 1909, offering a Dreadnought to the Imperial Government. That cable readsGovernment of Commonwealth of Australia take earliest opportunity, after assuming office, to inform Prime Minister, as President of Imperial Conference, that they will shortly submit to Parliament their proposals for defence of Commonwealth and its_ coasts. It is thus seen that we informed the I m perial Government thab we had our proposals for the defence of the CommonwealthThey now beg to offer to the Empire an Australian Dreadnought, or such addition to its naval strength as may be determined after consultation with Naval and Military Conference in London, at which it will be represented. This offer will be communicated to Parliament immediately it reassembles. The Dreadnought of that day was sneered at, but it is the flagship Australia of today; and I say that, whether that vessel was required for the Australian Navy or not, the fact remains that if the Empire wanted such a boat today, there is no one in Australia who would not offer such a ship to the Empire. That is the test.",27
275,Mr WEST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,But the Empire did not want it .,28
276,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"If the Empire did not want it , no harm was done in making the offer; bub while our Navy is in 'Australia, and is passed over to the Imperial control in time of war, it is an Empire force all the time, and it is the wish of the people of Australia that it should be so. I do not wish to go further, into this matter, but it is only fair that a few facts should be put on record. I hope that in future the Australian Navy will not be regarded either as a Liberal or Labour creation. It is an Australian Navy, supported by all oarties, and paid for by the taxpayers generally. As I have already said, the Labour party are entitled to credit for taking up the scheme propounded by their Liberal predecessors, and carrying it on from the sbage it had then reached. The late Government carried on the scheme and advanced it , and endeavoured to make our Navy an efficient U n it for the defence of the Empire as a whole. When the Prime Minister asks us to sink party controversy in regard to the Navy, it is well, before doing so, to put the facts before the public.",28
277,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I was careful not to raise controversial matters.,28
278,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"But the vague references made by a Minisber to croakers the other evening had their significance. The Minister of Trade and Customs made no secret of his attitude in this connection. At least he is so reported. Further, the Prime Minister, during the last election, signed a Labour manifesto,"""" in which he made the same claim. He now says he is prepared to drop it . If he is prepared to do that, so am I .",28
279,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I still think that the Labour party initiated the Australian Navy. Mr GROOM. - The right honourable gentleman is entitled to his belief; but I am pleased to have had the opportunity of putting on record the actual facts of the case.,28
280,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I was in favour of a local Navy in 1907, and said so.",28
281,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Quite so; but in 1908 the honourable member saidWhilst I am in favour of naval defence and the establishment of an Australian Navy at as early a date as possible, there are other things that, in the opinion of the electors and of this House, have a prior claim.",28
282,Mr FISHEE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Old-ag e pensions.,29
283,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The Prime Minister now says that, although he theoretically favoured the Australian Navy in 1908, he thought old-age pensions were more important.",29
284,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I succeeded in dovetailing the two matters.,29
285,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I am not questioning the academic belief of the right honourable gentleman, but it is quite one thing to have an academic belief for ten or' fifteen years, and another thing to claim that the Labour party originated the naval defence scheme of Australia. I am pleased that the Prime Minister has included the Bureau of Agriculture in his programme. The matter was not mentioned in the Speech delivered by the Governor General at the opening of the session. I do not know when Ministers decided to take up the policy. The Bureau was mentioned in the policy speech of the right honourable gentleman during the elections in 1910; hut, though the Labour party was in power for three years, it did nothing to establish it, and last session effectually succeeded in preventing the late Government from carrying it out. I hope, now that the Government have placed the establishment of the Bureau in their policy, they will carry it out on sound lines.",29
286,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Does the honourable member see any way of effectually doing it without the full co-operation of the States, because that is my difficulty?",29
287,Mr GROOM,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I think the Prime Minister will"" find that the States will not object to the Commonwealth undertaking the purely national sphere-that is, the scientific investigation of pests and diseases affecting animals and plants all over the continent. I know that on the part of the Queensland Government, the Victorian Government, and others, there was no objection to the Commonwealth taking that sphere of action. The Scottish Commission, all practical men, who knew what they were talking about, investigated the matter from an impartial stand-point, and studied it from a practical point of view, strongly advocated the establishment of this Bureau on the lines that I have indicated.",29
288,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Melbourne Ports) [5.10] - In common with other members who have preceded me, I wish to prevent this matter of defence from becoming a partisan one, but I believe that partisanship can be put aside, while, at the same time, a few facts may be given. When the first Fisher Government left office in 1909, and the Deakin Government came into existence, Colonel Foxton went to Great Britain to attend an Imperial Conference, and what took place at that Conference is green in the memory of all of us. That those who took part in that Conference believed that an Australian Navy was very desirable was very evident. Up to that point all was well.",29
289,Mr JOHN THOMSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,But what happened at the 1907 Conference?,29
290,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I am dealing with the year 1909. There is no need to go back further than that year.,29
291,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,It does not suit you to do so.,29
292,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The elections of 1910 were fought with all the usual bitterness of political fights, and the question of whether our Fleet should be an Australian one, or one that should be handed over to Great Britain, or sent to it the North Sea or anywhere else, was one of the biggest points fought out. In that year, 1910, the Age took up the stand that it was desirable to have an Australian Navy. On the other hand, the attitude of the Argus was that the navy should be a British Navy, and not an Australian one. The Argus advocated the payment of a larger subsidy to the British Government. Honourable members can turn up the files and see the articles.",29
293,Sir JOHN FORREST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,You are wrong in your dates.,29
294,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"At that time the Argus was the advocate of the Conservative party now in Opposition, and then in power; but, to the dismay of the Jingoes, as a result of the 1910 elections, the Labour party came into power, and decided that we should have an Australian Navy. At the time, the feeling in Europe was very tense, and the policy of the British Government to concentrate the whole strength of the British Navy in the North Sea was consummated.",29
295,Mr ATKINSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,You are wrong. You have mixed up your dates.,29
296,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I am just as conversant with the subject as is the honourable member. The Fisher Government came into power in 1910, and during the recess all the jingoistic talk that could possibly be imagined was talked. Everyone remembers that a twopenny-halfpenny play called The Englishman's Home was brought out. It was a beautiful dodge with the idea of charging the Labour party with being disloyal, with wanting to cut the painter, with not realizing the position, and with being without the desire to remain a portion of the Empire. The Jingoes said that the other Dominions had started sending Dreadnoughts to England, and they suggested that Australia should do the same. However, the Labour Government said "" No ! """,29
297,Mr ATKINSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Y o u are mixing up have not been able to attack the years.,30
298,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I am not. I re have member all the facts. I remember the fight, and the howling Jingoes of Viconly. toria, who charged the Labour party with being unpatriotic. I remember the stand we took. If it had not been for the one Australia. Australian Navy, Australasian seas and islands would have been at the mercy the German Fleet; there would have been would have been no Australian no warships here of sufficient strength meet the German cruisers; there would have been nothing but 6-in. would have been no 12-in. guns.",30
299,Sir ROBEET BEST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Who Australia?,30
300,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Yes , but you wished to give it away. Mr Deakin, to my surprise, took up the attitude of the other Jingoes who sat with him on the other side, and tried to embarrass the Governing the State election. ment on the question of the DreadState nought. Everywhere we heard so-called Patriotic Associations condemning the Labour party. It was a political dodge. Did we not hear the Leader of the Oppomade sition in New Zealand the other day away the whole show ? He admits now that if Australia had carried out the policy that the Jingoes intended, of sending a Dreadnought or a large warto England, and not kept it here. ship to the North Sea, we should have been at the mercy of the one, German Fleet during the last month for or so. Let us have some more evidence on the point. We remember the that in 1910, when the Labour party fused to send Australia's largest vessel to the North Sea, the patriots who jected to the land tax wished to expend thousands and thousands of pounds build a Dreadnought to send to England. They called for subscriptions with this [20] object, because the Labour party would not give effect to it. They collected £60,000 or £70,000. For what purpose? For a political dodge-to use the matter during the election 'with a view of getting political supremacy. That it was a political dodge these people knew. I say with the Leader of the Opposition in New Zealand, that if it had not been for the Labour party in power at that time keeping the Dreadnought here, all our ports would have been shelled within the last two months, and our smaller vessels would have been of no use against the German cruisers. Why is it that during the last few months we those cruisers? Because the German vessels 8-in. guns and 9-in. guns, and the Melbourne and Sydney have 6-in. guns To attack the German cruisers we require ships of the calibre and with the guns of the Australia, and we have only Honourable members opposite know the position as well as we of do. If they had had their way there Dreadto nought here, and we would have had nothing but vessels of the type of the guns; there Sydney and Melbourne.",30
301,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"That is not correct. ordered the Mr MATHEWS - It is a fact, and the honourable member knows it . Several Honorable MEMBERS - No .",30
302,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"In 1910 I had the pleasure of visiting Tasmania for the purpose of assisting Labour candidates durI went to the in the company of a Labour Premier of one of the States, but another Jingo Tory. He said to me, "" What a mistake Andrew Fisher and you chaps in not presenting the Dreadnought give to be part of the Imperial N a v y ."" Even in our own ranks there were men who had that jingoistic feeling that we should have presented the Dreadnought, I agreed with him that the Empire was and that in a war it did not matter the ultimate good that certain sections of the Empire should suffer, so long as head centre survived the fight, seeing rethat afterwards we could re-create, as will have to be done in portions of Gerobmany and France; but I said that the British could provide all the Dreadto noughts they required, that they had never asked for ours, and that Australia had no desire to be the scapegoat, and suffer, when' the possession of a Dreadnought wouldprevent it. That was my attitude then as it is today. Coming to the question of the contingents that we are sending away, I must express my surprise at the position taken up this afternoon hy the Leader of the Opposition in discussing the subject, although he was careful to say that he did not desire to make any attack on the Government. The right honourable member expressed regret that we could not get our men away more speedily and in larger numbers than at present. The honourable member for Perth interjected that what was desired was not equipment but men. Let me assure the honourable member that men without proper equipment would be perfectly useless.",30
303,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I did not suggest that they need not be equipped.,31
304,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The allied forces are fighting in France and Belgium today, and are gradually driving back the German hordes. Great Britain has some 1.200,000 more men who are being trained for service on the continent. Why are these men not sent abroad at once? The answer is that Lord Kitchener does not consider them to be efficient, and that they are not yet properly equipped. No doubt he feels that during the winter campaign, when much cannot be done, they can be well drilled and equipped to take the field in the spring. The British Army on the continent, I am assured, is the most efficient and best equipped that ever took the field in any part of the world, and it was only because of this that they were able to withstand the rush of the Germans during the historic retreat from Mons. Half-trained men could never have withstood such an onslaught as was made upon them. And so I say to the Government that every contingent that we send from Australia must be not only well trained, but so equipped that ib can at once take its place in the field. The British Government are not able to clothe, boot, and equip all their own men at the present moment, and we should not assist them by saying, "" Here are men for you, but you must equip them."" There is one other matter which J desire to bring forward, and I shall do so with, a certain amount of diffidence. With all due respect to the teetotal section of the community, I venture the opinion that those who conduct the temperance movement are the most intemperate I have ever heard speak. I wish to approach, from a common-sense standpoint, the question of dry camps. I make an appeal to those who know something of the drink traffic, and there are very few teetotallers who do. It is not so much the imbibing of strong drink as the evils of the drink traffic that we wish to avoid. The taking of strong drink in moderation does not prevent a man from being a good soldier. Some of the finest soldiers the world has ever known have had their share of beer, and some of the finest sailors their share of rum. I certainly do not desire that the Australian Army shall be a drunken one. I think that the consumption of alcohol by our troops should be supervised by the Defence Department itself.",31
305,Mr FLEMING,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Has, , the honourable member read Lord Roberts on the question?",31
306,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I know more about the drink question than fifty Lord Roberts could know.,31
307,Mr ATKINSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Does the honourable member know as much about it as does the honourable member for Brisbane?,31
308,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Yes ; I know good whisky from bad, whereas he - does not. I hope that the Minister of Defence will display his common sense by trying to regulate the consumption of alcohol in our camps instead of pretending to abolish it altogether. If any effective step could be taken to prevent the consumption of strong drink in military camps, the position would be different; but the system now in force is calculated to make drunkards of men who would hot otherwise be so. An effort is being made to maintain a dry camp. We know that the average man drinks beer. He cannot afford to pay for champagne, and he has not acquired a taste for whisky. When he cannot obtain beer in camp he surreptitiously takes in a bottle of whisky, and very often it is the vilest stuff that could be bought. I do not hesitate to say that in all our so-called dry camps there is being introduced a lot of horrible whisky, the consumption of which maddens men who would not be affected by a glass of beer. The Australian nation is not a drunken one. I have had as much experience of our young men as has any honourable member. I think I know every young man in my constituency. I have known some of the biggest larrikins that ever paraded the streets, and they would not even drink a glass of shandygaff. It cannot be said of our Australian youths that they are drunkards. We are told that the Russians are a drunken people, but I deny that Australians are.",31
309,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Whoeve r said that they were? This is most intemperate language.,32
310,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Our men may be fairly abstemious, but as they are not able to get a drink in camp they, in many cases, take into it a lot of inferior spirit. When they get twenty-four hours' leave many of them say, "" We can get no driuk in camp, so we will have a good skinful while we are out."" It is in this way that harm is done to our men. I want a stop to be put to this sort of thing, and I appeal to all who wish to abolish the evils of the drink traffic to try to bring about some better system than has yet heen conceived. I maintain that we shall never get rid of the evil by declaring for dry canteens, when we know very well that such a proposition cannot be carried out. We pass laws to regulate every phase of society, and it is ridiculous that we cannot regulate the supply of strong drink in camp instead of pretending to do away with it altogether. It is, after all, only a pretence. The community does not consist solely of intemperate teetotallers. We have in our midst many rational men and women who are moderate drinkers. I know that the teetotallers say that the moderate drinker is worse than the drunkard, but my answer is that the teetotaller does not understand the situation. The men in our camps are going tc take our place in the battlefield; some of us ought to be going with them. Many of them have, rightly or wrongly, acquired the habit of taking some alcoholic refreshment; but as soon as they are sent into camp they have forced upon them a system of which they disapprove. It is a silly method that we are adopting, and I appeal to the teetotal section of the community to devise a better one. I think that 95 per cent, of the officers of any army would prefer to regulate the drink traffic amongst their men rather than have an attempt to prevent it altogether. If we established canteens in the camps, and arranged for them to be properly looked after by the officers, we should go a long way towards securing what we desire. [20]- 2",32
311,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The officers are worse than the men.,32
312,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I am surprised that the honourable member should make such a statement. I have known officers who took drink, but who took care to keep their men sober. We know that an officer who gets drunk does not want to see his men get-drunk.",32
313,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Why ?,32
314,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Eve n an officer who was a drunkard would take care, I think, so to regulate the canteen under his control as to keep his men from getting drunk. I am not urging that our troops should be allowed to get drunk. Such a position would be almost as silly as that taken up by the teetotaller. I am merely appealing to the Government to regulate the drink traffic in our camps, and not to continue the present system, which is detrimental to the well-being of every soldier who has ever taken a drop of liquor. We should introduce a system of regulation that will make ""our camps sober, instead of sly-grog, communities. I know that the teetotal section of the community are actuated by a desire to do good. A lot of large-hearted men and women have devoted years of their lives to the cause without any recompense ether than that which they derive from the knowledge that the community is a sober one. But they do not understand the drink question, because they have never taken any part in the drink traffic. Perhaps, if there were more reformed drunkards in the Temperance party, their efforts would have more effect.",32
315,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Why does the honourable member not try his hand ?,32
316,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The arch-priest of teetotalism in this House, the honourable member for Brisbane, has an idea that at the back of my head there is a spark that requires a lot of quenching; but I tell him that I take my present stand as a man who was born in the army, and know its conditions, and who> is familiar with the urink problem in all kinds of places, from bush townships to largelypopulated centres, and my opinion is that the traffic is one to be regulated-that it is the misuse of drink, and not its use, that we have to prevent.",32
317,Sir JOHN FORREST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Swan) [5.35] It does not appear to me to be necessary to occupy much time in the discussion of this Supply Bill, because the Government have to carry on the affairs of the country, and must have the necessary appropriation. At the same time, I am disappointed that the Prime Minister has made no statement, not only in regard to the two Bills that have heen mentioned, but also in regard to the general financial position of the country. This has always been a customary course in the introduction of temporary Supply Bills; and I remember that my friends opposite, when in Opposition, were very insistent that that course should not be departed from by the then Government.",32
318,Mr ARCHIBALD,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The situation is now different.,33
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I do not think that, in this respect, there is any difference whatever. We might have been told how the revenue stands as compared with the previous year in regard to certain Departments in which some of us are interested. Personally, I should have liked to know something about the Customs and Excise revenue,' and also the income of the Post Office, not to mention other branches of the Public Services.",33
320,Mr FISHEE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The revenue is fairly steady.,33
321,Sir JOHN FORREST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,We have heard a great deal about which party or Government ought to have the credit for the establishment of the Australian Navy; but I do not think it is necessary to de.bate the question.,33
322,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Who introduced the question ? , Sir JOHN FORREST- I do not know, but I do know it was discussed all over .Australia during the elections, when the Labour party took the whole credit for the establishment of the Navy, to the exclusion of any efforts on the part of the Liberal party. There is no doubt that, at one time or another, most of us have expressed views different from those which we now hold.",33
323,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,That is the case with all progressive men.,33
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"When I was Minister of Defence, in the early days of Federation, the idea of expenditure in this direction found very little favour; and it was stated, I think, by the Leader of the Labour party of that day, that a very few hundred thousand pounds was sufficient; but, as I say, the views of honourable members opposite, and also of honourable members on this side, have changed a good deal since then. I remember at that time-il901-that the Defence vote, which was less than £900,000, as submitted by me as Minister of Defence, was, at the instance of the Labour party, reduced by £180,000; and when Sir William Lyne was acting for me as Minister of Defence, he promised to reduce it by another £60,000 in the following year. However, I do not think either party achieve any good purpose by taking to themselves all the credit for our present position in defence matters; there is no advantage in disparaging the efforts of others.. As Minister of Defence, I introduced a Bill in 1909, under the authority of which it was proposed to borrow £3,500,000 for the purpose of building a Navy; and, certainly, in our circumstances then, a'; Navy could not have been constructed without borrowed money, seeing that, owing to the .introduction of old-age pensions, we could not have financed ourselves otherwise. However, owing to the alteration in connection with the Braddon section, the borrowed money was not required. I admit that, in the early years of Federation, I was not an advocate for a local Navy, but favoured an Imperial Navy. Mine was a broad-based Imperial idea, founded on a common kindred and a common interest. My hope was that all the self governing Dominions would contribute, on a basis to be arranged, to maintain an Empire Navy, in which we should all be partners. I looked forward to a time when we should be represented at the Admiralty, and have a closer relationship with the defence of the Empire, and with the great questions of peace and war, than we haye now. Afterwards, however, when I found that the idea was not so acceptable to the people of this country as that of a local Navy, I was quite willing to accept the latter, because the object I had in view was to defend the Commonwealth, and to assist in the maintenance of the integrity of the Empire; and he would be a pig-headed man who, because he could not get all he wanted, would refuse to take anythinghalf a loaf is better than no bread. By this Bill it is proposed to appropriate a further sum of £925,000, in addition to £1.650,000 voted last month, making a total appropriation of £2,575,000 for the Expeditionary Forces. The latter figure does not startle me in the least; but, on the contrary, strikes me as moderate, considering what we have had to do in the way of equipping and paying troops, provisioning transports, and so forth.",33
325,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The amount will be big enough in the future.,34
326,Sir JOHN FORREST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The Prime Minister is probably doing his best to keep the expenditure down as much as possible; but, as he says, it must increase later on. Altogether, I do not take any exception to the figures, because I think the best is being done by the right honourable gentleman. I notice that there has been a Treasurer's Advance of over .£500,000, but that, of course, is necessary.",34
327,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Especiall y now.,34
328,Sir JOHNFORREST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I should have been glad to hear.: something about the expenditure on the transports, which, no doubt, represents a very large item. have been told that demurrage at the rate of £15,000 per day was paid. If so, it is a very regrettable fact.",34
329,Mr FISHER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Nothin g in the world could have prevented it .,34
330,Sir JOHN FORREST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"We are promised full information in regard to the proposed loans to the States. no doubt that a Bill will have to be passed authorizing the Commonwealth to obtain the money before we can carry out any such arrangements with the States. I have received some little information in regard to the amount to be lent to each State, but doubtless the whole facts will be laid before us in a document presented to the House. One point strikes me, namely, that we are not bound to provide money for the States except on the ground that the States cannot obtain it for themselves. If the States cannot borrow at a reasonable price, and the Commonwealth can do so, we should do what we can to assist them; but I think it would not be unreasonable for us to ask how the States ""propose to spend the money. It may be said that the States are responsible Governments, and that the various Parliaments wil l have to be given this information, and that, therefore, we ought not to interfere in local affairs. At the same time, if the Commonwealth has to make itself responsible for the £18,000,000 for the benefit of the States, we are entitled to some little assurance on the matter. The Commonwealth is, perhaps, the most interested in the welfare of the primary producers, and, in my opinion, it would not be too much to ask the State Governments to see that this money is spent in such a way as to be wealth-producing for the country generally. At the present time, those engaged in country pursuits are suffering severely from the drought, and I do not think we would be going too far if we inquired how much of the expenditure was to be devoted to assisting and protecting agricultural interests. It would make the passing of the Loan Bill through this House much easier if we were able to assure the people that a considerable portion of the money would be devoted to the end I have suggested. We should thus provide for the giving of assistance where it is required, to the benefiting of the whole community. It may be objected that we cannot interfere. I do not advocate interference at the point of the bayonet, so to speak, bub I I think that we should do good by the expression of our strong opinion and desire that expenditure shall be in a certain direction. Any expression of that kind would, I am sure, not go unheeded.",34

In conclusion, I feel it to be my duty to assist the Treasurer i u obtaining Supply that' I know to be absolutely required.

333,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Brisbane) [5.52] I should not take part in the debate had it not been for the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I have not heard for many a long day a more intemperate speech on the temperance question than that which he delivered. He arrogated to himself, and to those who think with him, all rational opinion on the question. He appealed for the regulation of the supply of liquor in military camps, and, I presume, on m i l i tary transports, too. I do not propose fco go fully into this very difficult and perplexing question; I take my stand on the ground that the drink traffic cannot be regulated. A f t e r 2,000 years' experience of regulation and restriction of every kind, it must be admitted that the drink traffic defies regulation and restriction, and that the only sensible way of dealing with it is to prohibit it . Section 123A of the Defence Act saysNo intoxicating or spirituous liquors shall be sold or supplied, and no person shall have such intoxicating liquors in his possession at any naval or military canteen, camp, fort, or post during such, time as training of persons as prescribed in paragraphs (a), (6), and (c) of section 125, is proceeding in such naval or military camp, fort, or post, except as prescribed for purely medical purposes. The section was meant to apply to camps of military training under our universal training system, and particularly to camps in which youths were being trained. Parliament has affirmed, and, I think, would re-affirm, the necessity of maintaining dry canteens in all camps in which cadets were under training. Under the limited interpretation that I have mentioned, Senator Millen unwisely allowed wet canteens to be established in the camps maintained for the Expeditionary Forces. Senator Pearce, who followed him , gave the section a wider interpretation, and disallowed wet canteens; hence these tears.",34
334,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Has the change had a good effect?,35
335,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,In my opinion it has. Speaking from my own experience,35
336,Mr CARR,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The honourable member does not drink.,35
337,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It is ridiculous to suggest that therefore I know nothing about the subject on which I am speaking. How many honourable members would be competent to express an opinion on any subject were a test of that kind applied ? My experience of the Enoggera camp, where there was a wet canteen, was of a most saddening character. The camp was, perhaps, the best conducted in the Commonwealth, because the military commandant of Queensland objects to wet canteens, but there was nevertheless a regrettable and a disgracef u l amount of drunkenness even there. The men were allowed so much leave that they were able to visit city hotels, and not merely to - satisfy their immediate wants, but also to obtain supplies of liquor which they took into the canip. Things became so serious that special efforts had to be made by the commandant to put an end to the scenes that occurred, and special orders were issued for that purpose. What happened amounted to a public scandal. No more sad sight has been seen in our cities and towns-and it could be witnessed here in Melbourne - tha n the reeling about our streets of drunken men clad in military uniform . What should be and has not yet been done is to stop the introduction of liquor into the camps. Why should men he allowed to take liquor into the camps when Parliament has declared that liquor shall not be taken into them? The greatest slygrog sellers that we have are the licensed hotel keepers. No persons more consistently and audaciou'sly break and defy the law than those engaged in the liquor traffic.",35
338,Mr WEST,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The honourable member should not utter a slander like that with out possessing full information.,35
339,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I am making a straight-out, open, and distinct charge. The nations now at war have ordered the avoidance of intoxicants by their armies. Kitchener's message to the troops contained the injunction to abstain from liquor, and Lord Roberts, and every other British general of note, has always advocated such abstention. General Grant, of the United States army, once saidGive me the sober man, the absolute teetotaller, every time. He is dependable. If I had the greatest appointive power in the country, no man would get even the smallest appointment from me unless he showed proof of his absolute teetotalism. If I could, by offering my body a sacrifice, free this country from this fell cancer, the demon drink, I'd thank the Almighty for the privilege of doing it. Listen to this from Germany. Count von Haiseler has saidThe soldier that can abstain altogether is the best man; he can accomplish more, march better, and is a better soldier than the man who drinks even moderately. . . . Strong drink tires and only increases thirst. For soldiers, water, coffee, and, above all, tea, are the best drinks. Honourable members carry in their memory Sir Victor Horsley's remarkable statement about the marching during the Boer war. He said that in the try in g march to Ladysmith the men who dropped out were not the tall men, or the short men, or the stout men, or the thin men, the old men, or the young men, but the drinking men, as plainly as if they had been labelled on the back. The Parliament of Norway has passed a resolution declaring that both army and navy messes shall be non-alcoholic. The Japanese and Russian navies are water waggon, and the British Navy is proceeding in the same direction. Admiral von. Muller has stated thatIn the German navy, grog rations are excluded from ships, and all canteens on shore and afloat, and to every recruit joining the navy is given a pamphlet warning them against alcoholic abuse. Among the regulations issued for the government of the New Zealand Expeditionary Forces is thisThe men are to be reminded that, on the voyage, their first aim and object should be to keep themselves fit in every respect, and that each man out of the firing line is a drag on his comrades. It should be noted that cigarette smoking impairs a man's marching power. No liquor of any sort or description will be . allowed on board, except that in charge of the medical officer for medical purposes. This prohibition includes the officers' mess. All bars are to be sealed. W it h the sad recollection of their experiences in the war with Japan, the Russians have taken a very courageous course. The Czar last year issued an order under which officers are forbidden to drink spirits in camp or on duty. Commanding officers are ordered to discourage drinking, and recommended to set an example of abstinence. are forbidden to the men at all times, and the most stringent measures will be taken to prevent them from buying them. Medical officers are to deliver lectures to officers and men concerning the harmfu l effects of alcohol. Major-General K i r k patrick, who was Inspector-General of the Commonwealth Forces, reported.My observation this year leads me to believe"" that, on the whole, the absence of liquor was an advantage, and that, as the men accustomed to alcoholic beverages at the canteens complete their service, its absence will not be noticed during the short training period of the militia. I refrain from making further quotations. The position, put in a nutshell, is this: The armies and navies of today are intended to be, first and last, efficient fighting machines. Everything that i nterferes with their efficiency is discouraged, and experience, and the result of every test and observation, prove that nothing impairs their efficiency, nothing so interferes with and hinders their work, nothing is more destructive of their discipline, than the use of alcohol. W hy are the nations today in arms against drink ? Is it because of any objection on the to the thing itself ? No. It is because the use of spirituous liquors is harmfu l and detrimental.",35

341,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The - honourable member suggests that it is not what is drunk, but where it is drunk that makes the difference. That position is illogical. The evil is in the drink itself; it does not matter where it is drunk, or who serves it . I made an interjection about the officers being worse than the men, and I desire to substantiate that statement by saying that the anxiety to have wet canteens in the camps is wholly due to the desire on the part of the .officers to secure perquisites for themselves.",36
342,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Do not say so.,36
343,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I do say it . There was a conference of militia officers in Melbourne in October, 1911, and they recommended that wet canteens should be reintroduced into camp - For what reason? The main reason was that they had lost a certain amount of pocketmoney by the abolition of the canteen. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports stated that a drunken officer always insisted on his men being sober. By that very statement the honourable memSpirits ber admitted that he knew the disadvantage of men being in any way inclined to the drink habit.",36
344,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The honourable member does not seem able to separate the man who drinks from the man who gets drunk.,36

347,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"That point is rather wide of the argument which I wish to emphasize. But let me reply to it in a word. It is impossible to distinguish between the man who drinks and the man who gets drunk, because in every two men there is a difference in the line of demarcation. The line of differenoa between drinking and getting drunk is different in the case of the honourable member from what it is in the case of the next man. Every man has his own standard by which he alone can be tested. It is morally impossible to say where the line shall be drawn between when a man is drinking and when a man is drunk.",36

The testimony is prolific and unanimous, and most of the naval experts and military officers in the world have declared in favour of dry canteens ashore and afloat. The only reply of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is that "" You know nothing about it ; you are a fanatic."" I prefer to follow the man with expert knowledge and experience.",38
368,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Perth) [6.15] - I agree with the right honourable the Prime Minister in deprecating the public discussion of matters in connection with the war, which are better l e ft untouched; b'ut, at the I think it is only reasonable that honourable members should take this, the first, opportunity of referring to certain phases of the grave issue that is before us. I intend to take advantage of that opportunity very briefly, and in a way which, I trust, will not overstep the discretion that ought to rest on the lips of every member of the House. I was very glad to hear the references to the matter of pensioning those who may be disabled, or the relatives of those who may be killed during the war, and I also join in the hope that these pensions may be of a liberality that will make any dependence upon public charity unnecessary. I think the Commonwealth can very well afford to do that, and that it should not be left to private charity to supplement what it is certainly the duty of the country as a whole to do. In this connection, I have had some difficulty with regard to a f u n d that is being added to very rapidly in Australia; that is the patriotic f u n d , which exists in the various States, and the sum total of which must now be very considerable. At the inception of the war, we had a patriotic f u n d in Western Australia that has remained in existence since the Boer War, and, while I was discussing the object of the f u n d with one of the trustees, he informed me that it was impossible to apply that money to any other purpose than the direct assistance of those who had participated in the war; thus the fund, which amounted to several thousands of pounds, was useless for any other purpose. If the Government are going to make ample provision for those who may lose their support during the war, I desire to know what the patriotic f u n d is to be applied to? According to the basis of the f u n d , in Western Australia, at any rate, the money can only be applied to the assistance of those who have suffered by reason of actually participating in the war. - Mr HANNAN - The same remark applies to the patriotic fund in Victoria.",38
369,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It now appears that there will not he the need for the application of the patriotic funds in this particular direction, and a considerable sum of money will remain unutilized simply because it cannot legally be applied in any other way. If this money cannot be applied in the direction of alleviating distress arising out of the warI am told that in Western Australia, at same time, any rate, it cannot-it is just as well at this stage to make inquiry as to whether there is any great necessity for ithe accumulation of money, in this particular fund, such as is going on at the present time. If the money cannot be utilized to deal with distress arising out of the war through unemployment, and with cases of absolute hardship suffered by women and children, it is high time another fund was in existence to which public charity might be directed, - and Which would have for its object the assistance of those who, in these present times of crisis, through no fault of their own, find themselves without the means of buying bread.",38
370,Mr HANNAN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,They have refused to do that in Victoria.,39
371,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I shall regret very much if the money in this patriotic fund cannot be utilized in the broadest sense, for which, no doubt, many people thought it existed; otherwise their money would not have been contributed to ic. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we should make a greater effort to convince the people of Australia as to the urgent necessity for entering more enthusiastically into the war. We are all proud of the contingent that we have despatched, 20,000 very fit and capable soldiers, who will give a good account of themselves; but I would like to see another contingent of the same strength going away very shortly . I do not think that we are making a sufiicient effort to advertise the fact that Australia needs recruits. In the Old Country, everywhere, there are posters exhibited calling on the young men of the country to enter the army; but here in Australia, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the only advertisement is one of 3 inches or 4 inches appearing in certain papers, and not seen by one in a hundred. It is the duty of any Government in power to point out to Australia that our interest in the war is even more vital than that of the people of the Old Land. One cannot imagine the rule of the British Isles passing away from the people of the British Isles; but if this war goes against the Empire there is nothing more certain than that the rule of Australia will pass away from the people who occupy this continent at the present time and we shall be brought under the heel of a Prussian despotism which will be something beyond anything many of our Australians believe-possible in these civilized times. There is urgent necessity for impressing on Australians, and especially on our young men, the need for defending Australia at the point where it requires defence at the present time, namely, on the field"" of battle on the frontier of Belgium. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports objected to a statement that I made by way of interjection a little while ago, that it was more important for Australia to consider the question of sending men than to send them equipped. The statement is quite a truism. Let us equip the men by all means, if we can; but, if we cannot, let us send them Home, and let them be trained and equipped there, as undoubtedly they would be in a very little while. Active operations on the battlefield will very largely come fo a stand-still during the winter, and the work of the warring nations will be mostly in the direction of preparing their forces for the spring campaign. If we send our Australians forward without equipment, they could very readily fall into a general scheme in England for the necessary training that would make them all the fitter to face the enemy on the battlefields of France and Belgium, and, perhaps, Germany. It has to be remembered that the topographical conditions of these countries are entirely different 1 from those of Australia, and it is very necessary that our Australians should get a considerable amount of training under conditions approximating more nearly to those on the field of battle on the Continent than we can find in Australia. The small, frequent enclosures, the frequent streams and ditches, the clumps of timber here and there, and the unevenness of the ground make a set of conditions entirely alien to the Australian. Therefore, I hold very strongly, that if we can get another 20,000 men together, equal in all respects to the 20,000 already despatched, we need not keep them back until they have every strap and buckle, or even every rifle required, but we should send them Home, where they would get their training and all their equipment, and be ready to take the field when they are required in the spring. I wish to refer, very briefly, to a matter which has been discussed with some heat, that is the question of which party, if any, is entitled to the particular credit for bringing into existence the Australian Navy.",39

I have a recollection that carries me over the whole record of the Federal Parliament, and I must say that for many years the question of an Australian Navy Auswas' regarded by all parties as being aloutside the range of practical politics. That was during theperiod when the the Imperial Navy was absolutely unrechallenged by any other Power. So long t as the Imperial Navy held that position many members of the Federal Parliament-member s of all parties-too k up the attitude indicated by the honourable hismember for Darling Downs as that of the Prime Minister when he said that the money proposed to be de-votfed to the foundation of an Australian Navy could very well be applied in other direc-.ttitude of many members during the earlier years of the Parliament. '""'The question of creating an my Australian Naval Force became acute of only when Germany, having made great strides in constructing her Navy, began almost openly to look forward to the time when she would be able to challenge the British Navy. When, following these . developments hy Germany, the Imperial authorities realized that it was necessary to' re-arrange the disposition of the Navy and to 'concentrate very largely in the North Sea, the question of .creating an party. Australian Squadron became a very pressing one to the people and the Parliahonorment of the Commonwealth. The honorwhich able member for Darling Downs has referred to the Conference of 1909. That undoubtedly was the particular time when the present Australian Squadron took definite shape. And it took that shape at the instance of the Imperial authorities themselves.' There were at that time in Australia two schools of thought regarding an Australian Wavy. One was .the .deep-water school, as it is usually called, while the other comprised those who regarded the defence of Australia as more likely to be accomplished by the creation of a mosquito Fleet- a Fleet of the smaller class of vessels, that could act only as a defence force close about our coast. The Imperial authorities, however, submitted to the Conference of 1909 a recommendation in which they pointed out that a defence force of that kind for Australia would not meet all the requirements that might arise. I wish to make only one brief quotation to indicate this attitude. At page 23 of the report of the Conference we have the following:In the opinion of the Admiralty, a Dominion Government desirous of creating a Navy should aim at forming a distinct Fleet Unit; and the smallest unit is one which, while manageable in time of peace, is capable of being used in its component parts in time of war. Under certain conditions, the establishment of local defence flotillas, consisting of torpedo craft and submarines, might be of assistance in time of war to the operations of the Fleet; but such flotillas cannot cooperate on the high seas in the wider duties of protection of trade and preventing attacks from hostile cruisers and squadrons. operations of destroyers and torpedo boats are necessarily limited to the waters near the coast, or to a radius of action not far distant from a base, while there are great difficulties in manning such a force and keeping it always thoroughly efficient. A scheme limited to torpedo craft would not, in itself, moreover, be a good' means of gradually developing a self-contained Fleet capable of both offence and defence. Unless a naval force-whateve r its size-complie s with this condition, never take its proper place in the organization of an Imperial Navy distributed strategically over the whole area of British interests. There was a clear indication by the experts of the Admiralty as to what, in their opinion, Australia should do if. it had made up its mind to attend to its own sea defence. At that time a Liberal Government was in' power here, and we find immediately an indication hy that Liberal Government that it was prepared to carry out the recommendation of the Admiralty as made at the Conference. Mr Fowler. On 8th December of the same year, the following cable messagewas despatched by Mr Deakin to the Secretary of State for the Colonies:The Commonwealth Government will be glad if the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty will arrange for the construction, without delay, of an armoured cruiser of the Indefatigable type, to be followed by three unarmoured cruisers of the improved Bristol typeThat order was given, and would have teen carried out in its entirety, I believe, if the Liberals had remained in office.",40

The Liberal .Government acted immediately The on that suggestion. They ordered an armoured cruiser-the Australia-and she is now in commission.",41
384,Mr RILEY,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,This is news.,41
385,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It is news that the honourable member does not relish, but I am placing it on record as an historical fact. Of the three unarmoured cruisers that the Liberal Government ordered, two it can are now in commission-the Sydney and the Melbourne. They ordered a thirdthe Brisbane-hu t when the Labour Government came into power the order for the construction of that vessel in the Old Country was cancelled, and it was placed in Australia.",41
386,Mr RILEY,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Does the honourable member object to that ?,41
387,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I certainly do, in the circumstances. It was a gross blunder - 1 a blunder from which we are suffering today, because this cruiser Brisbane, being built in Australia, is going to cost about double what it would have cost had it been built at Home.",41
388,Mr RILEY,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,That is only an assertion.,42
389,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Well , we have had a report on the question, which bears out what I say. But the worse feature of all is that, if the order for building the cruiser had remained where the Liberals placed it , the vessel would in all probability have been in commission now, whereas we are not likely to see her afloat during the continuance of the war. If there is as big a mess going to be made in the case of the Brisbane as there was in the case of the Warrego, she will not be of much use when she is afloat.",42
390,Mr HOWE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,What was the mess over the Warrego? She is the best of the lot.,42
391,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I do not propose to take up the time of the House in order to enlighten the honourable member. Those vessels were ordered by a Liberal Government.,42
392,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I better have the military censor here.,42
393,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The facts I am giving are on record, but they are being ignored by honourable members opposite, who, outside before a public ignorant of the position, make the claim that to the Labour party alone is due the credit of the existence of an Australian Navy today.",42
394,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Maribyrnong) [8.2] I do not intend to enter into any elaborate argument as to who is or is not responsible for the Navy and the Defence Forces we have in Australia today.,42
395,Mr ATKINSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,What did the able member say during the elections?,42
396,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I told the truth , and I hope the honourable member did the same.",42
397,Mr ATKINSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Dozen s Labour candidates did not do so.,42
398,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The electors are the best judges. I say, once again, as I have said on the platform, that if there is one man to whom Australia owes special thanks in connection with naval and military defence, it is the present Attorney-General. I refer honourable members opposite to the speech delivered by that gentleman in the first session of the first Federal Parliament, on 31st July, 1901, as reported on page 3292 of Hansard for that year. This was, indeed, a very early commencement; yet in that speech honourable members will find what is practically a forecast of the defence system as we have it today. The present Attorney-General on that occasion declared that we must defend ourselves, and it is wonderful how he foretold what has taken place during the war in various parts of the world. The honourable member for West Sydney on this question of defence was then in opposition to many members of his own party; indeed, there were times when he was almost mobbed by electors outside this chamber. The fact is that in this connection he was a long way in advance of his party at the commencement of Federation; but his speech outlined unmistakably our present universal system of training on land, and, without specifying any particular class of vessels, showed the necessity for some naval force to take the place of the British squadron in Australian waters.",42
399,Mr SAMPSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Mr Crouch, the then member for Corio, was really the first to make the suggestion.",42
400,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"If the honourable think we had member for Wimmera can point to any earlier proposals of the kind I shall be glad to listen to him ; but I do not think that any one was before the honourable member for West Sydney. We are all, I am sure, devoutly thankful that there is an Australian Navy in Australian waters to protect us today. It may have been that, had the other party been in power all the time, they would not have been quite so expeditious in bringing the Australian Navy into being.",42
401,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Is that fair?,42
402,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Fai r enough. I am honoronly judging the party to which the honourable member belongs by their conduct in the Federal and other political spheres-the y are good hands at promising, but very poor performers. of other However, my desire is to refer to the Northern Territory, and particularly to an agreement for the establishment of freezing works at Darwin entered into between the Cook Government and Sir William Vestey, of the firm of Vestey Brothers, West Smithfield, London. As a layman, I take exception to the terms of the agreement as being vague. Of course, it is quite likely that after I hear the honourable member for Angas-wh o was Minister for External Affairs in the Cook Government- I may modify my opinion; but it appears to me that the agreement is very much in favour of Vestey Brothers as against the Commonwealth, or, what is more important still, as against the future producers and cattle-raisers of the Northern Territory. The first paragraph of the agreement referring to the conditions says The said company shall be incorporated under the Companies Acts of the United Kingdom, or of the Commonwealth, or of any State or Territory of the Commonwealth, for the purpose of taking over the said works and the rights and obligations of the contractor under these presents: . . . . In my opinion that paragraph is vague, and apparently gives to the firm the right to register under any Companies A ct that may be suitable to them. In some of the States there are Companies Acts on which I do not place much reliance, though in other States the law has been brought somewhat up to date. At present there is no Commonwealth Companies Act, and my fear is that in this paragraph of the agreement may be found a loop-hole which will allow this wealthy English company to register under an A ct which would not give the Commonwealth very much control. In the same paragraph of the agreement we find it set forth that the capital of the company shall not be less than £100,000, and thatThere shall be a condition in the memorandum of association of the said company that a majority of the shares in the said company shall always bo held by British subjects. Only recently we have read how some companies are formed in Australia, and we do not know but that the British subjects who hold the shares may not be in collusion with the subjects of some other country, particularly of the United States of America. I am anxious to know whether Vestey Brothers have any connection with the Meat Trust as we know it .",42
403,Mr RODGERS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,That is dead!,43
404,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It is not dead. Woodrow Wilson declared that he was going to k ill the Meat Trust in America by throwing down the Protectionist barriers, and thus allow free competition, but the Meat Trust, which can legislate even before the Legislature, made due provision. It came to Australia, and went to other countries, and set up in business, so that when the Protectionist - barriers were thrown down in America millions of pounds weight of Australian and other meat were sent over to the United States, and sold under the auspices of the Trust in the same old way. As a layman, the agreement appears to me to be altogether favour of Vestey Brothers, with their large business at Smithfield, where, I may say, the American Meat Trust also has some fifty establishments. There is nothing to insure that there is no connection between the firm and the Trust.",43
405,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The firm are the great competitors of the Trust.,43
406,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"That may be, but I have seen firms flying at one another's throats one month, and the next month hanging on one another's necks. This has been the history of companies in Victoria, New South Wales, and Australia generally, and particularly in America; wherever competition proves disastrous to the competitors, they come to an arrangement to share the profits. Then, again, in the agreement certain specified charges are set forth in connection with the freezing of stock belonging to other persons than Vestey Brothers. This is to be doneat the average price from time to time charged for similar services at private meat works in tropical Australia (that is to say, at meat works situated north of the parallel 23 degrees 27 minutes), together with any addition to, and subject to any deduction from, such price which may be agreed upon from time to time between the Administrator and the contractor This, I take to mean, that the charges are to be the same as those at works at and about Rockhampton, or further North. The Administrator may be a very good man in certain respects, but I question whether he is a fit and proper person to determine the conditions governing the operations of a big company like this in the Northern Territory. This is too large a matter to be settled even by a Government. The agreement should have been submitted to the Parliament for discussion and the suggestion of amendments. If the producers in the Northern Territory are to be protected, we shall have to do for them what has been done in Victoria, New South Wales, and other States; the Government must look after freezing and export operations. Unless there is Government control, big men possessing money and influence will secure all available space, to the exclusion of small men. Parliament should have reviewed the agreement, so that the interests of the small men would be safeguarded.",43
407,Mr FLEMING,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Ver y few men ship in away their frozen meat themselves.,43
408,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I have known individuals to do it . A clause of the agreement would lead one to believe that the company is to obtain no concessionThe contractor shall not, in any circumstances, claim, or be entitled to, any grant, contribution, payment, or assistance by or from the Government towards the cost of the said works. Although it would thus appear that the company is to receive no concession, it is specified that the Commonwealth shall make improvements to the jetty, bore for water ito give the company a water supply, charge railway freights in accordance with the North Queensland railway freights, extend the railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River, and lease to the company 160,000 acres at the rail head and at Glencoe. trol of the company has passed out of the hands of the Government, and rests almost exclusively, so far as the enforcement of the main provisions of the agreement is concerned, in those of the Administrator. He would have to be a wonderfully good all-round man to be able to determine the big commercial questions which must crop up.",44
409,Mr SHARPE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,What Government entered into this agreement?,44
410,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I made it , and take full responsibility for it .",44
411,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I hope to hear the honourable and learned gentleman's explanation. An y person sires to export frozen carcasses is required to give six months' notice to the proprietors of these works, stating what number of carcasses he wishes to have frozen at the works. That seems to me an excessive notice to demand. In addition to the concessions which I have mentioned, paragraph h. of clause 4 of the agreement saysSubject to any law for the time being in force in the Northern Territory, the contractor may, on such terms as may be approved by the Administrator, supply electricity in the town of Darwin for lighting and other purposes, provided always that, in the event of the contractor and the Administrator being unable to agree as to such terms, the dispute shall not be referable to arbitration. I wish to know whether the ex-Minister of External Affairs absolutely satisfied himself that there is no connection between Sir William Vestey and the American Meat Trust. If there is such a connection, the Northern Territory has been placed in the hands of those who have been manipulating the meat products of the United States of America, and who will , if they get the opportunity, manipulate the meat products of Australia.",44
412,Mr RODGERS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Does the honourable member say that there is a connection ?,44
413,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"When I find two big companies operating close to one another, and on the same lines, I suspect a connection. The fact that a certain proportion of this company's shares must be held by British subjects does not make the position satisfactory. I have a strong suspicion that there is a connection between the company and the American Meat Trust. The company has a lot of land in the Northern Territory, and the agreement will give it a still larger area. The con- It has also properties in the north-east of almost Western Australia. Vast tracts of country are owned or leased by it , and it possesses nearly 200,000 head of cattle. To hand over the Northern Territory to a company associated with the American Meat Trust would be disastrous to settlement there. If the honourable member for Angas is able to disabuse my mind of the suspicions which I entertain, I shall be very pleased.",44
414,Mr SAMPSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Is it fair to associate the company with the American Meat Trust without evidence in support of the connection ? _ Mr Fenton - Apar t from any assowho de- ciation which there may be, I say that too much power has been given to this company. It seems to me that competition is shut out for all time. The charges seem likely to be anything that Vestey Brothers wish to make them. There is to be an allowance of 1 \ per cent, for depreciation, which would come to £7,500 a year. That is to be provided by outside freezers as well as the company. The company will be in a position to control the cattle business and the export trade of the Northern Territory-at least, that is my reading of the agreement. T am sorry that the last Government did not bring the proposed agreement before Parliament. Had that been done, the agreement would not have been made in the form in which it was drafted. Should the majority be of the same opinion as I am on this matter, I hope that things have not gone too far to prevent the alteration or cancellation of the agreement.",44
415,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Angas) [8.26] - I propose to deal with the two matters OD which the honourable member for Marithirty-nine byrnong has touched. I regret that the contribution origin of the Australian Navy has been brought into this debate, but, as it been spoken of, I wish to set one or facts before the Committee. I have had the honour of representing, first, the State of South Australia, and, subsequently, July, 1903, I saida constituency of the State, in the House of Representatives, from the beginning nising of the Federal Parliament, and I am about to speak from a memory which is pretty find retentive. At the beginning of Federaour tion, Sir Edmund Barton declared, i two speeches, the very policy which is now being developed in our naval and dens and responsibilities. military defence. I opposed the Naval extent, Agreement of 1903 because I was afraid vast that, if the subsidy to the Imperial GoProportionate vernment were continued without qualiby fication, the construction of an Ausinternational tralian Navy might be definitely postrisks poned; but, during the discussion of the matter, Sir Edmund Barton said that he could not hope to begin even .the nucleus of an Australian Navy while the BraHdon blot existed. In his preliminary ment of policy in 1901, he declared that he intended to go in for, not an extravanecessities gant system of land defence, but the lishment of a Citizen Defence Force. June, 1909, an arrangement was made with the Premiers of the States, which was ultimately not ratified by the desires, electors under which the Braddon blot would practically have ceased to have out. effect as from that time. The honorLiberals, able member for Parramatta, who was then Minister of Defence, introduced a Bill for the creation of an Australian Navy, on the assumption that the Braddon blot would so cease to have effect.",44
416,Mr WISE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,W as not 'that proposal the result of the decision of the Imperial Defence Conference ?,45
417,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I do not wish to claim credit for any party in this matter. fore the Liberal Government took office in 1909, a memorandum was drawn up by its predecessor, clearly setting forth the principle of an Australian Navy. That was telegraphed Home in A p r i l , 1909. When the Liberal Government took office, Colonel Foxton was sent to England to attend an Imperial Conference, and what seemed to be the policy of Mr . Deakin in 1906 was adopted both the Liberals and the Labour party. Both parties agreed to the establishment of an Eastern Fleet of vessels, to .which' Australia's was to be one U n it , and that brought about our existing local Navy. has I do not propose to quote ancient histwo tory more than is necessary to justify what I <have said from memory. Speaking on the Naval Agreement Bill on 14th Those who rely upon this method of recogour Imperial obligations have a concrete suggestion for carrying them out. We may then in the creation of some sort of local Navy a way of recognising and acknowledging responsibilities to the Empire and to the n Commonwealth. As members of the Empire, we must bear a reasonable share of its burThe method and however, must pay some regard to the local desire for independent control and the differences between the interests at stake. contributions are not called for any excessive intermeddling on our part in affairs, nor as a premium upon voluntarily incurred by us and covered by the Imperial Fleet. But as units in the great Imperial system whose real strength lies in the voluntary co-operation and independent development of its various members, we must, and do, acknowledge an obligation to bear some part of the cost of naval destatefence; and we are prepared to do so by a method which will pay some regard to local and instincts, and will not, in subestabstance, oppose Imperial desires. In That method was to be the method of building up the local Navy,. and at the same time, in accordance with Imperial would transfer the control of that Navy to the Admiralty when war broke That policy was declared by some at any rate, as far back as 1903, and is the principle now being administered in connection with the naval defence of the Commonwealth. Honourable members will find in Jebb's work on the Imperial Conference, published in 1911, a statement pointing out the vision of some Liberals, as well as some Labour men from the Colonies, particularly Australia, of building up a fleet, which on Begreat emergency might cover any failure by the Imperial Fleet being concentrated in northern waters to safeguard Pacific interests. Turning now to the policy for the development of the Northern Territory, I take absolute responsibility for the drafting and conception of that policy. It took me about five months to consider what was best to he done. When I had the honour to become Minister controlling by the Northern Territory, I found that we had to face very serious problems. There was an annual deficit of nearly £400,000 in the revenue. I found pastoral settlement absolutely stagnant. In the Victoria River district, which is the country to be connected with the freezing works, there were only 13 lessees, who were paying a rental of about £2,000 a year, and I think the area held was something like 38,000 square miles. Amongst other holders were Vestey Brothers, who had recently acquired in open market a considerable area of leased country which gave them a total holding of some 14,000 square miles out of the total of 38,000 square miles. There was no easy means of getting Victoria River cattle to market. There was a strong probability, and almost a certainty, that the Western Australian Government would establish freezing works at Wyndham, and if that had been done it would have been a bad thing, for, at all events, the bulk of the lessees in the Victoria country. I may tell honourable members opposite that I read the terms which the Labour Government in Western Australia, it was said, were offering to private people to build freezing works in Western Australia, and they were more liberal than I have given. What did we do? I found that my predecessor had put an amount of £25,000 on the Estimates towards freezing works that would cost at least £200,000. You cannot possibly carry on freezing works unless you have cattle stations tied up with those works. What had been done by my predecessor in office in this respect? There were not 5,000 cattle a year tied up with the freezing works. We are now getting built by Vestey Brothers in the Northern Territory, freezing works which will accommodate at least 30,000 cattle a year, and Vestey Brothers alone are capable of keeping those works going. I say that it was not sound administration on the part of those who preceded us to set about establishing freezing works before they had contracts definitelv enabling them to keep those works going. I asked my colleagues, if I failed to make a satisfactory arrangement with private persons, to restore the provision of £25,000 towards the erection of freezing works.",45
418,Mr THOMAS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Did we think we were going to build the works for £25,000?",46
419,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I did not say that. That amount was a vote towards the cost of building them.,46
420,Mr THOMAS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"At any rate, we were going to build the works ourselves, and not hand them over to private people.",46
421,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I am coming to that. I have pointed out that there were not enough cattle tied up by agreement to enable the works to be fully carried on. We may have been political Micawbers, waiting for something to turn up which we had not provided for, but that something had not turned up, and nothing substantial had been done to bind some of the stations to send cattle to the works. I had an opportunity through other companies of establishing freezing works there. I did see some gentlemen who may or may not have been connected with some of the trusts. There was one gentleman who came out from Armour and Company, in England. I saw him, and I am not sure whether Armour and Company, in England, is dissociated from Armour and Company, of New York. I had reasons for suspicion as to what their relations were, but I did not act on suspicion. My colleagues and I obtained from Sir George Reid a report running into 200 pages of foolscap, which will give the honourable member for Maribyrnong more accurate information than he now possesses if he cares to study that document. I believe it 'is in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the members of the Government party will find in it all the information as to who really are the three or four firms who boss the meat trade in the Old Country.",46
422,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Who are they ? Mr Glynn, - They are not Vestey Brothers. One firm has a name that smells of a German proprietary; but its connection is not clear. We know the extent to which the evil of the Meat Trust exists in England, and the possibility that may exist of its extension to Australia. I told the gentleman from Armour and Company that I would not deal with his firm.",46
423,Mr SHARPE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Why ? ,46
424,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Because I did not like the name. I might have been right, or I might have been wrong, but there was a fear of the Meat Trust in Australia, and unless I was absolutely sure of what I was doing I was determined to take no risk. Who are Vestey Brothers? I made inquiry from the High Commissioner's office, and from other sources. I already knew something about them. I took the English financial papers, and read their recent re-arrangements. They own about forty-seven meat works throughout the world-the y or The Union Cool Storage Company, of which they are the controlling shareholders. They are some of the biggest meat dealers resident in the British Empire, and amongst the biggest in the world. They are an English firm, and it is stated to me that the Vestey Brothers are the strongest barriers against the methods of the Meat Trust in England. They are Englishmen who are trying to keep the English market. free. They are not mixed up in any way with obnoxious operations in Smithfield. I do not wish to mention names in the House at present, because the document has not been published, but there is a large portion of that report from the High Commissioner which could be put on the tabltf of the House at any time. It is not confidential, and honourable members who peruse it will see who are the parties who are beginning to control the meat industry in England. I say that they are not Vestey Brothers.",46
425,Mr BBTJCE SMITH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,If the report runs to 200 pages of foolscap you may be sure it will not be read.,47
426,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I r'ead the report immediately it was received, and I then handed it to my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, who, I think, also read it. The honourable member for Maribyrnong first threw out a suspicion on Vestey Brothers, by attempting, without evidence, to associate them with the Meat Trust. Then he objects that there is some suspicion about the formation of the company. They need not form a company. Vestey Brothers are the contractors, and are bound, by the provisions of their agreement, and all the conditions say is that, if they do form a company, we will permit the transfer of the interests they have acquired to the company, which must be incorporated, if not under the English law, under whatever law operates in the Northern Territory. The law that operates there is the Commonwealth law, and if we choose to pass a uniform companies law, they must come under that. All we ask is that the company he incorporated under some British Act. ""We can control them no matter what Act they are under. Parliament could tomorrow morning pass an Act modifying the conditions of incorporation under the agreement, no matter what Act the company are incorporated under.",47
427,Mr WISE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Did the honourable member say we could pass a uniform Companies Act?,47
428,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"We could pass a Companies Act, but not a thoroughly comprehensive one; there are difficulties in the Constitution. But we can pass an Act for the Territory. We have absolute power as regards the Territory, and we are now dealing with the Territory only. The next point which the honourable member for Maribyrnong took up was the concessions given to the company. What - concessions were given ? Absolutely none. Any one can start freezing works in the Territory tomorrow. No monopoly is given. We have given Vestey Brothers the right to take up leaseholds under existing Ordinances, and I refused to give them anything beyond what Parliament had sanctioned. All that we promised to do was to facilitate their getting these lands.",47
429,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,-They have land at the railhead and at Glencoe.,47
430,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,We promised to assist them to get land as holding ground in the vicinity of the works and at the point of shipment.  thousand acres is not a big area in any case.,47
431,Mr BBTJCE SMITH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,It is not as big as some of the .holdings which honourable members of the Labour party took up along the route of the transcontinental railway.,47
432,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The conditions under which the land is taken up are provided in the Ordinance which the Labour party framed. All I promised to do was to facilitate their getting those areas where they would be effective for the purposes for which they are intended. They are held under a perpetual leasing system in some cases, and in others on the terms of pastoral or miscellaneous lease. The honourable member has referred to the question of a concession of railway rates. What is the nature of that concession? We merely declare what rates shall be charged for five years. It took me nearly two months before I was satisfied that they were fair rates. Even after the agreement was first signed, though not by myself, I . declined to abide by the rates fixed, and Sir William Vestey even got as far as Thursday Island before agreeing to the ultimate arrangement. He was quite right to see that the charges were not too heavy upon him, and on the other hand I was right in seeing that the rates were fair from the Commonwealth point of view. The rates fixed upon were the minimum Queensland rate of 9s. 2d. per head of cattle, with a maximum of, I think, lis. 6d. I was informed that it was not intended in Queensland to raise the rates beyond 9s. 2d - honorabl e members will see that I was not sleeping on the matter-bu t if the Queensland rates are raised our rates will also go up to the maximum prescribed. The honourable member says that we made no provision for the treatment of the cattle of private owners. Is it not a great stroke to compel a firm spending their own money on the erection of freezing works to give up part of their space to other lessees? Not only that; if at any time they do not use any of their space, the whole of that space not used must be devoted to the use of outside lessees. They must give up, if required, at least one-third of their space to outside lessees. I am afraid, however, that it will be some years before other lessees will be in a position to use that amount of space. In any case, as development proceeds there is nothing to prevent any other person from starting freezing works.",47
433,Mr THOMAS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Do you think that any other company will start operations?,48
434,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Before we left office we were making provision for the starting of other freezing works in another part of the Territory.,48
435,Mr SHARPE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Can the honourable member give the name of any other company wishing to start freezing works?,48
436,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"There are none as yet, but one individual told me that there were prospects of freezing works being erected in another part of the Territory, and I told him the conditions. He got no rights, however, though we facilitated his project in every way while he was negotiating with British capitalists by holding up land, which would otherwise have not been occupied. I can assure the honourable member that we were not asleep in regard to the problem of the Northern Territory. However, I have not done with these, so-called concessions about which the honourable member for Maribyrnong was talking. The honourable member spoke of erecting sidings. Does not every railway company provide for the erection of sidings on the same terms? They are to be provided on the ordinary terms of payment for services rendered. Then again, in regard to the question of electric light, the Commonwealth were not prepared to establish an electric light plant. I discussed the matter with the Administrator, and he did not think it would be profitable, or that we were likely, under the circumstances, to erect such a plant. In any event, Vestey Brothers will only be permitted to supply Darwin with electric light, and only on terms settled by the Administrator.",48
437,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,There is too much left in the hands of the Administrator.,48
438,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Who is the Administrator? The man appointed by the Labour Government to control the Northern Territory.,48
439,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I do not think that the Minister should hand over everything to the Administrator.,48
440,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The Administrator is doing his duty. He is a forcible character, and a very zealous and energetic official. But he is not the only man concerned. The Minister has control and direction. When we were dealing with this matter I telegraphed for Dr Gilruth, and when he came to Melbourne I had the advantage of his co-operation and knowledge during several weeks of very keen negotiations in regard to this and other matters. The honourable member referred to the fact that any one wishing to send cattle to the freezing works must give reasonable notice-si x months in some cases. And why not? Should a man be permitted to send in cattle for treatment without notice ?",48
441,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I do not say so.,48
442,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"All these matters were very carefully considered. It was not a case of the head of a Department bring-, ing a matter to the Minister for his approval. The files show the extent of the negotiations. For five months the matter was given most careful scrutiny. There were objections to this and to that, and there were amendments suggested by the one side and then by the other side. As a matter of fact, Sir William Vestey had to come out to Australia to conclude the negotiations before the terms were finalized, indicating an amount of administrative care and caution, at all events, worthv of some commendation. The honourable member has referred to boring. In any eveuu bores were to have been put down in the Northern Territory.. We shall simply be putting down bores for which, among others, parliamentary provision had already been made. The Administrator told me that bores would have to be put down close to Darwin. There is not a single concession given to Vestey Brothers that is not reasonable. There is no concession, except as regards the railway rates, and that concession, which is really a declaration for guidance, is only for five years, being based on the Queensland rates and the minimum at present in force in that State.",48

We promised to construct that railway; the Bill for the purpose was passed last session. There is nothing in that point.

Vestey Brothers have no conexclusive cession in land. They were entitled some reasonable declaration as to what railway rates would be charged from Katherine River for the first Reasonable rates were fixed. The charges for treatment at the freezing works are to be the same as are charged in other freezing works in tropical tralia. Some allowance is to be made for increasing or lowering the rates to meet the special conditions of the Territory. What this allowance will be is a matter for expert arbitration as provided for in the agreement.",49
449,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,There will be no arbitration if the contractor and the Administrator agree.,49
450,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Naturally ; but if the Administrator does not agree to the charges suggested the matter goes to arbitration. What could be fairer? We cannot leave the matter to the absolute discretion of one party. These are the rates to be charged for the treatment of the cattle of men who have the privilege of having their cattle treated by this private contractor to the extent of a third of the total capacity of his works.,49
451,Mr SHARPE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,How many stations have these people secured?,49
452,Mr GLYNN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I know every holding, they have in the Territory, their period, of occupation, and the duration of their leases. I told them that I was preparinga policy for dealing with the pastoral lands of the Territory that might possibly result in taxing them or in resumption. I did not wish them to be under any misapprehension as to compensation. The outlines of my policy in regard to the Territory were published and in the hands of honourable members before the contract was signed. There is no obligaon us in regard to any subdivision or any pastoral policy we may pursue. I do not know that any other matter the member has mentioned in connection with this agreement is worth disThe agreement is a very successful one. To bring it about was the Minister's duty. We have not attempted boast about it ; but it will stand closest scrutiny. The members of the Meat Trust can be found from inforin the possession of the Department of External Affairs. They do not comprise Vestey Brothers. But if Vestey Brothers abuse their position we have power of dealing with them. I to told them that we had behind all these matters the power of an Act of Parliament or Ordinance to see that their posifive years. tion was not abused.",49

Sydney sunk Emden's collier as flooded prior capture. There has also been an appreciative, sympathetic, and patriotic resolution passed by the Legislature of Queensland, to which we shall suitably reply.",50
457,Mr CARR,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Macquarie) [8.57] - I regret that the practice followed on the hustings of each side attempting to take credit for the establishment of our defence system has been continued in this chamber. To me it is immaterial who started the great forces upon which we are relying. There are large bodies of both parties who were keen on Australian defence, and there are others who have been adverse to any effective defence steps being taken. I wish to add the weight of my opinion in the matter of providing pensions for those who, as a result of going to the front, may leave behind them children and others dependent upon them. There should not be the slightest hesitation, on the part of the Government to make adequate provision for possible widows and orphans, the result of the great war in which we are engaged. I also think that it would be wise for the Government to take a hand in controlling the huge Patriotic Funds that are being accumulated. There have been many rumours about questionable control of similar funds that have existed in the past. I do not say that there is any danger of that now, while every one is keenly patriotic and careful to see that the right thing is done, but as time goes on, possibly when the war is over, this enthusiasm may wane, and there will not be so much care exercised. A trust should be appointed to take charge of these funds, and see that they are suitably applied in the direction of. making adequate provision in the shape of pensions to those who are wounded and those who have dependent survivors. I wish to refer to the attitude of the Government in regard to dry canteens. I am well aware that adverse comment on the action taken renders one open to the imputation from many eminently respectable citizens and many good people of lacking moral fibre and a sense of decency in combating the assumption that everything tending to total abstinence should be encouraged. However, I do combat the said assumption, not because I have any less respect for the sober man or less contempt for the drunken man than has the honourable member for Brisbane. It seems to me that the honourable member is eaten up with a commendable zeal, and a zeal without which, no doubt, very much good work in this world could not be accomplished. At the same time, I think that if it were not for the wisdom of wiser people in many cases the efforts of the good would not result in anything like that which is desired by even themselves. I fear that the efforts of the honourable member and his friends will bring about their own reprisals. Added to the general desire that people shall reform, there is also the sub-conscious tendency toCompound for sins they are inclined to, By damning those they have no mind to. I do not suggest that the honourable member for Brisbane has any sins that he would like to condone, but there can be no doubt that this, after all, is a human tendency. I fear a reaction will follow the efforts to suppress all traffic in drink, whether inside or outside our canteens. The trouble is that men who are probably in the habit of taking a little drink when away from the camp, and "" off the leash,"" so to speak, may indulge too freely, chiefly because they have had no drink for some time. That is one of the reactionary effects which I foresee in regard to dry canteens. Prohibition in other quarters has not had all the good results that our honourable friend would have us believe. According to the statistics, the importation of stimulants into New Zealand during the prohibition period is larger than it was before. That is not necessarily conclusive proof that more strong drink is being consumed than was the case before, but it certainly conveys such a suggestion. We cannot lose sight of the fact that prohibition means driving tradeunderground; it means illicit traffic. No one will say that if the rank and file are denied their beer, those who are in a position to acquire it by some means will do without it. In such circumstances, those who were supposed to uphold the law would not always do so, and even if the law prohibited the traffic altogether, I think that strong drink would still be acquired by some. military canteens are under official control; they are supervised by officers who spend their lives in keeping others up tc the mark, whose one function it is to inculcate discipline and to secure the strict observance of rules and regulations. If , in such circumstances, the drink traffic in our camps cannot be administered satisfactorily, one must feel inclined to abandon all hope. I am quite satisfied, however, that we are more likely to secure effective control over our men inside our canteens than in public houses. I would, therefore, much prefer to know that our soldiers were obtaining what drink they required under properly regulated conditions instead of in a haphazard, illicit way, and getting questionable brands as well as undue quantities. Many of these men are probably going ""to lay down their lives for tlieir country. Many of them have been in the habit of taking some alcoholic refreshment, and, for the most part, they are moderate drinkers. If their supply is to be absolutely cut off, we shall have a great deal of dissatisfaction and discontent which we would do well not to engender. There are many practical considerations in favour of the canteen in camp rather than having our soldiers supplied by irresponsible persons outside, or obtaining illicit supplies within the camp itself. There are very substantial reasons for permitting the old system to obtain, and for refusing to adhere to the lines laid down by the honourable member for Brisbane.  hearing the many speeches to which we have listened to-night regarding the authorship of the Australian Navy, I feel constrained to say that I am interested, not so much in the question of who is entitled to claim credit for the initiation of the Navy as in that of the proper upkeep of the Navy as we have it today. An examination of our responsibilities in this respect has led me into several interesting investigations, and a large field for careful study, more particularly in regard to the food supplies of the men whom we are sending to the front, is opened up. From the reply that I received to a question which I addressed to the Prime Minister today with regard to the proposal to borrow money to be handed over to the States, I am inclined to the opinion that the right The honourable gentleman regarded my inquiry as a rather hostile one. I am sorry that he is not in the chamber just now, for I desired to assure him that in putting the question I had absolutely no hostile intent. Having looked carefully into the position, I find one or two remarkable situations arising from the present unfortunate drought troubles of Australia, and I believe that if the Prime Minister had been perfectly acquainted with the actual position he would not have regarded my suggestion from a hostile point of view. I am assuming, first of all, for the sake of argument, that we shall have to work up to the ultimate number of men that many people in Australia expect us to put into the field in the defence of ourselves and the Empire, and that is no fewer than 100,000. The question naturally arises, ""How are they to be fed?"" Whilst we may be very anxious to know what their equipment is to be, it is idle to talk about their clothing, and so forth, if we do not give them the necessary material wherewith to maintain body and soul. A most important factor in dealing with a number of men at the front is to see that their food supplies are kept well up to them. I find that if we do ultimately place 100,000 men in the field, we shall have to provide, in respect of their bread alone, no less than 1,666 bushels of wheat per day. I search in vain for any part of Australia that is likely, in the near future, to be able to supply that demand. I am under an obligation to Mr Knibbs, the Commonwealth Statistician, who has given me some of the latest figures in his keeping with respect to this question. We are in a rather precarious position in the Commonwealth owing, not to war, but to something that is really more dreadful to us here, and that is the drought over which, unfortunately, we have no control. We read in many of the newspapers that New South Wales hopes this year to have a wheat yield of 20,000,000 bushels, but, as a practical man, I have no hesitation in saying that the Commonwealth will be well served if we have sufficient wheat grown this year to supply us with the seed we require and with the bread that is necessary for the people within our own borders.",50
458,Mr SAMPSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"We shall be very fortunate if we have.  tenance of our own men at the front is something that we all have at heart, and according to the figures in my possession for that purpose alone we shall have to provide no less than 1,666 bushels of wheat per day, which means 608,090 bushels per year.",52
459,Mr MATHEWS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Whether they go to the war or not they must still be supplied with bread.  one or two other considerations of much importance that I wish to bring before the Committee. I practically concentrated the whole of my desires in this respect in the question that I addressed today to the Prime Minister. I asked the right honourable gentleman if it was proposed to impose any conditions regarding the use of the money borrowed for the States-whethe r the primary producers throughout Australia might expect to receive some slight benefit from the amount of money that would then be let loose. The reply I received was that, if the money loaned to the States were devoted to a public works policy, other financial activities would probably be left open for the particular class of producers I desired to see assisted. You, Mr. Chanter, know, as well as I do, that a large number of our primary producers in New South Wales will require substantial financial assistance before they will see their way clear to go on with ducing operations during 1915.",52
460,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"They will be able to obtain that assistance from the honourable member's friends-the private banks.  not lend money on a certain tenure which the honourable member and his brother Labour men in several States have brought into existence, and which is commonly known as the leasehold system.  be obtained in Queensland on leasehold securities.  pleased to hear it ; but that statement, I am sorry to say, does not apply to New South Wales.",52
461,Mr SHARPE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Then , why is the honourable member always supporting the private banks?  vate banks is not available for the class' for whom I desire to secure assistance. While I admit that there are difficulties in the way, I was pleased to hear the ex-Treasurer draw the attention of the Prime Minister to one method by which, in his opinion, the States might be induced to take into consideration this very matter. The Commonwealth, I think, might impose a condition that a certain amount of the money loaned to the States should be used to assist those engaged in the production of our food stuffs, who need financial assistance.  from the honourable member! ",52
462,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"After the electioneering speeches in which the cry of the Liberals was "" Leave us alone.""   anything unreasonable. I am simply urging that this borrowed money should be spread as far as possible over every industry, and should not necessarily be limited to one particular class of activities.",52
463,Mr WEBSTER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The honourable member requires the Commonwealth to take a risk that the private banks will not take.  for anything unreasonable. I merely urge that if the Commonwealth is prepared to borrow this money from the Imperial Government, or from some other source, we should impose some condiprotions insisting upon some assistance being given to necessitous farmers. I should like to know, in the first place, whether the Imperial Government, if they are lending this money, are prepared to advance it for public works only. Of course I have only the press reports to rely on, but it is said that the States intend to use the money for this purpose, as, for instance, in New South Wales, where it is to be devoted to the construction of railways and activities of that sort. But what is the good of building a railway line if , when it is built, there is no produce to carry? For the last few years a large number of men in the country have experienced a series of droughts, which culminated in that of the present year, the most disastrous, perhaps, in the history of Australia.  hear that it has heen "" the worse of a l  able member, from his experience, must know that I am not exaggerating the position. If this year there is only sufficient wheat to provide our own bread and seed, what will be the position next year if a large number of our producers are in such financial straits that they cannot carry on operations? It is all very well for a paternal State Government to talk about supplying seed wheat and superphosphates; but where is the benefit of that if these farmers have not the wherewithal to enable them to carry on for the five or six months before the crop is harvested ?",52
464,Mr WEBSTER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"What does the honourable member suggest the State Government should do?  rowing for developmental purposes, a certain portion of the money should be allotted to the reasonable assistance of those producing activities which otherwise must cease.",53
465,Mr WEBSTER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"What activities?  I am alluding particularly to men who have been on the land not longer than two or three years, and of whom there are large numbers in New South Wales.",53
466,Mr LAIRD SMITH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Coul d the Government not meet the case by giving them a fair price for their product?  a fair price if they have no produce to sell? I should say that, if we have enough seed and flour for the whole of the Commonwealth, we shall do very well indeed with our present crop. But what about next year? I am very sorry indeed to have to make observations of this kind in regard to my brother farmers, hut I know the conditions under which they are suffering, and I have intense sympathy with them. Honourable members opposite, who are always prating so much about their humanitarian attitude   ""prating "" because of the hostile interjections that I have experienced. started out to deal with the subject from the point of view of the food supply for the Navy and Expeditionary Forces. The state of affairs at the other side of the world requires that we should do l "" ! everything possible to safeguard the food supply of our kith and kin here and in all parts of the Empire.",53
467,Mr SHARPE,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"What about the companies that are continually raising the prices of foodstuffs ?  from that point of view, and I regard that as a hostile interjection. According to the latest statistics supplied by Mr. Knibbs, Great Britain and Ireland require 276,000,000 bushels of wheat per year, and hitherto the supply has come from British East India, the United States of America, Canada, Argentine, Russia, Australia, Roumania, Chili, New Zealand, and quite a number of other places, some of which, owing to the war, are now "" out of action."" In 1913 Great Britain imported 35,000,000 bushels from the British East Indies, 63,000,000 bushels from the United States, 40,000,000 bushels from Canada, 27,000,000 bushels from Argentine, and 18,000,000 bushels from Australia- a total of 183,000,000. Great Britain and Ireland supplied 56,000,000, bringing the figure up to 239,000,000, and leaving a deficit of 35,000,000 bushels of wheat. This deficit last year was made up by imported flour and wheat from other countries which today are at war, and next year will themselves need all the wheat that is raised, and then, probably, they will have a very small loaf. We Cannot hope next year to see the Empire supplied as it was in 1913, if for no other reason than that, to begin with, there will not be the 18,000,000 from Australia. Under the circumstances we should, to the best of our power and ability, safeguard those industries which supply the br^ad of the British Dominions; and to that end I submit that we ought to assist those producers in Australia who, owing to circumstances over which they have no control, now find themselves in dire necessity. If the producing industries are kept going, then all the dependent industries would continue normal; but some honourable members opposite, losing sight of the true position, propose that we should limit the assistance I to the wrong end of the line, namely, the public works of the States.",53
468,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Perth) [9.28] - I was prevented a little while ago by the time l i m it from completing my remarks; and T should not have risen again had it not been for an argument that was attempted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. That honourable member mentioned a Melbourne newspaper of somewhat Conservative tendency, and insisted on identif y i ng honourable members on thSs side with the attitude of that newspaper on the question of the creation of a Naval U n it for Australia. I wish to give him a Roland for his Oliver. If the honourable member chooses to identify members on this side with particular newspapers, he cannot take exception if I identify a certain section of the Labour party with opinions expressed on this matter by the leading Labour organ, the Worker. I readily admit that what I am about to quote did not, even at that time, represent the opinions of any considerable number of Labour members, in this House, and I am sure that it does not represent the opinions any of them at the present time. I read the quotation, however, as an indication that when the question of an Australian U n it was being discussed an influential section of the Labour movement, outside the House to a large extent, took anything but the national view that an Australian Navy was essential to the Commonwealth. When this particular matter was becoming a very live question, the Sydney Worker, on' the 13th February. 1909, published an article from which I propose to read one or two extracts. It indicated that the question was one which must be considered free from the "" cant of patriotism."" Only a short time ago we had a section of the people-mostl y on the Labour side-whic h sneered at the idea of patriotism. If the war has done nothing else, it has brought back to the peopleof this part of the Empire the idea of patriotism.",54
469,Mr JENSEN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The honourable member is dealing with matters which might well be left alone at this juncture.,54
470,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"So long as the Minister and his friends are allowed to claim that they alone are entitled to all the credit for the creation of the Australian Navy, everything is right and proper, but they consider it wrong to mention that there is another point of view. It is quite right for an honourable member on the Government side to identify honourable members of the Opposition with certain opinions expressed by a Conservative newspaper, but quite wrong for me to quote opinions expressed by the principal Labour organ in Australia. When an attempt is made to place me in a false position, I am not going to remain silent. The Worker article statedTo half the British population, then, there would be nothing to lose. There might be something to gain by the setting up of a German Government to match the German dynasty on the throne. The writer sneers at the idea of an Australian NavyAustralia is going to have a Navy, only, it is true, a little bit of a thing that Australia will be able to carry about in its lunch bag, and amuse itself with floating in a basin, but the beginning of a Navy, nevertheless.",54
471,Mr JENSEN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,At the Brisbane Conference in 1908 the establishment of an Australian-owned and controlled Navy was made a plank of the Labour platform.,54
472,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It was made a plank of of the Labour platform when it became a vital part of the policy of the Empire. I am willing to give honourable members opposite their proper share of the credit for the defence preparations of Australia, but I protest against the claim that they have repeatedly made during the last few weeks, and which I have read in the newspapers, that they are entitled to all the credit for the establishment of the Australian Navy. The article in the Worker continues The Federal Government has decided to spend £250,000 in the inauguration of this novel project, and two destroyers are to be ordered forthwith, to protect the coast and commerce of Australia, and strike terror into that little brown beast, Japan, to say nothing of incidentally acting as a warning to Kaiser Bill to be very careful and mind what he is about in the future. The heart of Fat is rejoiced. He has wanted a Navy all along. old The Worker gave the credit for the Navy to the "" f at man "" He is always in favour of spending the national wealth in the protection of his wealth. Not, however, that he is wolfish in the matter. He is anxious to preserve the homes of the people from foreign foes. What a dreadful thing it would be if the Japs or the Germans came over here and invaded the sanctity of our slums. . . . To the Worker, on the contrary, the whole business seems at once so pitiful and so absurd that it knows not whether jeers or tears are more expressive of its feeling on the subject.",54
473,Mr JENSEN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Is not the honourable member now going into party questions?,54
474,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"When honourable members attempt to put the facts in their true light, they are accused of going into party questions. But for members of the Labour party to claim all credit for the creation of the Australian Navy is not to go into party questions.",55
475,Mr JENSEN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The Labour party was the first to put the creation of an Australian Navy on its political platform, and it brought its policy into operation pretty quickly when it got into power.",55
476,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"No doubt the Labour party recognised the need for an Australian Squadron; but while it was doing so Mr Deakin initiated the scheme. All I desire is that credit shall be given where credit is due. Neither party is entitled to all the credit in this connection. If the war has done nothing else than to revive a solid patriotic feeling throughout Australia, it has been not altogether an evil. It is not many years since it was common thing in many quarters here to sneer and jeer at anything and everythink English.",55

478,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I never belonged to the Peace Society. It is not very long since it was the correct thing in some quarters to incite in the minds of Australians hostility and contempt foT England and the English. Those who did so are now only too glad to read of the English Johnny shedding his blood to protect them. They have come into line with those old-fashioned folk who believe in national patriotism, and who are convinced that the race has the pluck to fight to a triumphant finish in this war.",55
479,Mr SAMPSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Wimmera) [9.38] - I compliment the Prime Minister on the adoption as part of his policy of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States for the settlement of the Murray Waters question, which has agitated the minds of the people of Australia for the past forty years. But I regret exceedingly that the right honourable gentleman has declared that we must wait until the State Parliaments have ratified the agreement entered into by the State Premiers before we can deal with it . It has been our boast that we are prepared, as the Parliament of Australia, to pass the legislation needed in the interests of Australia. Why in this case should we wait for the lead of the Parliaments of the States? It will be clearly a dereliction of our duty if we do not at the earliest moment discharge our responsibilities under the agreement. Since Federation was established fourteen years ago, this is the first real opportunity that the Parliament has had to approve of a scheme of a purely developmental character for the benefit of every section of the community.",55

481,Mr SAMPSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It is our duty to pass the legislation we are pledged to pass. Australia is now faced with the most disastrous drought in its history. Those who are acquainted with the irrigation works already carried out along the Murray know that the lives of thousands of sheep have been saved by the a irrigation of lucerne paddocks. By ratifying the agreement with the States we set an example to tfie State Parliaments, and produce a moral influence which should compel them to do their duty in this matter. The Commonwealth has undertaken to provide £1,000,000 for the construction of locks and other important works on the Murray, and the States are to co-operate. It is impossible to determine exactly the benefits which will result from the carrying out of the enterprise. We know that already some 300,000 acres are under irrigation in the three States which are parties to the agreement, and that when effect has been given to the agreement, some 1,500,000 acres more. will be available for intense cultivation.",55

In New South Wales' large areas of land have been repurchased for closer settlement in connection with the Burrinjuck scheme. At Mildura 12,000 acres of irrigated land give a return which averages £30 per acre per annum. On that basis, 1,500,000 acres of irrigated land would yield annually £45,000,000. On a dairying basis, allowing a cow to every acre put under lucerne, and a return of £10 per annum from each cow, the gross return would be £15,000,000.

The distribution of this wealth of water should be handed over to a National body which is without State prejudices.

If this agreement is carried, we shall have this work authorized, which will mean an expenditure of £4,500,000, and I do not know of any more fruitfu l source of employment that could be undertaken in the Commonwealth than the ratification of the Murray Waters Agreement. That expenditure is only the first immediate benefit; following that, we have the enormous possibilities of settlement, irrigation, and intense cultivation along the river bank.",57

493,Mr SAMPSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"If the honourable member cannot see that this is a national question I am sorry for him in his lack of vision. I can only express once more my regret that this one question that has given the Federal Parliament an opportunity to help the producers, find plenty of employment, enormously increase our wealth, and perform a great national duty, has been handed over to the States, while we, as a National Parliament, are waiting on the doings of the State Parliaments.  [9.55] - I am not going to detain the Committee very long, nor would I have risen at all but for the statements of the honourable member for Wimmera and the honourable member who preceded him. I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera that this question of the Murray waters is one that should concern the whole of Australia. If .the question of water conservation and irrigation is not a national one, it is hard to find a question that is. I would suggest to the honourable member for Maranoa that this question concerns Queensland as well as any other part of Australia. The agreement to which reference has been made was framed by the party opposite when they were in office, and I would remind the honourable member for Wimmera that it was in his power last year to have compelled the Government he was supporting to give statutory effect to the agreement. That party had a majority of one, and it was in the hands of any one gentleman sitting in support of lue Government to nave compelled them to take action in connection with the agreement.",57

But any honourable member supporting the Leader of the Opposition when he was in power could have compelled the sending of the agreement to the Senate very speedily, and we do not know what fate it would have met with there. I quite agree with all the honourable member for Wimmera has said with regard to the urgency of this question, whilst, at the same, time, condemning him for not having done a little more to further the ratification of the agreement when he had the opportunity. Mr SAMPSON.'-The honourable member ought to know that the agreement was only signed last September, on the eve of the elections, and it was impossible to do anything with it until it was signed.  was the signing of it deferred so long? Because the Government had moTe important business to transact, such as the abolition of preference to unionists?",57
495,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I will tell you why it was detained so long. We could not get the agreement back from a Stiite Attorney-General.,57
496,The CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Order ! These conversations must cease.  agree that this question is of importance to the whole of Australia. Any one who has seen what has been done at Mildura must be forced to the conclusion that we can have a great many more Milduras if effect is given to this agreement. I think the honourable member for Wimmera missage represented the Leader of the ment when he said that the Prime Minister is practically going to do nothing but wait for the State Parliaments to pass their Acts. The honourable member must of have misunderstood the Prime Minister, whose statement was that, whilst the Government were willing to do a!! sibly could, they must wait for the Act to be passed by the State Parliaments. That was an invitation to the State Parports the other side. liaments to do their duty in this regard. I well remember that when the present party were in power before, and tried get greater powers for the Commonwealth, the honourable member for Wimmera was and a strong advocate for State rights.

That I did use those words in the Town H all in Sydney is perfectly true, but those words were not all that I said. Not only did I advocate during all those times the immediate offer of a Dreadnought to be placed where the Imperial Government should see fit to use it , so that it might add to the effective defensive strength of the Empire, and the immediate increase of our obligation in the shape of a subsidy, which was then the only machinery in existence whereby we could offer assistance of any kind, but I also went on to say-and this is the part that honourable members all leave out- "" that it was time we began to build an Australian N a v y .

510,Mr FOWLER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I did not deny it ; I gave to the party credit over and over again for the part it took.,59
511,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Honourable members have circulated these half truths all over the country, until I believe the. bulk of them believe them to be true. That the Labour party took up the cry of an Australian Navy is quite true, but they did so long after Mr . Deakin had advocated it in the House.",59

519,The CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Order ! The honourable member must address the chair.,60
520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I merely wish to clear up this matter of the Navy.,60
521,Mr HUGHES,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I am waiting fco hear this clearing up.,60
522,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I am glad you are. You are one of the worse sinners. You have written and spoken more of these half truths than any man on your side. You actually leave out all the facts when you deal with the subject.,60
523,Mr HUGHES,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I am waiting to hear your facts.,60
524,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,The facts are not mine. They are in the report of the Imperial Conference.,60
525,Mr HUGHES,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,If they are not yours I shall look at them.,60
526,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Then if you do it will be bad for your rhetoric. The facts are these: Mr Deakin first propagated his idea of an Australian Navy, but he fell into the mistake-it was an honest mistake-of advocating a flotilla of small boats for the purpose of purely Australian defence, boats which could not move out to be active co-operators with the Imperial Navy, or could not move to any part of the waters outside our own immediate neighbourhood.",60
527,Mr BURNS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"You said that they could not get out of the rivers. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I said nothing of the sort; that is just another of those lies you circulate all over the place. They are lies, straight-out lies, and honourable members keen repeating themthey become their stock-in-trade. I said then as I say now, that so far as the use of these boats in the coastal defence of Australia are concerned, they were a delusion, a sham, and a fraud . Is that plain enough? Not only did I say that, but let honourable members listen to what the Imperial authorities said about the Navy at the Imperial ConferenceIn the opinion of the Admiralty, a Dominion Government desirous of creating a Navy should aim at forming a distinct Fleet unit; and the smallest unit is one which, while manageable in time of peace, is capable of being used in its component parts in time of war. Under certain conditions, the establishment of local defence flotillas, consisting of torpedo craft and submarines That referred to the Prime Minister's proposals at Gympiemight be of assistance in time of war to the operations of the Fleet, but such flotillas cannot co-operate on the high seas in the wider duties of protection of trade and preventing attacks from hostile cruisers and squadrons. The operations of destroyers and torpedo boats are necessarily limited to the waters near the coast, or to a radius of action not far distant from a base, while there are great difficulties in manning such a force and keeping it always thoroughly efficient. A scheme limited to torpedo craft would not, in itself, moreover, be a good means of gradually developing a self-contained fleet capable of both offence and defence. Unless a naval force-whateve r its size-complie s with this condition, it can never take its proper place in the organization of an Imperial Navy distributed strategically over the whole area of British interests. That is not my statement, but the statement of the Imperial authorities, regarding the tiny cockle-shell fleet proposed by the right honourable member. They knocked it right out of the water. Further down they said that the honourable member's proposal showed a complete misconception of proper naval strategy, as applied to Australia or any other part of the Empire. That is the Fleet the honourable member proposed to bring into being. I condemned those proposals, and those only. I did not condemn a properly-organized U n it for the defence of Australia. I always advocated it .",60
528,Mr WEBSTER,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,You advocated something else.,60

However, I am not criticizing the Prime Minister, but am merely explaining the facts. As to the other statements by honourable members opposite, fortunately the facts are on record. Our Navy is in existence. It is nobody's special navy. Why, therefore, cannot we give each other a little credit for having called that Navy into existence? Why are these party aspects dragged in every time the matter comes up for discussion, despite the statements of the Prime Minister outside ? If we are going to legislate on non-party lines, let us adhere strictly to those lines. There ought to be no party lines connected with this war, or with the preparations that have to be made to see it through.

570,Mr MCGRATH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Quite so, but the output is not half as large as it ought to is rapidly be. The Constitution prevents the De-. partment undertaking any trading conBencern, but here we have an 'opportunity to the develop one of the - natural resources of conAustralia. By doing so, we should give he did not employment to hundreds of our own of all, people, and also satisfy one of the «3> the quiremetnts of the Commonwealth. There to show should be no necessity to import many said, other articles manufactured from clay, and now used largely in Australia. I not go have been shown a sample of kaolin from the the Snake Valley district, which experts with say is equal to anything of the kind to he found in Austria or Germany, but this deposit is also untouched.",63
571,Mr BURNS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,We were exporting it to Austria.,64
572,Mr MCGRATH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"The young man who brought the sample to Parliament House informed me that something like 100 tons of this kaolin' was sent to Austria, where it was manufactured into the finest china. I trust that the Postmaster-General will adopt my suggestion, and. inquire into the possibility of developing the vast and profitable deposits of clay which we have in Australia. I wish now to refer to the payments we are making to the troops we are sending abroad. I agree that the Bill to provide for pensions should beintroduced as soon as possible, so that we may know what provision the Government propose to make for those who may lose their breadwinners on the battle-field. But there is a duty still nearer home, and it relates to the wives and children of those who have gone abroad. I understand that the soldiers receive 5s. per day.",64
573,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"Fiv e shillings,, and also Is. per day deferred pay. Mr MCGRATH. - The deferred pay of Is. per day is of no use to the men now. I was interviewed today by the wife of a soldier who has gone to the front, and was told that she had six children. She said that she was receiving 4s. 6d. per day. That was the provision which her husband had made for her support; ""and if he is receiving only 5s. per day I think he has done his best for her. She has rent to pay, and how can she hope to maintain her six children decently on such an allowance? I am informed that one officer is receiving £1,500 a year, an allowance of 15B. per day. I do not know what the allowance is for, seeing that, while an board ship, all his wants will be supplied. His allowance is three times greater than the pay received by the men in the ranks. If we want to induce 100,000 men to volunteer, we must see that adequate provision is made for' those whom they leave behind.",64
574,Mr FINLAYSON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Me n with large families ought not to be sent.,64
575,Mr MCGRATH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"We cannot deal with that question now. Many men so situated were loth to leave their wives and children; but, realizing the danger of the Empire, they thought it their doty to volunteer, and the least we can do is to [21]- 2 see that their wives and little ones are not allowed to want.",64
576,Mr RILEY,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"What is being done with, the large funds that have been raised t",64
577,Mr MCGRATH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"We do not desirethese people to depend on charity. We have vast resources, and we ought to see that the wives and children of ou*soldiers are provided for.",64
578,Mr BURNS,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I am told that no allowance will be made out of the Victoriac patriotic fund for such a purpose.,64
579,Mr MCGRATH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I do not care so much about that. My contention is tiiat we should make adequate provision for the wives and children of those who have gone to the front, and I trust that the Assistant Minister of Defence will ascertain whether an increased payment cannot be made. There is only one other matter to which I shall refer, and it relates to the positions vacated by officers who have volunteered to go to the front. I was promised by the Minister that non-. commissioned officers would have an opportunity to apply for these commissions, and certain regulations were cancelled to afford them that opportunity. In the latest district orders issued to the Military Forces, however-Distric t Order No. 54-w e have this statementApplications are invited from the militia officers on theactive, unattached, reserve,, and retired lists, for appointment as brigade-major (temporarily) 18th Infantry Brigade, and Brigade Area, 3rd Military District, to reach District Head-quarters not later than 1st November, 1014. Under this order, sergeant-majors and! other non-commissioned officers are debarred from applying for higher .positions in the Force than they now occupy. I consider that that is most unfair. Thereand are no better men connected with our Forces. There was a regulation in force giving priority in jegard to appointments to quite a number of people, such, as retired Imperial soldiers and reservists, and, to a certain extent, disqualifying non-commissioned officers of our Forces from applying for promotion. I brought this under the notice of the.. Minister of Defence, and he immediatelyordered that those regulations should be cancelled. They were cancelled, and I was informed that non-commissioned officers could apply for higher positions than they at present hold. But later on, the district order, which I have read, was issued, under which non-commissioned officers' are included amongst those. who are not eligible to apply for higher positions.",64
580,Mr FENTON,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,I am told that we cannot remedy that without an alteration of the Act.,65
581,Mr MCGRATH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"I believe that it can be remedied without altering - the Act. Senator Pearce, in his letter to me intimating the cancellation of previous regulations, gave mo clearly to understand that there is nothing in the Act to prevent non-commissioned officers from applying for promotion.",65
582,Mr RILEY,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,Who signed the order last issued f,65
583,Mr MCGRATH,AMENDMENT S INCORPORATION,"It is signed "" J. C. Hawker, Colonel."" I know that some of these people have no time for non-commissioned officers. We are accustomed to say that amongst our citizen soldiers a man may rise from the ranks to be a general; but there is nearly as much ' class distinction in our Australian A r m y today as there is in the Imperial Army. I ask the Minister representing the M i nister of Defence to take a note of the order to which I have referred, and to see that non-commissioned officers are made eligible for appointment to higher positions.
