I do not know how far the powers of the Commonwealth extend in the direction of enabling us to require the Railway Commissioners to carry special mails by the goods trains to which the honourable member refers, but an inquiry into the matter will be instituted at once, and an effort will be made to come to a satisfactory arrangement with the Railways Commissioners.

7,Mr MAHON,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"The answer to the honourable and learned member's question is as follows : The. Deputy-Postmaster-General of Victoria has not been censured by the Postmaster-General, but his action in certain respects has been criticised, and he has been instructed as to the manner in which some of the duties devolving upon him should be carried out. AUSTRALIAN FLAG.",13
8,Mr CROUCH,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS," I move- That, in the opinion of this House, the Australian Flag, as officially selected, should' be flown, upon all forts, vessels, saluting places, and public buildings of the Commonwealth upon all occasions when flags are used. - Mr OMALLEY - The honourable member should include the public schools.",13
9,Sir JOHN QUICK,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,The Commonwealth has no control over the public schools.,13
10,Mr CROUCH,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"No doubt honourable members will be surprised to learn that it was necessary to place a notice of this motion upon the business-paper, and that a resolution of this House must be passed to require to be done by the Government something which it is only right and proper should be done. They are aware that, at the request of the King, designs for a Commonwealth Flag were asked for by the first Commonwealth Administration. Prizes, amounting to ^75, were offered to successful competitors, and designs were invited from the citizens of the Commonwealth and of the ad-, joining Colony of New Zealand. Ultimately, the prize-money was divided among five competitors, who, strangelv enough, all sent in the same design. The designs submitted were then publicly displayed in the Exhibition Buildings at Melbourne. To the opening of this display not only were members of the then first Commonwealth Parliament invited, but invitations were extended to many of the prominent citizens of Melbourne, and additional prestige was given to the event by asking the wife of the Governor General, the Countess of Hopetoun, to formally declare it open. After considerable delay, it was announced in the press and in the Commonwealth Gazette that a design had been chosen, and, after further delay-as I could not understand why, since Ministers had selected a flag, it was not being flown from the public-offices- I asked two questions upon the subject, which were reported in Hansard. The first question was asked on the 21st November, 10,01, and was addressed to the then Prime Minister, now his Honour Mr. Justice Barton. His reply was that the matter was still before the Colonial Office. Then, on the 30th July, 1902, I addressed another question to the honourable member for Ballarat, because the flag had not even then been used; and I was told that its use was still unauthorized. But, because of the attention directed to the matter by. mv questions, a cablegram was sent to the Colonial Office, with the result that shortly afterwards the selected design was gazetted, and a coloured copy of it, together with a full official description, was printed and circulated with the CommonweaWi Gazette. I was then informed, as will be seen by reference to Hansard, that the selection of the design had been made by the Ministry at the request of the Imperial authorities, and that the design accepted and authorized was the official Australian flag. Since then the position has been that the Ministry have had a flag, but haye not known what to do with it. _ Possibly the members of the late Administration were rather sorry that they had anything to do with the matter, because they saw that, if the official Australian flag were used it would have to be flown from the ships of the fleet paid for and controlled by Australia, while the British flag would be flown from the vessels partly paid for by Australia, but entirely under ^ P ^ ^ ; trol. It seems to me that the fact that this distinction will have to be made has kept the Government from insisting upon the flying of the flag from vessels lake the Cerberus, the Victorian gunboats, and other vessels of war owned by the Commonwealth, and it has been rarely flown even from .our public When at anv military function the Military Forces of the Commonwealth are marched past a saluting base to salute the flag of their country, the Australian flag is; always conspicuous by its absence. Whether that is due to the 'fact that the General Officer Commanding is an Imperial officer, and would not stand under the Australian flag, I am not prepared to say.",13
11,Mr WILLIS,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"The Union Jack is there, and is honoured all the same.",14
12,Mr CROUCH,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"That is so; but it should be remembered that the Australian -1 Fla &flag bears the Jack, and there is no idea of separation involved in its use. By the Jack in its corner it symbolises the history of the old country, whilst, in addition, we have the States symbolised by distinctive stars, and the Commonwealth itself symbolised by the larger star underneath them. When we have an Australian flag, it is difficult to understand why it should not be used. I have experienced a good deal of difficulty in my efforts to induce the Department to take any step in regard to this matter. Before I gave notice of the motion I am moving today, I tried to get the Department to take action. I wrote first of all to the then Prime Minister on the 16th April, 1903, calling his attention to the fact that a flag other than the Australian flag was flown at the recent military encampment, and on the ships of the Auxiliary Squadron during the Easter naval manoeuvres, and that the Australian flag was conspicuous by its absence. I received a reply from the Secretary to the Prime Minister, which I shall read to the House, in order to show the position the Government took up in the matter : Dear Sir, I am desired by the Prime Minister to acknowledge your letter of 16th inst., calling his attention to the fact that a flag other than the Australian flag was flown at the recent military encampment, and on the ships of the Australian Auxiliary Squadron during the recent Easter manoeuvres. In reply, I am desired by the Prime Minister to say that his attention has not been previously drawn to the fact mentioned by you, into which he will make early inquiry. With reference to the fact that the Australian flag is not flown on the ships of the Auxiliary Squadron, the Prime Minister desires me to point out that, as these ships still belong to the British Navy, and that only a proportion of the cost of maintenance is borne by the Commonwealth, it is hardly a matter for surprise that the British flag is flown on these ships. I am, & c , T. R. BAVIN Although that letter is dated from Sydney, b^g*- 24th April, 1903, in the Commonwealth Gazette of the day after there is published an order directing that the-Royal Standard is the proper flag to be flown over all the forts of the Commonwealth and over Commonwealth buildings.",14
13,Sir JOHN FORREST,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"That is done throughout the Empire. _ Mr CROUCH - Althoug h the Prime Minister of the day stated in reply to me on the 24th April that the matter to which I directed his attention would be considered, the late Minister of Defence-the right honourable member for Swan-o n the 25th April issued an order in the Commonwealth Gazette directing that the Royal Standard was the only flag to be hoisted over all the forts in Australia-the only flag to be recognised by the Commonwealth Government in forts maintained entirely by yet Australian money.",14
14,Sir JOHN FORREST,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,On certain days?,15
15,Mr CROUCH,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"On any and every day. In consequence of the issue of the order, wrote to the Prime Minister on the 28th April, 1903, as follows: Dear Sir, I am obliged to you for your letter of the 24th inst., promising early inquiry into the nonuse of the Australian flag on Australian forts and ships; and would be glad if you would also direct your attention to a Gazette announcement, 1903/253, where the Right Honourable the Minister of Defence, only the day after the date 'of your letter, the 25th April, issued from the Department of Defence an order from His Excellency the Governor General in Council for the use on sixteen forts therein set out of the Royal Standard and the Union Jack, with full details of their use, and containing the statement that they are to be used in certain cases daily and in other cases on Royal anniversaries and State occasions, the official Australian flag not even being mentioned. As it is possible that the Defence authorities consider the Australian flag a kind of inferior ensign, to be used only upon occasions when it suits the official mood, you will doubtless take into consideration this Gazette notice when dealing with the whole question. No reply was received to that letter, and I wrote again, and on the 18th September, I 9°3, I was informed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister that the whole matter had been referred to the Defence Department. I knew what that meant. The matter is still before the Defence Department, and remains there in what may be considered a proper grave for the interment ' of all questions which another Department finds it inconvenient to answer, unless this House is induced to pass some such motion as that which I submit today. Seeing that a new Ministry had come into power, I wrote on the 20th of January, 1904, to the then Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, in these terms :. Dear Sir, I wrote your Department on the 24th April last, drawing your attention to the fact that the selected Australian flag now officially approved in London, was rarely, and on many occasions never, flown from the Commonwealth public buildings and ships; and, further, in a letter dated 28th April, 1903, called your attention to the Commonwealth Gazette' 1003/253, in which the use of that flag on the Australian defences was completely ignored. On the 18th September last I was informed that you were obtaining a report from the Defence Department on the matter, and were giving the whole subject careful consideration. I would be obliged if you will inform me if any decisions which we can make public have been arrived at by you; and when we can expect the Australian flag to be used in the Commonwealth by the Commonwealth authorities. Again I was promised further consideration. I The Secretary to the Prime Minister writing me as follows on '26th January, 1904 :I have the honour, by direction of the Prime Minister, to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th inst., with further reference to the question of the Australian flag being used in the Commonwealth by the Commonwealth authorities, and to inform you that the matter will receive early attention. It is still receiving early attention, and unless honourable members agree to pass some such motion as I submit, it will be impossible for* the Australian flag ever to be used. It appears to me that it was but a farce to have adopted an Australian flag, unless the Government of the Commonwealth intend to ' use it upon suitable occasions. I must say that the late Government under the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, proposed the use to a certain extent of the Australian flag. In the Navigation Bill which they introduced, and which I understand is now withdrawn, they had inserted a clause by which it was provided that the flag of ships registered in Australia was to be the English ensign, with the southern cross and a large star. That was a proposal to adopt the Australian flag for Australian owned ships, and if it is to be adopted, for use by Australian ships, it is a pity that it should not also be used in connection with public services of the Commonwealth.' If there is one feature connected with American school life, which I think might be very properly adopted in Australia, it is the institution of the National Flag Day, when the children are taught lessons on patriotism, what the flag of their country stands for, and what certain institutions mean. The late Senator Sir Frederick Sargood did his best to introduce that feature in Victoria by presenting flags to all the State schools. It is a pity that when children attending State schools in Australia ask what is the Australian flag, they should have to be told that, although one has been selected, the Minister of Defence is frightened to use it. Perhaps I should not say frightened; but announcement Ministers - have objected to use it, haveignored it, and treated it with contempt,. instead of recognising it as the emblem of the Naval and Military services, and thus conferring upon it the most honourable associations. I trust that the. House will agree to the resolution, and that our flag will be accorded the position to which it is entitled.",15
16,Mr WILLIS,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS," I think that the House is very much indebted to the honourable and learned member for Corio for bringing forward this, question. Judging from the correspondence in which he has been engaged, it has occupied a good deal of his attention. I think I remember some previous reference to the matter in this House. I suppose that one of the reasons why the Australian national flag' has not been flown from our buildings is that a very long time elapsed before the Imperial authorities extended their approval to the design which was adopted by the Commonwealth Government. I think that the Australian flag should be flown upon all Commonwealth buildings, and that we may reasonably ask the Prime Minister to see that in future our flag is accorded the chief place uppn all great occasions. It is only proper that it should also be flown from the ships maintained by the people of Australia. The fact that it has not been so displayed in the past is probablv due to the circumstance that the officers of the Navy feel that there is nothing like the flag under which they have served in the past. They have, however, a duty to perform' to the Commonwealth, and they should discharge their functions under the conditions laid down by the Commonwealth Government. Even though our naval policy may be changed, I think the Prime Minister should take steps to insure that our flag is always accorded a prominent place, and that the youth of Australia are taught to pay it as much respect as h-u hitherto been"" accorded to the Union Jack. We have adopted the Union Jack as part of the design of our national flag, and upon the face of it also appears a representation of the Southern Cross, and 'a six-pointed star, which is intended to indicate the number'of States in the Federation. It seems to me that the officials of Downing-street have been too tardy in their recognition of the national spirit'which Australians have shown in adopting a flag which is intended to be emblematical of the Federal Union, and I trust that, the Government will do their best to correct their errors of omission. I have very much pleasure in supporting the motion, and desire to express my personal indebtedness to the honourable and learned member for Corio for having submitted it. The correspondence which he has quoted shows that he has treated the authorities with every courtesy and respect, that he has thoroughly investigated the matter, and that his proposal is entitled to the fullest consideration.",16
17,Mr FOWL ER,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS," I agree with the previous speakers as to the desirability of having the Australian flag displayed upon our public buildings upon all suitable occasions. Perhaps one reason why we have not seen the flag displayed to the same extent that some of us would have liked, is that its design is not one of which we can feel very proud. Personally, I have looked at the flag time and again, and have felt . almost disgusted, because, unless there is a very strong breeze blowing, the distinctive portion of the design is all but ' invisible; at any rate, its significance is hidden. I do not presume to say wh.it design should have been adopted, but I think that we have been most unfortunate in selecting the commonplace emblem which typifies the Commonwealth in that flag. At-some future time, probably not very far distant, the States will be further subdivided, and I should like to know what will then happen to that particular star^yhjeb*- is intended to represent the number of the States. t7 Mr Wilks - We could make of it a circular saw.",16
18,Mr FOWLER,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"As the honourable member suggests it would become not unlike a circular saw, or a childish representation of the moon. Whilst we may decide that the Commonwealth flag shall be adequately displayed, I think that the Government might very' well consider whether the design should not be submitted to experts, with a view to making it distinctly Australian, and of a design which will lend itself to possible, and, in fact, very probable, developments in the near future. I believe in the principle of the referendum as applied to matters upon which the people are able to form an accurate opinion, but I . do not think that the people themselves desire to take such a matter as this out of the hands of experts. The method adopted by the late Government, in order to secure the adoption of the design, appeared to me to be almost childish. The flag selected, in an almost similar manner, under the auspices of a Melbourne newspaper, is, to my mind, vastly superior to that which has been adopted. It is a matter of common knowledge that a number of prizes were offered by the Government for suitable designs for a national flag, and I shall never forget the feeling, of amusement with which I inspected the work of the competitors. It showed conclusively that in asking the general public to express their ideas upon a subject concerning which they were not competent to form a sound opinion, an entirely wrong course had been adopted. To my mind the most artistic flag of the whole of the Australian States is that of Western Australia. At the same time. I do not urge for one moment that the symbols upon that flag should be given any special prominence in the Commonwealth flag. Next to the Western Australian design, the prettiest ancl the most distinctive flag from a heraldic stand-point is that of New South Wales. The fact that New South Wales is the mother State, and that when her flag was adopted it was practically the flag of Australia, is quite sufficient in my mind to justify the Government in adopting it as the flag of the Commonwealth. In that emblem we have the Southern Cross depicted in the conventional form, which I take it is a better method of representing it than the Victorian method of reproducing it in its accurate astronomical form. sonally I take special exception to the enormous star.which appears in the Commonwealth flag beneath the Union Jack, and which, I have no doubt, causes in the minds of many who see it for the first time a great deal of wonderment regarding the particular portion of the firmament from, which the constellation has been copied.",16
19,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,It is a star of the first magnitude.,17
20,Mr FOWLER,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"Undoubtedly . It is a star of such magnitude that it dwarfs the Southern Cross-whic h in itself is composed of stars of considerable dimensionsto very small proportions indeed, in fact, the whole design of the flag is puerile. I trust that the Government will reconsider this matter, and that, as a result of their Royal Standard? deliberations, we shall secure a flag the de Mr WATSON sign of which will be at once more handsome and more significant from an Australian stand-point, and which will, at the same time, lend itself to possible developments in the future.",17
21,Mr WATSON,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS," I must confess that I have not looked into this matter very carefully, having been busily engaged with other affairs for some little' time past. Consequently, I am not prepared to definitely state the opinion of the Government regarding the whole of the suggestions made by the honourable and learned member for Corio. One difficulty, however, presents itself to my mind, which would prevent the Government from giving effect to his proposal to fly the Commonwealth flag upon all vessels. As it is framed, his motion seems to refer only to vessels of the Commonwealth, but from his speech I gathered that he intended it to apply to vessels of the Australian Auxiliary Squadron.",17
22,Mr CROUCH,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"No , I said that we could not fly the flag upon them.",17
23,Mr WATSON,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"I beg the honourable and learned member's pardon. I was under the impression that he advanced the opposite contention. Personally, I think there is every reason why the Australian flag should be flown upon all Australian-owned vessels. I quite agree with the views which have been urged by the honourable member for Perth regarding the undesirable character of the design of the present flag. It does seem to me that though it includes the Southern Cross it does not adequately symbolize our national life, and that it is not sufficiently indicative of Australian unity. Before we take any steps in Per- the way of displacing upon our forts a flag of which' we are all proud- I refer to the Union Jack-w e should securea design w*hich is more in accord with the views of those who have taken the trouble to carefully examine this question. One thing, however, might be done. I am informed upon a hurried inquiry that so far no instructions have been issued that the Australian flag shall be flown upon all public buildings of the Commonwealth on holiday occasions, or when they are decorated. I think there should be a clear understanding that upon Commonwealth buildings the Australian flag should occupy the preeminent position on such occasions.",17
24,Sir PHILIP FYSH,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"What about the - I confess that I am not learned in these intricacies, but I understand that the Royal Standard is used only upon special occasions, when of course it would take precedence over the Australian flag. Upon all ordinary gala days, however, the Australian flag should be given pre-eminence. A copy of the warrant issued by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty authorizing the flag-adopted as the merchant flag of the Commonwealth-to be flown by vessels registered in the Commonwealth, was gazetted on the 8th August last. Copies of the Gazette notice"" were sent to the Premiers of all the States, to the Departments of Trade and Customs, Defence, and Postmaster-General, on the 17 th August. If no instructions have been issued for the Commonwealth flag to be flown upon all public buildings under Federal control, I will see that they are issued. It is not an an urgent matter, but the Government and Parliament might very well consider the wisdom of substituting a more distinctive-design for a national flag than that which has been adopted. I have no objection to the motion but before effect is given to it, the question of whether we should continue to use the present flag, or adopt another which in our opinion is more appropriate, should receive serious consideration.",17
25,Sir JOHN FORREST,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS," I am inclined to agree with the. Prime Minister that the present flag is not a very striking one. When viewed from a distance, one cannot distinguish the distinctive emblems upon it, and the large star does not 1 look like a star, but looks like a sphere. I think that we ought not to deal with this matter with unnecessary haste. I am unable to say at present what Statutes or Royal Warrants relate to the flying of flags in the Commonwealth"", or whether we have any law on the subject. There may be an Imperial Statute governing the floating of flags over ports and other military and naval establishments.",18
26,Mr WATSON,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,There is a measure relating to the flying of flags on British vessels.,18
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"We all desire that the Australian flag, once selected, shall fly over all Commonwealth buildings; but we should deal cautiously with this proposal.",18
28,Mr FOWLER,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,Is there any danger of the Imperial authorities sending the Prime Minister to gaol in this connection ?,18
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"No ; but I am sure that the honourable gentleman desires that all our proceedings shall be transacted with due regard for order. I would suggest that the motion be not pressed. If its consideration were postponed for two or three weeks, the Prime Minister would have an opportunity to make enquiries that would be of assistance to us on the resumption of the debate.",18
30,Mr CROUCH,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,I wrote on various occasions to the Ministry with which the right honourable member was associated in regard to the question.,18
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"But the matter is now before Parliament, and, therefore, in our own hands. I have no distinct recollection of what was done in reference to it during my term of office as Minister of' Defence. It is plainly necessary that we should ascertain what authority we have for the flying of flags before coming to a decision on this matter.'",18
32,Mr CROUCH,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,We have the authority of our own right.,18
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"The matter is, no doubt, governed by some Statute or Royal Warrant. The Governors of the various States receive instructions as to the flags that are to be flown over public buildings on certain days. On the birthday of the Sovereign, for instance, the Royal Standard is flown,, while in connection with certain other celebrations, the Union Jack, sometimes bearing the badges of the States, is hoisted. We should not deal with the matter until a full inquiry has been made, and I would therefore move That the debate be now adjourned.",18
34,Mr SPEAKER,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"The right honourable member having spoken, cannot submit that motion. ' Debate (on motion by Mr WATKINS) adjourned,. COMMONWEALTH COINAGE..",18
35,Mr GB EDWARDS,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS," I move That, in the opinion of this House, the Attorney-General should intioduce the necessary legislation to give effect to the recommendations contained in the report of a Select Committee on Commonwealth Coinage and Currency, adopted by the House on 19th June, 1903. I rise to again address myself to this important question, with not only a natural inclination, but a sense of public duty and a desire to comply with my election pledges. In returning to the subject it will be necessary for me to go over much of the ground that I traversed when the report of the Committee was last before the House, inasmuch as since then there has been a general election, with the result that we have many new members whose opinions in reference, to this subject are entirely unknown to me. It is my desire that the question should be definitely settled by legislative action,- and I feel constrained to put the case as embodied in the report of the Select Committee as clearly as possible before those who were returned at the last"" elections, and to revive the strong interest which was shown in the question by honourable members of the last Parliament. I may be pardoned for expressing the belief that the question is of far more importance than that which has engaged our attention during the last two weeks. In many respectis that debate has been marked by some of the characteristics of the discussions of the ancient schoolmen on such questions as "" How many angels could dance on the point of a pin?"" and other matters of that kind, to which the old Aristotelians used to devote their spare time. I trust that the consideration which will be given to this subject will bear as much relation to those discussions as does the Baconian philosophy to that of Aristotle. We come now to a question which is to be considered in the light of the philosophy Bacon brought into being-the science which resolves everything from fact, and judges everything, by the fruit it will produce. Whilst we have been engaged during the last week or two in the consideration of a . very serious matter, it seems to me that we have been somewhat discursive, and have certainly failed tb come tb a definite conclusion. I hope that the debate on this motion will be concise, and that as the result of it we shall arrive at a definite decision. When the question was previously under the consideration of the House, the late Treasurer remarked that if a report of a Select Committee was adopted by ths House it was usual to give legislative effect to it, and that the adoption of the Coinage Committee's report would necessarily mean the introduction of a Bill. But such are the exigencies of public life that Ministers very frequently do not give effect to the expressed will of the House in reference to matters of this kind. I ' am supported not only by the manner in which the report was received by the last Parliament, but by what I believe to be a very general belief on the part of the public, that legislative effect should be given to it. Earlier in the session-befor e the present Ministry took office-I . asked the late Prime Minister what despatches or other information bearing on this subject had been received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, or from any other source. I wished to know whether the Government had communicated with the authorities with a view to carry out the various suggestions contained in the report, and whether they had applied for information, as suggested by the Select Committee, in regard to the minting of the coins that would be necessary under the. proposed system, at such places as Birmingham and other cities where they are turned out by the million to the order of various Governments. There may have been some well-grounded Ministerial objection to the production of this information, and the late Prime Minister certainly took up the stand that the time was not ripe for the presentation of the despatches and other information which he admitted had been received. Now we have a new Ministry, and probably in the course of the discussion which may' take place, some member of it may see fit to reveal the nature of these despatches and other communications, and so assist us in coming toa conclusion upon the matter. I have alluded to what I believe to be a definite growth of public opinion in the direction of the adoption of a system of decimal coinage, and certainly in favour of coining our own - silver and bronze, and retaining the immense seigniorage or profit to be made thereby. I have noticed from time to time, by what I have read in the daily press, as well as in special publications such as banking and insurance magazines, that considerable interest is being taken in this question; and although the Committee could not obtain from bankers and others in their representative capacity any endorsement of its views, I find that many bankers individually are strongly in favour of them. They see the immense saving of time that could be effected by the adoption of the decimal system, and know of no reason why this new nation of ours should not have the advantages which are to be obtained by coining its own money. The late Treasurer told the Committee that the difficulty was to get the ordinary working people to take an interest in the subject; but, contrary to that opinion, I find that the working classes take a much keener interest in it, understand its details better, and appreciate the many advantages to be gained from the system much more highly, than do the better educated classes. That they have taken a real practical interest in it is evidenced by the attitude of the many meetings I have addressed, and by the many letters which I have received from working people and bodies representing them. The electoral division which I represent contains probably one of the largest aggregations of working men in the Commonwealth, and there the question has been received with a good deal of interest, and my action in connection with it certainly endorsed. I feel sure that at the late elections I received considerable support cause of what I had done in securing the appointment of the Committee which reported in favour of the adoption of a decimal system of coinage. I should like now to refer very briefly to the Committee's port, because, although the matter has been gone into before, there are now many new members present whom I wish to interest in it. I hope that they will read the document, and thus prepare themselves . to come to a conscientious conclusion on the whole subject. The Committee was one of the most impartial bodies that was ever got together in any Legislature. When I first moved in the matter, the members of this House were, to a very great extent, unknown to each other. I was not then personally acquainted with more than two of - the members of the Committee, and it was with a certain amount of difficulty that I succeeded in getting together the requisite number of men to serve upon it. Those appointed came from'different parts of the Commonwealth, and represented diverse interests ; and any one who goes to the trouble of examining in detail the somewhat voluminous report and minutes of evidence will see every indication of an honest and conscientious discharge by them of a public duty. The members of the Committee came together with no preconceived ideas. Of course, I myself had a most definite opinion of the advantage of the decimal system of coinage, and of the profit to be gained by coining our own silver and bronze; but the members of the Committee as a whole had, I think I can say, no preconceived notions, and there was no general determination to report in favour of or against the decimal system. The Committee sat for a considerable length of time, and took all the evidence it could. I regret that that evidence is not so voluminous as it might have been. It does nor contain the opinions of as many public commercial institutions as I should like to have had ; but that was no fault of the members of the Committee. We went to no end of pains in order to accurately gauge the average opinion of institutions representing various commercial and industrial interests, but with very inadequate results. The difficulty was that most of the representatives of banking and other companies were unable to speak in their representative capacitv. as the matter had not been formally discussed by the members of their corporations. But our report has led to the consideration of this matter by such bodies, Mr O. B. Edwards. be- and there is a growing conviction on the part bf their members in favour of the reform which I am now endeavouring to get honourable members to endorse. The corollary .of this reform, the adoption of a decire- mal system of weights and measures, will introduce itself at every stage of the argument, although we may try to keep it out as not having been included in the reference to the Select Committee. One of the great arguments used against a reform of the coinage is that it has not been proposed to accompany it by a similar reform of our system of weights and measures, many people contending that the two reforms should go together. I shall deal with that question somewhat later. I wish now only to refer to the fact that, in the interval between the adoption of the Committee's report by the last Parliament and today, there has been a great advance in the opinions of the English-speaking world on the subject of the adoption of a decimal system of weights and measures. . Some two years ago the Parliament of New Zealand passed an Act making the metric system compulsory there"" after the year 1907, upon the giving of twelve months' notice by the Administration then in power. The Executive can, at any time after the ist - January, 1907, by giving the requisite notice, make the use of the metric system of weights and measures compulsory throughout New Zealand. It was the regret of many of the members of the New Zealand Parliament, when the measure was under consideration, that that Colony had not done what we here were trying to do, and secured a reform of the coinage in the first instance. Then, at the last Conference of the Premiers of the scattered British possessions which assembled in London under the presidency of the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain, the question of the adoption of a decimal system ofmeasures was brought forward, and it was resolved that it would be desirable for the representa. tive men composing the Conference to consult their States as to the best system to be adopted. The representative of the Commonwealth complied with that resolution, and this Parliament forwarded to the Secretary of State for the Colonies a resolution strongly favouring theadoption by the Empire of a decimal system of weights and measures. The decision of the Conference was followed up by the Colonial Oflice issuing letters to various Governors and representatives of the Crown, advising them to inquire whether the authorities in their States and Colonies would favour the introduction of such a system throughout the Empire. I have had an opportunity of perusing the various replies,. and a great deal of other information which I regret to say I have not at my disposal in Victoria, as I was not aware that the question would come up for consideration today. These replies received from so many British possessions are distinctly in favour of the decimal system of weights and measures, and, although it was not a part of the inquiry, in many instances they express a very strong desire to see it accompanied by a reform in the direction of the decimalization of money. This bears out the contention of the members of the Select Committee, when the matter was previously before the House, that it is inevitable that something will shortly be done by Great Britain and her numerous dependencies towards adopting the decimal system. The decimalization of British money must come, and there is only one way in which it seems to me it can-be decimalized-that is by the method we are asking this Parliament to adopt for the Commonwealth. The Committee having, in an impartial way, taken all the evidence which could be obtained, and having consulted all the authorities to be found in the libraries, and in the archives of the Colonial Governments, came to the conclusion that it was eminently desirable to retain for the Commonwealth all the profit and advantage of coining its own silver and copper coins, and that when this proposal was being put into operation, to reap the considerable advantages to which I shall refer later on, we should make use of the opportunity to adopt the decimal system. The members of the Committee were unanimous in determining that no other system offers such advantages as does the decimal system. As a matter of fact there is no other - system in the world. The other so-called svstems of monev are really not systems at all. They are the growth of accident, - never having been thought out or directly adopted as systems. On the other hand the decimal system never originated anywhere by accident. It is a true system, because it was planned by the human mind, - before it was put into operation - The members of the Committee were convinced, as have been the majority of people everywhere in the world where the subject has been discussed, that the decimal system is not only the best, but the only system. The Committee were then faced by a difficulty as to which of the many possible decimal systems they should report in favour of. We had to consider long, and carefully weigh the merits of the different systems in force today. The subject has been considered by many Conferences of the nations, but they have all been unable, so far, to arrive at what may be called a "" universal "" system of money. Any one who gives the consideration to the question, which I and others have given to it, is compelled to admit that no such thing is necessary. Universal money would not give us a single advantage that I can see, except that of assisting slightly commerce in a large way between nations by saving time in effecting translations of money. But for the operations of 999 people out of 1,000 universal money would be of no advantage over any other system. The decimal system, no matter which is adopted, gives a distinct advantage to everybody who handles money, and that is to everybody who lives. When we came to discuss the different decimal systems we had to consider, the United States system of the dollar, divided into 100 cents; the system adopted by the Latin Union, originating in France, of the franc divided into 100 centimes; and also the decimal systems in operation in Germany and elsewhere. We had further to consider the decimal system that had been proposed in Great Britain. There were probably two or three slightly differing systems proposed in Great Britain, and we were forced to recognise the advantage of the definite millesimal division of the sovereign-that is, its division into 1,000 parts. The Committee, after long consideration, were forced to tha conclusion that, by reason of our connection and trade with the home country, the use of the sovereign in all our transactions, its world-wide celebrity and great credit, and the fact that all our records are being kept in pounds sterling, representing sovereigns, they must report in favour of that system which had been demonstrated to be not only the best, but the only system for Great Britain. We all believe that that system will ultimately be adopted by Great Britain. We therefore reported in favour of keeping as the gold standard and base of the Commonwealth coinage the existing British sovereign divided into ten florins. Under the system proposed the shilling would no longer be recognised by name as a shilling, but would become half-a-florin, and the sixpence wOuld become a quarter-florin. When we left the sixpence, and came at last into the region where we had to make changes, we found that we could not retain, except temporarily, the existing threepenny piece, because it is not a decimal part of any of the preceding coins. We had, therefore, to recommend a smaller coin the tenth of a florin, and another coin, a tenth of that again, which would give us a coin a little less in value than the existing farthing. scheme for. decimalizing British money is one which makes the least change, and creates the least friction. Those who have argued against the proposals of the Committee have said-"" You get rid of the penny; we could never stand that. We believe in the decimal system, and that it is the best system to adopt, but we must not get rid of the penny."" It is submitted that the penny is in such general use that we have penny stamps, penny fares, a penny box of matches, and a thousand other things which can be bought for a penny. But the people who argue so strenuously against getting rid of the penny, and at the same time say that they are strongly in favour of adopting a decimal system, must admit that they cannot get a decimal system without altering some of the coins in use under the present scheme. If we were to retain the penny or the half-penny as the basis of our system, we should have to alter the sovereign for some other coin, and the florin and the shilling could not remain under a decimal system based on .the retention of the penny. So that it will be seen at once that any idea of retaining the penny would involve a much greater alteration than the retention of the sovereign. The sovereign is intimately associated with our history, and in our records and statistics, values are expressed in sovereigns. It is well known that it was owing to the desire to ultimately decimalize the sovereign, that the florin was introduced by the British Government, and a resolution was passed a little later in the British House of Commons requesting the Crown to immediately complete that decimal division, by adopting the very coins which this Committee recommended. I think it will be admitted that the recommendation of the Committee presents, not only the simplest and easiest way of obtaining a decimal system, but also the only possible way that will ever be taken into consideration in the old country. Therefore, in order to keep ourselves in line with the inevitable trend of events in the mother land, it will be best for us to adopt the proposed reform. As I have said, the report was adopted in this House Mr G. B. Edwards. by a majority of only three. That was a small majority having regard to the importance, of the report, but when a matter of this, description is taken up by a private, member, it has a very small chance of securing the consideration which might be given to it if it were made the subject of This a Government measure. It is well known to honourable members who sat in the last Parliament, that when we dealt with private business on Fridays, a number of members left for their homes on Thursday, and consequently private business was always dealt with in a more or-less thin house. Judging, from a personal canvass of the absentees, however, I believe that a much larger majority than was indicated by the result of the division would have been in favour of the proposals of the Committee in a full .House. I think that I may say, without any breach of that respect for private conversation which should prevail, that two,' or probably three, of those honourable members who voted against the report have since admitted to me that they were strongly in favour of the Committee's recommendations, and have expressed the view that I should continue to press for the reform. They did not, however, consider that they were justified in further incommoding the Government, which was already staggering under the large amount of work it had to perform. Most of the objections urged at the time were expressed by the late Treasurer, some of whose arguments answered others advanced by him. For instance, the right honourable member said that there was no advantage in a decimal system, and that no saving would be effected in the education bill of the nation. It will be recollected that the Committee pointed out that we might save considerably upon our education bill by adopting a decimal system. The right honourable member denied this, but towards the close of his speech, as reported in Hansard, page 900, he appealed for time for consideration and discussionin order that the people may be taught that the benefits to be derived from the simplicity of keeping accounts and the lesser schooling required will compensate them for the losses they will have to submit to in the first instance. The right honourable gentleman thus answered one of his own objections to the scheme. .Then, again, after saying that there, was no advantage whatever to be derived from the adoption of the. decimal system, he remarkedLet me say that among all the 'Schemes I have seen I think the American is the best and the simplest. There can be no question as to its simplicity. If any change were; made. I should much prefer the adoption of the United States of America's system to that proposed by the Committee; but we cannot do away with the sovereign. If it is desired to' retain the. sovereign, as recommended by the Committee, it will be impossible to adopt the American system. The right honourable member said, furtherIn the United' SUates they have five, ten, twenty-five, and fifty cent pieces, while, the dollar piece, which has been mentioned, is not very often used. They work out their calculations at so many dollars and so many cents, and the whole system is very simple. It has been well put by some of the witnesses, whose evidence I shall quote for the benefit, of honourable members. What I should like to point out is that all manifest advantages of the system of the United States would be secured by the adoption of the scheme recommended by the Committee, the only difference being in the name. The right honprable member stated that in the United States they had the dollar, which was divided into 100 cents, and that their system was verysimple. If the recommendation of the Committee were adopted, we should have a florin divided into 100 cents. The cent would not be the one-hunrjredth part of a sovereign, but the one-hundredth part of a florin. The idea was that the florin would ultimately become the dollar of the Commonwealth and of the Pacific. There were very good reasons for taking that ground. The right honourable member admitted that the dollar was not carried in America. It is too unwieldly a coin to be carried about, and the only coin really in use in America is the half-dollar piece. The same remarks apply to Canada. half-dollar is the nearest equivalent for the florin, which the Committee are proposing to divide into 100 parts. On the other hand, if we turn to the Latin Union system, we have the franc- a coin rather smaller than our shilling-whic h is used as a standard of value, but which is really too small for that purpose. In the florin we have a happy mean between the too heavy dollar of the United States, and the too small franc of the Latin Union. We should have a coin which could be carried with facility, and one in which we could express values with much more readiness' than if the franc were employed as a standard. All the advantages enjoyed under the United States system would be conferred upon us if the system recommended by the Committee were adopted. <It does not matter what coin is made the standard so long as it is a convenient one for carrying, and can also be used as the leading coin of account. If accounts are to be made up in dollars, that coin should be of such a size that it can be conveniently carried about, and I think that the Committee did well to adopt the florin as the standard coin of the new system. As was pointed out by some critics in the press, the system contemplates the division of the florin, and not of the sovereign, into 100 cents. ""Why should you say that your system is based on the sovereign?"" they ask. It may appear a little inconsistent, but it is plain that the florin is intended to be the central coin of that system. The reason for retaining the sovereign as the standard is to disarm the ridiculous suspicion that, in favouring the coinage of silver, the Committee were endorsing bi-metallism. If we told people that the florin was to be the central coin of the system, they would conclude that we were relinquishing a gold basis, and, consequently, we felt it' absolutely necessary not to depart from a gold standard We have retained the sovereign, but have introduced the florin as the coin of account, well knowing that, though we retain a gold basis, the habits of the people themselves will speedily establish which coin shall be used in expressing values and keeping accounts. Honourable members will recognize that, though the sovereign is the standard of the existing system-o r want of system-value s in excess of £ 1 are frequently expressed in shillings. Do we not often see suits of clothes quoted at 45s - no t at £ 2 5s.; or The at 55s - no t at £ 2 15s.? It is more convenient to the people that values should be expressed in this way. Similarly, we shall find that the public will adopt the florin as the standard coin of the system. We have merely to look to the - United States to discover that. In that country today the dollar is not the basis, of their system-it is the golden tendollar that is the standard. But the coin which really represents the gold system is the half-eagle, or 5-dollar piece, which is somewhat akin to our sovereign - This coin stands as the very basis of the system, yet all accounts and daily transactions are reckoned in dollars and their hundredth parts, which are called ""cents."" I do not think that any objection can be urged to the system proposed, upon the ground that we recommend the use of the cent as expressing the hundredth part of the florin when we adopt destroyed, save a few dies. the gold basis of a sovereign, of which cent is only the one-thousandth part. system is not interfered with if we call farthing a "" m i l . "" I take up the ground that we should make a cent the hundredth part of a florin, and do away with its thoucussion. sandth part, knowing full well that the business people of Australia will adopt florin as those of the United States did "" dollar,"" and the cent as the hundredth alleged failure. part of the florin. The right honourable member for Balaclava also urged that reform should be preceded by the of the metric system of weights and sures. It is very curious that arguments, which are advanced against any particular land in the markets of the world. reform frequently take the shape of a posal for a previous reform. That fact well illustrated in the present instance, cause those who object to the reform of coinage system do so on the ground that repeating rifles of our competitors. they first wish to reform the metric system. I may mention that a Bill, which is intended to deal with the latter system, has recently been introduced into the commerce. House of Lords, and referred to a Select the question of our currency. Committee, which is still investigating question. So far'as I can ascertain, the cipal objection urged against the reform the system of weights and measures is that should be preceded by a reform of the coinnevertheless age system. So it will be t ill the end of her to maintain that supremacy which w 2, the chapter. If our efforts to effect sary reforms are thus to be stayed, we never achieve anvthing. In my judgment, there is not the slightest reason why the troduction of one of these reforms should the nostrums which are advocated. depend upon the accomplishment of the other. Both are excellent in their way. two, the reform of our weights and measures would probably be more far-reaching, ancl incalculable. would exercise the greater effect upon the whole nation. ' For that reason we should of ,£36,000 per annum. first attack the coinage. It will create least disturbance, and will be productive the least friction. The reform of the metric system will involve the loss of millions pounds to the British public. have to get rid of many of our weights, measures, scales, as well as thousands of out Australia. tools, to give effect to such an innovation. At the same time the reform will mean a gain of countless millions of pounds to the nation, thus completely outweighing the loss which would be incurred. On the other hand, the reform of the coinage system involve no loss, but a very substantial gain. In Great Britain itself it would mean appreciable loss. There is nothing to be advantage-a n Mr G. B. Edwards. Nothing would the require to be done beyond the gradual callThe ing in of coins, and re-coining them a under the new system. At this stage I wish to refer to an agitation which has cropped up since this question was previously under disI t has been alleged by some of our British statesmen that Great Britain is f a i lthe ing to maintain her commercial supremacy. the Many measures are advocated to meet this I hold that the reform which I am advocating, and its corollarythis the amendment of our system of weights adoption and measures - will ' do more than meaanything that has as yet been proposed 10 re-establish the supremacy of the mother We proare being beaten in many directions, because is we are fighting with less perfect weaponsbebecause we are engaged in a battle in whicn the we are using bows and arrows against the We can never hope to successfully compete with other nation's whilst we adhere to the present obsolete method of transacting our I propose to deal merely witn Although the the disadvantage uncier which England prinlfibours by reason of that currency is miicj of less than that ^ which is imposed by rhe it present system of weights and measures, it ought to be removed to assist : necesas members of a united Empire are proud shall to share. We can accomplish more in that direction by a reform of the currency system inthan can be achieved by the adoption of all The advantages to be gained from the refonn Of the recommended, not only in competition with foreign countries, but in our own midst, ar.? I claim that the Commonwealth can make a profit out of this system Upon a former the occasion I said-and I repeat it now-that of by its adoption we can secure an advantage of probably not less than £1,000,000 anof nually in the saving that would be effected We shall in keeping the accounts of private institutions and in the various schools throughI have previously pointed out that in America, where children in the State schools have been taught the enumeration of numbers, they pass straight from the tables of units, tens, hundreds, and thousands, which are so familiar to our infant will days, into problems of money which our own children have for one or two vears to no delay attacking. Here we have a distinct advantage w hich : was partly denied by the ex-Treasurer, but which has been reiterated over and again by those best qualified to speak regard to the position of our educational establishments. At a conference of school teachers recently held in New South VWes, the necessity for various improvements was discussed, and one of the leading ancl most trusted inspectors in the State said ihat more good could be done in. the direction of this reform than in any other of -.vhich he knew. He strongly advocated the two reforms recommended by the Select Combest mittee, and reiterated what has been said by many of the great thinkers of the old country, who hold that by the adoption the new system at least one ""ear's tuition would be saved in the education of every child in the Commonwealth. I would ask honourable members to consider whar sivr.ig that would effect iii the national education bill? If , instead of devoting a year acquiring a knowledge of rules that under this system would be no longer necessary, children of school-going age « ould devole it to some other form of instruction which would better qualify them for the struggle of life; if instead of having to give their attention during that time to useless rules, they could acquire the technical education which is so necessary to enable England to maintain supremacy in the world's kets, how great would be the reform? Honourable members must recognise that the. adoption of this system would result not only in the small monetary profit to which I have referred, but in the much larger that would be saved by every private inBritish stitution, every individual, and every struggling school child in the land. It is on this ground more than that of the mere monetary benefit that would accrue Commonwealth in its State capacity that urge the carrying out of the reform. The question naturally resolves itself into two parts. In the first place, we have to termine to what extent .the Commonwealth is prepared to take advantage of the power conferred upon it by the Constitution. persons Outside the Legislature entertain the opinion that we have no power to establish a coinage system of our own. I would point out, however, that we have the fullest power in this direction, and can gulate all questions of currency. We have thus to ask ourselves, firstly, whether we should take advantage of that power in order to obtain the. great profits now being reaped by the Imperial authorities from our Australian currency; and, secondly, whether' 31 we should avail ourselves of the opportunity over that would be given by the creation of a in Commonwealth coinage to secure the very best system, that could be devised. As soon as it is determined that the Commonwealth shall adopt its own coinage system, we shall be met with questions as to the class of coins that should be issued, ancl the relation they should have to each other under the system adopted. I believe that even the opponents of the Select Committee's report have admitted generally that the decimal system is the and in reality the only system for us to adopt, and if we are going to adopt it, why should we not avail ourselves of the opporof tunity to do so that the coining of our own metallic currency will give us ? The report shows that the desirableness of securing the profits of the coinage of silver in Australia was mooted as far back as 1873. Much correspondence took place between the varito ous Colonial Treasurers and the Imperial authorities with regard to the giving of the necessary power to mint our own silver, and the negotiations were protracted. year after year until practically the eve of the proclamation of the Commonwealth. It was then pointed out by the Imperial authorities that the difficulties which had arisen in the course of the correspondence would be resolved by the Commonmarwealth, which would have power to deal with the ques'tion of coinage and to determine what should be the currency. The matter was left at that stage. I believe that the late Treasurer has since had further sum communications ,on the subject with the authorities, and I am rather anxious to learn the nature of them. I fail to see that it was necessary for them to take place. The simple question before us is whether to the we are prepared now to take action I or whether we are going to delay this reform and lose the profits and other advantages which would result from it. It is time for deus to consider the question as a practical one. ' We have to decide whether we should continue to receive nearly £100,000 a year Many of silver coinage from the Home Government, and allow them to make the first great profit. The Imperial authorities, of course, incur the cost of repairing worn-out coins; but the net profit derived by them reis very considerable. The late Treasurer holds that we ought not to adopt the decimal system unless England first takes action in that direction. I have already pointed out that we did not wait for England to take action with regard to the ballot, the Torrens title, adult suffrage, and many other reforms, and those who support this system fail to^see why we should wait for her to adopt the decimal system before we ourselves set to work to bring about so valuable a reform. Whilst the right honourable member for Balaclava believes that there is something in the system, he does not think it would do for the Commonwealth to reap at one stroke all the profit that would be derived from its adoption. In dealing last session with the probable profits to be derived from the system, he saidAt all events, it is said that it would £1,000,000. When I first saw that statement. I felt that we should be prepared to almost any inconvenience in order to obtain so large a sum of money for the Commonwealth. But when we look carefully into the question honourable members must see that we could not 1900 to £974.000. hope to obtain, anything like that profit it represented the earnings of a considerable number of years. Whether we had a system discussion here. of decimal coinage, or adhered to the existing system, there would be no difference so that matter was concerned. The profit in either case would be exactly the same. There is no difference between the right honourable member and myself in regard that point. He admits that a saving to be made, but we differ in this way: say that the moment that the Commonwealth is ready to coin its own silver, we should introduce the coins as soon as we can, gradually ship the whole of the silver now use back to Great Britain. The right honorsilver able member for Balaclava, however, is prepared to go as far as that. I would point out that the new coins could be intro-duced only gradually. It would not possible to substitute the new coinage the present coinage within a few months, even within a year, and it would be only new coins came into circulation that I send back to England the coins now in use. The Imperial authorities have received the profit on their coinage, and should be pared to redeem it, or to pass the coins circulation in Great Britain. honourable member has intimated that thinks that this should not be done; but, my opinion, it can fairly and honestlv done. He contends that we should go getting the small profit to be obtained coining the £100.000 worth of silver coins' now imported each year, until 3 per interest upon an accumulated capital of rupees, or over £500,000. £1,000,000 would give us an annual return of £30,000. We differ only as to the gree of despatch with which the new age should be substituted for the old. Mr G. B. Edwards. have constitutional authority to take advantage of the benefits to be gained by coining our own silver, and we can honestly and justly do so. The Committee agreed that the large profit of £1,000,000 which can be secured should be invested, and held against any possible dislocation of the relative values of silver and gold, so that, no matter what occurred, the Commonwealth currencv would be upon a safe basis. I should like to make it clear, because it does not appear to be thoroughly understood by . many people, that the profit I mentioned can be obtained, and to do so I shall refer be over to the report of the Deputy-Master of the Imperial Mint in England, who suffer is the only authority upon the subject. The profits of the Imperial Mint on the coinage of silver amounted in the year Those figures were unless quoted when the subject was last under The year was an exceptional one, quantities being high, and silver far as low, and those in charge of the Mint are apparently most effective in coining silver when that metal is at its lowest price. The average annual profit for a considerableto number of years past, however, has been is £500,000, a large portion of the silver I coined being exported to Australia, though we have not shared in the profit. On pages 80 and 82 of the last report of the Deputyand Master and Comptroller of the Imperial in Mint, it is set forth that the net profit on bullion purchased for coinage durnot ing the year was £365.915. It will be seen that that is a big falling off in comparison with the profit gained in the prebe ceding year; but it is due to the large num-for ber of coins issued in that year. When we or were last dealing with this question, I as quoted the figures for the year 1900. The would profit on the coinage of bronze for that year was £119,000, and the profit for the year 1902, according to the last report obpretainable from the Library, was £118,601. into These are official figures, so that The right there can be no disputing them, he and I ask honourable members to bear them in in mind when I put before them the debe ductions I have drawn as to the profit to be on made by the coinage of silver'and bronze on within the Commonwealth. The same report sets forth that in India the receipts cent, exceeded the expenditure by 5.912,768 India is a country which uses a silver. currency, and, deconsequently, a very large number of silver coincoins are used there, which accounts for We the immense profit upon the operations of the Mint, though the nominal value of the rupee is higher, in comparison with its intrinsic value, than is that of our florin. The Imperial Mint turned out 83,000,000 odd Imperial pieces last year, and 41,000,000 odd Colonial pieces. They do a lot of minting in England for tha Colonies. The value of these coins was £9,090,000. We require in the £2,000,000 worth of silver coins used in Australia about 28,000,000 pieces, because great numbers of threepenny and sixpenny pieces are needed. If . honourable members will take the trouble to consult the report from which I am quoting, they will see that the Imperial Mint coined during the last year for which we have information, 125,000,000 coins of all denominations, the cost of the operation, inclusive of interest, rent, taxes, sums paid to the Board of Works, and all other charges which would be debited by a sound commercial concern, but exclusive of the cost of buying silver and gold, being £120,000. That, divided by the total number of pieces issued, makes it evident that the cost of coining the 28,000,000 silver pieces required for the Australian currency would be £ 2 6 , 6 6 6, so that the estimate I gave when the matter was last under discussion-£30.000-is not very far beyond the mark. The right honourable member for Balaclava is of opinion that we import only some £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 worth of silver coins from England each year, but I think - that he has made the mistake of taking the average importation for a number of years back. The figures given in the last report - of the Deputy-Master of the Imperial Mint are these: In 1901, Western Australia imported £ 2 4 , 6 5 0 worth of silver coins; New South Wales £ 9 0 , 0 0 0 worth; and Victoria £ 7 2 , 4 0 0 worth. In the following year there was a falling off, Western Australia importing only £ 1 6 , 2 0 0 worth; New South Wales £40.000 worth; ancl Victoria £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 worth; the total importation of the Commonwealth for 1901 being £ 1 8 7 , 0 5 0 worth, and for 1902 £ 8 2 , 2 0 0 worth. It yvill be seen that the average importation of those two years is much greater than the sum mentioned by the right honourable member for Balaclava. In my opinion the estimates obtained from experts in regard to the value of the silver current in Australia are very much under the mark This conclusion is borne in upon me when I read the value of the silver imported and exported. I do not wish to place the case unfairly before the House, and therefore I have to admit that certain deductions 3 12 should be made from the figures just given, inasmuch as a good deal of the silver imported by New South Wales is exported again to supply a currency for the Islands of the Pacific. The florin, which the Committee propose to make the chief coin of our decimal system, is already known as the "" dollar of the Pacific,"" and is current every where in the islands which are dotted over thousands of miles of ocean to.the northeast of Australia. But, making this allowance, the figures I have quoted show plainly that there is more silver in use in Australia than the experts are prepared to admit. One has only to look to the circumstances of similar countries to show that that must be so. Canada is, perhaps, the safest criterion I can adopt, because, as the United States currency circulates, freely there, a smaller number'of English coins are required than would otherwise be needed. The English coins in circulation' in Canada are made 'by the Royal Mint, Limited, Birmingham, a'sort of chartered company which does the extra work which the Royal Mint finds itself unable to get through. Last year 4,100,000 pieces were coined for the use of the Dominion of Canada, the value of the Canadian coinage amounting in 1901 to £ 9 0 , 0 0 0, while in the year 1902 £ 7 6 , 0 0 0 worth of silver coins were sent there. It must be remembered that the - Dominion gets the. profit upon that coinage, less the actual cost.",18
36,Mr BAMFORD,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,What is the profit?,27
37,Mr GB EDWARDS,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"Roughly , about 140 per cent. I shall deal more specifically with that question a little later on. Beforeleaving the report of the Deputy Master of the Mint, I wish to refer to some facts concerning the branches established in Australia. When the matter was last under discussion there was a tendency to consider that it would be desirable, if the Commonwealth took over the coinage of the whole Australian currency, to concentrate operations ; but I have since seen very good reason for altering my opinion that the Western Australian Mint might advantageously be closed,- because the figures in the report from which I am quoting show that, although its operations previously resulted in a loss, they are now giving the best profit which is being obtained in Australia. The various mints are kept going by votes of the State Parliaments, in the nature of Treasurers' advances. In some cases £.15,000 is ad- vanced, and in other cases £20.000, and as the receipts come in the money is paid back to the States Treasuries. For many years the States made a loss on these transactions. Then came the time when a slight profit was obtained, economies being which actual operations had shown to be necessary, and more skilled workmen being employed. Now the operations of the mints in New South Wales and Victoria are satisfactory in varying degree, while in Western Australia a very handsome profit is obtained. In New South Wales there has been a decrease of £2,815 H 1 r n e lected. That revenue amounted to £15,396, and the expenditure to £14,900, while a small balance carried forward made the profit to the State nearly £500. where we used 10 be able to show rather large figures, we seem to have receded last year. The Deputy-Master of the Mint reports that the revenue amounted to £16,863 as against £16,664 in 1901. pended balance of the Mint annuity for the year was £4,339, and' the Mint operations resulted in a profit to the State Treasury of £1,202. For the previous year the profit was greater than that. When we turn to Western Australia we find a most promising state of affairs. This was the last Mint to be established in Australia, and, for the first year or two, it involved the Western Australian Government in a loss. At that time most of the gold used to find its wayout of the State, without going through the Mint; but now the greater proportion of it passes through the local Mint, with the result that the Master states that there was a gain of £6.930 to the Western Government on the working of the establish men during the last year. .satisfactory in one way, because, in considering any scheme of dealing with our own - coinage, we have to remember that it will be - necessary for us to make good any losses on the gold coin used in Australia, as well is the loss resulting from the wear and tear of silver coin. Therefore, it is pleasing to see that the Mints are already making a sufficient profit to enable us to defray the cost of rehabilitating all the worn coin of Australia. Another point that cropped up when we were discussing this aspect of th? question was the practice of exporting large numbers of sovereigns, which were used for the purpose of settling international balances, and which, immediately they reached the countries to which they were sent - notably the United States-were down again. It appeared to me that this was a .senseless that we should, if possible, relieve ourselves Mr G. B. Edwards. of the necessity of going to the trouble and expense of turning out sovereigns which were simply to be melted down again. effected Not only thousands, but millions of sovereigns have been sent away to the United States in the course of a year, and have been melted down again in order to comply with the currency laws of the United States. The Committee strongly recommended that we should do what we could to adopt, for the purposes of export, a 10-oz. bar of revenue col- gold, not minted, but stamped with a mint mark, guaranteeing the gold as being of a certain standard of fineness. This would result in a great saving of expense, and In Melbourne, would also afford those who desired gold for export purposes, an opportunity to send it forward in a convenient shape. The Director of the Mint in the United States points out that The unex- The gold coinage of the country is now being almost entirely stored, the Treasury holding about 500,000,000 dollars, and the cost of the coinage is therefore an unnecessary expense, inasmuch as when gold is wanted for export it is required in the form of bars. He addsFor domestic circulation the public prefer Treasury certificates to gold coin. It is considered, indeed, that with some modification in the existing laws certificates might well be issued against gold bars instead of against gold coin. There, I think, we haye an endorsement of the practical suggestion of the Committee with regard to saving money on our present system of gold coinage. I have stated that the quantity of silver coin reAustralian quired for the Commonwealth has been variously estimated at about £2,000,000 This is very worth. I have reason to believe that that is an under estimate; but, for the purpose of calculation, and in order that I may be upon perfectly sure ground, I am assuming that £2,000,000 worth of silver coin will be required for circulation in Australia. I think, however, that I shall be able to show that more than that will be needed. The price of silver, in London, on 24th May, according to today's Argus, was 25 11-16 pence per ounce- a rise of £d. per oz. since Friday last. It requires 1 oz. of silver to turn out 5s. 6d. worth of coins, or, to use the ratio given in Lord Liverpool's famous letter, every pound troy of silver should turn out sixtysix shillings . worth of coins. Here we have a basis for calculating the actual cost of the silver that would be required melted to turn out silver coins of a face value of £2,000,000. The amount of silver required practice, and would be 7,272,726 ozs., which, at 2s. - 1 n - i 6 d. per ounce., would cost £777>575 12 s. 3d. I think that, like the immortal Mantalini, we may "" d e m "" the 12s. 3d. That leaves us a clear difference between the first cost of the silver and the value of the coin, which we may regard as a first profit. Then we have to take into account the cost of producing such a large amount of coin. Honourable members will, perhaps, recollect that, by a rule-of-three sum which I worked out by making a comparison with the British system, I calculated that the cost of minting £2,000,000 worth of silver coin would be £ 2 6 , 0 0 0. I have, however, put down the amount at £30,000. This would, bring the total outlay up to £ 8 0 7 , 5 7 5 . This would leave £ 4 6 , 5 gross profit than I said would be derived when the House last considered this question. That is owing to the fact that silver was then worth only 2s. o£d. per ounce. The effect of that slight rise in the price of silver has been to reduce the profit by that amount. In addition to the cost ,of the silver, and Of turning out the coin, we have to make provision for wear and tear. average life of a silver coin is thirteen years, so that for some years to come we should have nothing to pay on that score. think it is safer, however, to make provision from the commencement for wear and tear, and I set down an amount of £ 7 , 0 0 0 as sufficient to rehabilitate both our gold and silver coin. That calculation has been carefully checked, by means of comparison with the various reports of the Master of the Mint, and I am sure would correctly represent the amount of depreciation.",27
38,Mr BAMFORD,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,What is the average life of a sovereign?,29
39,Mr GB EDWARDS,FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS,"The sovereign is not subjected to the same wear and tear as are silver coins. The average life of silver coins is thirteen years, whereas that of the sovereign is calculated at slightly over nineteen years. Of course some sovereigns last for hundreds of years. are hundreds of thousands of sovereigns in a strong vault in Sydney, where they have been deposited by the banks for the purpose of facilitating the balancing of their exchanges. This coin has remained untouched for years, and may remain there for ever, for all we know. The life of a sovereign is much greater than that of silver coins, because it is not subjected to the same rough usage. The gross profit upon the coinage of £2,000,000 of silver would be £1,185,000. I am prepared ro stand by those figures in spite of anything that the right honourable member for Balaclava may care to say. If the Legislature chooses to derive this profit in driblets by spreading it over a number of years it can do so; but I think that we should be full y justified in deriving it as fast as we could, by turning out the coin as rapidly as possible, under some arrangement with the Royal Mint, or with some private firm possessing the necessary facilities. I have estimated that £2,000,00 0 worth of silver coin would be required to meet the necessities p f the Commonwealth, but I believe that is a much less amount that we should need-althoug h many 3 6 less of the experts have given a much lower estimate. On page 15, of the report of the Master of the Mint, he gives an answer to some inquiries which"" were made from India with regard to the quantity of silver required for currency purposes. The Master of the Mint entered into some very abstruse calculations, and came to the conclusion that in England silver coin to the value of The u s . 5d. per head of the population was required to provide a sufficiency of currency to carry on the operations of every-day life. (II f we multiply n s . 5d. by 4,000,000-the population of Australia-w e shall find it will give us an amount of £2,283,333. I d ° not think that the ordinary man in the Commonwealth requires less silver for everyday purposes than does the ordinary man in Great Britain. If anything, I should say that the average man here carries more coin than the average man in Great Britain. Therefore, if the Master of the Mint is justified in coming to the conclusion that IIS . 5d. per head is required to meet the necessities of the people of the United Kingdom, we shall want £2,283,333 worth of silver coin to meet the necessities of the Commonwealth. The Master of the Mint works out a similar calculation in regard to the bronze coinage, and estimates that i6-5id. per head of the population is required. Upon There that basis, we should require £272,221 worth of copper coinage. We can submit this calculation to another test. In Germany, in order to guard against the overissue of silver, it has been enacted that no more than 15 marks, roughly 15s., per head of the population shall be issued in the form of silver coins. If we adopted 15s. per head as thS basis of calculation we should require £3,000,000 worth of silver coin in Australia. I do not think that we are likely to fal l into any trouble owing to the overissue of silver in Australia. We should scarcely be inclined to play "" ducks and. drakes,"" with the operations of such an institution as the Mint. If , however, it should be considered that there is any danger of an attempt of this kind we could provide that silver coins should never be issued from the Mint except in exchange for gold. In this way we could institute a certain automatic check against the over-issue of silver. If silver could be issued in exchange for gold, no profit could be derived by the Government from the issue of silver coin over and above that required for the legitimate uses of the people. If the people can obtain silver in excess of their requirements, the thing will regulate itself by the banks refusing to purchase it They will buj only, when from the needs of their business, they can see that more silver currency is required. I do not think there need be any apprehension that Ave shall make use of our power to manufacture silver coin ad lib. We can purchase silver for 2s. an ounce, and if we could mint silver coin without restriction, there would be no need for the introduction of many of the schemes which are proposed by honourable members opposite. would be no necessity, for example, to take over the gold reserves from the banks-a scheme to which I do not object, provided that it is safeguarded by proper regulations-if we could turn out silver ad lib. at 2S. an ounce, and obtain 5s. 66. an ounce for it. There need ' be no fear that the Commonwealth will do anything more than issue silver currency as it may be required for specific purposes of trade within our midst. But we have a right to appropriate this million pounds odd, fund it, and paythe interest upon it into the Commonwealth . Treasury. The ex-Treasurer took exception to that proposal. He thought that we should not treat any portion of that sum as revenue, but should apply the whole of it towards the extinction of our national debt. His view is very much better than my own, and, therefore, I am only too willing to adopt it. At the same time, it would be a legitimate transaction to use the interest derived upon the profit secured from the adoption of the system as current revenue. But if the-Treasurer prefers it, I am perfectly prepared to agree to any suggestion which will have the effect of reducing, in however small' a degree, our national debt. I earnestly impress upon honourable members that the proposed, reform is a most desirable and practical one. Nothing can be urged against it, either on the score of honesty or of the letter of Mr C. B. Edwards. the law as it is contained in the Constitution; I am satisfied that this reform will be brought about in England within a comparatively brief period. Whatever difficulties there may be in the way of effectingit at the present moment will increase rather than diminish with the lapse of time. If we intend to attack the question at all, the only sooner we do so the better, because our difficulties will never be less than they are' now. There is no reason why the Commonwealth should not secure the advantage' which is offered by the adoption of this' scheme, and apply the proceeds to the re-, duction of our national debt, or fund them for some other useul purpose. To those who urge that we can obtain all this financial benefit by getting the silver coined for us without adopting the decimal system, I would put the question, "" Is it wise, when we are adopting a new system, to embrace other than the best'possible one?"" If we are going to initiate any reform, before doing so, we should decide what is best under the circumstances. Having made our choice, it should be a system to which There we can adhere. No nation which has' adopted the decimal system has ever thought of discarding 'it. It is the' natural system. Many people appear' to think that there is some mysterious quality about the number "" JO,"" which makes it the only radix of a system of numbers. But I would point out that we can perform arithmetic with "" 12,"" or practically any radix we choose. There is no mysterious virtue about the number ""10;"" but a system of decimal currency exists : throughout the civilized world, with the exception of Great Britain, its depend- 1 encies. and Turkey; and I do not envy Great Britain, her associate, in opposition to this reform. It is a great reform, which offers us a legitimate profit, and I have every confidence in submitting this motion to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr BATCHELOR) adjourned. NA KING ISLAND.",29
40,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," I move- _ That, in view of the enormous increase of the population of King Island and the magnitude of its agricultural and commercial importance (the island lying midway between the States of Victoria and Tasmania), in the opinion of this House the Postmaster-General should make arrangements with the Union Steam-ship Company for its steamer plying between Melbourne and' Strahan, Tasmania, to call at King Island and to stay there long enough to deliver the mails at Currie Harbor or Sea Elephant Bay. As this motion i j not of a contentious nature. ancl has little relation to politics, I think that it may very well be agreed to without much debate. The facts of the case are that King Island lies abou midway between Melbourne and Strahan, and is situated in the middle of Bass Straits. It has become a very important place, and possesses a population of 600 or 700. These people have no communication with the mainland or Tasmania, save that which is afforded by a sort of antiquated tub, which plies between Launceston and the Island. Settlers there never know when this vessel wil arrive, and when it will depart. Yet the steamer Kawatiri, belonging to the Union Steamship Company, travels from Melbourne to Strahan weekly, and passes within six miles of Sea Elephant Bay. I desire the Postmaster-General to endeavour .to arrive at some business arrangement with that company, which will enable its vessels to remain long enough at Sea Elephant Bay, or Wickham, to land the mails. If the winds were unfavorable at one place, the mails could be landed at the other. They could then be carried on horseback to Currie Harbor, which is the chief centre on the island. This island has an important pastoral interest, and contains good fattening country. Indeed, some of the finest cattle come from there. The settlers - are all pioneers, really hard workers, and substantial citizens of the Commonwealth. For a small additional expenditure on the part of the Postal authorities, these people would be enabled to send their produce to Melbourne, and to obtain a regular mail service. During the recent election campaign, I \vas unable to reach King Island, and none of the candidates could address the electors there. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - The ballot-papers did not arrive there in time for polling day.",30
41,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"That is quite correct. The polling had to be postponed until the day after that which was originally fixed for the election, because the boat, which at present runs there, did not reach the island in time.",31
42,Mr CROUCH,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"What expense will be involved by the adoption of this motion? . Mr OMALLEY - It will not be much, because a steamer belonging to the Union Company passes within six miles of the island twice a week. By steering another course, that distance would in reality not require to be covered.",31
43,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Is there any mining conducted upon the island?,31
44,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"It is becoming a very, important mining place.",31
45,Mr HUME COOK,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"It seems to be the "" hub of the universe.""",31
46,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I claim that the population settled upon the island should be given every possible encouragement. The motion, which I have, submitted, really takes the form of a suggestion. It is not mandatory.",31
47,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Is there a harbour at King Island?,31
48,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"There is a harbour at Currie, but the steamers will not go there. All I ask is that an arrangement shall be made with the Union Companv under. which its vessel will enter - Sea Elephant Bay, and land the mails in a boat.",31
49,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Can that be done ?,31
50,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I am informed so by a captain who has been there. Personally, I have not visited the locality. I would not risk my life in the Yan'ibacoona. I trust that the Postmaster-General will see his way to communicate with the Union Steam Ship ""Company, and ascertain what can be done.",31
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,How many people are settled upon the island?,31
52,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,About 600.,31
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,How often do they receive their mails?,31
54,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Once a week. The island is only six miles out of the ordinary route followed by steamers trading regularly between Melbourne and Strahan, and cdn be clearly seen from her decks.",31
55,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Would the steamer be able to land mails and passengers there? Mr O^MALLEY - Sh e could land them at Sea Elephant Bay, or at Wickham. The port to be selected would depend upon the quarter from which the wind was blowing. If the steamer could not land passengers at one point she would be able to do so at the other. There is a landing place on this side of the island, which one might say is in the very track of the Kawatiri, that runs between Strahan and Melbourne. That vessel is never overladen, and, even if she were delayed an hour or two as the result of the granting of this convenience, it would be immaterial.",31
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Does she carry passengers ?,32
57,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Yes ; but, as a rule, they are not landed at Strahan on Saturdays before 9 p.m., and a delay, of a couple of hours would be nothing, as compared with the advantage that the people of King Island would receive from the granting of this accommodation. The island has become, within the last two years, a most important centre of civilization. At present the mails are carried by a small steamer, which, I would not be surprised to learn, was one of the rowing boats attached to Noah's Ark, but, having been fitted with a steam engine, is now employed in this service. One never knows how long she will take to reach her destination. It is my desire that passengers and mails for King Island should be carried by the Kawatiri, and this arrangement would not involve any large increase on the cost of the present service.",32
58,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Does the honourable member say that it would cost very little more than does the present service?,32
59,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,It would not largely exceed the present cost.,32
60,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"What does the honourable member believe would be the increased cost ? - Mr OMALLEY - I do not wish to make any calculations at the present stage, but we shall haye an opportunity later on to discuss it. I trust that the Postmaster General will accept the motion, and I am sure that he will have ample opportunity to give effect to it.",32
61,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," I am sure that the Postmaster-General will give the motion his careful consideration, for it cannot be denied that the residents of King Island are far removed from many of the ordinary privileges of civilization. island is the largest in the straits, and its population, which consists of men who have made their homes and settled there, is undoubtedly a very deserving one. The land is fairly good. For grazing purposes it is all that could be desired, and a matter of fact the settlers are now supplybe ing the Launceston market with some of the finest fat stock that has ever been yarded there. This motion does not contemplate any interference with the direct mail and passenger service between Melbourne and Tasmania. The Kawatiri takes the northern course, and in voyaging between Melbourne and Strahan passes so close to the island that it can be plainly seen from her decks. Admittedly, neither of the harbors of King Island is first-class, but as there is one on each side of it, the steamer would generally be able to get a lee, and it would rarely happen that she would be unable to land passengers and mails. Honourable Members would be surprised to learn the irregularity of the Straits mail service. If the Union Steam-ship Company would deliver a mail once a week, alternating with the present service, the islanders would secure a biweekly mail, and I am sure that the expenditure which this would involve would be comparatively small. I can assure the House that the honourable member for Darwin has not made one statement as to the condition of the residents on the island that is no""t absolutely correct. We have there some 600 or 700 people, and their only means of comunication with the mainland or Tasmania is the small steamer from Launceston, which certainly cannot be described as a high-class vessel.",32
62,Mr BAMFORD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Do they at present possess a weekly mail service?,32
63,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Sometimes - they do not have anything like a weekly mail. I would also remind the Minister that King Island should be the distributing centre for the whole of the islands in theStraits. The mails for the other islands would be despatched from that point..,32
64,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,What is the population of the other islands?,32
65,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The total population is, I think, considerably over 1,000.",32
66,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If there is a population of 700 on. King Island, there must, therefore, be only about 300 persons on the other islands.",32
67,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I do not think that there, are more. I feel satisfied that the Postmaster-General will be prepared to The make inquiries, and to ascertain whether a reasonable service, at something like a moderate cost, cannot be secured for the islanders. If his inquiries show that it can, I trust that he will see that it is supplied. The House would readily agree to the as slightly increased expenditure that would necessary in order to extend the present mail facilities.  markable that a thousand people living on islands within a few hours' sail of Melbourne should be cut off from mail and telegraphic communication with the rest of the world for so long a time as the honourable member for Darwin has mentioned. There must have been something rotten in the state of Denmark prior to the establishment of Federation, or the Tasmanian and Victorian Governments would surely have arranged for a weekly mail. The islanders have my entire sympathy, because in the district which I represent there are many who know what it is to be practically shut off from the rest of the world. In many parts of my electorate the residents do not receive a mail once a month. It seems almost incredible that in this year of grace there should be no regular mail communication with King Island. honourable member for Darwin has made out a good case, and the Postmaster General, who has fought more strenuously than bas any other honourable member if or reasonable mail facilities for his own constituents, must surely sympathize with the motion.",32
68,Mr MCCAY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Bu the was not Postmaster General when he fought in that way.  position. * We have it on the authority of two of the representatives of Tasmania that a steamer trading between Victoria and Tasmania passes King Island twice a week, and there should be no difficulty, therefore, in arranging for a better mail service at a reasonable cost. If new expenditure were incurred in this direction I am sure that no objection would be offered. that the Postmaster-General will see his way clear to give the residents of these islands, who are living where perhaps many of us would not care to go, better mail facilities than they at present possess.",33
69,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," Like the honourable member for Maranoa, I sympathize with those who, like these islanders, are situated in remote or inaccessible parts of the Commonwealth. I also agree with him that it is remarkable that apparently no attempt has previously been made to secure reasonable postal accommodation for the residents of King Island. It is certainly singular that the Tasmanian Government, when the Postal Department was under its control, did not supply the facilities which honourable members from that State have so eloquently advocated this afternoon.",33
70,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I have fought for them for years past.,33
71,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The honourable member should have told us of the causes responsible for his failure. I am sure that the House would have welcomed a more ample explanation of his inability to secure these postal facilities.,33
72,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,A large population has only lately settled on the island.,33
73,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I presume that the island has been populated for many years, and I have not heard of any reason for a sudden influx of population:",33
74,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,There has been of late a very large increase.,33
75,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If correct that constitutes a very good argument for the proposal. I am entirely in sympathy with the motion, The but I am not at present prepared to accept it as a direction to the Department to immediately make the suggested arrangements. It seems to me that the explanation of the position in which the people of these islands find themselves is that they have no suitable harbour accommodation on their coast line. That being so, shipping companies are naturally reluctant to allow their vessels to touch there. The honourable member for Darwin,- and the honourable member for Franklin, have formed a rather economical estimate of the expenditure which would be required to establish the service for which they ask, and I fear that they will be somewhat surprised when they learn that the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, with which I have already communicated on the subject, require no less than I trust £ 5 0 0 per annum for a fortnightly service.",33
76,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Having , regard to the risk, that seems to be a comparatively small sum.",33
77,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I have before me a letter from the manager of the Union Steamship Company, dated 24th inst., in which it is stated thatWe cannot arrange to call at the island each week, but we will be prepared to make a call each fortnight for ^500 per annum. Then they go on to explain what is apparently the real difficultySuch call would require to be made either off Currie Harbor, on the west side of the island, or off Sea Elephant Harbor, on the east side of the island, according to the direction of the wind, and it would be necessary for the mails to be landed by a boat from the shore at either placeto be in waiting on arrival of the steamer. They are apparently not prepared to send their steamers close into land, so that the Department would have to incur the additional cost of providing a boatman and boat to take the mails to and from the steamer. The letter continuesShould the boat not be in readiness to receive the mails on the arrival of the steamer, the master to *>-. at liberty to proceed on his voyage after waiting for an hour. I understand that, while a steamer-sa y the Kawatiri-coul d approach within about two miles of the shore at Sea Elephant Bay, she could not safely anchor within about six miles of Currie Harbor, on the west side of the island.",33
78,Mr WATKINS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,It is always the when there is no competition.,34
79,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Hear , hear; Aye shall have to put a Government steamer on.",34
80,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I am not prepared to say how far the position is due to the absence of competition. An earlier communication from the Union Steamship Company, dated 20th April last, says The difficulty we foresee is in arranging for landing at the island, as the depth of water at Currie Harbor is too limited to allow our steamers to enter, and Sea Elephant Bay is exposed to easterly weather. It is possible, however, that if an arrangement can be made with some parties on shore to send a boat off to meet the Strahan steamer, communication with the island may be provided for. Further inquiries a.e being made. The information in my possession is not so full as I should like it to be, and, fore, I shall be glad if the honourable member will withdraw his motion, to enable the Department to obtain ampler details.",34
81,Mr CHAPMAN,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"That is what the Department is always professing itself desirous of doing, though it never does much.",34
82,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I do not suppose that the Department of the Postmaster-General is less successful in the transaction of its business than are sonie of the other Departments.' There is a certain amount of circumlocution in connection with the operations of every Department. No doubt the honourable member found, when Minister of Defence, that he was not able to accomplish all that, before accepting office, he wished to have done.",34
83,Mr CHAPMAN,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,We shall see whether the honourable member will carry out the pledges which he has made.,34
84,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I undertake to carry them out. so far as it is in my power to do so - The honourable member for Darwin must see that the estimate of cost is greatly in excess of what he thought it would be. Taking everything into account, I think he will do well ""to withdraw the motion.",34
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," I know something about this matter, and can endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Darwin. Some three or four vears ago I made inquiries on the subject invself; and .having friends living upon King Island, I tried to ascertain why a better steam-shiD service could not be given to the place. The Tasmanian Government was applied to, but in all these matters it is rather slow. It must not be forgotten that at the time there was no steamer running directly between Melbourne and Strahan. The service would have had to be done .by way steamers running from Launceston, and would have cost a great deal more than the service which could be provided by the use of the steamer now running between the two places I have mentioned.

93,Mr GB EDWARDS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If carried amended, the motion will express the general consensus of honourable members as to the desirability of providing the mail service asked for. Unquestionably it ""should be provided. We have already healthiest. .agreed to subsidise a wealthy steam-ship day of my existence there. proprietary in order to obtain better communication with the New Hebrides fore, and other islands which lie outside the Commonwealth, Island is part of the Commonwealth. The residents there are, by force of cirwe cumstances, excluded from . the ordinary means of communication enjoyed by those in other places, and, seeing tnat they number 600 or 700 persons, we should all we can to improve their means of . munication with the mainland, and with Tasmania. I have been on King Island, and, while I cannot describe it as the finest places in Australia, it is quilt possible that, with better communication, it would be largely resorted to by tourist?. Many of us have already intimated that we are agreeable to the policy of bringing the various parts of the Commonwealth much in touch as is possible. No doubt when the Navigation Bill comes under sideration, the Postmaster-General will ready to relax certain of its provisions .order that there shall be no interference - with the communication between Western Australia and the eastern States. I say that that will be wrong; in my opinion have to it has a good deal to 'recommend it. Simithe mainland or Tasmania. larly, we should not overlook the claims of an important island lying so near mainland as does King Island. The branch of the Legislature, some time instituted an inquiry as to the best - of improving the communication between the mainland and the island State of mania. There is a great deal to be said for that. The steam-ship company which now does so large a part of the trade between Tasmania and the mainland could easilv the make a visit to King Island a side trip for one of its vessels. I do not say that it is benecessary to have a vessel calling (here frequently, but, as the residents of the island consume a large quantity of goods, pay a considerable amount of taxation to the Commonwealth, they should be considered in this matter. I do not think any great expense would be involved in providing the inhabitants of King Island with means of access to the other States. If such facilities were afforded, they would tend to the developas ment of the island, and probably result in its becoming a popular health resort. Although King Island is not what I should call the most charming place in Australia, can and there is no doubt that it is one of the I spent the most miserable I was on board a weather-bound ship, and, theresaw the place under the worse possible circumstances. I had to help the sailors whereas King to carry sheep down to the ship, because we had run out of food. I think that if can do anything to bring the inhabitants into more direct contact with the people of the mainland we shall be justified in innow curring a small expenditure with that obdo ject. If King Island were divided from comthe great centres of population by a desert, similar to those which exist in the interior of Australia, instead of by sea, it would one of be considered necessary to provide it with postal facilities, even though the cost involved might be considerable. Therefore, I do not think that the inhabitants of the Island should be placed at any disadvantage. Ships already trade along routes as Which pass very near it, - and they would require to make only a slight detour conin order to call there. They would not be need to go out of their way for the purin pose of conveying mails only, because the Island yields a certain amount of produce, which has to be sent to the mainland, and do not the inhabitants require stores, which be brought to them from Therefore, a certain amount of trade would be carthe ried on by any vessels which called there, other and we should only require to pay such ago, a.sum as would compensate the owners for means the expense of maintaining a regular service for the conveyance of mails. I have Tasgreat pleasure in supporting the motion.",35
94,Mr STORRER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," I shall support the motion, but I should be very sorry indeed if the provision of the proposed facilities involved an outlay of such a large sum as has been mentioned. There are a number of people living upon the islands in Bass Straits who do not enjoy the same conveniences as do the inhabitants of King Island, and they are entitled to at least equal consideration. It has been complained thj.1 the ballot-boxes and ballot-papers intended for King Island during the recent elections, arrived too late for use by the electors there. The people living on other islands in Bass Straits had no special facilities for recording their votes. Their only recourse was to go to Georgetown, on the mainland, and vote there as best they could. It was arranged that certain papers were to be sent to these islands to enable the electors 10 vote by post, but these did not arrive in time, and the electors were disfranchised. No harm can be done by passing the motion; on the contrary, it may do some good, ' and I think that we should certainly afford all reasonable facilities to the inhabitants of King Island. Amendment agreed to. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.

Whether Major-General Hutton travelled with an orderly. 12. If so, what was the sum annually paid for his travelling expenses. I do not propose to detain the House at any great length. In the first place, an inquiry is pending, which might render it a matter of delicacy for me to discuss the subject cX length; and, secondly, I know that honourable members are anxious to proceed with other business. I think it is only right that the community should know exactly 1H2 sum of money paid to the General Officer Commanding. I find, by reference to ths oflicial papers, that Major-General Hutton receives a salary of £2,500, including all allowances, except travelling allowances. I know that, in connection with certain forces, three different kinds of allowances are provided for under the head of travelling expenses, living expenses, and route expense.;, the latter term being somewhat difficult to define. I find that Von Moltke, w h j led the victorious legions of Germany against France, and who had the command of the of about a million men, received a salary of only £1,500, and although the salaries paid in Australia must be upon a relatively of higher scale, we should guard against any this undue extravagance. The citizens of Australia are entitled to know the exact amount Bay. which is paid to the General Officer Commanding out of the funds-of the Commonwealth.  jection to the motion, but I think we should its scope in order to cover the expenses paid to the State Commandants. I am under the impression that the aggregate amount expended. in the form of travelling expenses to the military commandants reprewas sents a very considerable sum. I-move That the following words be added :- "" (13) Similar information regarding the travelling expenses of each of the six State Commandants for 1902 and 1903.""",36
96,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," I do not see much objection, on principle, to the House desiring and obtaining information of this description, especially as within a comparatively short time the Estimates will be presented. I expect, however, that the amendment will lead to a considerable increase in the cost of preparing the return.  they are paying.",36
97,Sir JOHN FOKREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,They do ,37

99,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The public the rate per diem that is allowed.,37
100,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I have no objection to the motion, but I hope that the preparation of the return will not involve any great expense.",37
101,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," There is no objection to any return being asked for in connection with the public expenditure, so long as the information sought is required for the enlightenment of the public, but it appears to me that the motion is somewhat longer than is really necessary, and that there is something underlying it. If that be so, I do not approve of it. The travelling expenses of public officers of the Commonwealth are fixed by regulations which have been approved by the Public Service Commissioner and the Executive of the day. Those allowances are not of a haphazard character. They are absolutely fixed. Officers of the Commonwealth are allowed two things. In the first place they are granted the actual cost of their transport, whether it be by coach, rail, or otherwise. Then they are allowed a certain sum per day, which, as a rule, is regulated by the amount of their salaries. From the day they leave their place of residence until they return they receive this allowance, which is intended to cover everything. Their only other reimbursement is for out-of-pocket expenses, such as might be involved in the despatch of official telegrams. In the case of Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, his allowance was decided whilst I occupied Ministerial office, and therefore I have some knowledge of the matter. Originally he was granted his actual expenses. That arrangement continued for some time. It did not prove a very satisfactory one, because it was felt that it was undesirable to have numerous small accounts submitted to the Department, in some of which the expenditure was vouched for, whilst in others it was not. Eventually an agreement was arrived at which was based upon the Major-General's expenditure for more than a year. Under that arrangement the Commonwealth agreed to allow that officer £ 2 per day as travelling expenses whenever he was absent from Melbourne on duty. The amount covers all his expenses, with the exception of transport by railway. He has a pass over now. all railways. He is required to pay all his expenses out of the £ 2 per day to Which I have referred. It is impossible for him to travel without an orderly. It would not be possible for any honourable member, if he occupied Major-General Sir Edward know Hutton's position, to do without an orderly.  saddle through Queensland.",37
102,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Probably the honourable member had not as many uniforms as has the Major-General?,37
103,Mr CROUCH,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Who pays for the orderly ?,37
104,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The orderly is a soldier.,37
105,Mr CROUCH,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,He is supposed to be doing garrison work.,37
106,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Genera l Officers are always allowed orderlies.,37
107,Mr CROUCH,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I think they should pay for them.  Service are allowed a soldier groom and a soldier servant.,37
108,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"""All the expenses I have enumerated are covered by the allowance to Major - General Sir Edward Hutton of £ 2 per day. I do not know that it is of any interest to the public to learn how many days were occupied by that officer in travelling to Tasmania and back. Surely, it is not implied that he charged for more days than he was absent! In my opinion, the more frequently he is away from HeadQuarters, the better it is for the forces of the Commonwealth. I would remind honourable members that the duties of the General Officer Commanding are by no means confined to Victoria, but extend to the whole of the Commonwealth. Of course, the longer he remains in Melbourne, with his family, the more comfortable he is. On the other hand, it is necessary that he should travel, in order to efficiently perform the duties of his office. Instead of having a General Officer Commanding, I understand that it is suggested by some people that we should appoint an Inspector General, who would be required to do a great deal of travelling. The question as to how many days Major-General Sir Edward Hutton was occupied in Tasmania is absolutely silly, unless he has done something which he ought not to have done. The answer to the third question raised by the honourable member is that the Major-General, on his visit to that State, was allowed travelling expenses at the rate of £ 2 per - day. I scarcely think that we are in a position to judge whether he was absent for too long or too short a period. The total sum paid to him, as travelling expenses, during 1902-3 might possibly be of interest to some persons, but the other matters upon which the honourable member for Melbourne desires information appear to suggest that the General Officer Commanding charged for more days than he was entitled to.",37
109,Mr MALONEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Evi l be to him who evil thinks.,38
110,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I cannot help thinking that some one has supplied the honourable member with these questions for some purpose of his own, and perhaps with a desire to trap the Major-General. I do not like this system of espionage upon a public officer.",38
111,Mr BROWN,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,If there is anything wrong it ought to be cleared up.,38
112,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,There is nothing to clear up.,38
113,Mr MALONEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The right honourable member mav trv to hide it as much as he chooses, but the truth will prevail.",38
114,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I do not desire to conceal anything. I am merely expressing my opinion, and I have some knowledge of these matters. The questions raised by the honourable member seem to reflect upon the Major-General, and in my judgment it is wrong to put queries which even insinuate a double meaning. I repeat that it is necessary for . Major-General Sir Edward Hutton to travel in order to faithfull y perform his duty. No one can urge that he endeavours to spare himself, because he is ever ready to do his work. I do'not like to see the slightest semblance of a reflecton cast upon an officer who is lent to us for a short period by the Imperial Government. These questions press me with the idea that there is something behind them, ancl beyond the information which is sought. If that is the case, let it be clearlv stated.",38
115,Mr KELLY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," I quite agree with the remarks of the right honourable member for Swan. It seems to me that this motion could have been concentrated under two or three heads, ancl that then the information required by the honourable member for Melbourne, could have been asked 'for in the ordinary way, at a convenient time, in the form of questions. . I should be the last to endeavour to curtail information supplied to any honourable member. But I do think, with the right nonorable member for Swan, that in this motion there is implied an indirect attack on the General Officer Commanding the Commonwealth Forces. I find, in support of my contention, that this motion might have been narrowed down considerably - Looking at paragraph 2, for instance, we find that it is desired by the honourable member to know "" How many days Major General Hutton was absent on his recent visit to Tasmania "" ? I am quite convinced that three minutes' conversation on the telephone , , with the shipping company would have extracted that valuable information. Therefore, I do not think it was necessary to ask for it in this form. As regards the other questions, they mainly concern details of the expenses of Major-General Hutton when he has been travelling. Surely, with regard to those questions, the matter is equally simple. The honourable member might simply have asked what travelling allowances the General Officer Commanding received from the Government. That would cover almost the whole of his questions. Lower down, we find that the same information' is wanted for years back. I do not know whether that is necessary for the honourable member's purposes. Of course, if it is, I would not attempt to suggest anything that would frustrate the obtaining of the information. I would defer to his request absolutely. But, at the same time, it appears to me that the information could have been obtained from the Estimates. The allowance paid to the General Officer Commanding would give the honourable member the result at once. Looking further down, we find that the honourable member wants to know the amount paid to the Major-General's aide-de-camp, and also whether he travels with a private secretary and an orderly. As the right honourable member for Swan very rightly said, it imis absolutely necessary for the General Officer Commanding to travel with some servant, if only to look after his baggage. I should say that' it is also necessary for him to travel with his secretary, because, under our dual system of military control, he has a great amount of secretarial work to do. In this connection, I should like to remind the House that some Ministers of the Commonwealth-ver y rightly, I think - hav e taken secretaries with them when they have travelled. I am not speaking of the members of the present Ministry, be! cause I do not actually know what they da 0 But certainly there have been Ministers who have travelled with secretaries as well as with servants.  fence.",38
116,Mr KELLY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I am not mentioning any particular branch of the service, but I think all the Departments are affected in this respect. I think that it would invidious to mention one; but when a Minthe ister finds it necessary to travel with secretary and with a servant, we may very well concede the same advantages to a disex-Minister tinguished officer who has to discharge enormous duties devolving *pn the General Officer Commanding. I urge that all the in information which the honourable member for Melbourne asks for in this series of questions could have been obtained in ordinary way at question time. I hope that the honourable member will not suppose that I am objecting to his obtaining the informaunless, tion. If he attempted to obtain it at tion time, andi it were refused, I should then be inclined to support a motion this kind.",39
117,Mr MALONEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I could not obtain it means of questions.,39
118,Mr KELLY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I do not think the honorwhilst able member could in this detailed form, but I think that if he narrowed down his motion, and put the questions under. or three heads, or four or five, at the outside, they would have been allowed. Of course I am not an authority on thes; matters, and have never pretended to he cne. But it seems to me that the only way m which to get information of this kind, an honourable member does not want to .'cave a sting in the minds of those against his questions are directed, is to ask them question time in the ordinary way.  in' that way. Ministers often smother up.",39
119,Mr KELLY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"In that case such a tion might be justified. As ihe case I regret that I must oppose the motion.  this motion, I may say that I am one those who are regarded by a number of the most difficult tasks as honourable members as having a particular ""down"" upon Major-General Hutton. I no particular "" down "" upon him personally. But I have a "" down "" on Imperial militarof ism. As far as the travelling allowances the circumstances. of Major-General Hutton are concerned, do not think the Commonwealth pays him too much. I might tell the honourable memserious ber for Melbourne that I have given travelling expenses of all the omcers, the commandants and their staffs, and Major General Hutton and his staff, a great deal . Deof scrutiny. I do not think we are paying them too much in these allowances. The right honourable member for Swan has put it very plausibly when he states that the more Major-General Hutton is away from Melbe bourne the more and the better he is earning salary which we pay to him. But there a is a fault in the regulations in regard to travelling expenses. I have spoken to the of Defence, the honourable memthe ber for Eden-Monaro, about it. I allude to the great difference in the amount paid travelling allowances to different officers of the service. Every one of us knows that, in travelling and staying at hotels, a man the like Major-General Hutton is not charged any more than a private individual or a lieutenant. The charge is exactly the same, of course, the General has a special quessuite of rooms, for which, naturally, he would pay correspondingly. But people, inoftravelling, do not very often go in for privileges of that kind. I cannot see for by the life of me why a colonel who is travelling should get £ 2 a day for his expenses, a lieutenant, who is travelling with him, and has to spend exactly the same amount for his. conveniences, gets ios. 6d., two or, at the most, 15s. a day.",39
120,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The General has to have a horse.  can an orderly go with a General on foot if if the General is on horseback? One of the paragraphs in the motion of the honourable whom member for Melbourne is: "" How many at days Major-General Hutton was absent on his recent visit to Tasmania?"" There is also another paragraph which deals with it the travelling expenses in respect of Major General's Hutton's visit to Tasmania. I do mo- - not know why the honourable member for stands Melbourne has picked out Tasmania any more than - any other place; but I believe to that, when Major-General Hutton was over of in Tasmania, he had to perform one of regards, military discipline that any General Officer have Commanding ever had to perform in any country. It seems to me that he got out the difficulty very wellindeed, under If what happened in I Tasmania had happened in some of the countries of Europe, a penalty much more than'the disbanding of a corps would to ihe have been thei,consequence.",39
121,Mr STORRER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"What could have been done?  been in prison tb-day in consequence of their action. It was not simply that they did not turn up to duty; it was practically rebellion, and the honourable member for Bass must know what the penalty for rebellion is.",40

Some drivers in the artillery were discontented at having to drive out on a wet day.

The drivers refused to turn out. What happened? Every one of them w'as sent to gaol, with a long term of imprisonment.",40
123,Mr STORRER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"They were regulars.  regulars and volunteers is the same, and if a volunteer breaks it he is just as liable to imprisonment as is a member of the regular forces. I am unable to say what object the honourable member has in view, so far as his inquiry in reference to the visit paid to Tasmania' by the General Officer Commanding .is concerned; but he is quite within his rights in asking that the return be furnished. The honourable member for Wentworth suggested that the honourable member might have secured the information he desires as to the length of Major-General Hutton's stay in Tasmania, by telephoning to the Steam-ship Company; but it seems tto me that it would be infra dig for an honourable member to resortto any such source of information. Wh^ should he spy round the shipping offices?",40
124,Mr HUTCHISON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Ha d he done so wouid have acted practically as a private detective - . correspondence,  ing Orders the honourable member is entitled to secure this information, and no exception can be taken to his action. Complaint is made of the action of the General Officer Commanding in taking his prderlv with him. But every officer in the British Army is allowed two men-on e to act as groom, and the other as a valet. He takes those men with him wherever he goes on duty and the British Government bear his living as well as his travelling expenses while he is so engaged. It may well be said that we are becoming very niggardly if we refuse to allow the General Officer Commanding to have even one servant in attendance on him when he is travelling from place to place in the performance of his duties. I was surprised at the interjection made some minutes ago by the honourable member for Corio. As a military man, he must know thateven the officers of volunteer regiments are each allowed a batman to polish their swords, and keep their buttons burnished. Surely the honourable and learned member would allow, the General Officer Commanding at least the privileges that are accorded to alieutenant in a volunteer force ? Last year I moved for a return showing the expenses incurred by Major-General Hutton and his staff in connection with his northern tour-inclusiv e of the trip to New Guinea-and was astounded by the information that I obtained. The amount paid to Major-General Hutton was exceedingly small, and I had to admit that I had discovered a mare's nest. . Mr WILLIS - What did the trip cost?  I was under the impression that it had involved an outlay approximating to £ 5 , 0 0 0. When the return was furnished, I at once saw that I was on the wrong track, and allowed the matter to rest. My opinion of Major-General Hutton is such that I feel satisfied that he would not take £ 1 from the Commonwealth if he was not justly entitled to receive it. In this respect. I also believe that mv honourable friend, the member for Melbourne, is on the wrong track. As to the appointment of a private secretary, I would ask honourable members whether they do not consider that the General Officer Commanding, who has to control the-Military Forces of the Commonwealth in no less than six States, is. entitled to the services of such he an officer. Could he be expected to personally attend to. all his voluminous official and to take notes of the many interviews which he has to hold. Whenever he visits Queensland, he invariably has long interviews with officers and others, and whether we believe in his system or not, we must all admit that his heart is in the work His intentions are undoubtedly good; and I believe that in ability he is second to none. The fact remains, however, that just as honourable members opposite consider that members of the Labour Party would administer the affairs of the Commonwealth in a curious manner, so many persons entertain the opinion that the General Officer Commanding has a peculiar way of giving effect to his views and schemes. We must, nevertheless, give him credit for honesty of purpose, although, perhaps, the honourable member for Robertcuring son mav not do so.",40
125,Mr WILLIS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I have not said anything.  thinks a lot. So far as the Major-General's private secretary is concerned, I do not think that greater efficiency would be cured by the abolition of that office. I required the information which the able member for Melbourne seeks, T should have inquired from the Minister of Defence whether it was available to me as a private member. The Minister would, doubtless, have fenced a little",41
126,Mr CHAPMAN,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"He certainly would have done that.  have done so; but I should have parried, and eventually obtained the information. When I first asked for information relatI ing to Major-General Hutton's northern tour of inspection, I was informed that was not available - I persisted, however, visiting the offices of the Defence ment day after clay, with the result that . secured the information piece by piece, by the time the Estimates were ready for consideration I was in possession of all facts. As soon as I discovered that everyimputation. thing was fair and above board, I was satismotion. fied. I would point out to the honourable member for Melbourne that the travelling expenses are fixed by regulation, and be exceeded. The accounts are audited by the Audit Department, and vouchers to be forthcoming in respect of every for allowances. If an honourable member queried any item of expenditure the Treasurer invariably went to great trouble to ascertain whether there was any ground for objecting to it. I am sure that the present Treasurer will take up a similar position, ancl, although the honourable ber for Melbourne is not exceeding his, privileges in asking for this return, I satisfied that when it is furnished he find, as I did in connection with my request for the return relating to the northern of inspection,. that he has been "" barking up the wrong tree.""",41
127,Mr BROWN,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," The objecthe tion raised by the right honourable for Swan to the-passing of this motion given me considerable surprise. The honourable member for Melbourne apparat ently desires to secure certain information, for which he is entitled to ask, and it would seem that he can secure it in no other way. I do not know whether the honourable member for Maranoa has succeeded in seinformation of this kind by personal application to the Department, but he will admit that we all do not possess his degree of persistency. The Defence Department expenditure is very heavy, and the Estimates are so drawn up that it is often imsepossible to secure specific information in Had regard to'any particular item. The honorhonorable member for Swan has placed a certain interpretation on the action of the honourable member for Melbourne in submitting this motion. If there is anything in his remarks which amount to an imputation against the General, it is to the interest of the officer concerned that the information not desired by the honourable member for Melbourne should be made public. Personally, I do not entertain any suspicion of wrongdoing on the part of the General, or of the members of his Head-Quarters Staff, nor do think that such a suspicion has crossed the minds of any considerable number of it honourable members. But after the suggesin tion made by the right honourable member Departfor Swan, who' was himself for a time. I Minister of Defence, the motion should be until passed, so that the House may be put into our possession of all information, and it may the be seen what justification there is for the Therefore, I shall support the",41
128,Mr CHAPMAN,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," I see cannot no reason why the information asked for should not be given, though it is difficult to have understand why the honourable member for claim Melbourne has moved a motion, instead of placing a question upon the notice-paper, late because every honourable member is well within his rights in asking for information such as this. I shall support the motion. If I thought that the honourable member for Melbourne imputed misconduct to the. memMajor-General Commanding, I should have to consider the matter more fully; but I am see nothing in the motion which leads me to will believe that he has any such intention. General Hutton is too well known for any tour member of the House to harbour the suspicion that he would be guilty, of wrongdoing in connection with the expenditure of public money intrusted to him. The member honourable member for Maranoa spoke of has the difference between the travelling, expenses of officers who might all have to stay the same hotel; but I would point out. that the military travelling allowances are provided for by regulation. They bear a certain relation to the salaries paid, and are as far as possible identical with the scale of travelling allowances sanctioned by the Public Service Board. seems to me as good an arrangement as can be made. In reply to the cavilling at the amount of money spent by the Military Department generally for travelling expenses, I would ask the House to remember that that branch of the service has of late been in a state of flux, or change, and a considerable amount of travelling has had to be done in connection with the re-arrangement of positions which has been necessary. The Major-General Commanding receives for his expenses a fixed sum. We, who know something about military matters, know that, although the right honorabr member for Swan did not, perhaps, clear.v express his opinion, what he intended to convey was that it is a cheering sign to hai'e at the head of our Military Forces an energetic man like General Hutton, who is always flitting about the various the Commonwealth. It cannot be very pleasurable to General Hutton to rush from State to State, as he does, in all"" weathers and at all times, and no one would accuse him of travelling in order to save money out of his allowance. I take it that it is very necessary that he should move round as he does. Whatever accusations may be levelled against him, he cannot l-e charged with not being energetic enough. Something has been said about his action in Tasmania. It is hardly in order to ref jr to the subject on the motion under discussion, but I should like to say that I look upon the action taken in that case as the turning point in the history of Commonwealth Defence administration. occurred in Tasmania was in the nature of a military strike. of us strongly favour the building up of a citizen soldiery. But we must have discipline even where citizen soldiers are concerned, and it is a good thing that on the occasion to which I refer we had a commanding officer who was not afraid to act. Persons who have forgotten more about military matters than I ever knew, have spoken very highly about General Hutton's action on that occasion. He knew that whenever large bodies of citizens are concerned, attempts are made to bring political influence to bear, and it is a cheering thing to remember that he was not afraid to make the recommendation which he did. He knew that Mr Chapman. he would have to face hostile criticism, and that he might be blamed in this or the Other House, but, nevertheless, he did his duty. I myself have on many occasions felt bound That to differ from General Hutton, and to express my views plainly ih this Chamber; but I owe it to myself and to the country, whenever a public oflicer with whom I am acquainted or have come into contact is unjustly censured, to say frankly what I know about the facts of the case. With regard to what has been said about carrying servants and private secretaries about the country-as we all know, officers of high standing are accustomed to take with them certain attendants. In my opinion there should be a line drawn between servants and messengers. It is quite a different thing for the General to take a servant and for the Prime Minister to take a messenger about with him. But I hold that if a high military officer claims a right to take with him a private secretary and an orderly, it is for the Minister in charge of the DeStates of fence Department to say when the bounds are overstepped. Members of Parliament cannot go into these details. I take it that the honourable membei for Melbourne wishes to elicit information, so that when the Estimates come be- . fore us for discussion, he will be able to say whether the lump sum asked for is too much. I hold a strong opinion in regard to travelling expenses. I believe that in many ways a saving could be made in this expenditure; but, as I have pointed out, a good deal of it has been unavoidable, because of the changes which have been in process. Now that these changes have been made, and men are settled in positions where they will probably remain for some considerWhat able time, the travelling expenditure of the Department should be reduced. Most Mr HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) - I do not for a ""moment suppose that Major General Hutton has drawn, sixpence more than the amount to which he is entitled for travelling expenses, and I do not think that the honourable member for Melbourne suggests that he has.",41
129,Mr MALONEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I do not suggest it. nor do I think it.,42
130,Mr HUTCHISON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The right honourable member for Swan and' the honourable member for Wentworth would be among the first to resent any dictation in regard to notices of motion. Every honourable member has a right to place upon the business-paper any notice of motion - If it is not in order, he will be told so by the proper authority; but if it is in order, no other honourable member has a right to object to it on the ground of form. The taxpayers are entitled to know what any and every depart-ment of Government costs. I myself am anxious to obtain the information for which the honourable member for Melbourne asks, because I wish to know how the travelling allowances granted to military omcers compare with those given to travelling letter sorters, who receive 2 s. 8d. per clay. The right honourable member for Swan spoke of an officer getting £ 2 a day. I do not say whether that is too much or too little, though to me it appears a very generous amount. What I am anxious to see is that justice is done to lower paid officials, such as the travelling letter-sorters to whom I have referred. In many small towns there are' only one or two hotels, where every person stopping has to put up. gone round the country with Royal' Commissions, and have found that we w-ere' charged no more than ordinary visitors. If a Railway Commissioner is stopping in the same town as a letter-sorter, although the one may be getting £ 1 or £ 2 a day as travelling allowance, and the other 2s. 8d., they may both have to stay at the same hotel and pay the same charges. I shall support the motion.",42
131,Mr MALONEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," I assure honourable members that I have nothing to hide. in connection with the motion. I desire to procure certain information, and I have taken a course which a great deal of experience in the Victorian Legislature makes me think necessary. At the present time no one knows what the Militarv Commandant of Victoria receives in travelling expenses. Although I hada pledge from the late Treasurer of the Commonwealth, when he was Premier of Victoria, that he would give me similar State information, I never got it. The general who commands 250.000 Switzers in time of war gets only £.2 per day. Personally, I have nothing against Major-General Hutton. I do not know this gentleman, and I have yet to learn to take a dislike to a human being whom I have never met. I should like, through the press if possible, to assure this gentleman that I have no animus against him. I hold that,_ in. my position as a member of this House, I have a right to demand this information so that the public, who have to provide these large' sums, may know exact!v how much is spent in this direction. ' I thank honourable members for the courteous way in which the debate has been conducted. Amendment agreed to. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT: PAPER. Debate resumed from 25th May (vide page 1584), on motion by Mr WATSONThat the letter from the Secretary of State for the Colonies regarding the use of the title of "" Honourable"" by members of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia be printed.",43
132,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," Wit h the exception of my leader, the honourable and learned member - for Ballarat, no member of the party to which I belong has spoken during this debate. As the debate appears to be coming fo a close, and, seeing I have that I am now free from all Ministerial obligations, I do not feel justified in remaining silent in regard to so important a matter as the transfer of the administration from the party with which I am associated to what is known in this House as the Labour Party. I should like to say, at the beginning, in view of the misstatements or misrepresentations as tb the political leanings or proclivities of members of this House, that I am now, and always have been during my political life, a protectionist. It ought not to be necessary for me to make such an avowal, but the circumstances render it necessary. I do not know whether the misrepresentation is intentional, and I am quite willing to admit for the sake of argument that it is quite unintentional. I have called myself, though no one else has so called me, a moderate protectionist; and during the twenty-one years in which I have been engaged in legislative work in Western Australia and in the Commonwealth Parliament, I have never changed my views. Since the inauguration of the Commonwealth I have, as honourable members know, served under two leaders, both representing what is called the Protectionist Party-firs t Sir Edmund Barton, and, more recently, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, Mr Deakin. Three years have passed away, and, being now relieved of Ministerial responsibility, I am quite free to say that I have always been a very open and candid colleague. I have never hesitated to express my opinions, which arc well known to both the gentlemen I have mentioned, and, to a smaller extent, to all my colleagues. I may tell honourable members, that both these gentlemen are now my personal, as well political, friends, to a greater extent than they ever were before. That utterance should, I think, dispel any idea that during our association we did not work together with the greatest harmony and friendship. It would be impossible for me to say that every measure introduced by the Administrations to which I belonged, met with my approval; and the members of the present Government, when they have had longer Ministerial experience, will find that they have to submit to much with which they are not altgether in accord. It must be a matter of real ancl vital importance to a Minister's principles and conscience, fore he takes such an important step in politics as to dissociate himself from those with whom he has been working. To take that course involves greater responsibility than may be imagined by those who"" have not had to take it into consideration. In such circumstances, a Minister has to consider, not only his leaving his colleaguesthat would be painful enough-bu the has also to consider where he is going, and with whom he is going to associate. Therefore it is very seldom in the political history of our country, or of any country within the British Empire, that we find men associated in a Government finding it necessary to separate from one another. I should like also to say that I have always had the fullest confidence of the two leaders under whom I served in the Commonwealth Government; nothing was ever kept back from me. Whether I agreed or disagreed with them, I always had, as I say, the fullest confidence of those two gentlemen, under whom I am proud to have served. I wish to repeat, that to-night I am free from Ministerial responsibility. I owe no allegiance whatever, which, in my opinionI say my opinion, and not the opinion of other people-is inconsistent with my duty to my constituents and my conscience. On me there is exerted no pressure, either from outside or from any inside caucus of any political party-n o pressure from a few individuals, who, meeting almost in secret, and calling themselves a labour council, may seek to bind me. Can honourable members opposite say the same?",43
133,Mr CARPENTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Undoubtedly .,44
134,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Honourable ago members opposite have to reckon not only with an outside caucus, but with a caucus inside. as my Mr CARPENTER - Th a right honourable gentleman is wrong.",44
135,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"We are always said to be wrong in making that statement, but the printed documents of the Labour Party show that we are quite right.",44
136,Mr BAMFORD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Does the right honourable gentleman not think that one caucus is quite enough for any reasonable man ?,44
137,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If I do not vote to-night, or tomorrow, as my friends beside me think I ought to vote, I am not liable to be called opprobrious names, such as ""blackleg"" or ""scab."" I do not know the meaning of the latter term, but I have be- heard it used. I am not exposed to these opprobrious names if I exercise my own judgment and vote as I like. On the contrary, I feel that I am at liberty to vote in a way that will commend itself to my constituents and to my own conscience.",44
138,Mr HUTCHISON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The right honourable and learned member for Adelaide had to leave the Barton Government.,44
139,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I shall refer ro the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide by-and-by. I - desire, in what I have to say, to be very frank. It is my desire also, as it has been, throughout my' political life, not to exhibit any personal feeling. I wish it to be thoroughly understood that I have no personal feeling against honourable members, opposite, and I am urged only by a* sense of public duty to say what I shall say. We have worked together as friends for over three years, and though I may in some of my remarks upon honourable' members opposite be severe, I hope that what I shall say will not interfere with our friendship in the future.",44
140,Mr CARPENTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"So long as it is the truth, we shall not mind.",44
141,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I remind the honourable member that the truth is not always told in a courteous way, but I desire to be courteous, though there may be some difference of opinion on the point before I shall have done. A little incident happened yesterday, which shows how one may be misrepresented. I had noticed in certain newspapers a reference to remarks which were made by the present Minister of Defence. I thought the remarks were very improper, and not such as should have been made by a public man, whether years or at the present time. I gave notice of a question dealing with the subject, and I find that the honourable gentleman has written and stated that I am suffering isome pique or disappointment on being relieved of the duties of my office as a Minister. If that is the spirit in which a simple question is to be received, I cannot help it. I believe that I was the honourable gentleman's best friend, if he only knew it, because there was Ian absolutely easy and satisfactory answer to the question I submitted, and the answer which I should have given if I had been in his unenviable position. If I had made any statement at a previous period of my life which was not justified, or which was not creditable to me, I should have said in answer to such a question- "" It is perfectly true that I made the statement, and I very much regret it."" If the present Minister of Defence had adopted that course, the incident would have closed to his advantage. When a man has made statements which are not of a creditable character, concerning our public institutions, or public men, he is not entitled to expect, when he enters this Parliament, that he will be shielded, and will not be asked what he meant. I have little doubt that the action which I took in this matter will do good. It will show our public men that they must be guarded in what they say. No man is justified in designating people who are trying to do their duty, and who are doing the bravest thing whicn men can do when they leave their homes ancl kindred to fight for their country in a distant land, incurring all the disadvantages attending that .action, as bucklers,"" ""cowards,"" ""curs,"" or ""dogs."" I think lhat the action I have taken will afford the Minister of Defence the best lesson which the honourable gentleman could receive; it will be good for him and for the community generally. I leave the matter now, and add only that personally the honourable gentleman and I have always been good friends, and I regret to have to say anything that reflects upon him",44
142,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"He is a good friend to the railway, too.",45
143,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"That only goes to show how very unreasonable it is to suggest that, in the course I took, I was actuated by anything but what I considered my duty. We have heard excellent speeches from the honourable and learned member forBallarat and the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney. If anything were necessary to show that either of those gentlemen is fully qualified to lead any party in this country, those speeches gave proof that they are specially well fitted for such a task. It is no doubt to the credit of those honourable gentlemen; but they appeared to me to be a little too complimentary. In my opinion, the Opposition should never say anything very complimentary about the Government, but should find fault with them if they do wrong. If they do right, the Opposition should say, ""That is just what you ought to have done; you have done your duty; "" but if the Government does wrong, the Opposition should hold them to account for it. I do not think it was necessary for those who had just been dispossessed of their positions to pay compliments to those who had turned them out of office. What has occurred serves to show the kindly dispositions of those two honourable gentlemen, and, perhaps, how very superior they are in that regard to what I think I should have been under similar circumstances. I cannot forecast the future; time will tell what is to take place; but I do not look upon the present as a time of political peace. It is, in my opinion, a time of political war. What are the facts? We on this side have been vanquished; honourable members opposite are the victors, and they have taken possession of the spoils.",45
144,Mr HUTCHISON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,That is the grievance,45
145,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The honourable member has spoilt my joke by saying "" That is the grievance."" I can assure the honourable member that the loss of the "" spoils"" is not a grievance with me. ""'swash- Some of the pleasantest days I have spent since I entered this Parliament have been those which I have spent in opposition. My circle of acquaintance has been largely extended. Persons upon whom I had looked rather askance during the last two or three years are, I now find, really excellent men, with whom I can fraternize, and enjoy myself. Instead of restricting my parliamentary circle of acquaintance, I - have enlarged it in the last few days, and I can assure honourable members that the experience has been agreeable.",45
146,Mr BAMFORD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The right honourable member has only to join us to still further enlarge it.,45
147,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"When I hear what the terms are, I shall see about that. I may say, at once, that I am ouite in accord with the action recently taken by my honourable and learned friend and leader, the honourable member for Ballarat, and with the expressions he has used in the memoranda which have been made public. I am in accord with him when he agrees with the right hort: orable and learned member for East Syd. neyThat the existence of three parties in the Federal Legislature of nearly equal strength has thrown public affairs into confusion, makes parliamentary government on constitutional lines impossible, and calls for some, immediate remedy. These words give expression to an opinion which I have held for some time, and it is gratifying to me to find the honourable ancl learned member for Ballarat and the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney holding exactly the opinion which I have previously held and expressed on several occasions'. I am in accord with those honourable gentlemen - also when they say thatUnfortunately, the party now in power, quite apart from any question relating to its programme, maintains control of its minority by its majority. I agree with that statement absolutely.",45
148,Mr CARPENTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Does the right honourable member think that the minority should rule?,46
149,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I like a little freedom. I wish to make myself perfectly clear. I expect some time, and I shall frequently make use of the term ""Labour Party."" I do not want to be misrepresented. Therefore, I should like to explain exactly what I mean when I use that term. the organized labour unions of this country, which, in my opinion, dominate the present Government.",46
150,Mr CARPENTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The right honourable gentleman is starting with a false defini-tion.,46
151,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Ver y likely, according to the view of the honourable member; but I think that I am justified in my definition. The honourable member may think otherwise. He may be like the schoolmaster mentioned by Goldsmith, who could still argue even when he was vanquished. When I speak of the Labour Party I refer to the organized labour unions which, in my. opinion, dominate the present Government. mean the rest-the large majority-of the workers and toilers of this country. Let that be thoroughly understood. - that almost every one of us, myself amongst the number, is to be included within this latter category. I am as much a representative of the workers and toilers of this country as is any other honourable member. I am as much a toiler myself as is any labour representative. I have been a worker and a toiler all my life. I worked with my hands in my early days, and I have been a toiler ever since. I do not want any question to be raised as to what I mean, or to leave the slightest opening for the misrepresentation that in speaking of the Labour Party I refer to the whole of the workers and toilers of Australia. We are all industrious people. The maiority of our citizens, if not labouring now, have worked in clays gone by. With very few exceptions our fathers came here, not as the inheritors of wealth, but in order to establish homes ancl better - their condition in this new country. Therefore, we are all toilers and workers. I again reiterate that when I speak of the Labour Party I mean only the organized labour unions, which, in my opinion, dominate the present Government. '",46
152,Mr HUTCHISON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,They do not wholly constitute the Labour Partv.,46
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"It has been stated over and over again by honourable member's-by the Attorney-General and by the Minister of External Affairs, and by others, in the press and out of it-that the Government policy, as set forith by the Prime Minister, is identical with that of the to occupy late Government. That may be true so far as the headings of their proposals are concerned ; but I have yet to learn that the heading of a Bill is any indication of its contents in detail. I refer to Mr HIGGINS - The right honourable member intends to convey that we mean what we say, and that some other Governments do not.",46
154,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I do not mean anything of the sort. If our policy was identical with that put forward by the present Ministry, why did we leave the Treasury benches? If the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill introduced by the present Government is the same as that brought forward by us, why did we resign ?",46
155,Mr HIGGINS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Hear , hear. It was wrong for the Government to resign.",46
156,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"T h at is a matter of opinion. I believe that we did I do not right.' Were we, as a Government, in favour of placing State public servants under Commonwealth control ? Have we changed I believe our opinions since we came over to this side of the House ? Do we not think as strongly today as when we resigned, that the action of the Labour Party, and those who assisted them, in so amending the Bill as to bring the public servants of the States within its scope, is hot warranted by the terms of the Constitution?",46
157,Mr CHAPMAN,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,That is not a vital question now.,47
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,It was a vital question with the late Government. But what is sauce for the goose may not be sauce for the gander.,47
159,Mr HIGGINS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Who is the goose?,47
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I will come to the honourable and learned member directly, and give him a little sauce. We still think that the provision inserted by the Labour Party is unconstitutional. If the High Court should decide against us on that point, we should hold that it is inexpedient under existing conditions for the Commonwealth to exercise any .control over the public servants of the States. We contend, further, that never in his wildest dreams did the honourable the Attorney General, who proposed at the Convention the sub-section of the Constitution relating to conciliation and arbitration, ever imagine that it would be construed in such a manner as to confer upon the Commonwealth power to exercise control over the public servants of the States. Moreover, we hold that such a provision would strike at the very root of the Federation and the autonomy of the States. We said that before we resigned, and we say it now. In spite of this, however, it is stated in the press, and in this House, that the policy of the present Government is the same as ours. Our policy is the very. opposite of that put forward' by the present Government. It differs from it in the fundamental principle involved in the amendment proposed to be inserted in the Bill by the present Government. It is not only with the platform of the Government and the party behind it for this session that we have to deal. We know all about their programme, because, as they have so often boasted, they have published it in books and newspapers all over the country. There is a little difference here and there between the platforms adopted by the State labour leagues. The Victorian platform is, perhaps, a little wider than some of the others, but none of them are less wide than the platform of the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party. It is not their programme for the present session alone with which we are concerned. We might be able to wriggle through if that were all. Are we children ?. Are we goingto approve of a little bit of a programme because it is somewhat in accord with the views of some honourable members on this side of the r House ? The members of the late Government are absolutely opposed to the labour programme. We went out of office because we regarded their proposals with regard to the public servants of the States as unconstitutional. We sacrificed not only the emoluments of office, which are so frequently mentioned, but we forfeited something that was of much greater importance, namely, the control of the affairs of the Commonwealth. When any one talks about our being hurled from office, I hope that he will not suppose that the loss of the salary attached to the office is the important matter. It may be very convenient to receive such a salary-bu t the loss of the emoluments attached to the office sinks into absolute insignificance when compared with the surrender of the control of the affairs of this great Commonwealth. Surely it must be conceded that there must have been very strong reasons and influences actuating us, or we would not have resigned. I am dpposed to the platform and the methods of the Labour Party. I am opposed to the domination of any class, irrespective of whether they are members of labour unions or otherwise. The question has been asked over and over again, "" Why not give the Labour Party a fair trial ?"" I think that is a most unreasonable proposition. What is a fair trial ?",47

There was a £500 freehold property qualification when I went into office. I gave manhood and womanhood suffrage.

It is practically the same Act that we have in force in the Commonwealth-and was based on what was called the "" Natal Act.""

There has always been a difficulty in dealing with the question, and that difficulty I am sure is recognised by every one in this House, and every one in the Colony who takes a reasonable and moderate view of the question, and has any regard to the responsibility which attaches to dealing with the question. Then I went on to comment on what Mr. Chamberlain had said at the 1897 Conference in London about the matter, and pointed out that he had told us thatHer Majesty's Government have every expectation that the natural desire of the Colonies to protect themselves against an overwhelming influx of Asiatics can be attained, without placing a stigma upon any of Her Majesty's subjects on the sole ground of race or colour. I concluded what I had to say in moving the second reading of the measure-whic h was subsequently passed through both Houses of Parliament-by sayingThe position is a difficult one; but I think that the wise words which I have read from Mr. Chamberlain cover the whole ground; and he has not hesitated for a moment to say that it is our duty and privilege to try to keep ourselves as free as we can from the disadvantages which would follow the ingress of persons alien in colour, in sympathy, and in civilization, to our own countrymen. He has not hesitated to say that it is'our duty to try to protect ourselves as far as we can from those influences. Honourable members will, therefore, see that so long ago as 1897, I introduced a measure on these lines. And it has worked exceedingly well. It was, I think, administered faithfully and fairly, and there has been no objection to it by any large section of the community. Besides the Immigration Act, I introduced and carried through Parliament a Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It was the first measure of its kind in Australia, if we except the South Australian Act, which has - never proved to be of any use. I can say this, without any egotism-that if I had not supported that Act, it could not have been passed at that time. I also passed a PayI ment of Members Act. I do not take all the credit for that, because I was' not at first in favour of it ; but certainly it could not have been passed without my assistance. I passed dozens of Bills that were beneficial and liberal in their character, but there is one other, the principle of which might be introduced in other States, which I may mention. I introduced a Biil in 1894- I think that was the date-givin g to any man in Western Australia, whether he had recently come in as an immigrant, or was previously settled there, 160 acres of land, on condition that he would go arid the Cololive upon it. The land was given free; all that the settler had to do was to make some improvements upon it. Not only did we give the land free, but the Government lent money at a low rate, and on the easiest terms to improve it. I also passed through Parliament another Act, which is not, I think, in force to any great extent in any other State; that is, a Truck Act, which makes it obligatory on employers to pay their employees in cash, and not in stores. I passed many other Acts of a similarly liberal and progressive-character. But, sir, the point of the whole matter is this: There was no Labour Party in the Western Australian Parliament at that time. Honourable members who knew Western Australia in those days are aware that there was no body of men of that party sitting behind me, and urging me to pass such legislation. There was no. sword of Damocles hanging over my head.",48
176,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The right honourable member did not give them a chance to get into Parliament; they were in the country, and he knew that they were coming.",49
177,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The Postmaster-General was one of those discontented people at that time.,49
178,Mr THOMAS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,He urged the right honourable member on from outside.,49
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"He did, and I give him all credit for it. He and others stirred up these questions outside Parliament. Of course, I do not suppose that everything which occurred would have occurred if there had been no public representations. Probably I should not have moved in some of these matters except for outside influences. But there were public demands, and I was liberal enough to give effect to them. There was, as I have said, no payment of members in Western Australia at that time, nor was there a Labour Party in Parliament; but, nevertheless, these Acts were passed into law at the instance of your humble servant, sir, this Conservative member. These facts cannot be gainsaid. I am quite content, whatever a section of the press of this State may say in regard to me, Or to my political views, or as to my being out of sympathy with the toilers of the Commonwealth, to be judged by what - I done. I say to them, as I say to honourable members here-let my works bear evidence for or against me. I am sorry to intrude personal matters into this debate. I have been reluctant to say these things, but I feel it is necessary to speak of my personal acts-in the interests of myself and. of the State I represent.",49
180,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The right honourable member also voted in the Convention for the provision with regard to old-age pensions.,50
181,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Yes , I voted for that, and am very glad to have done But with regard to the provision of stitution as to conciliation and arbitration, I had known that it was to be used as it nowattempted to be used, I should not have voted for it. I must have had over the glamour of the eloquence of my honornised able and learned friend, the AttorneyGovernment General, so that I either became stupefied, or was hoodwinked, or I would not have voted for that provision. voted for it, i.t would not have been inserted in the Constitution.",50
182,Mr HIGGINS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The right honourable office, member is quite correct.",50
183,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I admit that I have sinned, and sinned grievously. is all very well for the honourable and learned member to smile, but the House he is associated. knows that I and every other member of the Convention never understood or even imagined the use which would be attempted had to be made of this provision. If I and other members of the Convention had imathing gined that it would be used as it is now posed to use it , it would have been ignothe miniously rejected.",50
184,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The right honourable member's Government introduced an Arbifrom tration Bill in the Western Australian Legislature.,50
185,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The States being autonomous are at liberty to deal as they please with their own employees and property; but we are asked to allow the Commonwealth to interfere with their employees and property. I - wish now to refer to some of the remarks made by the Minister of External Affairs a day or two ago. When addressing himself to this question, he assumed a very jaunty air, and appearing to be well pleased with himself, invited honourable members on this side of the House to "" come over."" He inhave vited us to go oyer to that ""land of Canaan,"" that land flowing with milk and honey, and to enjoy the good things which he had in store for us. He extended an open invitation, saying, in'effect, ""We shall be glad to see you over here; Ave shall do unto you almost, if not quite, as Ave shall do unto ourselves.""",50
186,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,It was a Christian invitation.,50
187,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The honourable and learned gentleman in extending that invitation to us, knew that the Government Avas in a minority, and that if he so. could only induce some of us by prothe Conmises of advantages of one kind or if other, although I do not for a moment sugis gest anything in the nature of monetary gain, to give them the support they so much me required, all would be well. He recogthat it would be a good thing for his if we crossed the floor, because Ave should thus give them a majority that would enable them to carry on the affairs If I had not of the CommonAvealth.",50
188,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Has the right honourable member's party a majority? Sir JOHN ' FORREST - I am not in but if we ever take office, as' I hope Ave shall, I trust that, if we haA'e not a majority, the honourable and learned gentleI t man will say as many hard things of us as I noAv intend to Say of the partu with which The invitation that he extended to us was an extraordinary one, coming as it did so soon after his party defeated us, ' and taken possession of the Treasury benches, and everyattaching to us as Ministers. I m promediately after his party has done all this Minister extends to us this invitation. "" Come over and join us,"" he says; "" come Over and help us to defeat those honourable members who have been in opposition to you the inception of the Parliament; you will put us in a constitutional position, which, unfortunately, Ave do not at present occupy."" Doubtless the honourable and learned gentleman meant us well, but he had "" an eye on the main, chance."" He invited us to forgetour defeat, and to join the ranks, or, rather, to enter the service - that, I think, is the better description of his invitationof the enemy. It might be possible for some members to do so by-and-by; but the honourable and learned gentleman is asking too much when he seeks our consent to such a proposal immediately after our defeat. The Minister made many promises, and one of them, was not a lapsus linguae-and doubtless it was-wa s not merely politically improper, but actually immoral. I refer to his promise that if the invitation were accepted we should not be opposed by the Labour Party at the next election. The inference was that we should be allowed to enjoy a walk-over, and thus remain in undisturbed possession of our seats in this House for the next five years. He offered us the security that we should enjoy, by acting as the tail, or, perhaps, in time, as a very small part of the body, of his party.",50
189,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,That was one of the proposals of the right honourable member's own party. It was one for each party .,51
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,But the Ministers' offer came too soon after,51
191,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,To o soon after that made by the right honourable member's party.,51
192,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"To o soon after our defeat. It was another case of-""Com e into my parlour, said the spider to the fly.""",51
193,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I invited only those who believe in our principles to join us; the right honourable member does not believe in them, and has never clone so.",51
194,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I certainly do not, and can quite understand that I was not considered eligible. so far as I , and many other honourable members on this side of the House, are concerned, even an offer of undisturbed possession of seats in this House for five years would have no effect upon us. Let the honourable member look after his own seat; we will look after ours. We are not going to be bribed.",51
195,Mr MCDONALD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,That is rubbing it j n .,51
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"In view bf the principles I profess, I , for one, should not be willing to kiss the hand that struck me a severe blow. I know that if I did, I should sooner or later receive another blow that would practically destroy me. Avery amusing reason has been given for the contention that we should support the present Government. An honourable mem-bef opposite, I think it was the Minister of Trade and Customs, urged that, as the Ministerial Party was in a minority-and they certainly are at present-the y could do no harm, and therefore we should support them. Has a more extraordinary claim for support ever been advanced by the representative of a Government intrusted with the administration of the affairs of any country ?",51
197,Mr KENNEDY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"They , at least, had a if it majority to oust the right honourable member and his colleagues from the Treasury benches.",51
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Surely Governments are not formed merely that they shall do no harm. Surely Ministers are created to accomplish good work, and in order to propose and carry out a policy under our system they must have a majority behind them.

199,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"T h at is what the government do not at .present possess, although the honourable and learned gentleman occupies the Ministerial chair at the table, and looks so complacent.",51
200,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Why does not the right ' honourable member turn us out ?,51
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,We have the statement of the Prime Minister himself that he has not a majority behind him. and I defy the honourable and learned gentleman to say that there is a majority in this House in favour of the Government.,51

204,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I shall dealpresently with that point. The honourable member is ever ready with what he very erroneously thinks ingenious and pithy interjections, and has a habit of making them at an inconvenient point in a member's speech; it invariably causes him for the moment to lose the thread of his argument. The Ministry cannot even control the House at the present time. I am somewhat amused when I hear honourable members opposite asserting, when it is proposed to adjourn the debate, as a condition that' it must be closed at a certain hour. They have not the power to enforce their will. They are absolutely in the hands of those who are opposed to them, and I advise them not to say that we must do this or that, until they are certain that they have a majority.",51
205,Mr EISHER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Is that the policy?,52
206,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,It is common sense.,52
207,Mr MCDONALD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Why does not the right honourable member move - a motion are opposed to him. which will have the effect of displacing the Government? Why is he not honest this matter?,52
208,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The time has not come for that yet. We could certainly displace the Government if we wished to party turn us out? do so.,52
209,Mr MCDONALD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The present situation is a public scandal.,52
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The entreaties of the Labour Party are so great, and their jority. endeavours to retain office so many, that one does not wish to hurry events. Nor do we desire to treat them in the least degree unfairly. As has been said, there is no doubting the fact that under they occupy the Ministerial benches, and that brings me to the constitutional point which I should like to discuss for few moments.

If the situathe tion is carefully analysed, it will be seen, I think, that the honourable member for Eland made a false move, in the interests of. both himself and his party, in accepting office.

I do not say that we were not at times saved from defeat by the votes of honourable members of one or other of the two remaining parties. That is not the point. My position is that we did not take office knowing that we had not a majority behind us. Sir Edmund Barton did not tell the Governor General that he was able to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth, knowing that he had not a majority behind him. His action was absolutely in accord with constitutional usage, whilst that of the honourable member for Bland was not.",52

222,Mr BATCHELOR,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"As a Minister in that Government the right honourable member was, in some measure, responsible.",53
223,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"When the honourable member for Boothby has held office as long as I have, he will find that a Minister has to concur in many acts which are . not altogether in accord with his wishes, but for which ""lie must accept responsibility. When one does not altogether approve of a thing, one generally says little about it. There is one thing, at any rate, which has been very evident during this crisis. I am sorry that the Attorney-General is not here, because I am about to refer to him, though I would prefer to say what I have to say to his face rather than behind his back.",53
224,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If the right honourable member will wait, we shall bring him in ",53
225,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"On e thing has been very evident during this crisis, and that is the readiness with which a few honourable members have changed their allegiance. If my inclinations had been in the direction of accepting the invitation of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, I think that I should have had some little compunction in doing so, unless my late colleagues had consented to go with me. I should not have been inclined, I think, to go over to the other party in the hour of our defeat, and leave my friends behind me, on a matter of this sort. There is a certain animal which is notorious, I believe, for leaving a sinking ship. No one likes to be accused of doing that, I am sure. But we have seen that thing done lately, and the desertion of his leader by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, now Attorney-General, is a good example.",53
226,Mr KENNEDY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Oh ! no; he voted with the party that put out the late Government.,53
227,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I am much obliged to the honourable member, but if he will leave me alone I shall get along much better. The conduct of the Attorney General, I submit, affords a good example of the desertion of a party in the way I have mentioned. I refer to this matter, not on any personal ground, but only on a public ground, because, personally, the honourable and learned gentleman and I are good friends. I am determined to say what I feel. I I was not mention his action in this matter, the more readily as I have always expected him to set a high standard of political morality for all of us to emulate.",53
228,Mr KENNEDY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Her e he is.,53
229,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I am speaking about the action of the Attorney-General in changing his allegiance from the party to which I belong, and going over to the ranks of the enemy, politically speaking.",53
230,Mr HIGGINS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I voted in the same way last year as I voted this vear.,53
231,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"That is not the point I am making. I do not wish to say anything which is offensive or unfriendly, but I have a public duty to perform. I mention this matter the more readily, because I have always looked to my honourable and learned friend to set up what I consider a high standard for us to follow. I need hardly say that I am very disappointed with the action that he felt it his duty to take. Of course, I am aware that he voted with the Labour Party on clause 3 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, both last session and this session. But I take it that because a vote I give is not in accord with the policy of those whom I am associated with, I do not cut myself off by that act from them. At any rate, if I do, I must give reasons for my action. I think that the people of this country, and those persons who have been associated with any honourable member, have a right to expect him to give some' reason why he takes a course of that kind. The Attorney-General voted against his party on a division, which caused the resignation of the Government. He then took ciffice with those who had defeated us with his assistance. When he spoke in the House, he did not explain the reasons why he had deserted his leader and taken office with other party. AVe know that he voted against us, and that he had voted in the same way last session, in accord with his convictions. In my opinion, he - acted honourably and properly in that matter. But he did not do what I think we were entitled to expect him to do. gave us no explanation of the reason why he, having helped to defeat his own leader and his own party, accepted office from those with whom he voted, and with whom he had not been allied previously.",53
232,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The idea of a man taking office simply because he agrees with other men's principles is simply disgusting, I think !",54
233,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"When the Attorney-General spoke in the House the other evening, he had an opportunity to give, and I suppose that every one here expected that he would give, the reasons why he felt justi- denial. fied in accepting office with the party that had defeated the party to which he had hitherto belonged. I must say that he made a very poor speech-the worse that I have ever heard him make-and he seemed very unhappy. I do not wonder that he was very unhappy, but notwithstanding that fact, he told us none of the reasons why he had parted from his old friends and joined those who had defeated them.",54
234,Mr HIGGINS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Were the reasons plentiful as blackberries, I should not give them under compulsion to the right honourable member.",54
235,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The honourable and learned gentleman has always had the credit of being very outspoken and very reasonable. I have heard him say in the House-and I know that he has made the statement many times, on anxious occasions, when a vote was about to be taken, and the life of the Government was at stake- "" If you will only assure me that this is vital to the Government, notwithstanding my personal views, I shall support you.""",54
236,Mr GROOM,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Was this said in a private conversation to the right honourable member ?,54
237,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"No ; it was said openly in the House. If the Attorney-General wishes to plead, let him speak for himself. The learned King's counsel is here, and he does not, 1 should think, want the assistance of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs in this matter. If I am mistaken, he can correct me. He has always taken that high stand- a stand which really did him the utmost credit, because a man owes the allegiance to the party that he is associated with, as much as to the pledges that he gave on the hustings. There are some honourable members who seem to think that a pledge on a detail of a Bill, sometimes on a great principle of a Bill, is of greater importance than a pledge that if elected he He will range himself under the banner of a leader. If they had not ranged themselves under that banner, they would probably not have got a seat in the House to give a vote on any matter. The other night the honourable and learned member for West Sydney told us all sorts of things about the right honourable member for East Sydney, but he forgot to tell us that, as I am informed, he asked to be allowed to fight under the banner of the right honourable member at the last election.",54
238,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I distinctly deny that.,54

244,Mr HIGGINS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,That is a mistake; I did not say that.,54
245,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,All I can sayis that I have heard the honourable and learned member say so.,54

247,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I did not say that the honourable and learned member had said so in regard to the question then under discussion, but that he had said so in regard to other questions.

263,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Is the ship of the right honourable member for Swan in difficulties,55
264,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"No ; it is sailing smoothly along, ancl I am quite happy. I should like to say a word in regard to the Arbitration Bill, which the Government have put in the forefront of their policy. No one can say truthfully that I am out of sympathy with the principle of arbitration, seeing that, as I have already said, I introduced a similar measure in Western Australia. It is true that the Bill was clamoured for by the labour unions in the western State; and there are at present in the Senate members who accompanied a deputation this which urged me to introduce the measure. is I had introduced a Bill the previous session, it was impossible to pass it, owing to want of time. The next session I once more introduced it, and was desirous of seeing it passed into law, if time would permit. The Labour unions were very anxious in the for by matter, and I was told at the time by .Senator de Largie in the presence of several of his friends, who came to me on a depuon the subject- "" If you pass this Bill it will be the first of the kind in Australia, . the and you will raise a monument for yourself, and will earn the love and respect of the usual working classes, not only of the present his generation, but of future generations.""",55
265,Mr JOHNSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"They knew how to pile benches while he on the ""jam "" !",55
266,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,They did.,55
267,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Did that utterance affect the right honourable gentleman?,55
268,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"It is not unthe pleasant to hear such things. There is no sound so sweet as praise, especially in a good cause; it is good to hear that you in have the goodopinion of your fellows. I had told the advocates of the measure that they withwould have to keep the Opposition in order, joined and they carried out their promise to do so. The Government had a strong majority,, but there was opposition and obstruction.",55
269,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,That is how we regardI the the opposition to the present measure.,56
270,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The Bill was\ passed. Not long after, however, it was stated by another gentleman, who is now this ? a member of the Senate, and was present when Senator de Largie made his speech, that the Labour unions or the labouring classes owed me nothing in regard honourable to that measure. I was disappointed, but measure in gentleman I had to submit. I was satisfied that I had done my duty, and placed what I thought to be a good Act on the statute-book, a> view to prevent strikes. If there thing which I abominate more than another, it is that people should strike, and, by so doing, inflict much injury upon one another. I mention these facts to show that, as Minister who introduced the first real sure of the kind in Australia, I am in favour of the principles of arbitration. But sometime has now elapsed, and I recognise that compulsory arbitration is on its country, both in regard to capital and labour. The provisions of the Acts in force, which were intended to cultivate good relations between employers and employed, are, ferent. I think, in danger of being run to death. I am not singular in that opinion. That great democrat, my friend, Mr Seddon, Prime Minister of New Zealand, has expressed the same opinion, and has warned Justice the trades unions of that Colony, with own whom he is in great sympathy, as he has been for years, that they must be management careful, in the administration of the Arbitration Act, not to run it to death. penalties Only today I read in the Melbourne, I newspapers the remarks which were mon made by the Chief Justice of New South the Wales in connection with the Act in force in that State. I am not familiar with its provisions, but I believe that it is more with stringent than was the New Zealand when I introduced the Arbitration the Western Australian Parliament in 1900. It would appear from the remarks of the Chief Justice of New South Wales that a very serious condition of affairs in that State. Speaking of the New South Wales Act, I find that he said It does encroach upon the liberty of the subjeqt as regards person and property; it creates new crimes unknown to the common and not contained in any previous statute. We knew that, of course - He further says- ' It interferes with the liberty of action the employer and employee; it precludes one from (dictment. giving and the other from obtaining employment except upon terms settled by the .Court; it has effect of preventing persons from obtaining employment at their own specific calling except upon terms imposed by the Act.",56
271,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The right honourable, gentleman, of course, does not believe all 1 - Sir JOHN FORREST - I must believe generous it on such high authority. 1",56
272,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"What , after the right introduced such a his own State ?",56
273,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"It is not the with same measure, and the Chief Justice was is one speaking with regard to administration.",56
274,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Not at all. What he says is against the Act -.,56
275,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The Chief the Justice is speaking of the New South Wales meaAct, and not of the Western Australian Act.",56
276,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,It is precisely the same.,56
277,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I beg the honourable and learned gentleman's pardon; trial in this it is not the same.,56
278,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,In what respect does it differ?',56
279,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,It is very dif,56
280,Mr HUME COOK,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"After all those remarks, the Chief Justice upheld the application which was before the Court.",56
281,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The Chief of New South Wales further said It deprives an employer of the conduct of his business, and vests it in a tribunal formed under the Act ; and it can prescribe terms of which, however injurious they may be to an employer,. he must comply with under for any breach of an order of the Court. There are many other matters to which might refer, such as the operation of the comrule upon persons who have not been before Court, but it is not necessary to do so. Further, I think this Act is productive of the most alarming and deplorable amount of litigation, its concomitant ill-feeling and ill-will, between employers and employees, who are by this Act Act forced into hostile camps. Bill in He concludes with these wordsI believe the object of the Legislature in passing the Act was to promote peace and good-will between employers and employees, but I fear it is growing has not had that effect.",56
282,Mr WEBSTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Does the right honourable gentleman think that a Judge should deliver a political speech from the Bench?,56
283,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Will the honorlaw able member be good enough to ask that question of the Judge himself? The statements I have read, coming as they . (do from the highest judicial authority iii both of New South Wales, constitute a terrible inJ",56
284,Mr HUTCHISON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,They show his bias^,57
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I have no desire to say anything against the New South Wales Act, but I repeat that this is a ter.rible indictment, and it behoves us, as sensible men intrusted with great responsibility, to examine into the working of that measure before proceeding with a Bill of our own dealing with the subject. What has been said by the Chief Justice of New South Wales should be a warning to us to act carefully, and we shall act very foolishly if we ignore what he has said. We shall make a mistake if we sav, "" We do not care what the Chief Justice of New South Wales, or any one else, has said about the working of the Act in that State; we shall not take the trouble to look into it, but are satisfied that it is all right."" Having introduced a similar measure in Western Australia, I perhaps feel a greater sense of responsibility in this connection than do other honourable members. I was guided in the action I took by New Zealand advice and experience; but if the remarks made by the Chief Justice of New South Wales correctly describe the experience of the effect of this legislation in an Australian community, as reasonable and sensible persons we should look into it.",57
286,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The same measure is proposed in the coalition programme.,57
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"What the honourable and learned gentleman refers to is merely the heading of a proposed Bill . If there should be a coalition, and such a Bill were introduced, and if , even after it had almost reached its third reading, we found in it provisions which would not be to the advantage of the country, we should have only one plain duty before us, and that would be to amend it.",57
288,Mr CAMERON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Thro w it out altogether; that would be the best plan.,57
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I repeat that the remarks of the Chief Justice of New South Wales constitute a terrible indictment against the New South Wales Act, and deserve careful consideration. I ask honor-, able members to consider the effect of it on Australia in the eyes of the British people. Who will embark in business under such conditions, as are described by the Chief Justice of New South Wales? When they are acquainted with the fact that such an Act is in operation here, are there any people in the old country who will be so stupid as to embark capital under conditions of that sort? The indictment of the Chief Justice of New South 3K Wales is not one which we can afford to treat lightly. It is one of the most important deliverances ever brought under the notice of this House. As a private individual, I should say that, if I had any money to invest in industry, I certainly should not put it into any venture in New South Wales, if the Chief Justice of that State has correctly described the way in which I might be treated. I imagine'that every one would act in the same way, and while those who have capital invested there will not invest more, they will probably withdraw what they have already invested as soon as possible. We, who afcfc in favour of the principle of arbitration, and who have taken action to impose such legislation on the community, are not, I hope, going to be blind ; and, if , after investigation, it is found that such legislation is likely to become law, we must reconsider our position. We must ""see that those provisions in the Bill which are not good are eliminated, and that other provisions are introduced which will make it carry out what we intend.",57
290,Mr WEBSTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"It requires amendment, Ave admit that.",57
291,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,My own opinion is that the NeAv South Wales Act is' not being treated fairly by the persons for Avhose benefit it Avas passed. It appears to me that it is being run to death. I haA'e received a long list of cases which have been brought before the Arbitration Court in that State.,57
292,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,There are over sixty cases before the Court noAv.,57
293,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Thos e engaged in almost eA'ery industry in that State appear to be dissatisfied, and are going to the Arbitration Court. That, to my mind, is an unfortunate state of affairs. If Ave are men Avho desire to do Avhat is right, Ave shall not, in the circumstances, ignore the opinion of the Chief Justice of NeAv South Wales and neglect to look closely into the matter.. One of the reasons Avhy I object to the methods of the Labour Party is that they neA'er seem to be satisfied with, any leader Avlio does good AA'ork for them. Perhaps the present Prime Minister will recei\'e better treatment at their hands, because he is one of themselves. One of today's neAvspapers contains a report of an intervieAV with the Premier of Western Australia, whose observations have a considerable bearing upon the point which I desire to impress uoon honourable members. The Premier of Western Australia, Mr James. entered Parliament some years ago, when I was Premier of that State, and has remained there ever since. We used to regard him as an extremist. He was a young and ambitious man, was full of fire, an excellent speaker, and possessed of a high character. He was imbued with the idea that no community could become great unless it gave its attention to social legislation, even though there might not appear to be any immediate necessity for it. He used to ransack the records of other States with a view to find' desirable new laws, and when any measure took his fkncv he brought it before the Western Australian Legislature. He did not succeed in carrying many of these Bills, as all our time was taken up in providing for the new order of things brought about by the rapid progress of the Colony. I used to say that, although the proposals contained in his measures were in many cases very good, they were not required. I argued, for instance, that there was no use in legislating in the direction of establishing a minimum wage, when all the workers of the State were receiving wages far in excess of any minimum that was likely to be fixed. Now, Mr James, whilst he has been the Premier of Western Australia, has succeeded in placing on the statute-book a large amount of legislation of a more or less radical character. He has been a staunch friend of the Labour Party ever since he has been in public life.",57
294,Mr FRAZER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The right honourable gentleman should not forget to tell the House - that the Labour Party kept Mr James in power.,58
295,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"They apparently do not intend to keep him in power any longer. Perhaps they kept Mr. James in power for a time, because it did not, suit them to turn him out in favour of others who might be even less favourably disposed to them. Mr James has no doubt been a good friend to the Labour Party, and an advocate of advanced legislation. In the course of an interview on Wednesday last, he was asked why all the members of his Government were being so bitterlyopposed by labour candidates. The James Government is constituted of severaj men who were political opponents of mine. They were never tired of airing their liberal or radical views, and tried to impress on their hearers that they were far in advance of me so far as their ideas of liberalism were concerned. Now the Labour Party are not only opposing their friends at the hustings, but every Minister, including the Premier, has to fight for his life. The contests will be three-cornered in most cases, because there are three parties in the field. I venture to think that the Labour Party will exhibit more bitterness against the Premier and his Ministers, who have been their friends, than against others, who have not been on their side. They will probably display the same spirit that was shown at the last Federal elections towards sympathizers and supporters like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Bourke, against whom, so I am told, their oppositionwas more furiously directed, than against other honourable members who had been openly hostile to them. Mr James, in reply to the question I have indicated, said thatThe cause of the workers never had a better or more consistent friend than himself. He is represented as saying, further, that It was a wonder, after such long and practical sympathy with the workmen, that he and his colleagues shoul'd be opposed. He did not object to labour being represented in Parliament, but he objected to the attempt to make unionism the exclusive mouthpiece of labour in Parliament. Mr James, who was opposed to me in politics-althoug h we have always been very good friends apart from that was supposed to be the "" white-headed boy "" of the Labour Party, and he worked hard for them. He was supported by the party against me, in spite of trie fact that I had given them good measures and good works, and had made the State a land' of plenty for all classes. Mr James went on to say thatHe sympathized with the desire of the workers to support their own candidates when they and their policy were progressive, but when the organizations claimed the exclusive right to represent labour, and aimed at making the party representation a practical monopoly of their organization, it was the duty of the people to plead for greater freedom and more democratic views. These are the view's which are entertained by one who has been considered a friend by the Labour Party for many years.",58
296,Mr CARPENTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Mr James has been the avowed opponent of the Labour Party for manv months.,58
297,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"There is no doubt that he is being denounced now, and that he is receiving the same treatment that was meted out to me. I used to think that when he reached power, and had responsibility, he would find that it was not so easy to please the Labour Party. In the beginning, he was young and inexperienced, and full of life and enterprise. Now he is more experienced, and has more knowledge, ' and probably finds that it is not so easy to exercise the powers of office in such a way as to please his supporters, as it is to sit in opposition and criticise those who are trying to do their best. Although evidences of the good work done by what was known as the Forrest Government can be found all over the goldfields, I had not, for some time before I resigned office in Western Australia, the support of more than two out of the ten representatives sent from that part of the State for which I had laboured so hard. I say-to honourable members who may contemplate accepting the invitation that has been so graciously extended to them by the. Minister of External Affairs, "" Beware "" ! I desire to say a few words regarding the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. Yesterday I asked the Minister of External Affairs if every passenger from Colombo to Fremantle by the mail steamers was to be hauled up before a Customs official and interrogated as to whether he was under an engagement for manual labour. The reply given was that immigrants are to be asked whether they are bond or free men. Unless they satisfy the officer upon this point, what is to happen? I , or any other honourable member of this House, who may be travelling from Colomboi will' be liable to be hauled up before a Customs official and interrogated.",58
298,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Why differentiate between individuals'?,59
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I am not advocating that.,59
300,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I thought that the right honourable member was asking me a question.,59
301,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I was not, but I shall have something to say to the Minister presently.",59
302,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I have an engagement elsewhere, but if the right honourable member will sav it now, I will answer him?",59
303,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If the Minister has an engagement elsewhere, he is at liberty to go. I have no wish to detain him. What are the instructions which he has issued to the Collector of Customs at Fremantle? He has directed thatA special officer shall be instructed to visit vessels likely to contain Austrian and Italian immigrants, and to examine all immigrants separately and carefully, particularly as to whether they are under contract to perform manual labour. If the officer is satisfied that they 3 K2 are under contract they are to be treated as pro-' hibited immigrants. I do not believe that there has been a single case of an immigrant landing in Western Australia under contract. Mr HUGHES^-Then how will my instructions affect these people ?",59
304,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Where is the necessity for the action which has been taken ?,59
305,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The right honourable member must know that a large meeting was held in Western Australia, at - which certain resolutions were passed.",59
306,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"But when the cases were investigated, it was proved that very few .Italians were employed in the mines at Kalgoorlie. The Minister's instructions continueI f he is not so satisfied, but has reasonable grounds to suspect that false statements have been made to him in this regardI suppose that the looks of some men would constitute "" reasonable grounds to suspect that false statements had been made ""-h e should permit the immigrant to land, and instruct him not to leave Fremantle until advised that he may do so, and while there to report ' himself every second day at the Customs office. In the meantime all 'possible inquiries should be made by the officer to ascertain whether his suspicion is well-founded. If he comes to the conclusion that such person is really under contract, you.should report the matter as briefly as possible by telegraph, and ask for instructions. What will happen to an immigrant who, after being treated in this way, proves that he is not under contract? Will the Government pay him anything for the inconvenience to which they have subjected him?",59
307,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Yes . I have agreed with the Italian Consul to pay all the immigrant's expenses 'in such cases,, and the Italian Consul is perfectly satisfied with the arrangement.",59
308,Mr THOMAS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Hear , hear. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - The honourable member for the Barrier says "" Hear, hear "" without knowing anything of the circumstances of the case. I am chiefly .concerned with the. interests of the travelling public.",59
309,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,How did the right honourable member fare at New York?,59
310,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I walked ashore there in the same way as I should walk from the Spencer-street railway station, without any Questions being asked of me. The Minister has not been out of Australia for twentv years, and knows nothing whatever of the usages of the world in matters of this character. I have travelled all over the globe, and .my liberty has never been interfered with, save by the la.ws of quarantine.",59
311,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Shoul d not all men treated alike?,60
312,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Yes ; but they should be treated on business lines. In New South Wales, I am aware that great care is taken to exclude undesirable persons coming from Vancouver. What is done there? Under regulations, every captain is required to get each passenger on his ship to fill in a form, setting out who he is, what he is, and the nature of his avocation. At New York a passenger has to declare that he has the equvalent of $30 in his pocket. But all that is done en route; it is not done at the port, where everybody wants to get off the ship, or meet his friends on shore. Administration of this sort only shows the inexperience of the honourable gentleman, who ought to be guided by his own officers, instead of issuing regulations of this description.",60
313,Mr FRAZER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Would the right honourable member advocate handing over the administration of the Act to the pursers of the vessels?,60
314,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Is this the way to encourage white men to come to this /country? We say that we want immigration. In my opinion, the honourable gentleman wants to keep immigrants out of Australia.",60
315,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,What does the right honourable member's opinion matter to any sane person ?,60
316,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Some people pay some attention to my opinion. honourable and learned gentleman evidently does not like it, although what I have said is true.",60
317,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The people of Western Australia did not show much regard for it at the elections.,60
318,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Wester n Australia has .a far better opinion of me than New South Wales has of the honourable gentleman who interrupts me.,60

320,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If it were not for the honourable gentleman's party, would not be here at all. Honourable memI bers opposite are dependent entirely upon voted out of 106,000 on the rolls. their organizations to place them in the positions they occupy.",60

322,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Le t me tell the Minister of External Affairs that if he lives for a thousand years he will never be regarded in this country as I am regarded by the people who know me in my own State. If he doubts that statement let him come over to Western Australia and see.,60
323,Mr HUGHES,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The honourable member,60
324,Mr SPEAKER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I must point out to honourable members that this is not a dialogue; it is a speech. I will ask the right honourable member for Swan to proceed.,60
325,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Honourable members opposite should not interrupt me offensively.,60
326,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"We know that the Western Australian people have a great opinion of the right honourable member personally, though not politically.",60
327,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The Prime Minister says that they have a high opinion of me personally. What a piece of arrogant impertinence towards a man who has been ten years continuously Premier of ' that State, enjoying the absolute confidence of the people all that time, and ' who has been returned unopposed ever since he has been in public life ! What does he mean by addressing this remark to me? What does he mean by saying that the people of West Australia have no regard for me politically? They have not only a regard for me politically, but an affection for me perThe sonally, and if the Prime Minister doubts that let him come over to Western Australia and see for himself.",60

I am altogether opposed to interfering unduly with Europeans entering Australia. We must act like other nations in dealing with the travelling public. There are plenty of ways by which passengers, from the humblest to the richest, can be interrogated pn the journey, instead of being pestered and delayed when they arrive at Fremantle, and instead of the impression being conveyed to them that they are entering a country in which they are considered to be in bondage. They may not be allowed to land for hours and hours after the ship has arrived. Probably honourable members do not know - that vessels only remain five or six hours at Fremantle altogether, and if passengers are to be humbugged about for an hour or two while the officials look after some Italian or Austrian whom they think is coming here to try to earn a living, they must regard it as most harassing. conduct will not suit the people of Western Australia. I do not say these things on personal grounds. If I were a selfish man, merely looking after myself, I should say to this Government, "" Go on and make your blunders-mak e a by-word of your administration."" But I may tell honourable members opposite, and the Minister, that if he tries to carry out in Western Australia the instructions that have been issued, he will have a hornet's nest about his ears. I am quite sure that the honourable member for Fremantle will have something said to him on the subject. It will be more than his political lif e is worth if these instructions are persevered with. - Mr CARPENTER - Le t the right honourable member leave that to me; he is raising a bogy.",60
334,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Surely ness the landing of passengers at Fremantle is difficult enough now, without the Commonwealth Government placing further restrictions in the way. It takes a very long time to land. Is that difficulty to be intensified in order that the Commonwealth Government may look after a few men who can just as weli be looked after en route?",61
335,Mr MAHON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Passenger s can land just as easily at Fremantle 'as at Port Melbourne.,61

338,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The honourable member, is very' bold now, but he will not be quite so bold when he bas to answer for these things which I am talking about. I understood that it was intended that we should treat all European nations alike. Now, however, Austrians and Italians are being singled out for objection. I do not know what the Austrian Empire and the people of Italy will say to this discrimination.",61
339,Mr BROWN,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Ne w Zealand has done the same thing with regard to Austrians.,61

341,Sir JOHNFORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I am desirous that the greatest care shall be taken in discriminating between different nationalities. The Minister who is responsible That for the working of the Immigration Restriction Act must, use his own discretion, but to discriminate in this fashion will probably be very offensive to the nations affected. The instructions which he has issued simply show the sort of slap-dash policy indulged in by this new Minister, who has had no experience at all in matters of this sort. It is evident that the Minister has not a proper appreciation of our obligations to the Empire. He must have forgotten altogether that incidents of this sort may make the position of the mother country very difficult indeed in regard to her relations with great and powerful foreign nations. This shows the danger of intrusting the administration of the government of this country to people who have had no experience of the management of affairs of this kind, or, indeed, of any affairs of any magnitude. to good- Now I want to say a word or two with regard to another feature of the policy of the Government. They say that they are opposed to borrowing, or at any rate that they wish to see borrowing restricted. Well, I suppose we are all in favour of that. No one wants to be extravagant or to borrow uselessly. They do not appear to be averse to taking money from the banks without paying any interest for the use of it. Doubtless a scheme will, in due course, be laid before us, showing how it is proposed to refund the money. I presume that the Government do not propose to give the banks nothing but paper in return for their gold, and to make no provision for a refund.",61
342,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Provisio n will be made.,61

Honourable members know what my feelings are in this regard. induced my colleagues to insert certain clauses in the Bill which we introduced, in order to make it more acceptable; but I never liked the Bill. I considered it to be premature. However desirable a measure may seem in theory, I do not think that it should be passed into law unless it is - actually required. Let us first deal with those matters which are pressing and practical, and allow those that are not to await a more convenient time.",63

I am glad that the Goaffluent, vernment have not gone on with the meaa sure, but that does not alter the fact that the Labour Party pressed, urged, and most coerced the late Government to bring in the Bill. Why should it be sacrificed, when it was considered last session to so pressing?",63

Are the seamen to be sacrificed ? Are the ship-owners to be sacrificed for the present session?

Was it all a sham? what has been said merely a cry to influence the elections? Every one knows that the seamen on our coast are fairly well paid, that our steam-ship owners are fairly and that there is no likelihood ot maritime strike. I am informed that the coastal shipping obtains more employment alby the carriage of goods transhipped to them from the over-sea and foreign steamers than it loses by the competition of those, be steamers. I understand that now the shipowners themselves are frightened, and are doubtful if it is in their interests to legislate in the way proposed. Is this virtuous and consistent party going to sacrifice the public servants as well as the seamen and the shipowners? Personally, I thinlc that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill should not apply to public servants. But the members of the Labour Party are ready to sacrifice anything to gain their own ends, and although they were enabled to get possession of the Treasury benches by carrying an amendment applying the provisions of the Bill to public servants, now that they are in power they are discarding them. I regret that my speech has been so long. My task has been a heavy one, and I have not been in the best of health for its performance. My concluding words are these: I have had to ask myself two questions. The first is, "" Am I prepared to give my help to the Government to carry out the platform, present and prospective, of their party ? "" The second is, "" Do I approve of their-objects and their methods? "" To both questions I definitely reply "" No."" I am not in accord with the platform of the Government, present and prospective, nor with the methods of their organization.",63
372,Mr WEBSTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"It is the programme of the right honourable member's party,",64

377,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I did it when it was denied, and was very glad to.",64
378,Mr HIGGINS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I regret that the statement was made without better reason.,64
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I assure the Attorney-General that I did not invent it. It was stated to me as a fact.,64
380,Mr HIGGINS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I am sure that honourable members believe that I would not utter a word that is not true, and I say that I heard nothing as to the acceptance of office until a day or two after the Prime Minister was commissioned by His Excellency to form an Administration. The right honourable member for Swan also said that, in accepting office, I had deserted my party, and had given no excuse for my action. But before I had accepted office I was assured that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat had been consulted, and that he had no objection to my doing so.",64
381,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The words were, "" He had no objection whatever.""",64
382,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Did he say that to the Attorney-General?,64

He replied; and if he does not regard the correspondence as confidential, I do not, and am perfectly willing that the right' honourable member for Swan should see it. I have a genuine respect for the right the honourable member, but may I say, with all have I kindness and respect, that I can understand and now his black looks at the Ministerial benches. If he had been loyal to the honof orable and learned member for Ballarat, and had consulted him about what had been done, he would have had all these doubts and difficulties dispelled.",64
385,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I do not think so.,64
386,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I had the authority of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat only a few minutes ago to make the statement which I have made.,64

Every one knows that,-from first to last, I have had a strong and a growing sympathv with their his aspirations. That sympathy has not been lessened one whit by the unjust attacks made on them. I am sorry that the right honourable member has been misled by rumours and suspicions. I think he has taken his beating very badly. I attribute that to his want of experience in being beaten. I think he was never beaten before.",64
388,Mr SPEAKER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I am afraid that the honorabls and learned member is going beyond a personal explanation.,65
389,Mr HIGGINS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The right honourable member's infinite capacity for learning will enable him to gain an advantage from this experience, and help him to bear his present trials. My admiration for his character and powers is not in the least diminished.",65
390,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," As one of those who assisted in displacing the late Government, and rendering it possible for the Labour Party to come into power, I should like to state briefly the reasons which actuate me in declining to sit on the Ministerial benches, or to support the Ministry in any way. I have more than one ground, I think, for taking that attitude, as I shall proceed to show. It is impossible for us not to-sympathize with the aims and objects of the Labour Party, although we have no sympathy with the methods they propose to adopt, because we believe that those methods, so far from increasing the prosperity and contentment of the great bulk of the working classes of Australia, will depress them still more than they have ever been depressed. It is on such grounds that I base my opposition to the party in power and their methods.",65
391,Mr BAMFORD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,To which particular method does the honourable and learned member refer?,65
392,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"To almost every method that can be employed. You seem to me to be determined to employ wrong methods. Starting out with high aims ancl high aspirations, vou go the wrong way to work.",65
393,Mr SPEAKER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Order . The honourable and learned member must address the Chair.,65
394,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The Labour Party go back to the musty-fusty past, arrogate to themselves the name of progressivists, say that they alone have' a knowledge of what is wanted, and lo and behold ! when we come to examine the methods they propose, we find that they date back to from 7,000 to 10,000 years ago. They are the same as the methods that caused the castes of. India to spring up today. If they were carried out to the full , even at the present time, there would be no free men in Australia. When the honourable members at the head of affairs show that they have so little intelligence that they cannot even separate themselves from a common bond or pledge that they must all work together-no t because they all have the same ideas, but because a majority of them say that they ought to have the same ideas-the n I submit that it is making a laughing stock of this Parliament. We are in this position that we do not know when one of them gets up in the House and delivers himself most forcibly and strongly on a point whether a caucus may not be held the next morning, and he may not enter the House next day and say"" Well, you know what I think about this subject; but now I am going to speak and vote the other way.""",65
395,Mr TUDOR,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,That has never occurred yet.,65
396,Mr BROWN,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,We have never had that in this House.,65
397,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I shall give an illustration. When the Electoral Bil l was going through the House, who insisted so strongly as the Labour Party on enacting the principle of one vote one value, and on altering the very quota of the Constitution Act ?",65
398,Mr MAUGER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,""" The end justifies the means.""",65
399,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"They justified themselves by saying that it was a plank in their platform, and, undoubtedly, it was. Time after time men in the Labour Party rose here and spoke of that very thing, and at the very first opportunity for carrying that idea into effect by providing for the distribution of the States into, as nearly as possible, electorates of equal value, every one of them went back on his principles, with the single exception of the honourable member for Yarra.",65
400,Mr TUDOR,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,What about the honourable members for Canobolas and West Sydney? The honourable and learned member does not know what he is talking about.,65
401,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I beg pardon. With the exception of three members the Labour Party went absolutely against their pledged word in this House.,65
402,Mr TUDOR,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The honourable and learned member is wrong. Mr CONR.OY - The effect of that vote was to practicallv disfranchise hundreds, nay, thousands, of persons in New South Wales. Only yesterday the Minister of Trade ancl Customs explained that Queensland has not its proper representation. Why? Because some men, under a State Act, were allowed to vote in more than one electorate; in other words, two per cent, of 5 Ministerial [REPRESENTATIVES.] the people had more votes than they should have had in the various electorates. And yet that Minister, with other members of his party, excepting the three just mentioned, voted to make a difference of over ioo per cent, in some electorates in New South Wales. I am now asked to say that you are a party of consistency, that you stand by your pledged word because it was a plank in the platform which you put specially forward, and whichyou absolutely departed from.",65
403,Mr SPEAKER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Order ! The honourable member is repeatedly using the second person.,66
404,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,If there was one party I sympathized with more than another when I entered this House it was the Labour Party.,66
405,Mr TUDOR,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Sympathize d with them?,66
406,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I think that my votes ancl my attitude on all great questions will show that I did. It is true that I did not always agree with the methods adopted, because they seemed to me to involve a marching back in so many that they ought not to have been brought into a House like this, which laid any claim - to advancement. One of the first shocks I received was in connection with the very vote to which I have referred. When I saw a body of men, with the exception of three, all turn round and vote in quite the other way, it showed me very clearly that they were not keeping to their principles as they should, and I have always regarded them with less favour on that account. At all events, they have come into power. not going to question the advisability of selecting a leader from a third party in the House. I have always been of the opinion that there ought to be only two parties here. I am still of opinion that there ought to be a party on the side of the ayes ancl a party on the side of the noes, and that if the former cannot carry on some person among the latter ought to be askedto lead the House. That, it appears to me, is the simple principle of government. I am not going to argue now how far that principle has been departed from. I will say that when the La'bour Party came into office I was prepared, if their principles were fashioned according to what they really believed, if they showed ihe same intense earnestness and enthusiasm to carry out their platform that they had displayed in the past, to make some little allowance for their great lapse from virtue, and to wait to see what they would do.

410,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I am not concerned with that question. I do not believe that he did. But if he did, it was clearly in ignorance of the Socialist programme. At all events, it is strange that the head of the Labour Party should not know what the May Day Socialists of the Continent and England propose. The words of the Prime Minister are perfectly clear, and express every sympathy with those men.",66
411,Mr SPENCE,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The honourable and learned member for Werriwa says that he has sympathy with the Labour Party. cases, Mr CONROY - But I did not think the Labour Party would carry their ideas to such extremes. I have sympathy with the Labour Party when they are willing to f o l low on the lines of sound legislation, but not when they join with a body which proposes the abolition of wagedom, and, therefore, a possible return to slavery; because, in slave countries, in the absence of wages, the workers are in the position of serfs.",66

428,Mr MAUGER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Why not give us Charles Kingsley's Socialism?,67
429,Mr SPEAKER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I must point out that it is quite impossible for the honourable and learned member to proceed, with interjections coming from two or three honourable members at a time, and being constantly repeated. I ask honourable members to give the honourable and learned member for Werriwa an opportunity to express, not the opinions of other honourable members, but his own.",67
430,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Charle s Kingsley knew nothing of the May Day Socialists, because their movement had not started in his day. I am now speaking of a particular body of men, with whom the honourable member for Melbourne Ports ought to have no sympathy. The honourable member has taught in the Sunday schools of the community, and tried to uphold religion; and I should like him to hear a part of the programme of the May Day Socialists, whose principles are published in two newspapers, and issued in no fewer than twelve manifestoes. It is remarkable how, running through all these declarations of doctrines, there is what, if honourable members like, may be called a revolting idea. The only excuse for the expression of sympathy by the Prime Minister must be his ignorance of the Socialist programme, and I expect from him a complete renunciation of the Socialist doctrines as soon as I have explained what they are. I shall begin with the collective ownership of land and the collective ownershio of all means of production. I have nothing to say against those proposals if they can be carried out; but if a man places his hand on my throat in order to get my share of the world's goods I shall take care to have my two hands on his throat, and my foot on his stomach at the same time. It is just as well to let it be understood that 1 there are those amongst us who are prepared to fight for their rights; and before anything like the programme of the Socialist is possible there must be the bloodiest of wars, in which one side or the other will be completely wiped out. I now draw the attention of honourable members to the second proposal of the Socialists, because and there is no doubt that the expression of sympathy by the Prime Minister has been cabled to all the countries of Europe.",67
431,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,My utterances are not so important.,67
432,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,There is no doubt that the Prime Minister's expression of sympathy will be printed in all the Socialist journals. Mark how this proposal in the Socialist programme is disguised:Substitution of a free and equal family for the moral and oppressive family in which the wife and children are the slaves of the husband and father.,67
433,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,What is meant by that ?,67
434,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The honourable member knows perfectly well what is meant- a subversion of all family ties. Lest there should be any doubt on that point, I shall read a still more open declaration made on behalf of those gentlemen. That declaration is not made in what I can call a mild manner, but in such a fashion that everybody may not, perhaps, be able to fully grasp its meaning. The inner manifesto of the party, however, will fully explain the position. Deville and his party declare that marriage is a regulation of property, and strongly advocate the suppression of all marriage, and the substitution of what is gloriously termed "" free love.""",67
435,Mr OMALLEY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,What kind of business is that?,68
436,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"What kind of business is it for the Prime Minister to even seem to approve of ? - Mr WATSON - How long is it since these proposals were written, and who approves of them now?",68
437,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I shall show that they are approved of by the very men whom the Prime Minister has mentioned-Kar l Marx and Engels. Deville and his party declareIt is marriage which gives to the possessing class its hereditary character, and thus develops its conservative instinct. Marriage is a regulation of property, a business contract before being a union of persons, and its utility grows out of the economic structure of a society which is based upon individual appropriation. By giving guarantees to the legitimate children, and insuring to them the paternal capital, it perpetuates the domination of the caste which monopolises the productive forces. . . . When property is transformed, and only after that transformation, marriage will lose its reason for existence, and boys and girls may then freely and without fear of censure listen - to the wants and promptings of their nature . . . . the support of the children will no longer depend upon the chance by birth. Like their instruction, it will become a charge of society. The reason given is that the support of the children will no longer depend on the "" chance of birth."" I object to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth publicly sympathizing with people who hold such views as these.",68
438,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,This is a most ungenerous and unfair attack. The honourable and learned member ought to be ashamed of himself.,68
439,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,If the Prime Minister wishes me to say that I do not believe he really does approve,68
440,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,It is a most disgusting party move.,68
441,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If the honourable gentleman desires that I should say that I personally believe that he absolutely disapproves of this kind of thing, well and good; but my complaint is that he should never have taken advantage of his position as Prime Minister of this great Commonwealth to allow it to go forth to the world that this is the sort of thing he does approve of. Are not the people of Australia to be considered when it is published abroad that this kind of thing is approved of by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth?",68

445,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I have not gone further back than 1873 for my quotations, so that honourable members may know what these people are driving at, and I have taken them up to 1897.",68

447,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"And yet Mr Tom Mann the other day said that he would not deliver the full manifesto of the party, because the people were not ripe for it. I trust the day will never come when they will be ripe for it. I was never one who looked with favour on the granting of the suffrage to women. I admit that honestly, but if the kind of thing to which I have been referring is attempted-if these are the doctrines to be preached-the extension of the suffrage to women will be found to be one of the very best things that could possibly have happened in Australia, because under female suffrage at least we shall not have any wild-cat nonsense of this sort. With female suffrage we shall know where we are. I can give honourable members another example.",68

We know, as a matter of fact, that he does not do so, but before he expressed his approval of such a creed, he should have made himself acquainted with the aims and objects of those who preach it. The announcement that has gone forth to the world constitutes a blot upon the fair name ot Australia.

The masses of men for whom honourable members opposite ought to fight are not those who can already make their voices heard, but those who are not in a position to do so. I say, therefore, that honourable members on this side of the House can be more truly called labour men than any of those sitting opposite; because we represent not union labour only, but non-union labour also. At the present unionists exceed the unionists in Australia by the proportion of over eight to one. What would become of the unionists of this country if the non-unionists treated them as those men are now being treated. the non-unionists took up arms, and said, "" As you have passed a law under which you will not allow non-unionists to work for a living, we will pass a Jaw which will not allow unionists to work""-wha t would be the result? Only recently in Sydney we had a trades union closing up its books ancl saying .that no man outside the ranks of that society should be allowed to get a living at the calling affected. It is a perversion of terms to say that justice can be obtained in this country while a union cari close up against all non-union men in that fashion.

516,Mr HUTCHISON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I withdraw it, of course; but why does the honourable and learned member say that we represent unionists only ?",72
517,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"For the reason that the Arbitration Bill passed in New South Wales, ancl the Bill introduced into this House, gives a preference to unionists, although, as a matter of fact non-unionists exceed them in numbers. If the unionists of this country are represented by twentytwo or twenty-three men in Parliament, it would only be right that the non-unionists, who number over 900,000 men, should have at least fifty representatives.",72

Because force is used when the police and military are, in cases of emergency, put into operation to support such laws as I have indicated. It is true that it is called legal force, but it is none the less force against which the great body of unorganized workers cannot fight. It is because I object to this perpetual legislation on behalf of a section, whom I call.the aristocracy of labour, that I take up this stand. I do not care from what party legislation of that kind comes. I shall raise my voice in objection to it as long as it shuts out from consideration eight men .out of ninein this Commonwealth.",72

521,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I have nothing to do with what my party, or any other party, has agreed to. From whatever party measures come, which are, in my opinion, inimical t to the interests of the people of this country, they will receive steady and persistent opposition from me. I am not going to support them for any party that can be formed. It is, it seems to me, one of the most awful things that can be contemplated that a large body of men, who ought to be the very men to fight for the unorganized workers, should be found supporting legislation which will render, those workers absolutely more helpless, and will push them still lower down in the scale. I have no hesitation in saying in regard to the proposal before the Chair to print a despatch in reference to conferring on members of the first Parliament the title of "" Honourable,"" that I intend to vote against it.",73
522,Mr MCDONALD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," I should not have said anything if it had not been for the speech of the honourable and learned member who has just sat down. I had decided not to speak, but when the honourable - and learned member for Werriwa made the attack, which he has done on-the party with which I am associated, by quoting obsolete documents, and then trying to fasten them on the supporters of the Government, it is time that some one made a reply. The honourable and learned member has been guilty of the most despicable attempt to assail the characters of political opponents that I have ever heard of in all my life. Had the honourable and learned member been a stranger to this Chamber; had he not known honourable members on this side of the House; had he not been associated with them for several years past, I could have excused him in quoting from documents of that character. But, as the honourable and learned' member knows us all personally, and knows that the members of this party lead honest, and 3L pure, and moral lives, for him to make such an attack was the most cowardly piece of work I ever heard of. if I knew only one prominent free-trader who had committed a murder in,New South Wales, should I not be the most cowardly man under heaven if I endeavoured to associate his conduct with that of men like the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, the Tionorable member for Macquarie, or even the honourable and learned member for Werriwa himself? It would be just as reasonable for me to say that I . had known free-traders who believed in bigamy, and to declare, therefore, that honourable members of the Free-trade Party believed in bigamy.. But. what. ..sort .of a man should I be if I were to make any such accusations against honourable members opposite? Should not I be unworthy of a seat in this House? The honourable and learned member has attempted to cast upon members of the Labour Party a slander which neither he nor any other honourable member can justify, and in these circumstances he should for ever hide his head in shame.",73

524,Mr MCDONALD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"There is no occasion for me to make any disclaimer. I stand here as a Socialist, and have openly declared for the last sixteen years that I am one. When I was first returned to Parliament I asserted that I had been elected only as a Socialist. Let the honourable member turn to Karl Marx, Hyndman, William Morris, .Webb, Harrison, and others whose characters, at any time, will bear comparison with his own. I for one should be prepared to stand by that comparison. Themen I have named are all well-known scientific writers, whilst, on the other hand, the honourable and learned member has quoted from the writings of fanatics in various parts of the world. Without having read, or properly digested, the theories propounded by the men to whom he referred, he rushed, forward to make a speech which did no credit to himself or to the party to which he belongs.. I feel sure that I echo the feelings of his party when I assert-that they do not give the slightest credence to any of the statements which the honourable and learned member has made. If I have spoken warmly. I think I have a right to be excused. The attack made by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa was most cowardly, and certainly ought not to have been made in this House. So far as the Prime"" Minister is concerned, he is well able referred. to defend himself, and needs no assistance from me. I do not take any exception to what the honourable gentleman did or said in relation to the May Day celebrations.",73

526,Mr MCDONALD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The honourable and 3earned gentleman may do what he pleases. I care not what he does.,74
527,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I expressly excluded ^honourable members opposite from any belief in the matters I have mentioned. I said that they did not know,74

529,Mr MCDONALD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If the honourable and learned member were acquainted with the May Day Socialists who meet once a year on the banks of the Yarra he would have anything to say against them. Much though he might disapprove of the princithe ples they advocated, it would be impossible for him to take exception to them personally or to Jay a charge against any one of them. I have nothing further to say, for the cussion is not likely to have any profitable, result. I understand that honourable memeffect bers opposite do not even intend to press the matter to a division. Much time has been wasted, and I should 'have refrained from speaking but for the violent attack made by the honourable and learned member forright Werriwa.",74

537,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I distinctly said that honourable members opposite did not know what these things were.,74
538,Mr MCDONALD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,We know as much about the subject as does the honourable and learned member.,74
539,Mr CARPENTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," It was my intention to reply at some length to several of the points made by the right honourable member for Swan;, but, at this very late hour, I am sure. that, honorableonly members have no desire that the debate should be continued. I shall, therefore, content myself with a very brief reference to two features of the right honourable member's address, and I regret that he is not not present to hear what I have to say. He referred, first of all, to the action taken by Minister of External Affairs with reference to the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act at Fremantle. I have no desire to accuse the right honourable dismember of having wilfully endeavoured to give rise to a scare; but I must say that one of the remarks made by him will be to frighten those engaged in mercantile pursuits in Fremantle into the belief that some new and harassing restriction has been placed upon the shipping of that port. The honourable member is entirely mistaken if he imagines that the Government have done, or propose to do, anything of the kind. As a member of the Ministry which introduced the Immigration Restriction Bill, he was doubtless sincere in the desire that - every possible restriction should be placed In these circumstances it ill-becomes him, when an attempt is being made to remedy many past defects, to seek to make capital out of the efforts of the Government to administer the to measure in something like an honest and effective manner. Let me assure any one who might otherwise be misled by the rethe marks of the right honourable member, that the Government do not intend to do anything that. will, in any way, hamper . or They will do all that is necessary, as they ought to do, for the proper administration of the Act, and do no more. The right honourable member made a veiled attack on the Labour Party in Western Australia, by .suggesting that they were disloyal to those who had been their recognised leaders. He referred to a paragraph appearing in this morning's issue of a Melbourne newspaper, in which the Premier of Western Australia, Mr. Walter James, is said to complain of the opposition which is being shown to him in the present State elections. The honourable gentleman told the House that the Premier of Western Australia had been for some time past a recognised leader of the Labour Party there. It is true that he has been known as a Radical, and has assisted to pass what we call labour legislation,' but he has never been officially nected with the Labour Party. He has held office almost entirely by the support of that party, but the fact that it is now in antagonism to him arises purely from his own expressed wish. Only a few months ago, speaking at a meeting at Bunbury, he publicly declared that from that time onwards he wanted only two parties, in Western Australia-the Ministerialists and the Labour Party. Having been challenged in that way, the Labour Party could not do less than take up the gauntlet, and they are, therefore, opposing the honourable gentleman now. I wish to make that statement in justification of their action, and to refute the charge that they are ungrateful to those who have led them. There has never been any relation, official or implied, between the Premier of Western Australia and the Labour Party of that State, and I wish these remarks to follow as quickly as possible those bf the right honourable member for Swan, so that the people may be able to read both sides of the case at the one time.",74
540,Mr STORRER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," When I entered the House a short time ago, if anyone had told me' that after the lapse of three months ive should have done no business, I would not have believed him. I have listened to the debate which has been pioceeding for now more than a week on the question of the printing of a letter referring to the adoption of the title of ""Honourable "" by certain honourable members, and I consider it an exceedingly regrettable waste of time. I am sorry that questions are not discussed in this Chamber quietly ' and coolly, and without the imputation of improper motives. I treat every honourable member as an honourable man, and have no desire to impute improper motives to any one. The members of this House were sent here' by a majority of those whom they represent, and their position is, therefore, not to be questioned. It is to be regretted that we have heard so much about what has taken place in the Parliaments of the States, of the constitution of the labour, organizations, and of other irrelevant matters. I desire - to correct a mistake which was made last night,- and repeated this evening, in reference to my position. .I am not a member of the Labour Party. I am still an independent member, and hope to continue so, although I sympathize with - many of the aims of .the Labour Party, and shall vote with them on many questions which will come before the House. con- The complaint was' made yesterday that the members of the Ministry are not business - men. Now I am a business man, and - have' had a workshop. When I entered that workshop I wished to see what my men had done for their money. If our masters, the people of Australia, could be brought here, they would find that we have done very little for our money during the past three months. I trust that this debate will not last any longer, and that if a no-confidence motion is to be moved, it will be dealt with as soon as possible. I have not had much experience in politics, and therefore I am new to the method of killing time with which I Sm now being made acquainted. Personally I would rather not be in Parliament than take money for work which I have not done. We are not elected to indulge in party fights. We were sent here to legislate for the welfare of the Commonwealth. It has been my policy all my life to vote, not for men, but for measures, and I shall continue to adopt that attitude; Whenever I regard a measure as a good one, I shall vote for it, while if I believe it to be a bad one, I shall vote against it. There are many other matters to which I should like to refer, but the hour is late, and I consider the whole debate a waste of time. ' Mr BROWN (Canobolas) - I should not have risen to speak but for the remarks of the honourable and learned member '.for Werriwa. I believe ihat fair play is bonny play. I do not belong to the Socialist Party. I have never allied myself to them in any way. I believe, however, that there are good men in that party. Not only have the members of the Labour Party in this House been slandered by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, but a number of good, honest, clean people outside who claim to belong to the Socialist Party have been traduced? Let me give one or two definitions from authoritative sources, instead of from the musty old records with which the honourable . and learned member has dealt in his endeavour to fasten a slander upon Socialists and the members of the Labour Party for low-down political purposes. I turn first :to that, great work, whose authority even the honourable and learned member will not question, the Encyclopaedia Britannica. How .does it define Socialism ? It says that the ethics . of Socialism are identical withthose of Christianity. That is not how the honourable and learned member presented it. I could' also go to a Webster's Dictionary, another eminent authority, but. I prefer to make .a short quotation from a poetess whose moral standing and work on behalf of humanity cannot be doubted. I refer to Ella Wheeler Wilcox. This is what she has writtenWho is a Socialist? It is the man ' : Who strives to aid or formulate a plan , To better earth's conditions. It is he Who,, having ears to hear,, and eyes to see, Is neither deaf nor blind, when Might roughshod Treads down the privileges and rights which God Means for all men-the privilege to toil, To breathe pure air, to till the fertile soil, The right to live, to love, to woo, to wed, And earn for hungry mouths their need of bread. The Socialist is he who claims no more - Than .his own share from generous Nature's store; But that he asks, and asks, too, that no other Shall claim the share of any weaker brother, 1 And brand himbeggar in his own domain, . To glut a mad, inordinate lust for gain. The Socialist is one who holds .the best Of all God's gifts is toil-the second rest. He asks that all men learn'the sweets of labour, - And that no idler fatten on his neighbourThat all men be allowed to share their leisure,. Nor thousands slave that one may seek his pleasure; Who on the Golden Rule shall dare exist, Behold in fcim the Sociilist. . The honourable and learned member for Werriwa made a vile-attack upon the Prime Minister. He wished to associate the honourable gentleman with the views which he himself put forward as being the basic .principles of Socialism.",75
541,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"That is not what I said. i Mr BROWN - I shall content myself with the remark that that innuendo has been thrown out against the leader of the House for low-down political purposes. I despise the honourable and learned member :from whom it emanates. I am prepared to - go outside and to fight my political battles, - but I believe in straight, fair, fighting.",76
542,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"That is straight fighting, and I shall fight against-that kind of thing to the day of m y death. - Mr BROWN - As ' this innuendo has been made against the Prime Minister, I shall quote the utterances of a worthy ; clergyman in Sydney from his pulpit last Sunday with respect to that honourable gentleman. In. the course of his sermon last Sunday, the Rev-. George Walters used these words:- - - - Upon merely party questions I shall not speak from this pulpit, but upon the purely personal aspect I venture to say that the present Premier, Mr J. C. Watson, is one of the cleanest, straightest,. and most honourable of those who have had the destinies of the Commonwealth, in their care and keeping. When in this church, fourteen years ago, I married him to his partner in life, I hardly anticipated that he would become Premier of a united Australia; but, from that day to this, in humble or exalted position, John Christian Watson has been a true man whom, we may respect and admire, whether or not we agree with his political ideas.",76
543,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Hav e I denied one word of that?,76
544,Mr BROWN,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If there is to be a fight in this House by those who do not believe that the Labour Party should siton these benches, surely there is plenty of opportunity for them to put up a decent, clean - fight. I shall' not ally myself with lowdown fighting,, and, although not a Socialist,! should be false to myself, knowing the good, clean lives that these men live, both inside the House and out of it, if I did not raise my protest against - the travesty and the caricature on Socialism which has been presented here to-night.",76
545,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H, I desire to make a personal explanation.,76
546,Mr SPEAKER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The honourable arid learned member has already made one personal explanation, but if it is the pleasure of the House that he should'be permitted to make another, he may proceed. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear. Mr 'CONROY - There is one thing that I thought I made most perfectly clear. My astonishment was that men whom I know in the most friendly way,, should have any communication with this body of May Day Socialists, and I then explained what the May Day Socialists are. I also stated that I hoped that as soon as the Prime Minister understood the kind of men they are,. and the class to which they belong, he would at once give an assurance-bu t for the way in which the news is transmitted to other countries I should not require it at all-that he has no sympathy with such .a body. I know that he has not, and I cannot too strongly impress on the honourable member for Canobolas that I was most careful about pointing out the views, not of honourable members.in this House, but of the May Day Socialists at home. Further than that T cannot go. If honourable members can question one case to which I referred,', then T shall admit that. I have .made a big error. But I did not refer to one individual in the House, as honourable members know.",76
547,Mr SPENCE,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Yes , the honourable and learned member did, .and to a number of us. . Mr CONROY - Honourable members know that I did not.",77
548,Mr SPENCE,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The honourable and learned member tried to damage us in the eyes of the country.,77
549,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Bland-Treasurer) At this hour it is not my intention to say much on the general tone of the debate on the programme I submitted a week ago. I regret that so much time has been taken up with a discussion on what, after all, is only ah abstract matter, because I would have preferred much, if we had"" been able, to have a clear fight on the issue whether this Government is to retain office-if that issue is intended to be raised-o r whether 'we are to get on to the work of the country, and, by accomplishing something, justify our existence as a Parliament. I think that the complaint of the honourable member for JBass-that we have been sitting here'for about three months, and yet have nothing to show for our work-is justified. It is about time that, with the help of one side or the other, we buckled to, and gave some result to the country. With regard to the line of attack'which has generally, been lowed, of course it was quite within' the competence of the speakers to fasten'tlieir - attack, not on the programme of immediate' .work presented by us, but rather on the - question of whether our methods of organization are justified; whether we are acting with propriety in insisting on a man doing in our party as he is required to do in every party-that is, to sink his minor convictions - when a crisis arrives, in order that the matters which he holds to be of larger importance should be given effect to. That principle obtains in every party in'a State. The right honourable member for Swan, who - talked so much about the great independence that he possesses, had to subdue his intense desire to burst up the Commonwealth because, being in a Cabinet, he had to give way to the pressure of his colleagues and the circumstances that surrounded him. It is only the sheerest hypocrisy on the part of honourable members on the other side to talk about the rules of the Labour Party and the'ir organization, when they know, every one Of them, that they must give way to party discipline if they are to accomplish anything under the system . of responsible Government that obtains in every British community. It is an absolute essential that we must give way here and there if we are to acomplish anything; and, I say that honourable, members, knowing that, were onlyspeaking for party purposes when they complained of the methods of the Labour Party. We have followed their example. It is true that our members exhibit a degree'of loyalty perhaps greater than that exhibited by members, of some other parties.",77
550,Sir JOHN FORREST,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,It is more cast-iron.,77
551,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,That is not so. We show a greater spirit df loyaltv to principle in a programme ori which we are agreed.,77
552,Mr THOMAS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The Labour Party is no niore cast-iron than was the honourable member's party when he was Emperor of the West - ,77
553,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"When, ' as I am reminded, the right honourable gentleman was running Western Australia there was hot a man, not merely in his party, but out of it, who dared to raise his voice in opposition to any proposal, because he knew that if he did he would be thrown into outer darkness without the semblance of a trial.' Mr - THOMAS - He dismissed one of his Ministers for that offence.",77
554,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The right honourable and learned gentleman who is leading one section of the Oppositional refer to the f o lhonorable member for East Sydney-sai d in regard to the indications given by myself of the anxiety of the' uovernment to"" nationalize the tobacco monopoly, to convert a private into a public monopoly, that that proposal, and all that went with it, would trample out every form of individual liberty in industry. I am quite prepared to admit that to the extent to which such a proposal is operative it does trample out individual liberty; but in this, as in every other civilized community, it' is being recognised that we must take in hand these monopolies for the safety of the State. Surely no one - would think of calling President Roosevelt a Socialist-at any rate, he would not be termed a May Day Socialist. Yet President Roosevelt just a little while ago, when trouble existed in the United States in connection with the' coal strike, assured the "" Coal Barons,"" as they are termed, that if an agreement under the Commission he appointed was found to be impossible, he would take the extreme step of resuming the coal mines in the interests of the community, in order to insure that the public Should have coal, and that they should not be left to die of cold because of the arrogance, greed, and rapacity of the people who controlled the mines.",77
555,Mr GB EDWARDS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,But President Roosevelt does not recognise the creed of the Socialists who meet in Chicago on Mav Day.,78
556,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Of course not. That is quite another question, and it is only .a man who. is so full of .prejudice or of party feeling that he would descend to anything base who would assume that we had any sympathy with such a creed. I come now to the temarks of the honourable member for Werriwa. I was pained to think that an honourable and learned member, to whom I have always given credit for at least fight-' ing fairly, if always hitting hard, should have descended to an attack of the description in which he engaged.",78
557,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Was it a personal attack on the Prime Minister ?,78
558,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"No ; I did not regard it in that way. I have, however, just as keena regard for the reputation of my party' generally as I have for my own, and I felt it deeply that it should be suggested that any of us sympathized with free love, or the breaking down of the marriage institution. It was a most shameful thing, in my view, for the honourable and learned member, who knows us so well, and knows the labour movement so well, to cast an imputation of that character upon us. He knows very well that no such sympathy is entertained by any man in our party.",78
559,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I made two personal explanations to the effect that I did not refer to the Prime Minister, or to the other members of the Labour Party, but to the May Day Socialists, of whose programme the Prime Minister expressed his approval. I said that the Minister did not know their programme.",78
560,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I know that perhaps I should not take as much notice as I am doing of what the honourable and learned member has said,' because, after all, I do not think there is .any man in this House who would pay the"" slightest regard to the arguments which he has used. I do know, however, that there is a certain section of the press in Australia which will note any insinuation of this kind, and spread it broadcast through the country, with. a view to injure, not us individually, but the movement with which we are associated. I put it to any fair-minded man whether it is right that those men who waited on me the other day-man y of whom T know to . be just as upright and clean living as any honourable member of this House, and who, whether they be right-or wrong, have made sacrifices to carry out their principlesshould be branded as being in favour of free love. That is a shameful libel on men whom the honourable and learned member ought to know advocate no> suGh thing. Sure!'- in these matters 1 of great public importance, we should sufficiently appreciate principles as distinguished from the individuals who may advocate them. Surely that is the first qualification for a man who desires to become a \ legislator. I , for one, say that, although I may believe that a socialistic writer is sound on the ecoriomic side of the question, I am not necessarily bound to follow him into every aspect of social life, and to subscribe to his theories thereon. The honourable and learned member studiously refrained from quoting any of the leading Socialists of England ",78
561,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I quoted Bax, Morris, and' Hyndman.",78
562,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I never heard Hyndman quoted in connection with the viewswhich the honourable and learned member has been puttingbefore us to-night. But what about Blatchford, the most - represent tative Socialist in England at the present time ?",78
563,Mr MCDONALD,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"And John Burns. . Mr WATSON - Yes , I include John Burns. But first I shall refer to Blatchford, who is the most representative Socialist in England today, the man who, at thismoment, exercises a greater amount of influence than any other on the working classes of England. What is the view of Blatchford? He saysI would sooner give up the Empire, or give up wealth or fame, rather than the old-time institution of marriage, and the right to marry the woman I love.",78
564,Mr THOMAS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,Why did not the honourable and learned member quote Blatchford ?,78
565,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I quoted the international manifesto of the Socialists. I could noi quote every individual leader of the party.,78
566,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"We are not responsible for the opinions expressed by continentaP - economic writers. Does the honourable and learned, member, as an individualist, hold himself responsible for the views expressed by every anarchist who cares to subscribe to his doctrine, and who wants to tear down and burn and destroy and ravage right through the'land?",78
567,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I have never expressed my .sympathy with the anarchists.,79
568,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"But the honourable and learned member is a pronounced individualist. He ""will not deny that.",79
569,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I do not.,79
570,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"The honourable and learned member is an individualist, and so is every anarchist; ergo, the honourable memberis an anarchist, and is responsible for every statement which may be made by those who subscribe to his doctrine of individualism.",79
571,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I do not approve of anarchists, or of their creed.",79
572,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"No ; but every anarchist believes, with the honourable and learned member, in the fullest individual liberty, and if the honourable and learned member carried his own doctrine to its logical, conclusion he would, to his own surprise, find that he was an anarchist. I desire to show the ridiculous nature of the honourable and learned member's argument, by quoting from Lecky. I suppose that the honourable and learned member will acknowledge that Lecky is a high authority on the subject of individualism, as against Socialism-that he strongly denounces .Socialism.",79
573,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Yes , and anarchy.",79
574,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"And that, therefore, the honourable and learned member agrees with him.",79
575,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Wit h me, Lecky denounces anarchy.",79
576,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Le t me quote what Lecky says in connection with this very question of marriage in his History of European Morals, volume II .",79
577,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I have never expressed my approval of Lecky. Mr .WATSON - The honourable and learned member will not wait for his own medicine to be dispensed to him.,79
578,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"If the Prime Minister willshow me a letter of sympathy, which I have written to Lecky, then I shall say no more.",79
579,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I shall show that Leckv gives utterance to views which I should not think of ascribing to the honourable and learned member; although it would be quite fair for me to do so,-because I should only be following the course adopted by him this evening. Lecky says, at page 269Connexions which were confessedly only for a few years have always subsisted side by side with permanent marriages; and in periods when public opinion, acquiescing in their propriety, inflicts no excommunication on one or both of the partners, when these partners are not living the demoralizing and degrading l i fe which accompanies the consciousness of guilt, and when proper provision is made for the children who are born, it would be, I believe, impossible to prove by the light of simple and unassisted reason that such connexions should be invariably condemned. He goes on to say thatThere are always multitudes who in the period of their lives when their passions are most strong are incapable of supporting children in their own social rank, and who would therefore injure society by marrying in it , but are nevertheless practically capable of securing an honourable career for their illegitimate children in the lower social sphere to which they would naturally belong. Under the conditions I have mentioned these connexions are not injurious, but beneficial, to the weaker partner. No concern is there expressed for the poor woman. They soften the differences of rank, they stimulate social habitsA fine stimulation for social habits ! - and they do not produce upon character the degrading effect of promiscuous intercourse, or upon society the injurious effects of imprudent marriages, one or other of which will multiply in their absence.",79
580,Mr GB EDWARDS,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,He praises the prostitute as offering a vicarious atonement for her virtuous sister.,79
581,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Quite so. I make that quotation from the writings of an individualist, in orderto show the unfairness of applying to us the doctrines of those amongst Socialist writers of the Continent who may advocate these lax and, in my view, most pernicious opinions in regard to the marriage tie.",79
582,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"-If one Minister is ito be held responsible for another, one Socialist should be held responsible for another.",79
583,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I should not be so contemptibly unfair as the honourable and learned member was when he sought to make us responsiblefor the opinions he quoted.,79
584,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,I pointed out that the honourable gentleman would not have done what he did if he had known.,79
585,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"This assumption by ths honourable and learned member, that he alone is acquainted with the fact that these views have .been expressed is most amusing. daresay that' there are honourable members on this side, of the House, who, on that aspect of economics, have read as widely as has any honourable and learned member.",79
586,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"Probably . I have found more knowledge of these things amongst honourable members opposite, than amongst other honourable members of the House.",80
587,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"In any case, I can assure the honourable and learned member that there was no question of our being ignorant of that aspect. But what did I say to those who waited upon me? I ask the attention of the honourable and learned member. This is what I said I have to thank you for the kindly expressions conveyed to my colleagues and myself upon assumption of office, and to say that so far general spirit behind the May Day movement is concerned, we are heartily in sympathy with it. What is that spirit?",80
588,Mr MAUGER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The spirit of brotherhood.,80
589,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"It is the spirit of humanity; the spirit of those who care f the poor and lowly; of those who are prea pared to make an effort to interfere with iron law of wages, and with the coldber, blooded calculation of the ordinary political economist. That is the spirit which recognise as being behind the May Day movement. It is not in anv way circumsaid scribed by any mere declaration of this that plank of a platform, but is the motive of those who will leave no stone turned, and no experiment untried, in their efforts to benefit humanity.. That is the spirit with which we are heartily in symof pathy, and I can challenge any honourable member to say that he is against it.. At late hour I shall not say any more. As who has always had a personal regard for movement the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, I am sorry indeed that he should have so far forgotten himself as to follow the course which he has pursued this evening.",80
590,Mr CONROY,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,The honourable gentleman should not take it personally; T pointed that out ,80
591,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I am not taking it perwith sonally. I know that the honourable learned member would not be guilty of an aspersion. But I do take it as an aspersion upon the movement with which I have been connected, and on the tens of thousands of people who are behind the Labour Party, and who are just as strong as the honourable and learned member for Werriwa can posand sibly b.e in their determination to uphold all that makes for purity in our social life. Ouestion resolved in the affirmative. I SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT . Motion (by Mr WATSON) agreed toThat the Plouse, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next. ADJOURNMENT. PERSONAL EXPLANATION. Motion (by Mr WATSON) proposed- That the House do now adjourn.",80
592,Mr WEBSTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H," I should not detain the ""House at this late hour, were it not that it has come under my notice that the honourable member for Lang during his speech yesterday made a number of state-r ments concerning my career, which I was our not present to listen to, and to which I as the 'think I should make some reply. When I spoke in the debate which has just concluded, I stated that.the honourable member at one time contested an election as a pledged labour candidate, and is now opo r posed to the party of which he was once member. That was a perfectly legitimate the statement to make, but the honourable memI understand, entered upon a long dissertation with regard .to my past history. II have no reason to fear any investigation of it. First of all, the honourable member that I was a free-trader. I plead or guilty; .but I was never a fanatic. He has said that I was an alderman and a coununcillor. I plead guilty again. I was an alderman and a councillor for six years, and in those capacities I have left a record which I have no occasion to be ashamed. He went on to say that the Labour this Party was started in New South Wales in one 1898, and that he was. the father of the in that State. I cannot confirm that statement, because I took part in the' initiation of the movement in New South Wales, and I have no knowledge of the honourable member being in any way interested in it at that time, whilst I am glad to say that it has since grown beyond any possible danger of identification the honourable member. In the early and days of the movement in New South such Wales a number of men set to work",80
593,Mr SPEAKER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"When the honourable member for Lang was yesterday referring to this matter, I did not allow him to proceed. He, thereupon, closed his references to matters which are now being discussed, went on to deal shortly with matters of Government policy. Having prevented the honourable member for Lang from continuing to make a' statement, which I considered unfair, I must now ask the honourable member for Gwydir not to traverse the same ground, and, if he thinks it sary to do so at all, to refer to these matters quite incidentally and most briefly.",80
594,Mr WEBSTER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I was not present when the honourable member for Lang spoke, and I do not know to what length he was allowed to go. I am aware that, he said a great deal respecting myself, to which I propose to reply. The honourable member has said that in the electorate in which I lived for twenty odd years, I received, ' on one occasion, only eleven votes. honourable member knows well that that statement is not correct. He is aware that I was nominated practically in error, and that at the time of the election I was working the whole of the day at my trade. He is aware also that my opponents circulated the rumour that I - had retired, and when my supporters were informed by members of my own committee that I had retired, they, of course, did not vote for. me. I was practically a retired candidate, but I could not remove my name from the ballot-paper, because the law would not permit me to do so. The honourable member for Lang has made this statement with a view to disparaging me, leaving it to be understood that in my own electorate, where I had served the people in the council for years, I must have lost public confidence, since I could poll only eleven votes. That is a wilful misrepresentation, and I have a right to contradict it, seeing 'that it has gone forth to the public.",81
595,Mr FISHER,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"But the honourable member has been returned now. Mr Webster. - I realise that; but it is not a question of my being returned; it is a question of these misstatements going out tp the public. The honourable member finally said, according to the . remarks I heard, that I was ""consistent in my inconsistency."" I have been in the labour movement since its inception, and I did not, nor would T, agree to nomination under the domination of a party which had usurped the functions of the first Labour Party, by engineering the first labour platform on which that party split asunder in its first Parliament. The single taxers wrecked that party. But I insisted in bringing into power the solidarity party, and in framing its pledge, under which I have fought six hard fights-tw o against members of the association to which the honourable member belongs, who were unpledged labour men.. . It is because I fought against those men 3M in two elections and maintained the solidarity movement, to which I am pledged, neces- that these statements are made on the floor of - the House. The fact is, I am here as a successful man, while he is here, not as a labour man, but as one who, having signed the labour platform, "" went back "" on it, and was returned to this House as the result of his mysterious appointment as secretary of the Free-trade and Reform Association. He was elected after a hard fight over the method of his selection, and thus became a member df The this Legislature.",81
596,Mr WATSON,MAIL COMMUNICATION WIT H,"I should have said earlier, that I expect the House to be prepared to make a start with the Arbitration Bill on Tuesday. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.53 p.m.",81
