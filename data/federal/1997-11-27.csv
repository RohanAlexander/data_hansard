1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Wooldridge, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (9.31 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes to amend the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The amendments will give effect to a part of the government's package of reforms to private health insurance. The reforms contained in this bill will: engender a positive and competitive environment in the private health sector; reduce some of the cost pressures on health insurance premiums; make contracting more attractive between the various parties; and help consumers by reducing the problems of often large and unexpected out-of-pocket expenses and multiple medical bills. Private health insurance has been the subject of inquiries by the Industry Commission and by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The package of reforms contained in this bill responds to those recommendations requiring legislation that could be dealt with immediately and incorporates the reforms announced by the government on 19 August 1997. The commission also made a number of recommendations that require further analysis and development. The most important of these is unfunded lifetime community rating, which the government is now examining to determine its feasibility. Unfunded lifetime community rating is designed to balance the age distribution of fund membership, make private health insurance more affordable for young and old alike, and reward loyalty for people who are members for long periods of time. There are also reforms that do not require legislation. The government has decided to establish a second-tier default benefit which would apply where there is no contract between a private hospital and a fund but where the hospital has in place arrangements for informed financial consent and simplified billing and evidence of an appropriate level of treatment. Australians overwhelmingly support Medicare and the universal access to public health services that this entails. Yet, at the same time, over one-third of the population still has some form of private health insurance. Clearly, we have a universally available public health system which is highly valued by most Australians. At the same time, many people also want to have choice of access to the private health sector. The government supports this choice. The key for most Australians to this access is private health insurance, with approximately 80 per cent of private hospital episodes funded this way. The previous government's policy position was to say that private health insurance in the private sector was simply supplementary to Medicare. It grudgingly acknowledged that the private sector existed but that this was a minor role compared with the taxpayer funded system. In sharp .contrast to this monocular view,this government is focused on the total health system-public and private. The private hospital system is an essential ingredient in the nation's health care mix. The community needs to have access to the existing range of beds and services across both the public and the private sectors. It is a matter of common sense to maximise the use of our existing acute capital stock-both public and private-rather than simply commit billions of extra dollars to funding new public hospital beds. The government's message is loud and clear: the private sector is a vital complement to the long-term viability of Medicare and the public hospital system. Importantly, this is not just idle rhetoric. Active and positive steps are being taken to ensure that private health insurance is a realistic choice for those Australians who wish to maintain it. This bill introduces reforms to private health insurance that build on the government's private health insurance incentives scheme and the adjustments to the Medicare levy for people on higher incomes who have chosen not to insure themselves privately. I will now outline the main elements of the reform package. The first set of the reforms will make contracting between funds, hospitals and doctors more attractive. The private health insurance legislation introduced by the previous government relied on contracting between funds and doctors to address a number of issues affecting private health insurance, including the incidence of unknown out-ofpocket· costs. This legislation has been a spectacular failure, with only a handful of doctors prepared to enter contracts. The Department of Health and Family Services estimated when it first came into place on 1 October 1995 that, within two years, 20 per cent of doctors would have such arrangements. Today there would be less than a handful of doctors around Australia who have been prepared to do so. The result is that consumers have continued to experience often large and unanticipated out-of-pocket medical bills. It is vital that we achieve greater certainty for consumers either through informed financial consent, so that they know in advance the out-of-pocket costs, or, even better, through securing agreements for 100 per cent cover for their medical bills. Schedule 3-paragraphs 5, 6 and 7-will for. the first time allow health funds to pay medical benefits above the Medicare benefits schedule (MBS) to doctors who have practitioner agreements with private hospitals. And, as is currently the case, practitioner agreements will only be permitted where the hospital also has a fixed cost contract, known as a hospital purchaser-provider agreement, with the fund. The effect of these new arrangements will be either to exclude out-ofpocket costs altogether or to allow for a predetermined amount of such costs known by the person in advance. The level of payment for in-hospital medical services will be· negotiated between the hospital and the doctor concerned. Such payment may be on whatever basis the hospitals and doctors choose. Examples include a percentage of the MBS fee, a retainer or some other agreed block payment. Where doctors have practitioner agreements, the bill enables the 75 per cent Medicare benefit to be paid direct to the health fund. In these circumstances, the assignment of the Medicare benefit by the patient to the fund will be mandatory. This will greatly simplify the billing and claiming process for patients. In other words, doctors will no longer have to negotiate only with the funds, which is a key objection that the medical profession has raised and steadfastly maintained since 1994. Agreements will be negotiated by the people directly involved in providing care to patients, who will then be able to provide services for no or known out-of-pocket costs and with greatly simplified billing and claiming procedures for the patient. Furthermore, paragraph four of schedule 3 will require all agreements offered by funds or hospitals to include a clause guaranteeing the general professional freedom of doctors to identify the appropriate treatment for their patients within the scope of accepted clinical practice. With the exception of the price arrangements entered into by the parties, which will remain commercial-in-confidence, and information relating to individuals, which will be confidential, the agreements will be open to public scrutiny. Both patients and doctors are correctly worried about US-sty Ie managed care. I have worked in the United States and seen the situation where funds have used their market power to dictate or limit clinical decisions. I am not prepared to allow this to happen in Australia. This legislation· protects the clinical independence of doctors within the boundaries of accepted clinical practice. It is the first time that this principle has been enshrined in law in Australia. With the threat of US-style managed care removed from the equation, I am confident that doctors will be more willing to negotiate arrangements with private hospitals. O! course, it remains entirely their call. Many will choose not to, and they have the right to do that. Nothing in this legislation changes that. I hope the profession understands that their cooperation is absolutely essential if private health care sector is to remain viable which depends largely on private health insurance continuing to cover a large proportion of the population. The second set of amendments removes unnecessary costs on funds, improves the regulatory environment and makes refinements to existing legislation to improve the operation of the industry. Schedule 1 will tighten the definition of 'health insurance business' to reduce the potential for new products entering the market to undermine the government's commitment to community rating. Products have been, and many more could be, designed which are risk rated. But they e-fectively provide health insurance by exten.dmg the number and range of conditions, drawmg on the model of trauma insurance and basing payments on estimated hospital and medical costs. The changes to the legislation will make it clearer that products of this nature cannot be marketed other than as community rated health insurance, while leaving legitimate trauma and life products in place. Schedule 2 replaces the current provision which requires the payment of benefits at an acute rate for the first 35 days of hospitalisato tion, irrespective of whether acute care is provided. The new regulation will provide for a determination of benefits for nursing home type patients on the occasion where acute care is provided. Schedule 4 will allow changes to reinsurance arrangements to be made by a disallowable instrument and facilitate necessary changes to reinsurance that may become necessary in the future. Schedule 5 restructures the Private Health Insurance Administration Council with a new board independent of the Department of Health and Family Services and the industry. It will include a commissioner and two to four other individuals. The changes were recommended by the Industry Commission. Schedule 6 contains a number of measures that will assist the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner to provide an effective and efficient operation over the next ·few years, by which, time information will be available to assess whether more substantial powers are required. The the commissioner will also be renamed the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. Paragraphs two and three of schedule 7 extend the maximum waiting period for obstetr-c.s from .nine to 12 months. Extending the waItmg penod to 12 months will help to reduce some of the cost pressures faced by the health insurance industry from so-called 'hit apd run' patients, who join knowing that they will have to use the product and then leave immediately, making everyone else pay more. Schedule 8 will allow the assignment of Medicare payments for in-hospital medical treatment by the patient to another party as part of an approved simplified billing arrangement. This will encourage the development of simplified billing arrangements for patients treated by doctors not covered by agreements with either health funds or hospitals. Para':' graphs one, two and three of schedule 11 will make it clear that for-profit organisations are on. the - ame footing as not-for-profit organisatIOns m terms of applying for registration as a health fund. It will facilitate the transition of existing non-profit funds to for-profit status, if that is their desire. The reforms in this bill have the potential create an environment which is more attractive to not only new players but also the Australian community through the development of health insurance products that truly offer value for money. They also form part of a comprehensive package of related measures to make the most of our existing health care assets, both public and private, and to ensure that Australians can look forward confidently to assured quality health care. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. . Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. TRANS-TASMAN MUTUAL RECOGNITION BILL 1996 Consideration of Senate Message Senate's. amendment(1) Schedule 3, clause 2, page 53 (before line 1), at the end of the clause, add: Trade Practices Act 1974 of the Commonwealth, Division 1A of Part V Fair Trading Act 1987 of New South Wales, sections 26, 30, 31 and 38 Consumer Affairs Act 1972 of Victoria, Part IV, sections 57C, 57D, 59 and 61A Fair Trading Act 1989 of Queensland, sections 81, 83, 85 and 85A Trade Standards Act 1979 of South Australia, sections 23, 26A and 33 Consumer Affairs Act 1971 of Western Australia, sections 23Q, 23R and 23U Fair Trading Act 1987 of Western Australia, sections 50 and 59 Goods (Trade Descriptions) Act 1971 of Tasman"" is, sections 16 and 17 Sale of Hazardous Goods Act 1977 of Tasmania, sections 6, 7 and 8 Consumer Affairs and Fair Trading Act 1990 of the Northern Territory, sections 25, 30 and 38 Consumer Affairs Act 1973 of the Australian Capital Territory, sections 15FBA, 15FCA, 15FB, 15FC and 15FD",13
3,Mr TRUSS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (9.43 a.m.)I move: That the amendment be agreed to. The opposition moved an amendment to the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill in the Senate to include under the special exemption category safety standards implemented under the Trade Practices Act and similar state and territory legislation for products such as child car restraints and disposable cigarette lighters. On consideration of the issue, the government supported the opposition amendment in the Senate. The amendment will result in product safety standards being subject to a harmonisation program along with other products covered by the special exemption mechanism, such as motor vehicles, therapeutic goods and gas appliances. The harmonisation of standards between Australia and New Zealand will achieve the same outcome of lowering nontariff barriers to trade, as was envisaged by the mutual recognition agreement. Question resolved in the affirmative. CUSTOMS LEGISLATION (ANTIDUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 Cognate bill: CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 June, on motion  That the bill be now read a second time.",16
4,Mr CREAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Hotham) (9.45 a.m.)Dumping is a threat to our manufacturing industry at any stage. That is why a country like ours, which seeks to build its manufacturing base, needs to ensure that it has in place effective anti-dumping legislation and speedy procedures by which that legislation can be acted upon. That is a position that is required in normal circumstances. We face a potentially bigger threat in terms of dumped product coming onto our markets at the moment because of the spreading and significant Asian economic downturn, the consequent oversupply in those markets, and the desire for them to ensure that that supply is sold. That is why we believe that not only the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997 but also the government's bill to implement the recommendations of the Willett report require urgent introduction into and urgent action in the parliament. Anti-dumping measures are not about protecting Australian industry, they are about ensuring fairness so that our manufacturing industry does not have to compete against unfair or unrealistically fixed prices. That is the fairness aspect, so let no-one pretend that strong anti-dumping legislation is about protecting Australian industry. As I said before, the current Asian economic circumstances establish the urgency of this. This is but one of, two pieces of legislation that the government should be bringing on urgently for finalisation. The other legislation relates to a report which the government commissioned when it came to office to implement an election promise to cut the length of time it took to run an anti-dumping case. The government made an election promise to reduce the number of days to 155. It commissioned a report to tell it how to do that. The government got the report that showed how to do it consistent with our international trading and WTO obligations. It then got too hard, and the government said it was going to refer it to the Productivity Commission for implementation. The government has not even framed the terms of reference to the Productivity Commission, and it has taken no action to ensure that Australian manufacturers can operate in circumstances in which they are not threatened by unfair prices coming in and undercutting the market. Anyone who has been to the north of was Tasmania or into Gippsland recently knows the problem that the pulp and paper industry is facing from the threat of dumped product from Indonesia. Jobs are at stake and commudone nities may be wrecked. The livelihoods of people are under threat because of this government's inaction. These are people who have shown commitment by lifting ty, embracing new technology, changing work practices and making a commitment to developing world-class operations. To try to force the government on these issues, Labor has introduced two private sidered members bills. We have taken the initiative again, as we did with the car and textiles industries and the ship and book bounties. Labor is setting the agenda for industry policy in this country. This industry policy would cost the government-if it could actually grapple with it-nothing. This legislation expedites dealing with cases and ensures fairness in the way in which we assess er product is being dumped. This is the easiest form of industry policy available, and the government has again failed to act. We had the matter of public important yesterday on the government's failure on industry policy. We listed anti-dumping one of the things on which the government has failed. The minister sitting back from table, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), has responsibility for customs area, even though his senior minister has responsibility for the policy. Whenever the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourthat ism (Mr Moore) is asked a question in the parliament, he flick passes it. He writes letters to people telling them that he has policy responsibility, but he will not be held accountable in the House. Let's face it, he is a hopeless minister. This is an example of having responsibility, but obtaining money under false pretences because he is not prepared to act upon it. The bill before the' house was actually introduced in June of this year. It was the last act of the former Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs. Mr Martin-Which one?",16
5,Mr CREAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Mr Geoffrey Prosser. This his last official act. This bill was introduced by the government in June. But when is it brought on for debate? The second last week of the year. What has the government in scheduling priority in the Senate? It has not given it priority. Our campaign on this has embarrassed the government into bringing the debate on in the House, but it is productivinot serious about it. The legislation will not be able to be dealt with by the Senate until at least March of next year. Between now and then, according to the government, China is going to be cona free market for all products. This is your decision, made not on the basis of any policy impera6ve, not on arguing the case as to why we should treat China as a market economy, not on arguing the toss, but simply on having been forced to introduce this legislation because of a botch-up by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer)-as he now is-in his capacity as Minister for whethTrade when he was in China last year. Over there, embarrassed by the fiasco they created by scrapping the DIFF scheme and anxious to create an environment of cooperation in trade, when the Acting Prime Minister is asked, 'Will you consider treating as China as a market economy to improve trade between the countries?', he agrees to do so. the Tim agrees, in private, without any discussion. In the process of doing that, they this thought they could allow this approach on a case by case basis. They allowed it in the case of a product called glyphosate, a product would be well known to consumers who need herbicides for either gardening or farming purposes. It is used in Roundup and Zero. It is a product that was produced in this country, but no more. A potential investment in this country, an $80 million investment, has now gone to Argentina because of this decision of the government on glyphosate-an $80 million investment lost, along with hundreds of jobs. Mr Truss-Absolutely wrong!",17
6,Mr CREAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Absolutely right, Minister. You know it. You have let Australian industry down and you have got no commitment to job creation in this economy. It is about your inaction and your inability-and from someone who used to wax lyrical in this parliament about how China was a terrible dumping threat to this country. Remember when you were going on about the peanut growers in your electorate? Do you remember that, Minister? Mr Martin-A great speech.",18
7,Mr CREAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It was a terrific speech, because he was actually prepared to stand up for his industry then. But that is the trouble with this government-they only stand up for the industry when they are in opposition. Get them into government and they would not have a clue how to act. You are a hypocrite, Minister-an absolute hypocrite. I hope members of your electorate understand that you will talk tough but you will not act when you get the responsibility. You have the chance to introduce a sensible piece of legislation. You have sat on it. You have had this portfolio for months now. You have not insisted on bringing it on as apriority, nor did dumping? you argue for its importance to be dealt with by the Senate. This is· a campaign which Labor has run with the industry. Mr O'Connor-We have to do everything for you blokes.",18
8,Mr CREAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"As the honourable member for Corio says, we have to do everything for you. You have got no idea. So we will continue to run the embarrassment campaign. We will continue to get your members in this House to stand up and we will see where they vote with regard to their constituencies. Where will the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) be when it comes to looking after the workers at the Burnie paper mill? Where will the member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent) be when it comes to sticking his hand up to support Labor's bill to protect the workers at the Maryvale mill? These were the people who went around their electorates telling textile workers that they supported them yet, when Labor introduced its bill to freeze tariffs, they sat on the other side and voted against it. The hypocrisy will continue to be exposed. This government created the problem that we have got, which this bill seeks to effect, more than a year ago when they decided to treat goods from China on a case by case basis. This, it would seem,resulted from a trade-off for the botch-up over the DIFF scheme. Despite the fact that we have asked the Deputy Prime Minister questions, we have had no explanation in this House as to what he said, and why he said it, to Madam Wu; no explanation at all. I challenge the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), when he has got the opportunity to reply in this debate, to tell us what did take place in those discussions and why we are facing the circumstances of China now being treated as a market economy. This has not occurred through any policy imperative that they came and explained, so why did they do it? What was the basis of the discussion? What was the compelling case put by China to our Deputy Prime Minister that convinced him to do what no other country in the world does in the way they treat China for the purposes of antiWhat we have seen here is a government that have mishandled the matter. It has resulted in their thinking they could do it on a case by case basis. With this one product, glyphosate, they thought they could treat it on a case by case basis, but now, having allowed one in, the position is that all goods from China have to be considered as coming from a free market. In the case of glyphosate, this is where the position really gets bad for the government, because there was overwhelming evidence that the export and domestic pricing of glyphosate from China was government controlled. We asked the minister in the parliament whether he was aware of a notice of the coordination meeting on the pricing of glyphosate. Understand the imagery of this: China, according to the government, is a free market economy. Free market means market forces run. You do not sit down in cartels or monopoly arrangements and fix prices together. You would have to accept that the latter does not fit the definition, Minister, of a free market. He has turned off. I cannot even get a nod from him. Maybe he does not understand what a free market is. Do you accept that a market is not a free market if there is price fixing going on? Do you accept that? What we have got in the case of glyphosate is this-and this is a quote from the notice that the government had; a notice that they tried to pretend was confidential and therefore could not be released. Mr Truss-Pretend? Haven't you seen the letter?",18
9,Mr CREAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Did you see it and why didn't you act on it? That is the question. You knew about it. We were not expecting you to make it public but it has been made public in frustration because of your botched handling of this whole issue. We do not expect you to make this issue public if in fact it has been handed to you on a confidential basis, but if it is handed to you on a confidential basis, don't you think you have got to act on it? Do you think if it is handed to you on a confidential basis that you ignore it? Only a dope would do that. What we have got here is advice to the government of which it should have taken notice in deciding whether or not to treat China as a market economy. This is what the note says: The China Chamber of Commerce for Metals, Minerals and Chemicals, the International Cooperation Department of MCI, the Production Coordination Department of MCI, the CCPIT Sub-council of Chemical Industriesa nice little grouphave decided to call a conference of glyphosate prices. That does not sound like a free market to me; it sounds like a bit of collusion. But we are just people who read the words. Maybe people like you read them and want to interpret 'something different. They go on to say: Through the event, it is hoped that through the efforts studies on the ex prices and export prices limit will be well studied. Mr Truss-Ah, 'export'!",19
10,Mr CREAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Here he falls in. He wants to quote selectively. What this notice says is not just 'export prices', which was your defence in this House, but also 'on the ex prices'-ex prices and export prices.In other' words, domestic prices. You dope! He sits here and tries to pretend, under the fiction of the fact that this only applies to export prices, that there is no collusion in China on glyphosate. Mr O'Connor-What hope have we got?",19
11,Mr CREAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"As the member for Corio points out, what hope have we got with you? What hope has Australian manufacturing industry got. What about your peanut farmers, Minister? You talk tough for them, but this is no indication that you are prepared to act for them. The simple fact of the matter is this: this government, despite evidence to the contrary, has determined that China is a free market and that has resulted in glyphosate being allowed to come into this country from China. That saw Monsanto make the decision to invest in an $80 million plant not in Australia but in Argentina. It is not as if the government did not know about this. Monsanto warned the government about the consequences of their action. I might just quote from a letter that they wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 22 November 1996, more than 12 months ago. They wrote to the Prime Minister because they thought that this was such an important issue. They had no confidence in your predecessor. They had no confidence in the industry minister. In that letter to the Prime Minister they said: As a company, we have several manufacturing facilities in Australia which recently announced plans to invest a further $80 million into Australian manufacturing. The movethat is, the move by you to treat China as a for coordination market economycreated much doubt as to the soundness of any such investment. They warned the government and the Prime Minister in that letter that, unless this issue was fixed, the investment would be lost to the country. I would be interested to know whether the Prime Minister ever responded to the company. There seems to be no record around. This is a Prime Minister who not only cannot lead; he closes his eyes when presented with an issue. 'Close the eyes and hope it goes away' is the Prime Minister's philosophy in life. 'It will not be a headline tomorrow; don't have to deal with it. It's not a crisis today; don't have to deal with it.' It is a crisis now, 12 months down the track, because the $80 million investment in Australia has been lost, jobs have been lost and regional development has been lost-all because the government has failed to act. I said before that Australia's position on this is unique. No other OECD nation treats product from China in the way your government does, Minister. Why is it that we have to take this stupid lead? I can understand leadership, but this is stupidity. This is a circumstance where there is no pressure on us to do it, there are no international pressures and no precedent. It is simply a request, presumably to the Deputy Prime Ministerwho is feeling pretty guilty because we have axed some effective export programs-and he agrees. No consultation, but look at the consequences. They are not the only consequences. The fact of the matter is that other significant investments have also been threatened or lost as a result of the government's U-turn following what happened. Pilkingtons employment-they produce glass; it is a very important industry in the member for Corio's electorate-has declined from 1,022 to 746. They have lost 276 jobs. We have lost 100 jobs as a result of the Monsanto failure and we have lost the $80 million investment. Garmond picture framers have laid off 20 per cent of their work force, including highly skilled craftsmen, and ACI Fibreglass is contemplating its position on fibreglass manufacturing in Australia. Wep done, Minister! This was the government committed to creating 200,OQO new jobs in manufacturing and all they have done is to drive them backwards. As I say, this does not even cost them anything. This does not even involve the so-called business welfare that they like to label the other business programs with. They could not run a manufacturing policy for this country if they tried, and that is the disgrace of it all. That is why we are seeing employment fall in this country and that is why we need more urgent, more effective action. There is no deliberate policy imperative in what this legislation does. The bill is not putting in place new policy which is being consciously determined. It is about fixing the mess created by the incompetence of the Acting Prime Minister. Market status in anti-dumping cases was offered to China to make up for the government's foreign policy failings in areas such as the axing of the DIFF scheme. Mr Truss-Wrong!",19
12,Mr CREAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Let us hear your explanation and, most importantly, tell us why you have sat on this for the past six months as a government and why you have given it no urgency in the Senate. Tell us why this exposure to dump product from China is still going to persist for at least the next three months. Tell us why, Minister, you have only got a half-baked response in the House and you are not even prepared to back it with legislative support in the Senate. What we are stuck with is a hybrid case. The government have not only mishandled the DIFF issue in China, but because of the way they have mishandled the issue we cannot restore the previous arrangements. Once one product is allowed in it has to apply to all of them. We are stuck with the hybrid case by case arrangement. The question now is: how do we make it work? This legislation does not provide the answer to that question. It results in the de facto recognition of practically all Chinese product as being from a free market. The legislation fails to take account of the market situation for inputs within each industry sector. Take shirts, for example. This is an easy example to understand. Under the government's legislation, provided the finished shirt is sold in China in a free market circumstance the determination of its price takes account of what happens in China. But what if the material, the buttons, the power and the machinery all come from state owned enterprises, all of which are capable of fixing the price? Under this legislation, that set of factors cannot be taken into account. One of our amendments-I am foreshadowing at this stage we will be moving amendments in the consideration in detail stage-redresses that position. It requires the circumstances of inputs to be taken into account in determining whether China is the case example or whether some surrogate pricing arrangement should apply. I am pleased to hear that the government has recognised that its legislation as introduced is inadequate and that it will be moving some amendments. The amendments go some of the way towards meeting our concerns, but not far enough. The amendments that the government has proposed are unsatisfactory. They fail on two counts. In an effort to address the fundamental issue of input prices, which are government controlled, the amendments propose 'flexibility' in addressing inputs. A better word, I suggest, would be 'uncertainty'. The government input price can be ignored, it can be accepted or it can be substituted with the cost of that input from another country. That is at the minister's whim. So understand this: you have got flexibility at three different levels. For prices, it is in at Customs consideration level, out at the Anti-Dumping Authority; in again at minister level or the reverse. We do not want flexibility, we want certainty . We want to know whether input prices are properly considered. Our amendments seek to do that. Besides creating huge uncertainty, the amendments will add even greater complexity to an already complex piece of legislation as proponents argue which surrogate country should be used for each significant cost input. The amendments that the Labor opposition will move propose a similar trigger system if greater than 10 per cent of the input is government controlled. In other words, if inputs represent 10 per cent, then a surrogate country test is required. Total surrogacy would then become, as it was before, the way in which we would treat cases in relation to China, not the alternative so-called free market arrangements. The amendment to subsection 269(SF) further compounds the uncertainty in the legislation. In circumstances where foreign government price control is identified, discretion is allowed as to whether or not to establish a normal value inquiry in a free market country. The amendments that Labor is proposing do not allow for that discretion. The second major count where the government's amendments fail is the recognition that in economies in transition industry sectors still exhibit substantial government control because of the presence of state owned enterprises trading at distressed prices. These industry sectors do not represent a free market and domestic prices should not be accepted as a basis for normal value. Again, the amendments that we are proposing cover this by ensuring that, where there is substantial government ownership in a sector, surrogacy should again apply. Take again the example of the shirt. Sure, you can have a whole lot of shirt manufacturers producing in what is considered to be a free market. But if there is a state owned shirt company as well that finds itself in difficulty and forces the prices down, what do you think the domestic prices have got to do? They too have got to drop to compete. Yet, in the input circumstances of the government's bill, no account is taken of the significant influence that a state owned enterprise would have. Again, the government has recognised that problem in this bill, but it has only come up with a half-baked solution which creates uncertainty because of its proposed unwarranted complexity. We are saying that this bill is deficient. We are also laying the charge that the government is not serious about amending it. The government has been forced into it only because we came in and said, 'Do something because there is a lot of concern out there.' They are not serious about doing it because they have not given it priority. So far I have mentioned cost. The other point that I would like to make is this: the bill that we introduced on Monday provides the real alternative. It is what the government should be embracing. In essence, the amendments that I am foreshadowing pick up the thrust of what my new bill proposes. But I think it is important to understand that all of what Labor is proposing is consistent with our international trading obligations. In conclusion, I would like to read from a memo which I sought from the Department of the Parliamentary Library when we submitted our bill to them for consideration. The conclusion they came to was: In my opinion, the amendments proposed by the Customs Legislation (Economies in Transition) Amendment Bill 1997my billdo not reach article 6 of the GATT and in particular do not propose a method for determining normal value which is prohibited. We are proposing a sensible solution consistent with WTO trading obligations. We should support the amendments.",20
13,Mrs STONE,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I rise in support of the Customs LegIslation (AntiDumping) Amendment Bill 1997 and Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997, which aim to amend the Customs Act 1901. In particular these amendments will provide for a special approach to determining normal values of allegedly dumped goods from countries that are in a process of transition from a controlled to a market economy. They will also clarify the provisions which relate to the manner in which interim dumping and countervailing duties are collected, in particular to ensure that interim dumping and countervailing duties can be imposed prior to the final assessment of duties payable. Dumping is the term used to describe the selling of goods in foreign markets at prices lower than those achieved in the home market which causes material injury to industries in the importing countries. Australia has a long history of attempting to protect its domestic markets from dumped imported product. In fact, we began legislating against unfair trading practices as early as 1921. In recent times a code of practice has been developed by the World Trade Organisation which aims to achieve some conformity in the member nations' definitions and administration of anti-dumping laws. The WTO has recognised that there is the potential for some countries to try to disguise non-tariff barriers as anti-dumping actions, especially in this increasingly globalised world economy. It is important to Australia that we support the WTO in its efforts to enforce fair anti-dumping regimes amongst its signatories. And, of course, we need to ensure that our own legislation is fair and works in the nation's jnterests. It is always amazing to me to hear how a member of the opposition, previously in government for some 13 years, becomes very indignant that our government in its first 20 months has failed, they say, to act, when for 13 years we have had a substantial problem in terms of industry being able to deal effectively with product dumped into this country. Suddenly they become extraordinarily upset, but it took us only a few months in government to tackle the· problem. It is amazing what opposition does to you. In June 1996 the then Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs commissioned a review of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing duties administration. It was one of his earliest acts. The so-called Willett report has since made some important recommendations which have been welcomed by industry. We have already moved to shorten the time it takes for anti-dumping actions to be processed. Australia has long been committed to the concept of free trade. Successive governments have supported this policy . We have been amongst the first in the region to lower tariffs and to abolish quotas. Successive Australian governments have determinedly put aside barriers to expose our industries to head-on competition from imports from countries where there is cheaper labour, bigger economies of scale, or longer experience of producing world best product. Successive Australian governments have had to do this to ensure our long-term survival in the new era of globalisation and as a nation that is export dependent, in particular in the sector of primary production. While our actions show we are serious when it comes to fair trade, we have also made ourselves a target for unfair competition from dumped product. Countries are lured by the reality of our zero or low tariffs and quota restrictions to attempt to put their product into our domestic markets at prices way below their normal value. Effective anti-dumping systems are therefore of profound importance to this nation. Our government recognises that. Most of our Australian industry must be able to generate sufficient profit from domestic sales to invest back into their enterprises to make them world competitive. Indeed, for many, their very survival is dependent on a swift and adequate response to the importation of any dumped product. These amendments are part of this government's response to the challenge to protect our Australian manufacturers and producers from unfair competition through dumping. Industry can then provide the employment and generate the wealth that this country needs to maintain our standards of living. The most important amendments before us in this debate deal with the problem that arises when an anti-dumping inquiry needs to determine normal values of goods from a country that is moving from a government controlled or planned economy to a market economy. Of course, China is the obvious example of just such an economy in transition. Under current legislation, an investigating authority needs to determine normal values for goods exported from command economies by reference to information obtained in a surrogate country. However, Customs has received legal advice from both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the international section of the Attorney-General's Department confirming that this subsection is severely limited in its application. It requires that the government of the country of export has a substantial monopoly on all trade of the country-not just in terms of the goods under investigation-and must also substantially influence the domestic price of all goods in that country, if a surrogate is to be used. Our proposed amendments are necessary because, although the governments of economies in transition may still maintain controls over the domestic selling prices of a significant number of products, they may not have control to the extent currently required under subsection 269TAC(4) to allow the use of surrogates. Our amendments will allow normal values to be ascertained in cases of economies in transition on a case by case basis after reference to other relevant information, including the selling prices of goods in a surrogate country, in situations where Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority are satisfied that the exporter's domestic selling prices for the product under investigation are subject to government control or substantial government control. An issue of concern acknowledged in the time that we have been developing these amendments is that subsidisation may occur at various stages in the manufacturing and export of product from a planned or evolving economy. And this is what the previous speaker, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), was getting so excited about. We understand this issue and we are dealing with it through these amendments. We know that subsidisation may occur at various stages of the manufacture and export of product from a planned economy or one in the process of transition. For example, the foreign government may control all or some of the prices of significant raw material inputs into the manufacturing process. During the deliberations of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee considering these amendments, industry strongly represented its concerns about the need to take into account any continued state subsidisation of raw materials in a transition economy. Therefore, our proposed amendments being debated today will enable investigators to also consider raw material inputs into the production of allegedly dumped goods when that raw material input is supplied to the manufacturer by a state owned enterprise and where that raw material input is significant, meaning that its cost to the manufacturer exceeds 10 per cent of the total production costs. There is nothing flexible about that; there is nothing discretionary. It is absolutely clear and gives certainty. These amendments, and those that allow a case by case decision to be made in regard to whether or not a sector is still state controlled in an economy in transition, will mean fairer dealings for iridustries in the future. As I have said, Australia, with its low tariff and quota regimes, is particularly vulnerable to exporters of dumped goods, and processed food is a prime example. The food and agribusiness industries in the electorate of Murray that I represent generate around $1.8 billion worth of food products annually, and $1 billion of this value is generated in export markets. Some of Australia's primary industries have led the way in adapting to a reduced tariff regime to become internationally competitive; for example, in cereal production and dairying. Agricultural industries such as the dairy, sheep meat, beef and fruit industries are receiving their lowest levels of government sponsored assistance in decades. Our food processors face mature demand for their agribusiness products in the domestic market. They must export to survive. On the other hand, the domestic market is essential for some 30 per cent of the beef returns and over 50 per cent of sheep meat, dairy and fruit sales. The few fruit processors left in Australia have both branded and generic labels which they produce under licence for domestic retailers. Prices paid in the domestic branded and generic labelled markets give fruit processors like SPC and Ardmona in Shepparton and Mooroopna the returns to invest in new product research and development. This is essential if they are ever to compete internationally or, indeed, defend and grow their own market shares in Australia. If the domestic markets are corrupted by dumped product, the prices for all goods competing in that category are driven down and, as we have seen too often, the local manufacturer does not survive. When you have a manufacturer like a fruit processor cease to be in a region like Murray you lose jobs, you lose towns and you threaten the future of a region. Typically, one of the early industries to evolve in a newly industrialising country is large scale food processing. Canning technology, for example, is comparatively simple. The product has a long shelf life and does not depend on the cold storage that Third World kitchens typically lack. As levels of agricultural productivity improve, countries like China quite quickly tum to food preserving through processes like canning to tum their surplus into opportunities for earning foreign currency. Australia is now seeing food importation competition from countries like the Philippines, China, Taiwan and the European Community. No Australian manufacturer can claim protection from competition from importations which conform with our health and safety regulations, are labelled according to our regulations and are priced appropriately. What our Australian industries should be able to insist on, however-and they do-is that anti-dumping regulations and processes are fast, can be put into effect simply and are fair and workable. These amendments move towards producing that sort of legislation. Just one season of unfair competition from dumped product can mean the end of an Australian manufacturer which could have survived under fair trade circumstances. We do not have any more time to get this right. Labor spent years thinking about it; we are taking action. These amendments, which recognise that an economy may be in transition and allow the use of surrogate markets for establishing normal values where the actual sector is still government influenced, are sensible and fair. They are also, of course, totally WTO consistent. We must also ensure that our AntiDumping Authority and Customs have a realistic appreciation of how difficult it is for an Australian company to get the detailed data on normal values that they have to produce to prove their cases. For years, it has not been easy for Australian manufacturers, compared with other industries in other countries, to deal with the anti-dumping laws and policies in Australia. The authors of an article entitled 'An evaluation of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing law and policy' which appeared in the October 1995 issue of the Journal of World Trade concluded: An examination of the Australian standard used to determine whether a causal link exists between the injury and the unfair trade practice reveals the strictness with which the Australian law is applied as compared to the standard used overseas. Starting with the GATT Anti-Dumping Code, which does not require that injury from the dumped imports be the major or only factor causing injury . . . the United States International Trade Commission need only show that the unfairly traded imports were a cause, but not necessarily the major cause, of injury. Let me remind you that this is 1995-in the era of Labor. The authors sum up by saying: Given the imprecision with which the ACS and the ADA determine the causation requirement, some concern on the part of domestic applicants may be justified in those cases where the investigative authorities assess the impact of the several potential causes of injury. Let me assure you that the industries in Murray had many concerns during the era of Labor. Companies in Australia have had a very mixed experience. Let me tell you about SPC and Ardmona. KPMG has been usecJ by these two companies to try to help them to prove alleged anti-dumping cases. I will quote from a report by KPMG: Ardmona Foods Limited and SPC Limited ... have been involved in two major dumping/countervailing inquiries: (i) canned peaches and canned pears exported from China, Greece and Spain; (ii) canned tomatoes exported from China, Italy, Spain and Thailand. On 27 June 1991 Customs announced a negative preliminary finding on an application for dumping and countervailing duty notices against exports of canned peaches from China, Greece and Spain. Customs found that canned peaches from: - China had been neither dumped nor subsidised; - Greece had been both dumped and subsidised; - Spain had been subsidised but not dumped. Customs went on to find that the Australian industry had suffered material injuryand note thisbut that the injury could not be causally linked to the subsidised and dumped imports. The Customs negative preliminary finding was referred by the Australian Industry to the ADA for review. The ADA disagreed with the Customs' assessmentnot surprisinglyof normal values for canned peaches from Spain, Greece and China and found that all three countries were dumping canned peaches. The ADA agreed with Customs that canned peaches from Spain and Greece were subsidised. Contrary to Customs, the ADA found that the material injury being suffered by the Australian industry was causally linked to the dumped and subsidised imports of canned peaches from Greece, Spain and China. The ADA went on to complete its inquiry and made a positive final finding imposing dumping and countervailing duties on imports of canned peaches from China, Greece and Spain. No wonder the industries of the era of the previous government were somewhat confused and vexed about how serious we were about effective anti-dumping legislation. Last year SPC and Ardmomi""asked for a continuation of the anti-dumping and countervailing measures-given the automatic expiry of the measures after five years-using the unamended legislation that had been in place for quite a number of years. Over the five years, the European Community had continued with its system of fruit production processing subsidies, and they well and truly remain in place. In other overseas markets-for example, in Germany-my industry saw that China continued to sell canned fruit at a third of the price of the Australian product. Their assumption was that the product was being dumped, and therefore they alleged that dumping was continuing in those other markets overseasin this case Germany. For the continuation of the measures to occur, the Australian companies had to produce data that showed that import prices potentially would be below the normal values of the product. Unlike in the initial case, Customs does not go to the foreign country to obtain the facts. It is incumbent on the Australian manufacturer to do the work to produce the data to prove the case. It is extraordinarily difficult for a small companyperhaps with only a handful of employees-to go offshore into perhaps China or parts of South America to produce data that is going to be convincing for the ADA and Customs in Australia. The Canned Fruit Industry Councilof Australia, acting on behalf of SPC and Ardmona, engaged consultants in an attempt to help them. After this work was done, however, the measures against China in relation to canned pears were not continued. There is at the moment no protection in Australia should there be dumped product coming from China. The manufacturers will have to bring another case and, by the time they bring that case, the damage may be done. Meanwhile, the measures against Spain in relation to peaches were also not continued, but in the case of Greece, the ADA chose to continue the countervailing measures. Quite an extraordinary result. In the statement of essential facts released in December 1996, the Anti-Dumping Authority stated that the applicants, SPC and Ardmona: . . . did not claim material injury to the industry producing canned peaches. This is part of the problem for Australia at the moment. We need to continue to work on our anti-dumping regulations-because how can you claim material injury in a continuation case when you have had five years of protection in the immediate past? It would be very difficult for any industry to claim material injury when arguing for a continuation. If the measures have worked at all, then the industry should not have suffered material injury in the time that the measures haye been in place. So we still have to do some more work beyond these very necessary amendments to ensure the best possible anti-dumping measures are in force in Australia. Labor left us with a situation that concerns industry, and therefore must concern this nation. The new Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) is working as hard and as fast as he can to make sure this government has the very best legislation in the future. I therefore strongly support these amendments. I represent an electorate that is dependent on exports and is very vulnerable to dumping. People in my electorate strongly support these amendments. I commend the amendments to the House.",22
14,Mr MARTIN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It is always a pleasure to enter into a debate in this place involving measures to combat anti-dumping because it has been-as was said by the last speaker in this debate, the member for Murray (Mrs Stone)-a vexed issue that has faced governments of all political persuasions. Cutting through the usual rhetoric-where the government would say, 'You were in government for 13 years. Why didn't you do something about it?' and we would stand up and say, 'But you've been there, coming in on the back of promises to do something. Why haven't you brought legislation. through more quickly?'-and putting both sides of the argument to one side, it is important that we address the issues at hand. Measures are being addressed by the government at the moment which they believe will go part way to addressing some of the real problems facing the dumping of goods into Australia which would be to the detriment of Australian industry . That said, I am sure the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) would not be surprised to find that I am in agreement with my colleague the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)-in that I say to him that the two private member's bills which stand in the name of the member for Hotham probably do go further than the government's present measures are proposing and actually contain some very reasonable measures which, I would hope, the minister would take on board. In the honourable member for Murray's presentation, she talked about SPC and Ardmona and used as the case example the time that was taken for the Anti-Dumping Authority and the Australian Customs Service to become involved in looking at the problem; she talked about whether or not Australian Customs officials or Anti-Dumping Authority officials actually travel overseas to try to investigate for themselves; and she said that reports are written to the minister and then other reports are written to the minister from the other authority, from a different department and so on. Listening to her presentation, I could not help but think it is no wonder that confusion does exist. That is why the member for Hotham has proposed that that split in the relationship be merged-that there be just one organisation that takes responsibility in the future for investigating and acting on anti-dumping measures. I cannot help but concur with that. He has suggested, and I am sure you will be delighted about this, that it reside within the Australia Customs Service and that Customs have that full responsibility, with the necessary resources to enable them to very quickly investigate the charges that are often brought by Australian companies that are starting to feel the pinch in respect of dumping issues. . For those people who are not quite sure of what we are talking about here, I point out that we are talking about the fact that, at different times, Australian manufactudng companies and Australian rural producers believe that they are being subjected to competition which is unfair-competition which emanates from a foreign country, from foreign producers where the market in which they are located can in fact be corrupted. The member for Hotham spoke at length about the glyphosate issue and about the interpretation of China's present status-whether it is an economy in transition, a market economy or a command economy. The simple fact is that, if you look at the way in which the political leaders of that nation would want to see China go at the moment, they want to have it as a mixed economy. Certainly, they want to see it moving very much to an economy which is earning foreign resources. They are embracing a form, I suppose, of more economic liberalisation-the likes of which have not been seen, certainly in that country, for quite some time. If one goes, particularly, to Southern China, state: although this is now an issue which is spreading throughout most of the country, one can see for oneself the way in which that is being embraced. That, in itself, is good in terms of raising economic and living standards for people in that country. But, by the same token, what it can do, when you take into consideration the manufacturing processes that are involved-and in the case of the example used by the member for Hotham, glyphosate, where directions were still being given in a planned economic way-is cause problems, particularly if the product that we are talking about then suddenly finds its way into Australia. If, as the member for Hotham has indicated, that has caused an Australian manufacturing operation to move offshore, that indeed is a great disadvantage for this country. I think there is no doubt that in this place members on both sides recognise that there is, at the moment, something of a crisis of confidence in much of manufacturing industry in Australia. There is a crying need for an industry policy to come from the new government-an industry policy which says, in terms of manufacturing, that we clearly have in place assistance programs where required and the economy's fundamental right to give that support to industry. . Part of that support mechanism that is necessary is protection from dumping. Part of that mechanism is the need to have in place a regime whereby, if a claim is made about economic disadvantage because of products being dumped in Australia-whether they be peaches and pears, which manifestly affect the producers in the member for Murray's electorate, or whether they be any other product that we are talking about-there is a process in place for a speedy resolution of those issues. I know that the latest minister is aware of this because he commented upon it when in opposition. The member for Hotham referred to the fact that he stood up in this place and gave a passionate defence of the peanut growers in his electorate some time ago and, at the time, claimed that Australia was 'a dumpers paradise' because of the dumping of Chinese peanuts. At the time, he went on to Upon return to government, we will slash the amount of time taken to determine the anti-dumping and countervailing cases and changes to the material injury test to ensure that an industry does not have to be decimated before remedial action can be taken. If there is any bias, it should be in favour of the Australian industry rather than the importer. . These were very reasonable sentiments expressed by the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs at a time when he was on the back bench defending the peanut growers in his electorate. But as the member for Hotham has rightly pointed out, and has been pointed out in a series of articles' in the media, it has taken a degree of time, and in some cases a bit of pushing and shoving and dragging three ministers kicking and screaming, to actually take some positive action by finally bringing to this place the legislation which we are debating today. I might also say on that point that when the member for Hotham was making his contribution and said words to the effect, 'It has taken a long time for this bill to actually get to the House. Why don't they hurry up and get it through if they are so concerned about this,' the minister for customs retorted words to the effect, 'Why don't you bring it on in the Senate?' I might remind the honourable minister that it is the Liberal-National parties that are the government and that in the Senate they and not the Labor Party, the opposition, control the way in which legislation is brought on for debate. It is not the opposition in this place that has control over that. That is why we have delays being occasioned in that place in respect of another piece of important legislation, which has finally seen the light of day over there today-and, of course, I am referring to the Wik bill. There is no point in the good minister suggesting that we are causing delays. We are not. This bill was listed for debate in this place, I think, at least three times in the last six weeks and withdrawn at the last minute, not by the opposition but by the government. It is finally here now. It is a bit disingenuous for the minister to come into this place and say that the Labor Party is delaying its implementation and its passage and that if we had put it on the legislative program in the Senate it would have got through. I think the minister, as I say, is stretching it a touch there. It is not only the member for Hotham or me in my role as the shadow minister for customs and small business who have been raising some issues about this anti-dumping issue. I refer the House to an article written by David Forman in the Australian newspaper on 5 November this year under the headline 'Antidumping minefield explodes'. There are three pretty reasonable pictures there. I think the present minister would be quite happy. His smiling face looks out from the newspaper. What it does do is illustrate that in the 20 months that this government has been in charge of the treasury bench there have been three ministers for customs dealing with these issues. First it was the member for Forrest  area. He was the one responsible for the decision in respect of China that we are giving some consideration to today. As the member for Hotham rightly pointed out, we are trying to fix up the mess that was made because of changes to the DIFF program. When the Minister for Trade, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), was chatting with Madam Wu in Beijing he said, 'We will try to do something for you. We will treat your economy slightly differently to the way we have in the past and the way we treat every other OECD nation in terms of anti-dumping and that should satisfy you.' There was the trade-off. That is how it has come to pass. Poor old Geoff Prosser was left to deal with that. After he went, Senator Chris Ellison became the new minister for customs. I think it was only a matter of weeks that he was in that portfolio. As David Forman reports in this article, there was an investigation in his time into the penalty duties due to expire applying to PVC from numerous countries. That article goes on to say: It recommended to Senator Chris Ellison that the duties be removed from all countries except Japan. But Ellison ignored their advice in relation Canada, China, France and Thailand, extending duties against them. At least two-China and Canada-are understood to have written formal letters seeking an explanation, and others have made informal approaches to the Government. Part of the Government's explanation to The - ustralian was that there was evidence of dumping mto other markets by some from these countries. So, last year evidence that China was fixing export prices did not convince the Government not to be more lenient with its exports. But by this year Australia was willing to use the finding of another country's anti-dumping authority ahead of the advice of its own authority. That adds to the confusion that I am sure people in the business community, the small business community and the farming community have when they see anti-dumping issues being raised and they see some differences of opinion and interpretation and, ultimately, decisions being taken by successive ministers in the same government. It might be well and good to stand up and level some criticism if it was ministers in different governments of different political persuasions, but when we are talking about changed decisions being made by ministers in the same government then people are entitled to ask a few questions about that. Another question arising out of this is the government's response to those countries that wrote in respect of that matter of PVC and whether or not the government has taken that on board as part of its decision in terms of the legislation that with us today. There are a couple of other elements that are also worthy of touching on. I am sure every member of this place would have been following with some concern the Asian currency crisis, so-described, that is affeoting so many of our trading partners. You cannot help but ask the question: if IMF support is being sought for the likes of Indonesia, Thailand and even South Korea, economic difficulties are being experienced in Japan and real concern is being expressed for China as it embarks upon this march towards a much more liberalised economic regime, what happens in those countries if in order just to survive they suddenly decide they are going to export and dump in other countries product which will unfairly compete against locally manufactured goods? That is a real probability and an issue which I think the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs and the Anti-Dumping Authority need to be extremely vigilant about. There is no doubt that, if we are seeing some fundamental problems in what had been described as the Asian tiger economiesemerging economies-and those with whom Australia, over the last 10 or so years, has been looking to cultivate very close trading relationships, we have to start to ask the question: should our anti-dumping organisations, the Anti-Dumping Authority and the Australian Customs Service, become a touch more vigilant about the potential for product being dumped in markets like Australia because of those concerns and those difficulties in those Asian economies? The other issue which is important and which I briefly touched on was the fact that a number of small businesses are affected by anti-dumping measures and by cases which are launched. The member for Murray rightly pointed out the difficulties that companies like SPC and Ardmona had in running anti-dumping cases. You can imagine what small businesses have to experience as well. It is a costly exercise and to prove material injury is not an - asy thing. As we have also seen, using the example that the member for Murray has used, to get agreement between is the Anti-Dumping Authority, the Australian Customs Services and then the variety of ministers that we have had in this portfolio is not an easy thing to achieve. As a consequence, if you are a small business that is trying to get into the export world and trying to utilise facilities that might be there to try to branch out and create jobs in Australia, they need to be aware that they are going to get some sort of protection from dumping of product in an unfair competitive environment. As was said earlier, there have been delays in bringing this legislation through, but for small business that is nothing new. For example, at the end of this year we are still debating the fair trading legislation in this place. There is no chance of that getting through the Senate this year. It will get to the Senate some time in March at the earliest. There is also that secret little clause that noone seems to have picked up in the government's bill that says it does not take effect until six months after royal assent, yet somehow the good Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has convinced the small business community that, come 1 July, all their problems are going to be solved. They are not. Again, the anti-dumping bills that we have talked about are not going to get to the Senate this year. They are not going to be considered by the Senate this year. Because of the Constitutional Convention that has wiped out the two sitting weeks in February, it is going to be at least March before they are considered in that place. Again, the unfair dismissal laws in small business, which had a second run in this place yesterday, are not going to be debated here, I would imagine, in the next week or so-or they might if we are looking for fillers until the Wik legislation gets through. As for the Senate getting a second run on it, again it will be next year. The same goes for the changes that the government has now foreshadowed in its backdown over the choice of superannuation funds. Once again, all of these sorts of issues that this government said were priorities for small business-fair trading, anti-dumping, unfair dismissals, superannuationhave not been completed at the end of 1997, yet this government maintains that it can keep its legislative program on track. As I said earlier, we have had three customs ministers dealing with the problems of antiAmendment dumping. In all of that time there has been only one industry minister, that is, John Moore. You have to ask the question: if Truss had identified such a huge problem when he was a backbencher, as the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) remarked on a little earlier to the member for Murray and to the minister, why has it taken this long to get the payable. legislation here to do something about it? If Mr Truss, now the minister for customs, had identified back in 1992 that this was a probries lem and reckoned that the government of the day did not do anything about it, why has it taken until the end of 1997, some 20-odd investigating months following the election of this governcountry's ment, for the bill to come before us? The minister for industry has not bothered to answer any questions in this place that have been posed to him on this issue. He simply squibs it every time the member Hotharn asks him a question on anything. is becoming almost a waste of time to ask the minister for industry any questions because certainly does not elicit any answers to very lected. important matters that we have brought forward. The member for Hotham's own private members' bills are here. As I said in quite genuine way to the minister before he left the chamber, we would maintain that all of what is in the member for Hotham's two private members' bills, which go to the issue of dumping, needs to be addressed and should picked up by the government. But it may be that only elements of those fit in with the government's policy. We understand that. That is politics. That is what creates opposition and a government. But it cannot all be bad. I would simply say to the minister for customs: have a look at what the member for Hotham is suggesting. It is extremely good legislation that he is proposing. Never mind the rhetoric about 13 years too late and all that sort of nonsense. The legislation is there and it is a genuine offer which I think the government should pick up. (Time expired)",26
15,Mrs BAILEY,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I rise today in support of the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Bill 1997. The purpose of these bills is to provide a new method for determining on a case by case basis the normal value Mr of goods exported from countries whose economies are in transition from command to market economies and to ensure interim dumping and countervailing duties can be imposed prior to a final assessment of duties As the legislation stands, it has no provision to appropriately deal with goods from countwhose economies are in transition. Current methods are limited in their application because there is no flexibility available for authorities to treat exports from whose economies are in transition differently from exports from other countries. The proposed amendments will bring the legislation in line to reflect the dynamic nature of world markets, ensuring our Australfor Ian industries remain protected from the It illegal dumping of goods. The amendments will also clarify the manner in which interim he dumping and countervailing duties are colEffective anti-dumping legislation is vital for our Australian industries, which trade in an increasing fiercely competitive global a marketplace. Anti-dumping measures are essential to ensure fairness in international trade to protect our industry from unfair competition. These proposed changes are antinecessary to protect Australian industry, be Australian jobs and Australian investment. Since 1921, Australia has legislated against the internationally recognised unfair trading practice of foreign countries dumping their an products into Australian markets or, put simply, foreign countries selling their goods at prices lower than their normal value or the price paid on their domestic market. The only result of such practices for our Australian industries has been to place our Australian products at a severe price disadvantage and to cause Australian companies severe financial hardship. If this situation were to be left any longer we would see Australian jobs at risk. At the core of this problem has been the difficulty of establishing what is 'normal value' of goods. The concept of a 'normal value' has been one of the basic issues when determining whether dumping has occurred. In the case of command economies, anti-dumping action was required on the basis that prices and costs were not acceptable because of government control. Until recently"" an alternative, surrogate market was usually selected and the 'normal value' was determined as if the surrogate country was the export source. However, as countries such as China have undergone such dramatic economic changes, such a regimented approach is not only inappropriate but also unworkable. The current legislation has provisions to deal with products from countries whose economies are government controlled and also has provisions to deal with countries whose economies are market based, but. there is no provision for countries where state owned enterprises coexist in a market with joint venture enterprises and wholly owned foreign enterprises-all operating in the same market-within a country that is in transition from the controlled command economy to the market based economy. This poses a problem. How are we meant to assess the normal value of goods from countries which are in transition? The answer is that we have been forced to treat their products as if they were from either a command economy or a market based economy like, for example, the United States. This is patently unfair and threatens the interests of Australian industries because transitional economies are influenced only partially by market forces, with government control still existing on the domestic selling prices of a significant number of products. To allow such products onto the Australian market without appropriate duties would unfairly disadvantage Australian products and falsely lower prices. Australian industry is aware of countries whose economies are in transition and holds genuine concerns about the risk of their products being dumped into our markets. The rapidly changing Chinese economy is a case in point. I have recently been to China and seen first-hand the vast amount of foreign investment, especially in manufacturing and agriculture. There is no way that China can be described as still having a command economy, especially in the southern provinces. However, the Chinese government continues to have an influence over the economy through measures such as production controls and still determines or influences the prices of some products through the input costs of raw materials. At the same time, some regions have embraced the capitalist economy with such fervour that prices are genuinely determined by competitive market forces. This transition has significant implications for the treatment of anti-dumping cases in Australia. This is especially so when considering the spread of manufactured goods available from China, which has expanded so rapidly, as China has encouraged more foreign investment and replaces its state owned enterprises with joint venture enterprises. Two-way trade between Australia and China is valued at around $A7.8 billion. As a government, we must perform a delicate balancing act. We must continue to encourage and facilitate trade between countries but, at the same time, ensure that our industries are not disadvantaged from artificially low prices by ensuring that we have strong and effective anti-dumping measures in place. This is why this legislation is so important. There is an urgent need to have the legislation in place that allows countries such as China to be treated as countries whose economies are in transition from command to matlket economy. Any changes to the method of determining normal value of goods exported to Australia from transitional countries need to be flexible to accommodate the complex nature of industry ownership and production in these economies. For this reason, anti-dumping action needs to be done on a case by case basis with consideration of specific circumstances of certain goods. The legislation will allow investigating authorities the flexibility to determine normal value by reference to other sources, not just surrogate information. These sources must be relevant and credible and can include information from, for example, trade journals as to the prevailing prices, other information relevant to the cost of production of the goods under inquiry and information supplied by the Australian industry in its dumping complaint. I am particularly pleased that the government has listened to the concerns of industry and will initiate further reform to assist our Australian industries. I refer to the concerns raised about not only government control over the domestic selling price of goods but also government control over the price of raw materials used in the manufacture of goods. Industry has argued the need to investigate the source of raw materials used as subsidised inputs that could lead to an artificially ·low domestic price for manufactured goods and therefore distort what was defined as normal value. The government has listened to these concerns and agrees that investigators should be able to examine both the domestic selling price of any goods in question and the cost of significant raw material inputs in the production of those goods. Such a method of assessment would enable anti-dumping investigators to examine raw material inputs into the production of allegedly dumped goods when that raw material input is supplied to the manufacturer by a state owned enterprise and the cost of that raw material input exceeded, for example, 10 per cent of the total production cost. At the end of the day, the amended bill will give the minister the flexibility to use a range of options when determining normal value appropriate to each situation. The legislation will permit different methods to be applied in determining normal values for each exporter. Not only will this result in a quicker decision but also industry will be assured that all relevant factors have been taken into consideration, in stark contrast to practices of past. There is no doubt that there is a need for greater flexibility in our anti-dumping laws to cater for countries in transition from command to market economy. Industry needs legislative certainty in which to operate in global markets and to make decisions. This legislation will provide that certainty. In keeping with this objective, the bill proposes to amend the Customs Tariff (AntiDumping) Act 1975 to clarify the way that interim dumping duties and countervailing duties are collected. The effect is to ensure that duties can be imposed in respect of exported goods to Australia prior to a final assessment of duties payable on those goods. These changes will clear up the ambiguities of the current measures and provide provisions which will commence retrospectively. This will ensure that duties collected since the commencement of the provisions, which was I January 1993, are not subject to legal challenge. The introduction of provisions for transitional economies and the clarification of anti-dumping duties have been widely embraced and supported by industry. This is evident in ICI Plastics' submission to the Senate Selection of Bills Committee in September, which stated: The need to introduce effective legislation as soon as practicable cannot be over-emphasised. A number of Australian manufacturers have fallen foul of the current legislative void with many more awaiting implementation of effective legislation which provides an element of certainty of process before proceeding with applications. This legislation has implications for the future profitability and investment plans of every Australian industry that competes with products, be they in a raw or manufactured state, from countries in transition, such as China. If we are to operate in a global, free trade environment, it must be on a fair basis. As a government, we must be able to undertake anti-dumping investigations on a case by case basis in relation to transitional economies to ensure that our anti-dumping laws provide a fair and effective trading environment and legitimate safeguards for our industries. The issue of anti-dumping is one of balance between facilitating trade between countries the and ensuring that our Australian industries are not disadvantaged because goods are dumped on our market at unfair and distorted prices. This legislation achieves this balance, because it effectively deals with a major anomaly that has been allowed to distort the global market. This stands in stark contrast to the neglect and inactivity of the previous government. I listened with great attention to the comments made previously by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I refer specifically to some of the comments made by the member for Hotham. In his address to this House, he had the audacity to say that the opposition had taken the initiative in this debate. How the member for Hotham has the audacity to stand in this place and make comments like that is absolutely beyond me, especially when we remember that it was the member for Hotham in the previous government who had direct responsibility in this area. The member for Hotham went on to comment about the possible loss of investment and jobs. He also had the temerity to speak about regional development that had been lost. I stand in this place representing the electorate of MCEwen, a very large and diverse rural regional electorate of Victoria, where so many businesses in past years had to operate under the administration of the previous government. They had to compete so unfairly. They had so many pressures put on them by the previous government, particularly by the member for Hotham. It was the deliberate policy action of the previous government that caused so many of my farmers and small businesses to go to the wall. Here this morning we had the member for Hotham, of all people, stand in this place and criticise government, which has only been in office for 20 months, for inaction which has caused people in my electorate to go to the wall. The hypocrisy of the member for Hotham knows no bounds whatsoever. While he spoke in very moderate terms, I would have to say that the member for Cunningham really falls into the same category as well. As the current shadow minister for small business, how dare the member for Cunningham have the audacity to stand in this place and ask us as a government where our priorities are for small business when he was a member of a government that for 13 years conducted inquiry after inquiry into small business. The previous government conducted approximately 17 different inquiries over 13 years. What, might I ask, was the result of all those 17 inquiries? The result was absolutely zilch, nil. No action whatsoever was taken on behalf of small business. They are the very people that this legislation we are introducing is designed to assist. It is designed to protect them from unfair trading practices. How dare the member for Cunningham make comments like that. I would like to know exactly where the priorities are of those who sit opposite. Time· after time, we listen in this place to each member of the opposition criticise us as a government for inaction when they had 13 years in government. It is all very well for the member for Cunningham to say in his opening comments, 'Look, let's put all of this aside.' I cannot do that. I would be lacking in my responsibility to the people I represent in my electorate of MCEwen if I did not stand in this place and remind those who sit opposite that it was their inactivity, their neglect, their lack of prioritising what was needed for small business in this country, that placed so many of the people in"" my electorate at risk.",30
16,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It is obvious that this government is suffering from stunned mullet syndrome. The members of the government are acting like a bunch of stunned mullet. They are unconscious. To follow the member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), it is interesting to look at the falsity of the allegations that were made this regarding reports. The high dudgeon and sheer ignorance which have been shown in this debate is really quite tragic. Anyone reading the Hansard or listening to the speeches would wonder what we are arguing about because it appears that we are all saying the same thing. That is because the ignorance of those opposite is so manifest. This government started off with a mad rush last year. The question of dumping and anti-dumping goes back a long way. The legislation we are amending was passed in 1975, but it goes back more than 50 or 60 years. Every country has problems of that nature, and those problems keep changing. We were not surprised when the government initiated an inquiry last year into anti-dumping measures. If we had been in government, we would have done the same. We have had regular inquiries into dumping because it is something that should be looked at regularly, and by people outside the system, because there tends to be a lot of vested interest· and a lot of institutionalised thinking. The Willett report was produced for the government in September of last year. This was a major achievement-a review of dumping measures with a view to tightening them up to make them more effective. What happened? The report hit the wall. Not one of the 23 recommendations has been put to this House by the government. The government is a stunned mullet, an unconscious fish. It is a government in suspension. There was a mad rush to review a major area for the economy and for our community. The report was very proactive and positive. What happened? It was shelved. Then a speaker in this place talks about inquiries into small business-falsely, deceitfully and wrongly-in speaking about amendments which should be about the Willett report, but which are not. The member for MCEwen criticised the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who has actually started to move on the Willett report recommendations by putting forward legislative proposals that would enact the recommendations which the government received over a year ago. She then stood in high dudgeon and talked about audacity. The members of the government are stunned mullet-that is the only way to understand it. Nothing else makes any sense. International trade is complex and it is constantly changing. I cannot recall the number of times that I have spoken in this House on dumping measures, because every month there is a different issue, a different measure. For example, let us look at light globes. Light globes might be fairly simple things-and we all get flashes of inspirationbut in trade terms they are very complex. If you go to the supermarket you will see light globes made in Australia, light globes made in Brazil, Italy, Belgium, France or almost anywhere in the world. Shoppers do not ponder why this is so, they basically just want to buy a light globe. But there are industry implications of that. When there are only a small number of light globe manufacturers in the world, there is a constant battle for market share and problems with what to do with oversupply. Over time, governments of both persuasions have battled this problem of having light globes brought into the country effectively at dumped prices. If one takes action on Belgium, hey presto, the next week they are coming from Italy. If one takes action on Italy, then they come in from Brazil-often from the same company, which simply shifts its sources around the globe. A constant process of change is going on. We have had a hiatus for two years in this place. Since this time in 1995, parliament has been in suspension. The members of the government are a bunch of stunned mullet. They started off with the Willett report last September. We all though that was terrific and that we would finally see some action and would be able to catch up, because in this business you have to keep running because the world is moving all the time. We have stood still as a country, just like stunned mullet caught in the spotlights. Read the speech of the previous minister for  brought in the legislation. He was caught in the spotlights in June. We had this great fanfare with the Willett report and its implications. What came out of it? Capital 'F' Flexibility which, translated to industry, means capital 'U' Uncertainty. This legislation does not provide a better environment. It is simply legislation that does something, but it does not produce certainty and it does not improve the investment environment or the trading environment. . All that bluster, hyperbole and hype that went on for months and months as to how, somehow, the Labor Party was pro dumping in this country and how we had somehow been negligent, ended up with the damp squib of this legislation. To his credit, the for Hotham has proposed an the bill which those opposite should understand and accept. That amendment goes to certainty so that it is absolutely clear everybody how it is going to work. The idea that the minister is going to how to apply and interpret this legislation terrifying to most businesses. Quite frankly, which espouses free trade, we have $12 it should be terrifying to it minister. potential for competing interests, competing lobbying and competing claims, institutionally and publicly, is horrendous and represents quagmire of possible litigation and absolute uncertainty. The sophistication of modem trade and cated; manufacturing investment within and between countries is immense. The idea that somehow a minister sits in Canberra in his little ivory ly tragic. tower saying, 'I know that 10 per cent of this investment is out of Taiwan, 35 per cent is out of Singapore, 40 per cent is out of Hong Kong and it's all affecting the price of goods made in China; I know all of that, I will therefore determine it,' is absolute nonsense. It is absolutely laughable. The tragedy is that we do not get many chances to amend the anti-dumping measures because they are always difficult. This is one of those critical times. If we do not lay down to the markets very clearly and absolutely what the position is, the opportunity will just be lost, it will be wasted. It becomes counterproductive, so this worsens the situahave tion rather than improving it. There is no doubt that at the moment, for example, Australia is receiving dumped steel, but the complexity of proving that is enoropposite, mous. It would take an enormous amount of rushing time to prove it. The current measures probably insufficiently sophisticated to handle what is going on. At the same time, we no longer export steel to America. Why? Because Americans have taken anti-dumping action against BHP. Five or six years ago, we were building up excelpolitical lent export markets 'in America. I have ferred to this in previous speeches. That was going very well. There was scope in America for specialised steels and particular kinds steel that we were developing very well. member America was becoming a very important amendment to marketplace for us. If you look at the graphs and charts on exports to America, the anti-dumping action to and the countervailing measures and duties that were being imposed, those exports were decide wiped out virtually overnight because the is risks were so great. With regard to America, a The billion a year trade deficit-we import $12 billion a year more from them than they import from us. We were building a relatively a small market, involving a few hundred thousand tonnes of steel a year. What happened? Down came the shutters. It was not sophistiit was pretty brutal. But it was supported by their government. And we sit back here like a bunch of stunned mullet. It is absoluteWith regard to this debate, there is no doubt that members on both sides of the parliament want to prevent dutrping. Why didn't we put the recommendations of the Willett report into legislation? No-one has explained that. Not one speaker on the other side has even referred to it. There was no mention of it in the minister's second reading speech. What was the point of commissioning the report? We all 'understand there will' be a need for constant and ongoing change in anti-dumping measures because there is a constant change not in international trading patterns. Companies move faster than governments. They always and they always will. We are always playing catch-up. While we are catching up, our businesses are suffering. We have had a two-year gap, a two-year pause, while those who were like racing greyhounds off into the field after the prey, turned are into a bunch of stunned mullet who did nothing. This is an insult to our businesses and to the issue. I urge those opposite who share my concerns about dumping measures to understand that they are being conned. This is not a issue; this is an issue of survival for remany businesses. Certainly, in terms of investment, it is absolutely fundamental. They should go back to their party rooms and say of to the ministers, 'We want the Willett report recommendations implemented now.' It was brought down in September last year and there has been no sign of any action with regard to it. Why not? If it was worth having it, why wasn't it worth doing something about it? The fact that nothing has been done is a tragedy. J have already referred to the fact that the member for Hotham has moved an amendment which would give some certainty. We still need to go further. We have tried to fix this part of the problem by way of legislation but there is more to it. The member for Hotham has introduced legislation in response to the Willett report because the government has not done so. That bill is now even more important. I know we are seen to be in an adversarial position. I know the perception is that whatever the government proposes, we oppose. That is absolutely not true. An enormous number of things are agreed on in this parliament. Right now, one of the biggest issues facing the whole world with respect to trade and international relations is the insecurity in the financial and banking institutions in Asia. The federal government has given support to Thailand, Indonesia and now to Korea. It would have been easy for us to oppose that measure. Politically, we probably would have won lots of kudos for it, but it would not have been good economics. So we have gone into bat for you guys because you handled it so badly. We have gone in and supported you because you have handled it so incompetently. The fact is we are genuinely concerned about trying to get good outcomes for this country in important legislative and policy areas. To be lectured to by those opposite on this legislation in the way that has been done is not just insulting, it is dumb. They are stunned mullet; nothing else could describe them. They do not understand the problem; therefore, they do not understand the solutions that are available. They are all reading from the same script, written by someone who was out to mislead them. They are not reading their own scripts. It is all the same mantra. They all end up saying that this problem has come about after 13 years. The fact is, the problem we have now, compared with 13 years ago, has changed 13 or 14 times. It will change again next year and the year after, and two or three times per year for ever and ever. It has done so every year for 40 or 50 years. It is a question of how fast we can move. Whatwe are facing now, as a small country in a very large world where individual companies are bigger than us by far, where our economy is dwarfed by the turnover of the big multinationals who trade around the world, where the bulk of world trade is within companies rather than between companies, where we are a relatively small but very honest player in this business, where we are very transparent with very open systems, is that we are in danger of being very dumb. All of our processes go through this kind of public debate. Hence the reason why governments use people like Willett-we have used others in the past-and various other forms of third party analysis or examination of our processes and procedures. Those processes are so important, and it is why so often, on things like Willett, like Mortimer, and various other reports which have been done for the government, you find the opposition agreeing with the bulk of the recommendations and saying, 'Yes, we agree. A third party analysis has been done. We've looked at that objectively. That makes sense. Bring it forward and we will support it.' Why not on dumping?",33
17,Mr CADMAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,You said that about the small business report and now you are opposing it.,36
18,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"We are not opposing it; we are trying to do what Willett was trying to do and what you guys have ignored. We had a bipartisan committee on small business which you, Mr Acting Speaker Reid, chaired. It was referred to earlier in the debate by your colleagues, so I am not straying from debate on the legislation. We worked with the government members on that. We were virtually outnumbered two to one-nine to five. We ended up with a bipartisan conclusion. We started in May of last year, tabled in May of this year and we are only just getting to debate the legislation for the first time this week. Of course, it will not get to the Senate until next year. In that bipartisan committee we travelled the country talking to people: experts and straightforward business people. The government left out key parts of the recommendations. The fact is, they gutted the key parts, they delayed the legislation, and at the same time they ask us for bipartisanship. When we give bipartisanship, what happens? The government plays politics with it. The government should bring forward the recommendations of the Willett report or support the legislation of the member for Hotham. On fair trading, the government should accept the amendments in the Senate to restore the committee recommendations in full, as we did. I get the feeling we live in different worlds. I sat through days of discussions with government members on the fair trading report. We went through it word by word and argued over phrases and sentences to try to reach agreement. A lot of work went into it in good faith.",36
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"The honourable member should endeavour to direct his remarks to the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997. It is all right to explore an analogy, which you have done, but I ask you to contain your remarks to the bills before the House.",37
20,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, if you let me finish you will find out I am actually responding to the earlier comments of the member for MCEwen, which you were not here for. So we went through all that. Then we had government members opposite, who were members of the same committee, berating us about our stance on the report. We are saying that it should be adopted, but the people who sat through the same discussions are now attacking us for adopting what they agreed to.",37
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member should direct his remarks to the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997.,37
22,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I am making observations on earlier speakers' comments. I think if you read the Hansard, you will find I am in order.",37
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Order! The honourable member will bring his comments back to the bills before the House.,37
24,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am allowed to refer to remarks made by other members, particularly in reference to us. That was certainly the case. The member for Mitchell was not here either.",37
25,Mr CADMAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. He is canvassingyour ruling and should be brought to order. .",37
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,I uphold the point of order. The honourable member is debating a bill before the House entitled the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997. He shall contain his remarks to that bill.,37
27,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,The amendment should be supported. (Time expired),37
28,Mr BROADBENT,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It is a pleasure to be here today. Obviously, there is a lot of bipartisan support for the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997. I commend the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) for his contribution. However, I say to the member for Newcastle that this mullet is moving in regard to his remarks that this government has been a stunned mullet on the issue of anti-dumping. That is not the case, as I will establish during this debate. He also said in regard to stunned mullet that five years ago there was an anti-dumping order put against this country with respect to steel with which he is particularly involved, being the member for Newcastle. He actually said that his government had been stunned mullet on the issue. I concur with the remarks of the member for MCEwen, Fran Bailey, when she said it was a bit rich for the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) who had, in a previous government, responsibility for this issue and had failed to move in the direction in which he now intends to move through his private members bill. These are important issues to very reasonable people across this nation. I say 'reasonable people' because I do not like to call them 'ordinary Australians'. The people who work in industries such as pulp and paper manufacturing are not ordinary Australians. They are defending themselves at all times against unfair dumping into this country. I refer at this point to the A team that I have been working with since becoming member for MCMillan. The A team stems from the Australian paper manufacturing plant at Morwell. Those people are absolutely dedicated to the cause of protecting their own jobs. I think that it is appropriate, it is for people to work with their local member through the process of government. That is why I get annoyed when I hear the member for Newcastle saying, 'Look, you're stunned mullet on the issue.' The government has been moving progressively forward on the issue under the World Trade Organisation rules. We are not offending. We can move forward. Equally, the member for Hotham has a right to make a contribution in this House on what he believes would be the best way to go at this time. Today a number of members have raised the point that, in regard to anti-dumping, companies move quicker than governments. Yes, we have restrictions on us. Yes, there are processes that have to be followed. The member for Newcastle said, 'Australia is a small but honest player in the world of trade.' Trade is particularly important, though, to people in Gippsland. I see political shenanigans and political games being played. Everybody has a right to play the games. The member for Hotham has the right to play his games. The member for Newcastle has the right to play his games. I am actually very supportive of this legislation. I think the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) will give reasonable consideration to the bill put forward by the member for Hotham. If any member raises anything in this House that can be an advantage to jobs generated in Australia, then let us get together and support it. There has been a lot of bipartisan effort in regard to anti-dumping. The government, rightly, now has the responsibility and we are working effectively and with genuine intent to make a difference in places like my seat of MCMillan. I read in my local paper that the union wants support for paper anti-dumping bills. The paper says that these bills will be introduced into the parliament and that they have the support of local groups.' As the member for MCMillan, I am very supportive of the CFMEU-the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union-and the efforts they have put into holding their jobs, looking after their jobs, in the industry. They have the support of Maryvale's A team. The team consists of right, a group of people who work on issues like this. They come together to look after Australian jobs in regional areas. It stems from the fact that there can be community input and support from the union as well. The member for Newcastle talked about the 'stunned mullet government'. This anti-dumping legislation is absolutely an important part of what the Howard government has been doing in regional areas. The Howard government has directly supported the dairy industry. They went down there. They said, 'We've got farmers in trouble down there. It is a regional area. We care about jobs in regional areas. We'll support the farmers.' We put a teleservice centre down there for Centrelink. We have the talent, the ability, the assets and the expertise to put in place a service centre for the Department of Social Security that will, I think, be the envy of the nation. It will supply another 140 or ISO jobs, and there is an opportunity for growth. What has this government done about the timber industry in east Gippsland? We implemented the regional forest agreement. It has made a big difference to jobs in Gippsland. But we cannot have jobs affected by other countries dumping on us in such a way that the investment of $360 million in a new plant in Gippsland is threatened. The plant is almost at the point of completion. If other countries dump their paper at unfair prices which do not reflect its normal value it is absolutely right for this nation to, say, 'No, hold on a minute. We know what it costs to produce the paper. You're either getting the raw material at a price that is inappropriate or you're selling under value through support from the government of another nation.' That is what is happening. The member for Murray (Mrs Stone) made a very important point in her address. In fact, her whole address was very good. She said, 'Let's get hright on this legislation.' Even if the government does hasten slowly on this issue, I would rather get the legislation right than have to come back to this parliament and say, 'We made a mistake here. We could have tweaked it here. We could have done something there.' It is very important that this government gives appropriate consideration to the legislation. I know that this government is currently working on a response to the Willett report and, in the fullness of time, we will see the results of that. We are not only a small player in this but also world's practice. We are world's best practice in our timber industry but somebody else is dumping paper on this nation. I do not want to get off the subject, but it is not only the dumping of paper that is an issue; it is also the labelling on the product that comes in, purporting that it is 'just about' Australian made. Of course, it is the printing on the label over the top that can be misleading. As I said, we are world's best practice in the industry. Paper is a waste product. Some of the paper that we produce in Gippsland is from waste product of the timber industry. In the timber industry we have people such as Trevor Smith, Drouin West Sawmills and the Stoll Brothers. Their waste products go into the manufacture of paper. Most of the paper used in this House is made in one of our Australian mills. This government, this party, intends to use Australian paper whenever we possibly can unless some unusual paper is needed. It should also be remembered that we import some pulp from places such as Indonesia. It is a two-way stream. We judge what we need to do as a nation. We cannot be accused of inactivity on this issue. Today the Financial Review said that Customs have found that certain coated woodfree paper sheets from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan have been exported to Australia at dumped prices since 1 January 1996, so we are on guard. I say to Chris Moody and his A team: congratulations on the work that you are doing through your local member, through your unions, through your support programs. I believe they are coming here next week to again put their case about the importance of this anti-dumping legislation, how it affects them and the threat to jobs in Gippsland because of this dumping. I do not to belabour that; I want to talk about this particular piece of legislation. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) took a very conciliatory line today by saying, 'Forget that we were in government for 13 years. I really do not want to talk about that at this stage.' He took a bipartisan attitude. In fact, I thought he was going to debunk the member for Hotham. I hope that the member for Hotham was saying, 'Now I am free from the cabinet solidarity that I had to impose upon myself prior to the government falling, I am now free to support jobs in Gippsland in a genuine way.' I will work with anybody if I can create one more job in Gippsland after the restructure of the power industry and the issues that we have been through down there. I hope that he is genuinely supporting jobs and investment in Gippsland. I notice that there are a number of children watching the proceedings today from the gallery. We cannot afford not to have this legislation go through, because this is about generations of people who will receive jobs, not just about the jobs that are in Gippsland today. It is about the investment that comes through a community working together to make sure that there are jobs for this and the next generation because we are good at something. We have to ensure that we are not be knocked off by another country which dumps a whole lot of their product into this country. The member for Cunningham rightly mentioned the problems in east Asia now which will put a whole new complexion on governments trying to get their goods out at any price to get some money into make a difference in their nation. So we have to be vigilant about what is coming into this country and how we judge what the normal price for the product will be in that country. We cannot allow ourselves to not be watching very closely what the normal price in that country should be. If they are dumping, we have to be on to it as quickly as we possibly can, having regard for the changes that will come forward as time goes on. Dumping is defined as 'selling goods in foreign markets at prices lower than achieved in the home market and causing material injury to industries in the importing countries'. That is why I am on my feet as the member for MCMillan to say that there is a community under threat from goods coming into this nation that are unfairly marketed and thrown into this country. Since 1922 Australia has legislated against the internationally recognised unfair trading practice of foreign countries dumping their products in Australian markets. While we will continue to recognise the World Trade Organisation-formerly known as GATT-we have applied the code of practice which countries are required to observe in relation to the practice of dumping and which administers uniformity in the way that countries govern their anti-dumping laws. It ensures that any anti-dumping action taken in a particular place is not a barrier to trade. So we are not saying at any time that we will put up a trade barrier. We do not mind competition. Competition is good. It creates opportunities and investment. We have accepted that we are not putting up a trade barrier. We are saying, 'Do not treat us unfairly.' I notice that because you are in chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, your report on a fair deal for small business had been raised. I am talking here today specifically about a fair deal for Australian workers under anti-dumping legislation. The purpose of these bills is to provide a new method for determining normal value in respect of goods exported from countries whose economies are in transition from command to market economies and to ensure that anti-dumping and countervailing duties can be imposed prior to final assessment of the duties payable. There are changes going on all over the world. It was mentioned before that companies change more quickly than nations can change. I mentioned before that we have to be vigilant about where we are going and what we are doing. But, importantly, because of the changes overseas-and we see from our daily papers they are happening every day and companies are responding to what is happening in their economies, China being a very good example-Australia has to position itself appropriately with regard .to the goods that come into this nation. We still have a huge deficit in paper products, and we are going to need these companies into the future. As much as this is about jobs in the future it is also about major investment. I repeat that the $360 million new investment in the Latrobe Valley is not peanuts. And it is not toy organisations that we are talking about here; we are talking about a major company with a huge number of employees, all of whom have families. It is a major regional effort that needs to be protected. The members who have spoken previously raised a couple of matters that I would like to address. Australia is under threat from dumping in a number of areas. We mentioned that steel had been stopped from going overseas five years ago. It was also mentioned that governments have been constantly dealing with these issues. Since I can remember, there has been some legislation going through about how we can protect ourselves. This is a government that is moving very effectively and very efficiently on anti-dumpthe ing. There art(those who, for political reasons, will criticise the approach that we are taking, but we are going to take the people with us as we go and we are going to make sure that jobs and opportunities are protected. The government's intention in these bills is to cater for, as I said before, the movement of economies. Industry has said that anti-dumping duties are not de facto customs tariffs, and industry representatives maintain that while Australian industry may be assisted to some extent by various levels of customs tariffs anti-dumping duties are important in relation to specific cases of countries importing certain goods. Industries believe that the customs tariff would be instantly eroded by a dumping case. So there is some urgency, and I recognise that. The need to introduce effective legislation as soon as practicable cannot be overemphasised. A number of Australian manufacturers have fallen foul of the current legislative void with many more awaiting implementation which provides for an element of certainty of process before proceeding with the applications. I raise this because on my return to the parliament in 1996 I watched companies work through the difficulties and complexities of an anti-dumping case. First, they have got to find out what the normal price is of the product overseas. The product may have hit the market already, so the length of time that it takes this nation to respond to an anti-dumping call is important to what is happening. You can have three, four or five months in which the price of a particular commodity that is dealt around the world drops on your local market. If you have not got continuity, especially in the production of paper products, which involves those companies running 12-hour shifts 24 hours a day, you have a real problem on your hands. You have an enormous amount of stocks coming through all the time and your sales have disappeared completely. That threatens the confidence of the people who make the big decisions that enhance the opportunities in regional Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would understand, coming as I do from a regional area, that confidence is absolutely crucial to investment decisions for major companies. As I have highlighted before, a $360 million investment in a paper production plant, along with the plants that currently exist in Gippsland, is not small money. It is a big opportunity and it is the sort of investment that we need in Australia. We have the assets in Gippsland. We have the water. We have the talented people. We have the weather. We have the power. The opportunities are there. Not only are the opportunities there but they are enhanced by government decisions to protect jobs in Australia without moving away at any stage from allowing a threat to those job opportunities and a threat to that investment. This government is moving cautiously towards the best outcome on anti-dumping cases. We will not be rolled. We will not be knocked over. The Howard government--as you will see as these bills progress-has a grand opportunity to send a message out to regional Australia, and that is: those of you in timber are important; Mr Dairyman, you are important too; and the worker in the APM mill is very important to us. We have really stood up a couple of times recently on the greenhouse gas issue and said, 'Hey, I am supporting the power industry workers in Latrobe Valley too.' Under the previous government-if I can be critical for a moment; those sitting opposite will not mind that, I am sure-those people in Gippsland actually felt let down after 13 years. They felt that the government was not delivering for them. They had taken their eye off the ball. We have not. We have actually said on greenhouse gas issues that we are going to support our workers in Gippsland. Now we have said it on pulp and paper. We will continue to support workers in Gippsland.

29,Mr ROCHER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"The Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997 and the Customs Tariff (AntiDumping) Amendment Bill 1997 are designed to do two things. The first is to correct an anomaly that arises from a grammatical error while the second is much more substantive. That part which aims to correct the grammatical error in the primary legislation might appear innocent enough, but it may be sufficient merely to comment that the financial impact of the error is theoretically very large indeed. Having said that, my comments will be essentially in relation to the other bill. The background to the bill, against which it should be considered, may need dwelling upon, as did the previous speaker, the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent), to some extent. Goods are dumped when they are exported from one country to another at prices less than their normal value. Australia can take anti-dumping action when as a result of the dumping material injury has been or is being caused to an Australian industry producing similar goods or when the establishment of a industry producing such goods has been or may be materially hindered. Australia's anti-dumping law is the product of our obligations under the old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, now in the embrace of the World Trade Organisation, its anti-dumping code and the code on subsidies and countervailing duties. The Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 are the principal legislative instruments. Where an Australian company lodges an application claiming dumping with the AntiDumping Authority, the ADA, which administers Australia's anti-dumping system, the ADA must first determine whether there are sufficient grounds to initiate an investigation. Within the statutory period allowed for consideration of a claim, the ADA considers matters including the adequacy of the price evidence produced and whether there is a causal link between the alleged dumping and injury to an Australian industry. Countervailing duties are duties imposed on imports to offset foreign government subsidies to producers or exporters in the exporting country. At this point the House should be aware of the promise made by the government in its election policy, Reviving the Heartland, by reference to the administrative processes for dealing with dumping complaints. In the section headed 'Fair Trade', the coalition promised, amongst other things, to reduce the inquiry period for anti-dumping cases so that the preliminary complaints screening takes a maximum of five working days, the preliminary investigation takes up to 60 days, with an extension in special circumstances, and the interim measures then imposed, pending the completion of a final investigation, within a further 90 days. That, if observed in the breach, would ensure the maximum total investigation period is 155 days in other than exceptional circumstances compared with the now 245 to 265 days. On 13 December 1996, the then minister responsible for Customs, the honourable  that the government would shorten the time frame not to 155 days as promised but to 215 days. The then minister went on to say that the government had decided to refer Australia's anti-dumping arrangements to the Productivity Commission for report in 1997 and that the government would not move for the full reduction of the investigation process until after the commission reported. Despite that, the matter has not been formally referred yet because the terms of reference for the Productivity Commission have not been settled. The length of time to make a finding on an anti-dumping complaint is of concern to Australian companies, and excessive delay in investigating a dumping case will inevitably damage Australian industry. The government is urged to act on its election promise. One cannot determine that goods are being dumped unless it can be shown that they are being exported at a price less than their normal value. Generally, the method used to determine normal value is to consider the price paid in the exporting country. Other methods though include constructing a value from the costs of production and administration and other general costs, allowing for profit, or applying the price paid for similar goods sold into a third country. Where insufficient information has been supplied or is simply not available, the minister determines normal value, having regard to all relevant available information. A specific subsection in the Customs Act sets out the methods to be used by the ADA to determine the normal value of goods exported. by a country with a centrally planned economy where the government has a monopoly or a substantial monopoly of the trade of the country and determines or substantially influences the domestic price of all goods in that country. The methods that must be used to calculate normal value in these circumstances include using the price payable for similar goods produced or manufactured in Australia and sold on the home market, and the price of similar goods produced or manufactured in a third country, determined by the minister, for sale on that country's home market. This latter calculation method is known as the surrogate country method. However, the existing legislation makes no provision for countries that are in transition from centrally planned to market economies. Until the end of 1996, the surrogacy method was used to ascertain normal values for goods exported from economies in transition. However, in December 1996 counsel from the Office of International Law in the Attorney General's Department advised the ADA that the subsection of the Customs Act relating to command economies was very limited and narrow in scope. Counsel. advised that the stringent tests of the subsection required that the government of export have at least a substantial monopoly of the trade of the country, not just in terms of the goods in dispute. Counsel commented that the provision could only rarely apply today. In relation to the principal bill, Dr Frances Perkins, the assistant secretary and head of the East Asia Analysis Unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, gave evidence before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in September of this year about the nature of the Chinese economy. Dr Perkins's evidence was that China could no longer be classified as a centrally planned economy. She said that the World Bank and the IMF regarded China as an economy in transition and she provided statistical evidence of the nature of China's market to confirm that proposition. In the legal opinion it provided, the ney-General's Department advised that, therefore, on the basis of this assessment by DFAT 'it is difficult to see' how the subsection in the Customs Act used for command economies could be applied in China's case. On the basis of that advice, the government came to the view that to continue, for the purposes of anti-dumping legislation, to treat China as a centrally planned economy would raise the possibility of a legal challenge. The alternatives were to treat China and other transitional economies as full market economies, such as Japan and the United States, or to amend the legislation. Clearly, the Chinese economy cannot be treated as a market economy, with its domestic prices taken into account for the assessment of normal values. In my view it is clear that, with such a choice, the legislation has to be amende.d-if not whilst going through the parliament on this occasion, in the very near future. The issue then is how China should be regarded for anti-dumping purposes. The government's proposal is to deal with each anti-dumping complaint on a case by case basis. The explanatory memorandum to the principal bill notes that this reflects the viewpoint that the focus is not on the economy as a whole in an exporting country with a transitional economy, but on whether the selling prices of particular goods are subject to government control. The bill provides that, if a price control situation exists in relati9n to goods, then the minister will determine the normal value of the goods, taking into account all relevant information. While the bill does not specify what is meant by the term 'all relevant information', it expressly leaves it open to the minister to use the surrogacy method of calculating normal values. The bill defines what .is a price control situation but does not state who has the responsibility for assessing whether such a situation exists. The price control situation exists when the domestic selling prices of the goods or similar goods are controlled in whole or in part by the government in the exporting country. The minister's office advises that in all cases this assessment will be made by the minister's delegate, the Attor- Director of Operations of Customs. There is a two-step process: firstly, an assessment by a customs official of whether a foreign government has played a controlling role in depressing the level of domestic selling prices of particular goods in that country; and, secondly, if a positive finding is made, an assessment by the minister, by unspecified methods, of the normal value of the goods. Industry has been very critic.al of this approach, saying it does not provide certainty nor does it ensure fair competition. An industry anti-dumping task force, through its chairman, Mr Bruce MCAllen, gave evidence before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee about this bill on 22 September 1997. Mr MCAllen told that Senate committee that industry does not object to according free market status to industry sectors in transitional countries where those sectors exhibited free market characteristics. However, Australian industry is concerned about the inability of customs officials to detect the presence of government subsidised raw materials upstream, in the case of a privatised enterprise. Another major concern raised by that industry task force is that no test is set down for the calculation of normal values for goods. It is difficult for an Australian company to provide supporting evidence for a complaint if the act refers only to 'all relevant inforniation'. The industry task force is view that the surrogate country method has been shown to provide more certainty in assessing normal values in the case of a price control situation. The industry task force has proposed its own two-step test for assessing normal values in a country which has an economy in transition. The key to the industry proposal is the identification of foreign government ownership or control of the goods being produced or the supply of significant raw materials to the manufacturing sector iIi which the goods are produced. The industry task force defines 'significant raw materials' as any single element in excess of 10 per cent of production cost. The task force says that when this finding has been made there should then be a deemed price control situation triggering the surrogacy method of calculating normal values. To this end, the task force has proposed amendments to the government bill. The amendments provide for the making of regulations that would prescribe circumstances in which price control is deemed to exist. Those circumstance include: majority ownership or control by a foreign government in the enterprise manufacturing the exported goods; any government restriction on selling on the domestic market; government owned or controlled enterprises being major domestic customers for the goods sold; and any government restriction or direction as to of goods to be manufactured. It has been pointed out that the United States and the European Union treat China as a command economy, not as an economy in transition, for the purpose of their anti-dumping laws. It has been suggested that the proposed legislation takes Australia too far, too soon, towards recognising China's domestic prices as having the characteristics of normal values. It has been suggested that the amount of government involvement in the Chinese marketplace is such that it is a mistake to treat all privati sed Chinese companies as free market players. In my view, the concerns of industry are valid. I ask the minister to consider further amending the bill to give more guidance to of the the Director of Operations of Customs by specifying how to identify a price' control situation, ensuring that Customs can identify the existence of government subsidised inputs. I endorse the industry's plea that a price control situation should be treated as it was under the command economy rules-that is, using a test based on the surrogate country test. That particular test was used successfully in the past and there appears to be no logic in abandoning it in price control situations. In view of the government's legal advice, it appears that an amendment to the Customs Act, to the effect that a price control situation in a transitional economy is to be treated in the same manner as is a centrally planned economy, is what is required. Australian industry must be treated fairly if it is to compete in the global marketplace. Having said that, I am not advocating special protection for our own industries, but that they have an opportunity to compete fairly and equally on their own merits. The purpose of anti-dumping laws is to protect industry from unfair trading. Countervailing duties are not tariffs; they are not a form of artificial protection. They are designed to even out unfairness. In conclusion, the bill's provisions, as they stand, need to be built on. They should represent a beginning of modernisation of the relevant legislation. The amendments before the parliament today should not be considered the quantity as an end in themselves.",41
30,Mr MILES,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (12.14 p.m.)-I rise to make some brief comments on the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997. The purpose of this bill is to enable investigating authorities to examine the cost of significant raw material inputs into the production of goods in economies in transition and to enable the examination of inputs when raw material· inputs are supplied to the manufacturer by state owned enterprises and where the cost of those inputs constitutes 10 per cent or more of the cost of production of the goods under investigation. Obviously for a country like Australia, which exports a lot of products and is in competition globally, anti-dumping legislation is very important to it, as are imports. In particular, I want to focus my comments on the manufacturing of paper in my electorate of Braddon, a major industry in Australia. The forest industry is very important to Australia and the manufacturing of paper is a very important part of the forest industry. That industry is in competition with many countries-some have a demand economy; others have an economy in transition. From time to time, there are opportunities for some of these countries to put products onto our market at prices below cost. In recent days, a particular case of dumping has been brought by a particular company against 14 different countries around the world. I want to make a few brief comments about the importance of Australia having good anti-dumping legislation. The government will be responding to the Willett report in the near future. A member of the opposition came into this House and made some comments about the anti-dumping process. On this issue, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) can be described only as being a prime example of a hypocrite. He was in government for 13 years. In actual fact, it was his government that brought in the Anti-Dumping Authority in 1990. After 20 months of this government being in office, he starts a tirade against government about the length of the anti-dumping procedures in this country.",44
31,Mr CADMAN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Unbelievable.,45
32,Mr MILES,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It is unbelievable, as the member for Mitchell says. He comes in here and then says that the government has to cut down the length of time taken for anti-dumping procedures. The opposition will do and say anything to get back into government. The interesting thing is that, in government, the Labor Party believed that 21S days was a sensible period to go through the processes of anti-dumping; now that they are in opposition they think it should be ISS days. When they get back into government, what will they do? You can bet your bottom dollar that they will go back to 21S days. They say one thing in opposition and do something different in government. That is what is going on with this particular issue. There has been a fascinating discussion in the last six months on anti-dumping and the importation of paper' into this country. I have been working quite closely with a group in my area, comprising largely of AWU members and people from management in a paper comp\lny at Wesley Vale and Burnie. Just recently the CFMEU has jumped onto the bandwagon. Up until August they were not going to have a thing to do with this anti-dumping case. They would not join, they would not participate, with the TasPEAC members to fight this case at all, because of the fight between the unions. How ridiculous! There are 1,000 jobs involved in northern Tasmania in these two companies and you have an inter-union dispute-a fight between them. The Johnny-come-Iatelys-the CFMEU-now want to get involved in the anti-dumping case. They have promoted the idea of bringing in a private member's bill, which has been introduced in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. That is a stunt. We all know it is a stunt. It will go nowhere. It will lie on the table. Every now and then the member for Hotham will refer to it and argue that this is an important advancement. If it were not a stunt, if this it were genuinely a policy reform being put forward by the opposition to improve anti-dumping procedures in this country, I would have thought that their draft platform would have said something about anti-dumping in it. If you go through this draft platform-I think, it was put out a week ago, so it is right up to date-there is not one word about anti-dumping in it. Yet they come into this place and parade around as if, by bringing in this private member's bill, they are going to do something to help the manufacturing industry in Australia. It should be seen for exactly what it is. The member for Hotham is a person who is mainly full of words and very little action. This has clearly been promoted by an inter-union dispute. It was .interesting to talk to the AWU people. They said that Senator Cook did not support doing away with the Anti-Dumping Authority. Yet the private member's bill, which has been supported by Senator Shayne Murphy from Tasmania, is doing away with the Anti-Dumping Authority. I wondered where their policy position was, so I picked up their draft platform to try to identify the Labor Party were going on this issue. They are obviously going nowhere. The real problem· with this whole issue is that they have been going around fear campaigning-a bit like the nursing home issue-trying to stir up trouble. This was also the case with the tariffs issue in my area. Under our government, the Australian Customs Service has been diligently looking into this anti-dumping problem which we are faced with not only in Tasmania but also in other pulp industries around this country. Two or three days ago, on 20 November, the Australian Customs Service brought down their report. They found that 90 per cent of the paper coming in 1997 from about nine or 10 different countries out of the 14 was dumped .paper. The CFMEU were really annoyed-the AWU workers in TasPEAC have been working really hard; they have been coming up here, meeting with the government, talking with the minister, lobbying in this parliament for the company and for their jobs, working with me and some other senators and members in this parliament to try to make sure the case goes forward to the Australian Customs Service-that the report of the Australian Customs Service said that 90 per cent of the product. coming in was dumped. They are miffed. That is the real problem for the member for Hotham. He is miffed because he has lost any substance to his fear campaign. We hope that as this goes on to the Anti-Dumping Authority over the next 90 or so days the authority, under representation and information given to them, will come to a decision which is balanced on scientific facts. We await their decision. At the moment we have this interunion dispute. The Labor Party were hoping this would be a great trump card in northern Tasmania. They have failed because the decision from of the Australian Customs Service indicates that dumping is occurring. It is important for a country like Australia and its manufacturing base to ensure that there is no dumping. There does need to be fair trading in this whole area. Certainly, in many regional parts of Australia it is absolutely vital that we do protect our manufacturing where base from unfair trading which can occur. Australia is a very credible country, a very competitive country, a country that is willing to compete in the global market. We do not want any protection from competition from other countries. We are prepared to market our products on a fair basis. That is what this debate is all about: trying to ensure that products coming in here are not being dumped below the price they are being produced in other countries. It is particularly important at this time for the forest industries and the paper and pulp industries in Australia, if there is any evidence, scientific empirical data, that dumping is occurring, that we act and are firm in our resolution to fight that type of unfair competition coming into this country. There has been a great result so far with the anti-dumping case brought by the pulp company in Tasmania. A lot of hard work has gone into that by TasPEAC members and several other senators and members, and I have been representing them. As we continue to make those representations, if the facts stack up, I am quietly confident that we will get a good result in the anti-dumping procedures which we have at present in this country.",45
33,Mr ADAMS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"The member for Braddon (Mr Miles) must always remember that it was his party that promised to deliver on this issue before the last election. The government has had this report for a year. I asked a question yesterday about the government's timetable, when it would something about the report, but it was not answered. Nothing has been done. Like the rest of government business and public administration in this country, this government is failing the people; it is failing to deliver. There are some issues that the government does not seem to be able to get on with and this is one of them. The Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997 is a means through which some of the recommendations of the Willett anti-dumping report can be implemented. We on the opposition side will support some of the things in this bill. out some action, thousands of Australian jobs will be put at risk because of the unfair international trading practices. The Willett report was commissioned by the current government to cut the time taken to investigate complaints of dumping and to improve procedures to ensure Australian producers are not disadvantaged. Some useful and valuable recommendations have emerged from this report. The Willett report recommendations have been with the government over a year and the government has done nothing about it. In fact, the government has faced a number of questions during question time this session and all it has come up with is the change to the time it takes to put forward anti-dumping complaints. It is a very vexed issue. Dumping is the practice of selling goods at a price below home country to the disadvantage of industry of the importing country. We can apply anti-dumping duties if we can prove that the goods have been dumped. In Tasmania, where we produce a lot of paper and a lot of pulp, we have a particular problem with the dumping of paper. At the moment there is a case being investigated with Customs for the Tasmanian Papermills Employee Action Committee, TasPEAC. Many of us have given broad and strong support to TasPEAC's case. The initial findings by the Australian Customs Service that were handed down last week found that 22 of the 31 companies in the 14 importing countries were dumping. Securities have been placed on 14 of them. Australian Paper started action against the countries back in July claiming they were flooding the market with cheap paper. It is through the action of TasPEAC, in particular Royce Webster, that much of this case has come to light. They alerted the people who were involved directly with the mill and made sure that the whole of the north-west coast Tasmania and the north understood the issue and what it would mean to the Tasmanian economy if this paper continued to be dumped in this country. I had hundreds of letters from small businesses and local enterprises all over the north-west coast asking members to help save jobs Withand, of course, the local economy. Many groups and individuals have made submissions to the Customs Service to highlight the problems that dumping can have not only in the Tasmanian industry but in the interstate industry as well. TasPEAC told me that allowing the dumping would mean that the production of copy paper at the Australian Paper's Maryvale and Burnie mills would not be able to compete with cheap imports at dumped prices. They also pointed out that the current low world market price for fine paper could mean the closure of Australian industry altogether if dumping were sustained.· TasPEAC advised me that in 1993-94 dumping of copy paper caused the loss of 1,000 jobs before the ACS inquiries found overseas producers from a number of countries guilty of causing material the injury to the Australian industry. Now we have another problem that is emanating from Indonesia. They have some of the lowest cost producers of copy paper in the world, but they enjoy huge government patronage and subsidy. They have very negligible environmental costs and/or charges and they have extremely low labour costs. This is supposed to be a level playing field. It is not a level playing field, and we should not kid ourselves that it is. This government should do something about it. It should act quickly. By comparison, Australian paper makers have to meet among the highest environmental standards in the world. This particular Australian company does not enjoy any government patronage. It has no subsidies 14 and, at only five per cent, has among the world's lowest tariffs. We have good environmental standards and forest protection in this country. We lead the world in forest practices. We should set standards that also assist to bring some of the rest of the world on-line by lifting the standof ards in those countries as well. The most recent case certainly highlights the ineffectiveness of this country's anti-dumping laws as evidenced by this incursion. TasPEAC have told me that they have been particularly concerned over the inadequacies of the investigations overseas. They talked of two-day visits with no interpreters, no mill visits and exporters using former Customs employees and consultants to their own benefit. It is obvious that more resources need to be directed to such investigations so that they can be carried out independently of other countries' interests. It is in the national interests of Australia-the working people and the battlers of this country and the battlers the electorate of Braddon. A lot of this could have been avoided if the Willett recommendations had been implemented. All the government has done with this bill is shave 30 days off the existing investigation times without addressing any of the fundamental structural issues highlighted by Willett which require legislation. We have been told that the government will conduct a review of the entire anti-dumping scheme by the Productivity Commission, but so far I have heard nothing of it. There is now enormous uncertainty in the Asian economy, and many countries will be looking to offload their surplus. Australian manufacturers are more exposed than ever. I certainly hope that the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), who is at the table, takes this on board in his deliberations between now and Christmas. I certainly hope that he will come up with some recommendations and take them to the cabinet that will put something in place to protect Australian manufacturing jobs. Although this bill does go partly towards dealing with this problem, it only scratches the surface. We on the Labor side of politics believe that anti-dumping measures should be about ensuring fairness in international trade. The primary focus should be on creating Australian jobs and building national wealth. They should not, on the other hand, be used as a protective trade barrier or breach any international trading obligations. Legislation and administrative changes are needed to preserve the integrity of Australia's anti-dumping scheme and restore confidence in the system among manufacturers, primary producers and importers. That is what Labor tried to do through the private member's bill put up by the shadow minister for industry and regional development, the member for Hotham, Simon Crean. It would have cleaned up some of these problems once and for all. I can understand the frustration of our shadow minister, the member for Hotham. He has tried and tried again to get an answer during question time about where the Willett report is under review and what the time frame is to get something in done with the Willett report, but no-one on the government side will give him an answer. So he put forward a private member's bill to try to address this question. I asked a question yesterday in which I referred to the economic downturn among a number of our Asian trading partners and the potential this has to result in a significant increase in dumping from those countries. I asked what the government had done to safeguard Australian manufacturers from unfairly priced markets and imports. I also asked when the recommendations of the Willett anti-dumping report would be implemented. The answer was, 'This question was dealt with a couple of weeks ago.' The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moo.re) then passed the buck to the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, saying that he was handling the Willett report and that parliament should wait until there is a response to the total Willett report. That was it. It was flogged off-'Don't worry.' I can tell you that nothing has been done yet, and we do not know when it will be done. In the meantime, there is a wide, gaping hole by which our industries can be affected by dumping. Talk about fiddling while Rome bums; that is really an understatement in this case. Government has a job to do to protect our industries from unfair trading practices. The Willett recommendations should be taken up. It should not be left to companies or a group of employees to mount a challenge to other countries to prevent the dumping from occurring. It should be part of the Australian regulations to ensure that they can trade on an equal footing. I do not know whether people realise quite how serious this can be for Australian industry. With all the freeing up of marketplaces, there are a lot of new opportunities, but there are also a lot of unscrupulous players out there. If we are to enjoy the ability to trade equally with other nations, we have to make damned sure that our regulations can withstand the onslaught of unfair practices. Australia can be on the losing end of jobs, investment and our quality of life. I do not see how the member for Braddon can go back to his constituency and say that this government has done everything it could to protect and retain the paper industry. I do not think it has. His contribution today, which made excuses for government inaction, will certainly not satisfy his constituency. The criticism made by TasPEAC that the process is flawed is correct. The fact that the inadequate dumping laws prevent evidence from the 1996 dumping being accepted now is a case in point. Is this going to be addressed by the government or is it going to run away from this too? We would like those answers. The government has a job to do. Why can it not get on and do it? I am willing to agree to this bill as it stands, but the government has to address the broader issues contained in the Willett report-and address them soon-so that there is some security in Australia against dumping. We really need some security and comfort for Australian workers and battlers.",46
34,Mr TRUSS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I thank honourable members for their contributions to this anti-dumping legislation. I have noted the comments that members on both sides have made about the importance of anti-dumping measures and having an effective regime in Australia to ensure that Australian industry does not face unfair and improper competition from goods that are dumped or subsidised in their country of manufacture. I have to say that I have, though, been a little disappointed with what seems to be a lack of understanding on the part of some members opposite as to what dumping actually is. The fact that something comes into this country that is cheaper than the Australian product does not mean that it is dumped. The fact that it comes here and may be of poorer quality than the Australian product does not mean that it is dumped. The fact that it might be providing competition to an Australian industry does not mean that it is dumped. For a product to be actually dumped in this nation in the context of anti-dumping legislation, it has to be sold in Australia at a lower price than it is sold domestically in its country of manufacture. That point is sometimes missed by some who make perhaps ill-informed comments on these issues. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) was perhaps as much guilty of that as anyone. I am disappointed that the person who sometimes says he is the shadow minister for these matters would make statements that are inaccurate. My understanding is that the shadow minister for customs is the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). Opposition policy may well be advantaged if the member for Hotham gave it all away and let the member for Cunningham get on with the job. I think we would end up with a much more rational policy that way. There certainly seems to have been a degree of shifting and changing as far as that is concerned. The honourable member for Hotham made quite a deal of reference to the Monsanto glyphosate case. He suggested that the government had messed it all up and that, therefore, this legislation was to try to fix up the problem. That is an absolute load of nonsense. It is important at the beginning to understand why the decision was made in relation to the glyphosate case. I will read directly from the conclusions of report No. 159 from the Anti-Dumping Authority into glyphosate acid from the People's Republic of China. The Anti-Dumping Authority states: The Authority has found that most exports of glyphosate acid from China to Australia have been undumped. Of the few shipments that have been dumped, the dumping margins were negligible. The Authority is not satisfied that glyphosate acid produced in Australia meets the 'local content' requirements of subsection 269T(2) of the Customs Act. So the Anti-Dumping Authority, firstly, came to the conclusion that the glyphosate was not dumped and, secondly, that even if it was, because the manufacturer in Australia did not meet the 25 per cent test, there was just no capacity for the ADA to make a ruling in its favour, even if it had wanted to do so. So the existing legislation, the legislation put in place by the previous government, precluded a decision being made in Monsanto's favour. I want to make one other observation in relation to that decision. It is true of almost every anti-dumping case that when one industry receives an anti-dumping duty that generally means that the costs go up for other industries. The decision not to impose an antity. dumping duty on glyphosate acid coming in from China was hugely popular in the rural sector, because they were going to get access to lower priced chemical products. While referring to the comments of other members, I will make a brief reference to some of the remarks by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who spoke about how important it is that there not be any undue burden on industry in endeavouring to establish what the costs of production might be in a faraway country. Let me emphasise that the government certainly recognises the difficulties faced by local industry, especially small business and smaller industries, in gathering information to mount a successful case. The legislation does not impose a burden on the local industry. All they need to submit is 'such information that is reasonably available'. It is then a matter for Customs to do the detailed research that might be necessary to ascertain whether practices are occurring in the country of manufacture which should give rise to dumping duties. I would like to make a couple of comments on the coated paper case that was of particular interest to the last speaker who contributed this debate, the member for Lyons (Mr Adams), and also to the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who has done an outstanding job in representing the interests of the people of northern Tasmania and their particular concerns on this issue. This was a very difficult case because it involved claims against 14 countries. It seems that some members, even though they claim to be very close to the situation in Tasmania, had not caught up with the fact that last week a positive finding was made in relation to Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan. The exports from the companies subject to a positive finding represent 90 per cent of imports of the goods since January 1997. There has been a finding in that particular case, and the matter now goes to the AntiDumping Authority. I encourage anyone who has views on that matter to make sure that they are known to the Anti-Dumping AuthoriAt the completion of its review, the ADA will make recommendations to me as the minister, and I will then decide the issue. It is inappropriate for me to make too many comments about the details of that case until I have had the opportunity to consider the ADA report. In relation to the legislation before the House, section 269TAC of the Customs Act provides for the assessment of the normal value of imported goods for the purposes of dumping investigations. Until the latter part of last year, this section was applied to goods exported from economies in transition, such as China, by reference to information obtained in a surrogate country. This is the key point-and I hope that even the member for Hotham might be prepared to acknowledge this point. In November of last year, the Attorney-General's Department advised that section 269TAC(4) was severely limited in its application. Its stringent tests require that the government of the country of export has at least a substantial monopoly of all of the trade of the country, not just in terms of the trade in the goods under consideration, and must also substantially influto ence the domestic price of all goods in that country. The advice went on to conclude that the section could have no further application to economies in transition, such as China. As this section can have no further application to economies which are considered to be in transition, the determination of the normal values of exports from such economies as a matter of law must be made in accordance with the remaining provisions of section 269TAC. The existing legislation does not distinguish between market economies and those that are considered to be in transition. Normal values of goods exported from economies in transition must therefore be ascertained by the application of the same methods that are required for exports from countries such as the United States of America and Germany. There is presently no flexibility available to treat exports from economies which are in transition differently from exports from other countries. Australian industry has expressed concern at the potential for dumped imports from economies in transition to adversely affect Australian manufacturers. The government and Australian industry recognise the need to restore flexibility in the investigation of dumping from economies in transition. That is the purpose of this legislation. On 12 March 1997, the government announced its intention to introduce into parliament amendments to the Customs Act that provide for a case by case approach to be taken in investigations into the alleged dumping of products from economies in transition. The Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997 amends section 269TAC of the act, and was tabled before the parliament on 25 June 1997. The bill corrects the anomaly with the existing legislation by recognising that there is still a level of government control evident within economies considered to be in transition which might in some cases so influence the domestic price of the goods under consideration that it would be inappropriate to use that price to determine normal valuation. The legislation has been drafted to provide investigators with a sufficient degree of flexibility to allow them to determine the normal value of goods under investigation in the best available manner, given the circumstances of each case. Specifically, it provides that in those circumstances where the government of the country controls or substantially controls the domestic selling price of the goods in question then the normal value of such goods may be determined, having regard to all relevant information. This information may include, but is not necessarily restricted to, information obtained in a surrogate country. At the request of the government, following the tabling of the bill in June,· officials convened a series of meetings in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra to consult with Australian industry on the provisions of the bill. In view of allegations that somehow or other the government has been tardy on this matter, it is important to note the progress that has occurred. The legislation was introduced in June, after the government's announcement in March that it was to take action in this area. That is surely a reasonable time in which to draft the appropriate legislation. We. then consulted extensively with industry and held seminars in various places around the country. In addition, the Senate, of its own volition, chose to take the matter away for its own inquiry. The government has been criticised on a number of occasions for proceeding with debates before the results of Senate inquiries are known. We have allowed a proper process of consultation to occur and the bill has now been brought on for debate. Industry expressed concern that the bill referred only to government control over the domestic selling price of the goods in question, and so a little later in this debate I will be proposing a government amendment to deal with those kinds of industry concerns. I am conscious of the importance of this legislation and of the keen interest of members in anti-dumping measures and the sorts of structures that should be in place to best deliver results and outcomes for Australian industry and the Australian community. As I said before, we are currently actively addressing those issues. This legislation goes a long way to introducing a fair and appropriate way to deal with countries in transition, and I commend it to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Mr CREAN CHotham) (12.53 p.m.)-I move: Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 8) to page 4 (line 9), omit the item, substitute: 2 After subsection 269TAC(5C) Insert: (SD) If goods are exported to Australia and the Minister is satisfied that: (a) in the past the Government of the country of export had a monopoly, or a substantial monopoly, of the trade of that and determined, or substantially influenced, the domestic price of goods in that country; and (b) the circumstance described in paragraph (a) no longer applies in relation to the country of export; and (c) a price control situation exists, within the meaning of subsection (SE), in relation to like goods to those first-mentioned goods; the normal value of those first-mentioned goods is to be a value ascertained in accordance with whichever of paragraphs (c), (d), (e) or (f) of subsection (4), the Minister determines, having regard to what is appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances of the case. (SE) A price control situation applies in relation to like goods to the goods first-mentioned in subsection (SD): (a) if the exporter of those first-mentioned goods, or any other seller, sells like goods in the country of export and the domestic selling price of any of those like goods is, directly or indirectly, controlled or tially controlled, or substantially influenced by a government (at whatever level) of that country; or (b) if the exporter of· those first-mentioned goods, or any other seller, sells like goods in the country of export and any cost of production or manufacture of any of those goods representing more than 10% of the total cost of production or manufacture of the last-mentioned goods is, directly or indirectly, controlled, or substantially trolled, or substantially influenced, by a government (at whatever level) of that country. (SF) The circumstances where the domestic selling price, or any cost of production or manufacture, of like goods referred to in subsection (SD) is so controlled, or substantially so controlled or influenced shall include, but not be limited to, such circumstances as are, from time to time, provided in the regulations. (SG) For the purposes of complying with Australia's international obligations under an international agreement, regulations may be made to disapply subsection (SD) to a country, or part of a country. I foreshadowed this amendment in my contribution to the second reading debate, because whilst we acknowledge that the government's amendments that it will move a little later do country try to address key issues that we have raised they do not go far enough. In essence, our amendment seeks to establish that, once a price control situation exists, that situation must lead to a surrogacy test. That is the effect of our amendment. The government's amendments, as I understand it, leave a discretion in the various stages of the process and, ultimately, the minister as to whether surrogacy applies. Rather than giving certainty to our manufacturing industry so that when they have established a case they know that surrogacy will apply, the government's proposi tions seek to compound that uncertainty, because there is no guarantee that the government would act and require the surrogacy test. A point that we have to acknowledge is that the government has embraced what we have been pushing for in taking account of the input components that go into the final price. It has embraced the 10 per cent test which we have put forward. But, in embracing the test, substanthe government still leaves too much discretion with, ultimately, the minister. Also, before that, with regard to the two stages of process-the Customs Service and the AntiDumping Authority-there is too much discretion as to whether, having established the 10 per cent exercise, surrogacy applied. They could ignore it, the minister could ignore it, or they could surrogate it. Our amendment seeks to give certainty so that, con- once you establish the test, surrogacy applies. We understand that the legislation that is before us is to patch up a mess of their own making and to try to deal with exercises on a case by case basis. We understand that legislation in some form must be passed to correct this. But what we are saying is that if we are going to give certainty to industry then our amendment is better, because it gives the certainty once you have established that the price fixing arrangements exist. The other thing that we do in our amendment is to enable, through regulations, the positive identification of price control by actually specifying the criteria that would be taken into account. That is the amendment that we are proposing. We urge the government to embrace it. I think the peanut growers in the electorate of the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) will be pretty disappointed by his performance. This was the minister who, in 1992, was the most vocal critic of dumping from China. This was the person who said, 'We have got to introduce legislation to act speedily to address those problems.' He campaigned in his constituency about doing something. When it comes to the ultimate test, when he has actually got charge, he wimps it. I think he is going to have some explaining to do in saying to his farmers and to manufacturers around the country that when they can actually demonstrate that price fixing arrangements are existing they still cannot be certain that the surrogacy test will apply. In the case of glyphosate the other day, we saw how the government ignored evidence that was before us that showed that glyphosate prices were being fixed. That is why we believe there should be no discretion. That is why our amendments require surrogacy to apply once the tests are met. I urge the House to embrace our amendment because it strengthens the bill. If this amendment fails, of course we will support the government's amendments because at least they do improve the situation, but they do not improve it in a way that gives certainty to our manufacturers. Whilst they do not have that certainty, jobs will continue to be lost in this country.",49
35,Mr TRUSS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"The opposition amendment, as the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) says, goes very much further than what is proposed by the government. In fact, I believe it goes even further than he acknowledged to the House. The intent behind the government's bill is to provide greater flexibility to investigating authorities. When a price control situation is identified, investigating authorities are able to determine normal values by reference to all relevant information, thus maximising flexibility. For example, where there are three exporters from an economy in transition and only one is affected by a price control situation, investigating authorities are able to determine normal values for that one exporter by reference to the dotnestic selling prices or costs of the two other exporters whose sales are not subject to control. There is no automatic reliance upon surrogacy information. The amendment proposed by the member for Hotham limits flexibility. Investigating authorities would be precluded from looking at what other information might happen to be around. In essence, investigating authorities would be compelled in all cases to rely solely upon information obtained in surrogate countries. The amendment also requires investigating authorities to proceed beyond an examination of the extent to which the prices of the exporters-that is, the alleged unfair tradersare subject to control. The amendment requires investigating authorities to look at 'any other seller'. This is obviously one of the significant difficulties the government has with the opposition's amendment. Even if it is established that the particular exporter is trading in response to market forces, investigating authorities must conduct a thorough search of the entire market of the economy in transition to see if there is one seller, who might not even be an exporter, whose prices are subject to government control. For example, under the amendment, one seller in the entire Chinese market is sufficient to so take the entire Chinese market as to render it inappropriate to have regard to the Chinese exporters' domestic selling prices as an appropriate basis for the determination of normal values. A Foreign Affairs detailed analysis of the Chinese market has concluded that, although there has been significant economic reform, the sheer size of its domestic market means that it is. likely that, if investigating authorities look hard enough, they will find one seller in any given sector which is still subject to control. In essence, the amendment would lead to the reinstatement of pretty well an automatic application of surrogacy information in all future dumping cases. We are concerned that that will be the practical effect of the proposed amendment. It limits flexibility. If after an exhaustive search the investigating authorities are unable to find one seller in the entire Chinese market whose selling prices are subject to control, the search is not over under this amendment. Again, the phrase 'or any other seller' is used. Investigating authorities must again scour the entire market to identify whether one seller is able to buy a significant input at a price which is subject to government control. Investigating authorities must, therefore, not only identify all sellers of like goods within the Chinese market but also identify all suppliers of significant raw material inputs to such sellers. Our concerns, therefore, are that the opposition amendment goes further than the government is prepared to go in this particular matter and would in fact destroy the capacity to demonstrate flexibility in dealing in economies in transition, which is the primary purpose of the bill.",53
36,Mr MARTIN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I take the opportunity while the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) is here to reiterate one or two points that I made in my contribution to this anti-dumping legislation a little earlier and pick up specifiinvolved cally this issue of flexibility to investigating authorities-plural. One of the major stumbling blocks which we have experienced, which we have identified and which the private member's bill of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) picks up is the need to ensure that this 'authorities' involvement is limited, is contained within one organisation. The process of the identification of concerns in anti-dumping cases brought to the government's attention was clearly and amply demonstrated by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) in her contribution a little earlier when she talked about SPC and Ardmona and the dumping of canned pears and other fruits from Spain, China and one other country. She talked about the process that was fol!owed under existing legislative regimes where the Anti-Dumping Authority and the Australian Customs Service became involved. She talked about the difficulty of sending officers to that foreign country to check the validity of the dumping claim. She talked about reports going to ministers. As I pointed out, of course, there have been three ministers since the government came into office last year, and there is no way that that has not added to the confusion. It has gone across you, Minister, and your two predecessors and there has been a difference in emphasis as well, as I pointed out in comparing attitudes to one or two dumping cases which had been outlined in a report in the Australian by David Forman. This flexibility to investigating authorities is not something which we would want to stifle. In fact, it is the opposite. I think it is what the member for Hotham's amendment is on about. Importantly as well, drawing on his private member's bill which lies in this place, it suggests that there being one investigating authority would make a lot of sense, and I would commend that particular element, as I do the rest of the member for Hotham's private member's bills, to the House. The minister's talking in his response a moment or two ago about people perhaps not having an appropriate understanding of what dumping is all about is real. We are spending a fair bit of time in this country on becoming in the Australian-made campaign. We did in the course of the last government and, hopefully, we may again in the course of this government. At the moment there is a lot of uncertainty about that as well because a new licensing arrangement with the logo was supposed to be in place by the end of last year and June 1997. Apparently there are some difficulties associated with that, and I think the minister is seeking to address that, because he put a press release out the other day about it. This is intimately bound up in the dumping today issue because consumers want to know that the goods and services they procure in Australia are quality goods and services. I think most Australians are interested in the protection of Australian industry and want to purchase Australian goods and services. They want to know that, if they go and buy something on the shelf that says 'Made in Australia' or 'Product of Australia', that is exactly what it is. You could have a circumstance where a foreign producer of, say, canned pears chooswe es to dump that into the Australian economy and then the Australian producer raises concern because it might even have labelling on it that says 'Product of Australia' or 'Made in Australia', although we would hope that that does not occur. But a case was brought to my attention yesterday when I was talking to one of the ABC programs in Melbourne on this subject. They had an example of a duct that had 'Made in Australia' on the outside, but when you opened it up it was Indian product and there was another label the inside that said that. We should start looking at those sorts of issues, Minister, and I am sure you will take that on board. My point on this specific matter is that, clearly, if there are products being dumped into Australia, it is going to be injurious Australian manufacturers, it is going to bring jobs into jeopardy in this country and it something we want to change. We would maintain that flexibility in investigating authorities could be improved by one authoriof ty taking that responsibility. But, as is indicatties ed here by the member for Hotham's amend which ment, we have also applied some other tests which we believe are more reasonable which you have said are harder. We think this amendment needs consideration, and we are going to support it accordingly. (Extension time granted) I will just say one further thing because minister was not here when I made a contribecause bution a little earlier, and it is something member for Hotham and I have spoken about in as early as this morning. That is, the present economic circumstances of some of our major trading partners in the Asian region are such now that we may well see a flood of dumped products coming into Australia. Because there is this need to try to strengthen those econoway mies again, we are going to see, as a result some of the advances that have been made in the tiger economies of Asia particularly, producers trying by necessity to continue to make some foreign currency, and they will do that in any way that is possible. There may well be a flood of products coming into Australia. We do not dispute competition. You have said that, Minister, and have said that as well. But the concern that we would have is that the flood of fora eign material, foreign goods, coming into Australia may come in at a disadvantageous price to Australian producers and would be clearly within the ambit of the anti-dumping legislation. Again, for the benefit of the minister as he is with us now while we are talking about this matter, I think it would be prowell worthwhile if both the Anti-Dumping Authority and the Australian Customs Service an kept a weather eye out for these sorts of on things as those Asian economies look to ways in which they can get back on their feet.",54
37,Mr TRUSS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I will respond briefly to the last matter raised by the honourable member for Cunningham to (Mr Martin), although, Mr Deputy Speaker, you are being very indulgent to allow us to is get this far off the amendment. I have noted comments by a number of people that there is a greater risk of dumping action as a result problems in Asian economies. The difficulare generally occurring in economies would not be affected by this legislation anyhow because they are not regarded as but economies in transition. Obviously, there are concerns internationally about these economies, and we as Australof ians are concerned about what impact any decline in those economies might have in the Australia. It does not necessarily follow that there is a lot of pressure in those the economies they would seek to dump products other parts of the world. In fact, one of the things that is likely to happen is that their own domestic markets will collapse to some extent and, therefore, a product could be sent to Australia or a third country at a lower price without it actually being dumped because, by of definition, it would not be being sold of here at a lower price than at home. Those are issues that may well have to be dealt with within other fora other than the anti-dumping area. But certainly, if there are examples of cases where dumping occurs, we need to act and we need to have appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure that Australian industry is able to seek protective action and then that we can deliver that as promptly as possible.

(5H) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (5G)(f), the Minister may determine the amount that is to be the value of a raw material under that paragraph in accordance with whichever of the following paragraphs the Minister, having regard to what is appropriate and reasonable in the circumstances of the case, determines to be appropriate, as if the raw material were goods exported from the country of export referred to in paragraph (5G)(a): (a) an amount equal to the price determined by the Minister to be the price of like goods to the raw material produced or manufactured in a country determined by the Minister and sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in that country, being sales that are arms length transactions; (b) an amount equal to the price determined by the Minister to be the price of like goods to the raw material produced or manufactured in a country determined by the Minister and sold in the ordinary course of trade in arms length transactions for exportation from that country to a third country determined by the Minister to be an appropriate third country; (c) an amount equal to the sum of the following amounts ascertained in respect of like goods to the raw material produced or manufactured in a country determined by the Minister and sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in that country: (i) such amount as the Minister determines to be the cost of production or manufacture of like goods to the raw material in that country; (ii) such amounts as the Minister determines to be the administrative, selling and general costs associated with the sale of like goods to the raw material in that country and the profit on that sale; (d) an amount equal to the price payable for like goods to the raw material produced or manufactured in Australia and sold for home consumption in the ordinary course of trade in Australia, being sales that are arms length transactions. (51) For the purposes of fulfilling Australia's international obligations under an international agreement, regulations may be made to disapply subsection (5D) or (5G) to a country. (5) Schedule 1, item 4, page 4 (line 14), after ""(5D)"", insert ""or (5G)"". Honourable members will be aware from the preceding debate that this legislation has been before the House of Representatives since 25 June. The government undertook extensive consultation with industry. There was a Senate cO'mmittee cO'nsideratiDn of the matter and, as a result, the gDvernment is propDsing a number of amendments. Industry expressed CDncern that the bill referred Dnly to' gDvernment cDntrol Dver the dDmestic selling price of the gDDds in questiDn and did not address the issue of gDvernment cDntrol Dver the price of significant raw material inputs intO' the manufacturing prDcess of allegedly dumped gDDds. In September, the Senate referred the CustDms LegislatiDn (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1997 to' the Senate ECDnDmics LegislatiDn CDmmittee, and industry CDntinued thDse arguments befDre that cDmmittee. The majDrity repDrt from the cDmmittee recDmmended the passage O'f the bill but cDmmented that cDnsideratiO'n shDuld be given to' the CDSt of raw material inputs where investigatDrs cDnclude that it exceeds 10 per cent of the productiDn prDcess. It is impDrtant that Australia's anti-dumping system is recDgnised by bDth the industry and the internatiDnal cDmmunity as providing an effective remedy against discriminatDry pricing practices to' enabk industry to' CDmpete on an equal fDDting. It is not reasDnable to' expect industry to' be able to' cDmpete with cDuntries which already enjDy a cDmpetitive advantage in terms of cheaper labDur and infrastructure CDStS if their cDmpetitors can alsO' prO' cure raw materials at unrealistic state cDntrolled prices. Mindful of the views expressed by industry, the gO'vernment has reached the cO'nclusiO'n that it wDuld be apprDpriate fDr the bill to' be amended to' enable investigatDrs to' examine bDth the dDmestic selling price O'f the gDDds in questiDn and the CDSt O'f significant raw material inputs where such inputs are supplied by state Dwned enterprises. The amendments to' the bill will further add to' the flexibility needed by investigatDrs when dealing with dumped impDrts from eCDnO'mies in transitiO'n. Under the amendments which I have mDved, where a significant raw material input is supplied by a state Dwned enterprise, it dDes not inVDlve in all cases the autDmatic determinatiDn of nDrmal value fDr the manufactured gDDd sDlely by reference to' surrogate material. The CDStS of any raw material supplied by nDn-state Dwned enterprisescDmpanies that are genuinely driven by market fDrces-wDuld be accepted, and Dther relevant infO'rmatiDn wDuld Dnly be used in estimating the CDSt of significant raw material which is supplied by state O'wned enterprises. I cDmmend the amendments to' the HDuse and present a supplementary explanatDry memDrandum.",56
39,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"We will not be O'PpDsing these amendments. They strengthen the legislatiDn that the gDvernment had previDusly introduced in June. UnfDrtunately, they dO' not strengthen it to' the extent to' which we wDuld have wanted. It is unfDrtunate that the gDvernment has vDted dDwn Dur amendments that wDuld have given the legislatiDn that strengthening. What we are dealing with here is trying to' say to' industry, 'If YDU can establish the facts, then YDU shDuld be entitled to' be certain in knDwing that the surrogacy test applies.' There is nO' pDint in establishing price fixing-unrealistically fair prices that are CDntrDlled-in the market eCDnDmy if there cannDt be cDnfidence in the gDvernment's assessment of dumping, because it then gO'es Dff to' be tested in the surrDgate role as it was dDne befDre. Under the discretiO'n that these amendments give the gDvernment, the minister can choDse to' ignDre the surrO'gacy test. That is just nO't appropriate in circumstances where industry has expended time and effDrt in trying to' establish the case. If peDple can prO've their case, they are entitled to' sO'me certainty in the regime that their case, having been proved, will be acted upDn. YDur amendments dO' nO't give them that certainty. As fDr the suggestiDn that our amendments WO'uid have required an endless stream O'f investigatiDn, that is just not right. What we have cO'nsistently said is that, under O'ur amendments, we want specific criteria against which the test of price fixing can be established. Once it is established, there shDuld nO't be any ifs O'r buts. Yau dO' not use the Chinese price as the test; yO'U gO' to' a real market eCDnDmy-not a false market eCDnO'my. The truth of the matter is that, by this piece of legislatiDn, the gDvernment is still enabling China to be treated as a market economy even where evidence shows they are not. Again, I keep coming back to the glyphosate case, the product that is used in herbicides such as Roundup or Zero. Here there was clear evidence in a document that showed that the price was being fixed in China. The government had it and chose to ignore it. Under our amendments and with that evidence there, the surrogacy test would have had to apply. There is no way the price being put forward by China could have provided the basis for an outcome. Under Labor's test, they would have had to go to cost of that production in a market economy. That is what our amendments would have achieved. Your amendments recognise that there could be a problem and want to set up the investigation, but they do not guarantee it. What is the point of telling industry, 'It doesn't matter what you prove to us, we still hold the discretion not to act on it,' because that is where you will create the uncertainty. All that business, all the unions and all the workers, whose livelihoods are dependent on these threats of dumped products coming in, are asking for is a regime of certainty-not endless waffle and not a circumstance in which they can prove the case and still not get satisfaction. That is what we are looking for. Quite frankly, whilst the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) has sought to grapple with this issue-despite the fact that his predecessors were doing nothing-he should really be taking a tougher stance on this, given speeches that he has made to this parliament on previous occasions. He was breathing hellfire in this ber in 1992 and 1993 when he said that Australia was a dumper's paradise. He particularly singled out China and said that tougher action had to be taken, both in terms of the time to run the case and in the outcome, which should go in favour of the local manufacturer. That is what you You said essentially that the onus should be in favour of the Australian manufacturer. What your amendments do is still leave the discretion with you; they do not put the onus or the commitment in favour of the Australian manufacturer. (Extension of time granted) I acknowledge that the minister has made some progress on this issue; I acknowledge that we have an improvement in the legislation; and I acknowledge that it is important that this bill is finally brought on for debate. Despite the fact that the bill was introduced in June, we are still only debating it in the second last week of sittings and with no hope of it being passed in the Senate. It was all very well for the minister to talk about the Senate of its own volition referring the this matter to a committee. But you are the ones in charge. You are the government; you can determine the legislative program; you can insist on what goes forward in the program in the other chamber. If you are really serious about this matter, you would have had this bill up in the priorities. In any event, if you had brought the legislation back into this chamber earlier-it has been listed for debate on five separate occasions and then withdrawn-not only would you have amendments that strengthen the bill being passed here but also you would have been able to get them through the Senate. That is why we are saying that you are letting Australian industry down. We have essentially had to force you into this position but, having forced you into it, we are still going to find ourselves caught with this legislation not concluded, because the parliament is not coming back until March. Even if we pass these amendments today, the fact that the Senate does not deal with them means it does not become law until March or April of next year at the earliest. That is another four months of uncertainty. chamThat is another four months where every product coming in from China is treated as if it comes from a market economy-no discretion. Because you have opened the gates in terms of glyphosate, they are now floodgates. Everything has to be treated the same way. That is why we are dealing with this amendsaid, Minister. ing legislation. Why in goodness name if it is a problem and if you acknowledge it is a problem, won't you seek to move quickly on it? This is the complaint that people have against this government in legion. First, it does not take leadership on these issues; it is always drawn in. Labor has fought the campaign to get this legislation on; you have not done it of your own volition. Secondly, when you are forced into the position, you dither, you waste time. You say, 'Yes, we have got the interests of Australian workers and Australian manufacturers at heart.' If you meant it, you would be dealing with this quickly. That is the problem, Minister. That is the difficulty you have got. You knew as far back as 1992, at least, the problems that confronted this country with dumped product coming in from China. You made impassioned speeches in the parliament. You are now in a position to do something, but you have wimped on it. People do not appreciate their politicians saying something but then not acting on it. They do not appreciate politicians who mouth the words in the electorate but do not back their constituents in the parliament. That is the problem with the member for Braddon (Mr Miles). That is the problem with him in terms of the textile workers. When we were putting to the test the other customs bill to implement the Willet inquiry, he was down at Burnie saying he is sticking up for the workers in the paper mill. If you are, come and vote for our bill, because our bill supports them. We will put you to the test so that your words will be seen as empty rhetoric down in Burnie. I have been down there, brother, and I know what they think of you. Have a look at the front-page Newspoll and have a look at where your government is sliding to. It will be bye-bye to you next time. You ought to get smart. You ought to actually stick up for the workers at Burnie. They might give you a few brownie points. But at the moment you are sitting there with a stupid smile on your face. You know you have been embarrassed on this issue. You go down there and say that you have got the interests of their future at heart. Mr Bradford- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",58
40,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"Here we go. We have got the intervention to stop us embarrassing that fool from Braddon on the front bench. Mr Bradford- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this sort of conduct is clearly",60
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"What is your point of order? Mr Bradford-The member is required to address his remarks through the chair and he is constantly referring to 'you', 'your' and other personal pronouns. He is clearly out of order in the way he is addressing his remarks.",60
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"There is no point of order. I would ask the honourable member to address the matter of the amendments before the chair. Mr Miles-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I regard some of those comments as quite offensive.",60
43,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,Which ones? Mr Miles-You know what you said. I ask him to withdraw them.,60
44,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"You regard that as offensive? Mr Miles-Yes, I do.",60
45,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"If you regard it as offensive, I withdraw it. (Extension of time granted) Let me say that it does not change the fact that you were not representing your constituents. It does not change the fact one bit that you have been telling them that you support their jobs, but you are not prepared to support legislation that will see those jobs secured in this country. That is the point of this legislation and it is the point of another piece of legislation which you will not bring on. You promised in the election that you would improve the anti-dumping procedures and you have done nothing. You have had a report for 14 months that has told you how to do it and you have sat on it. What did you do when you got it? You said, 'We'll refer it to the Productivity Commission for another report.' No wonder those people down in Braddon are moving away from you, and they deserve to. You are not representing their interests and we will expose that at every opportunity. Whilst we have made some progress in terms of this bill in the treatment of China, we are very disappointed that we are not going as far as we could. We are also very disappointed that the government has not given it enough priority to ensure that it is passed now. The people whose jobs are threatened want to know before Christmas that their jobs are going to be secure. Under your approach, this bill will not even get back to the parliament until March of next yearanother three months of uncertainty. What do you think that is going to do to the investment climate of this nation? We hear you rabbiting on about all sorts of other things holding up investment. These are easy decisions to get through because you would have our support on this side of the House to implement the Willet recommendations. You are getting our support in terms of this legislation. Why have you sat on it for so long? If you believe in these issues, why have you not been prepared to bring the legislation on? If we are supporting it, why can't you get it into the Senate and get the thing through quickly? Mr Truss-You won't give the time.",60
46,Mr CREAN,PAIRS,"He says we will not give the time. Come off it! You are the government. You manage the program. If you cannot manage the program, you do not deserve to sit on that side of the House. You are the people who have got responsibility for organising the timing and all you have done is push this off so it is not a priority. That point will be sheeted home. Whilst we acknowledge the progress that has been made, we will be very critical of the fact that you are not serious and that you have been forced kicking and screaming to embrace this. We will keep that pressure up in terms of the other bill. We will also keep the pressure up in terms of timing. Australian manufacturers and Australian workers deserve certainty. They need a climate against which their security and their plans can be made. The longer you take to address that certainty, the more we lose in investment and the more the job opportunities of those people are put at risk. It is about time this government honoured its obligations and actually acted, having gone to the election last time saying it was going to do something on this. People are sick to death of you having turned all these things into non-core promises and then hoping the problem goes away. I tell you what: so long as we are around, we will make sure the problem does not go away. More importantly, we will be putting forward constructive alternatives so that we are actually doing your work for you. That is what we have done in terms of this legislation. That is what we have done in terms of the other anti-dumping bill which, seeks to implement the Willet recommendations. I hope you bring that bill on, quickly and I hope you take steps to ensure that this legislation is passed in the other chamber so that the security of the work force as well as the investment opportunities can be determined in the interests of this nation and in the interests of their communities.",61
47,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (1.37 p.m.)Listeners to this debate may not be remembering that the current government has been in office for less than a year and a half following 13 long, hard, bitter years of Labor. Who is being accused of delaying this issue? The people who sat there for 13 years and did not get around to fixing it are now setting the bar at ever increasingly high places for this government to jump. Frankly, we do not mind big targets because we address them. I find with almost some amusement the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) suggesting that the government has not honoured its election commitment. I doubt whether there is any government in history that has made as much progress in developing and implementing its election platform as this one has. With the term only halfway through, most of the platform has been already delivered. What has not been delivered is certainly well on the way to achieving our intended objectives. As I mentioned, the government's progress on this matter has not been slow from the moment the announcement was made by the government that it would address this issue. It is an issue that arose because of advice that came from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department. It was not an attempt to patch up Monsanto. Foreign Affairs and Attorney General's advised that the legislation that you had put in place could no longer be used in relation to economies like China in the way it had been, in the past because they could no longer be considered to be command economies. That is a matter of legal advice; it is not a matter of what people say in one place or other; It is necessary, therefore, for us to deal with these issues on a case by case basis if we are going to provide an appropriately fair system for looking after the interests of Australian industry. In some cases, there will be a determination' that the particular manufacturing process in a country like China-and let us not forget that there may well be economies other than China affected by this legislation-is in a command economy environment. In other cases the evidence from Foreign Affairs and others is that that is no longer the case. So that is the objective of this legislation. The amendments before the House at the present time enable us to take into account not just the selling price in China but also the cost of inputs where those inputs are significant. I thank the honourable member for Hotham for the faint praise that he gave us in relation to the amendments. I thought he might also be prepared to commend us for the extensive consultation that has been undertaken, our willingness to talk to industry around the country and our preparedness to wait for the Senate committee report and to listen to what they have to say. We should bear in mind that there was a majority report from that committee which recommended the passage of the anti-dumping bill and two minority reports which were significantly different from each other. So it was appropriate that the government should consider the content of those reports before bringing to this House amendments which we believe adequately resolve the issues. I think the government's progress on this matter should be commended. I would like to thank the previous ministers who have done all of the elementary and development work on this proposal. It has certainly been my pleasure to bring it before the House today to bring it to fruition. I believe this legislation does provide to industries in Australia an appropriate level of protection where dumping occurs. It also ensures that, where a country like China is making reasonable and commendable steps towards freeing up its economy, we recognise those achievements and give them credit where they have made improvements. I think we all know that China still has some distance to go. Therefore, it cannot be treated as a completely free and open economy in the current circumstances. That is why this legislation is before the House. I believe it will be welcomed by manufacturers and industry in this country. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

48,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am most appreciative that members of the government have provided me with an audience. This bill is the sixth omnibus taxation bill for 1997. It covers 10 separate issues relating to avoidance schemes, manipulating capital losses, simplifying the tracing rules for company losses, closing of a sales tax loophole on reimported goods, changes to fringe benefits tax, adjusting capital gains tax to take into account some deductible expenses incurred on real property assets, tightening of expense claims for insurance companies and clarifying depreciation rules for previously tax exempt entities-for example, assets which have been privati sed. The first area I want to concentrate on relates to those in the area of fringe benefits tax. The bill proposes to exempt certain benefits from fringe benefits tax and to alter the so-called arranger provisions. In 1995, Labor reviewed the operation of the fringe benefits tax with a view to simplifying the compliance burden and exempting some benefits where this was considered justified. Some considerable changes were made, including providing an exemption for outside hours taxi travel-that is to say, between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., the night hours-conducted by employees between work and home, and the provision of laptop computers to employees by employers to facilitate work away from the office. These were sensible changes which recognised that there was little or no private benefit by the employer paying for the items as they were really connected with work. In particular, the out of hours taxi travel exemption simply recognised the practice of many employers, including the Commonwealth, of providing taxi travel to their employees who either work late or have to come to work very early. The reason for this benefit being provided is not to provide any kind of rort to employees but merely to recognise that out of hours travel has special features. We know in the first place that public transport services are less available or, in some cases, are not available at all, particularly late at night. It not fair to tax an employer for providing an employee with what amounts to their only option for getting home. Secondly, the issue of safety of the employee, particularly late at night, dictates that taxi travel may well be preferable in many situations and that it would be poor social policy for a government to tax such an arrangement. Accordingly, Labor exempted this travel in this context from fringe benefits tax. This bill is introducing further changes to exempt all taxi travel 'from fringe benefits tax. Mr Deputy Speaker, in the view of the opposition, this will be an unlimited right to tax-free travel to and from work for those lucky enough to enjoy it. This will mean that directors and executives will be able to negotiate tax-free travel by taxi to and from work if they so desire. In practical terms, people working in low income jobs will not benefit from this proposal-it will be restricted to the better off. Ordinary people will continue to have to pay for their own travel to and from work on bus, train or tram and the like from their own income after they have paid their PAYE tax. Labor believes that this exemption should be opposed on equity grounds-that is, the exemptions which Labor introduced and which recognise the special circumstances of late night or early morning travel should remain but that no further exemption should be granted. Labor considered this issue in 1995 but rejected it on cost and equity grounds, and we remain convinced that that was the correct decision. The second proposed exemption relates to certain car parking fringe benefits provided by small business. Quite properly, if an employer provides an employee with subsidised or free use of commercial car parking facilities, for example, in the central business district of Sydney or Melbourne, that is a fringe benefit and is properly liable to fringe benefits tax. It is fair to say that this has been an unpopular tax measure with some employers, especially when the car parking facility is simply allowing employees to park on the premises. Substantial record keeping is required in some circumstances and it is approis priate to look at the car parking issue in the context of lessening the compliance burden on small business. To address these issues, the bill is proposing to exempt car parking benefits for some employers. The exemption will be limited to those small and medium businesses which are delineated by the tests of not being a public company for the purposes of the income tax law, not being a government body and having less than $10 million per year in gross income. The exemption will be provided only where the benefit is not provided in a commercial car parking facility-that is, it addresses the perceived anomaly where employers simply make space available for parking, but it will still ensure that high value commercial car parking spaces will be liable for fringe benefits tax. The opposition will support this exemption and the benefits that it provides to the small business sector. It will save a very substantial $35 million for business each year and will eliminate record keeping and compliance costs, which can be substantial in some cases. The third set of changes proposed to the fringe benefits tax are to change the so-called 'arranger provisions'. As well as benefits provided by employers to their employees, fringe benefits tax includes, in general terms, a benefit provided to an employee where that benefit is provided by some other party-a third party, a different party from the employer-under an arrangement with the employer. They are necessary provisions to ensure that fringe benefits tax cannot simply be avoided by getting people other than the employer, such as clients, to provide benefits on the employer's behalf. The government is proposing to alter these so-called 'arranger provisions' in this bill. new proposals purport to simplify the rules, but they may actually make more complex and less certain the liabilities of employers in some circumstances. There will now be two ways in which an arranger benefit will arise. It will be provided either under an agreement between the employer and the third party or if the employer is involved in a particular way in the provision of the benefit. So there will now be a test of whether the employer knowingly participates or facilitates the provision of a benefit. In this case, 'knowingly' includes a situation where the employer ought reasonably to have known about the benefit. The government is pretending that this is an improvement on the current situation. This is a matter of some debate. The Financial Review carried a report on this issue on 31 October written by Fiona Buffini. A tax partner from Coopers and Lybrand, Mr Chris Blake, is referred to in the article as stating that the changes highlighted the glaring complexity of the fringe benefits tax. It points out that Mr Blake, who is an expert in this area, said that if a third party invited an employee to lunch and the employer did nothing to stop it then fringe benefits tax would apply. If the third party invites the employee directly, there is no tax. But if the third party calls the employer first or invites them and the employee to lunch then under the new rules the employer may have to pay fringe benefits tax on the employee's lunch because the employer may have facilitated the benefit. Mr Blake then goes on to comment that this raises the question of how high up the level of employment has to go before the tax applies. He is quoted in the article as saying: It's hilarious until you actually have to advise someone. That is a pretty damning commentary on these provisions. An industry expert is saying that the government's legislation is a joke. If this is what the government means by simplifying and improving legislation, then the tax profession has perhaps passed judgment on this particular aspect. Labor will not be opposing the new regime. I note that it is one thing for rhetoric to be The employed by the coalition in opposition in terms of simplifying taxation legislation but, when they actually come to try to implement what they have claimed is so simple, they find that things are rather more complex and difficult in the real world of government. The government is increasingly on the nose in the business community as business finds that the government cannot deliver on the glib promises that it made whilst it was in opposition. I want to tum briefly to some of the other measures in the bill. I would indicate at the outset that these are generally of an antiavoidance or base protection nature and, hence, are supported by Labor. The first matter is the denial of artificially created capital losses. The provisions of schedule 1 of the bill will limit the total amount of certain capital losses incurred by corporate groups under the law to the level of the corporate group's actual economic loss. The general anti-avoidance provisions of part IVA are also amended to allow these provisions to now apply to schemes artificially creating capital losses in the year in which the capital losses are created. These amendments will protect around $100 million per year and have the support of Labor. This is further evidence that tax avoidance scheming never stops. There have been many earlier amendments on the capital gains tax provisions to stamp out artificiaIly generated losses, yet clearly further loopholes are always being found and exploited. To paraphrase a famous maxim, 'The price of a decent tax system is eternal vigilance.' I can assure the House that the Labor Party will continue to be vigilant in this important area of tax avoidance. Our attempts to stamp out tax avoidance got no support from those opposite. The second matter is the concessional tracing rules for company loss provisions. The company loss and debt deduction provisions of the income tax law will be amended by the provisions in schedule 2 to extend to companies two concessional tracing rules available to trusts. These are not actual concessions on amounts of tax payable but, rather, are simpler rules for tracing the underlying ownership of entities where such information is relevant. These simpler rules should lower the cost of compliance with the law and are supported by the opposition. The third item concerns the temporary importation of goods. These provisions close a smaIl loophole in the sales tax law whereby goods imported into Australia under a temporary importation exemption, used in Australia and then exported and reimported are not subject to sales tax. This bill imposes sales tax at the time of the reimportation and revenue is only around $2 million per annum. The problem is clearly not a major one from the revenue point of view. However, experience shows that smaIl leaks in the tax base do tend to increase significantly over time and that it is worth the effort to close off avoidance avenues when these are identified.",63

I inform the House that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop, will be absent from question time today. Mrs Bishop is addressing the British Aerospace Australia-UK Business Forum in Sydney, from which I have just returned. The Minister for Defence, the Hon. Ian MCLachlan, will answer questions on behalf ot Mrs Bishop. I also inform the House that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. John Anderson, will be absent from question time today. Mr Anderson is travelling to Victoria for Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council commitments and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott, will answer questions on his behalf. NA Native Title",65
51,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I join with the Acting Prime Minister in his best wishes to the Socceroos. I think they will come with slightly less of a handicap than they had the other night when 120,000 people were roaring against them. HopefuIly, it will be 80,000 roaring the other way. My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Can he confirm that his office told the Sydney Morning Herald that the letter written by his senior policy consultant, Mr Terry Ryan, saying that freehold title could be threatened by native title was 'not very weII worded' and that 'there was no intention to suggest that Wik had any impact on freehold title'. If this is the case, why has he allowed Tribunal. the Special Minister for State to persist with such disgraceful and untrue claims in the media today, especially when he knows the High Court has three times ruled 7:0 that freehold extinguishes native title?",65
52,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. He refers to a letter written some six months ago. He then refers to advice from my office apparently to the Sydney Morning Herald last night, and I have no reason disavow him of that advice because in fact Wik was a judgment on leasehold, not freehold, and in terms of that I have no particular complaint. I take this opportunity to say that the issue of freehold is back on the agenda not because of any letter written six months ago but because of Labor's amendments to our Wik legislation. The House is entitled to an explanation in relation to that statement. Firstly, the High Court has not ruled specificaIIy on freehold. It has passed comment by way of an obiter dicta, not an actual judgment, which said that freehold and leasehold, properly issued, extinguish native title. We agree; that was in Mabo 2. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with that statement inter alia that freehold and leasehold, properly issued, extinguish native title. What then happened? Secondly, the High Court returned to this issue in a specific judgment which, in effect, overturned one half of that statement. It said that, in respect of leasehold there will now be the concept of coexistence. Leasehold no longer completely extinguishes native title. That is an absolute statement in respect of the Wik judgment which then went on to give a postscript-I freely acknowledge-which said that, where there was conflict between pastoral leasehold entitlements and native title, the rights of pastoral leaseholder will in fact prevail.",66
53,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is a congenital lie.,66
54,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the member for Kingsford-Smith just accused the Acting Prime Minister of using a congenital lie. I ask him to withdraw that. I remind the House there are claims over freehold land in Bremer Bay and they have been issued by the National Native Title",66
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor will resume his seat. Mrs Crosio--You are mad. Mr Tuckey interjecting,66
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor.,66
57,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I did not accuse him of being a congenital liar. That is not what I said.",66
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. As I understood it, the word I heard was 'line'.",66
59,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thirdly, it is a matter of fact that there have been claims submitted over freehold. I will give you one specific example which relates to Narrandera in the federal electorate of Riverina. Both the federal member for Riverina and I went to Narrandera and were confronted earlier this year with claims over actual, residential freehold in the town of Narrandera. What our legislation seeks to do, and why there is a rising passion with regard to our legislation, is that we seek to fully protect freehold as an effective title in relation to which native title is extinguished. What we found late last night is that the official circulated list of Labor amendments seeks to strike out this protection of freehold which we are seeking to provide. This is the nub of the matter. Your amendments to division 2B seek to strike out the exclusive possession confirmation that we provide for freehold. Labor's legislation also seeks to delete schedule 4. True or false? Mr Gareth Evans-True.",66
60,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"True. Labor's the amendments to our amendments seek to delete schedule 4, which provides confirmation of exclusive possession with regard to certain categories of pastoral leasehold. Now we are getting to the nub of this debate. You have had it far too easy for too long, with too many inaccuracies in relation to this debate. I want to say that all we seek to do in our legislation is to provide fairness and certainty. Provision of native title remains on mainland Australia, and in fact, up to 79 per cent of mainland Australia can be claimed. The issue of freehold is around only because Labor will not support the coalition's confirmation of certainty and security over freehold land. We are for certainty, freehold and jobs. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Kingsford-Smith came to the dispatch box and claimed that he had not uttered two words. I did hear the member for Kingsford-Smith use the word 'liar', and he ought to be required to withdraw it. It is not parliamentary and those standards should be upheld.",66
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-'-I respect the Leader of the House's view in this matter. However, listened carefully. I did hear the comment. interpretation of what I heard, although poorly framed, was 'congenital line'. I am very drop. happy to listen to the tape and I am very happy to consult with Hansard. In the event that the words alleged by the minister have been used, then I will demand the member for Kingsford-Smith withdraw. But if the member the ALP again. for Kingsford Smith wants to pursue the point further",67
62,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the point of order, Mr Speaker: what I said was 'this is a congenital lie' .",67
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Lie?,67
64,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Lie. I was accused of calling the minister a congenital liar. I said I did not say that. If the minister would like me to withdraw the word 'lie', I am quite happy to do so-and I do so.",67
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable the member for Kingsford-Smith. We have tidied up that affair. Private New Capital Expenditure,67
66,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is' adparameter dressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the results of the SepWhat tember quarter survey of private new capital expenditure? How do the expectations for 1997-98 compare with the budget forecast?,67
67,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. I know her interest in the state of the Australian economy. She will be very pleased to know that the private new 'capital expenditure figures released for the September quarter today show very strong investment expectations over the course of the next year. Of course, everybody in Australia will welcome strong investment expectations, won't they? The poor old Labor Party-another bad day for the Labor Party. ,Good news for Australia-a bad day for the Labor Party, intervening in the way that they did .. Investment intentions were considerably stronger for business investment in 1997-98 reflecting very strong expected growth in equipment, which I am sure all Australians will welcome. The investment intentions shown for the 1997-98 year are at least equal I to the budget outlook for firm growth of My nearly eight per cent over 1997-98. Mr Gareth Evans-It's a four per cent",67
68,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These are particularly pleasing to all Australia, with the exception of the ALP interjectors-a miserable day for Mr Gareth Evans-Was this before the Asian crisis or after?",67
69,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These were taken during a period of stock market instability during October which would have been expected to have some depressing effect on expectations. Mr Gareth Evans-Before the extension of the crisis to North Asia, you goose!",67
70,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition very disappointedly said, 'It was taken before the extension of the crisis to North Asia.' If only it had been taken after, figures would have been a little worse-is that your point? If only they had taken it after, we could have had some worse figures. Here we have a desperate Australian Labor Party running around trying to move every they can to try to get bad news. Why do you want bad news for Australia? a mean-spirited negative lot you are! What a mean-spirited negative lot, running around saying, 'Oh, good news. But if only it had happened after North Asia.' Are you happy about North Asia? You would like that to be taken into account, would you? The fourth estimate for equipment investment in 1997-98 is over 13 per cent higher than the third estimate in July-August 1997 and over 12 per cent higher than the equivalent estimate for 1996-97. These are expected expenditures which show avery strong investment climate for Australia in 1997-98. I think all Australians will welcome a strong investment climate: a strong investment climate which comes off the back of low interest rates, which comes off the back of low inflation, which comes off the back of strong growth in the economy, which comes off the back of rising job opportunities, which comes off the back of strong retail sales and which shows that, in relation to the domestic economy, we are experiencing very strong conditions for the 1997-98 year. This is good news for Australia: good news in relation to investment, good news in relation to the climate and, with the exception of the Australian Labor Party, to be welcomed by all Australians. Native Title",67
71,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer is pretty easily pleased, with a four per cent drop.",68
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Move quickly to your question.,68
73,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is getting to be like Dr Kemp. We have got Kemp facts; we now have Costello facts. My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Why did you tell the House yesterday that the chair of the Cape York Land Council, Noel Pearson, had issued a native title claim of exclusive possession on a pastoral lease contrary to the High Court's decision that pastoralists' rights prevailed  so? Isn't it a fact that each of the relevant four leases in the Kalpowar holdings area had been cancelled and that, in other words, they no longer existed, and that the status of the land was therefore unallocated state or crown land perfectly claimable under the Wik judgement? Did the Acting Prime Minister intend to mislead the public or was it that, like his senior policy adviser, he just did not know what he was on about?",68
74,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I happen to have the Register of Native Title Claims C00655 in my hand. I would just make two points in response to the Leader. of the Oppo$ition. ' . Mr MCMullan-Were you right yesterday or not ? :,68
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the niemberf-r Canberra.,68
76,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ha-e been around long enough to know that you must not seek to mislead on the floor of this House. So yesterday-and I'll check the Hansdrd-I think I used the phrase 'they were leases in transition'. But in fact I am also advised since yesterday that the position is by no means clear and that in respect of at least one of those leases there is a possibility that the pastoral leaseholder has been issued with a permit to continue to live on that pastoral lease. All I can do is put to the House what is in my hand. I think the House is entitled to know that it states at the bottom of page 1 of this claim: The right to possession of the lands, waters and the resources and attributes of the lands and waters (""resources"") to the exclusion of all others. There is the claim and that is what stacks up in respect of what I said. I say this of Mr Pearson: I respect his intellect; I respect his capability to present his case with great aggressiveness. I do not respect him for calling me 'racist scum', and nobody else thanks him for the introduction of that terminology into this debate. Furthermore, it is an ambit claim in respect of a large section of Cape York. It is a claim for the use of the land to the exclusion of all others. And whilst I object to ambit claims-and I note that he says he objects to ambit claims-he said' over something else: that he was not going to proceed with a raft of these types of claims. Of course he continues to proceed with those claims. There is one correction I will make. He was not the only signatory on the claim. There. were many other signatories of the claim, and I am prepared to fully state that before the House as well. On matters Wik, on matters Mabo, this is a seminal debate for the nation as a whole. The nation has a right to be interested in what is at stake here and in the outcome that the government seeks by way of its legislation. I accept that we ought to get it right for the benefit of mainstream Australia and for all Australians and all groupings of Australians, including the Aboriginal people and the leaseholders. I respect the fact that the Aboriginal people have a deep-seated spiritual interest in their land-and having a deep and abiding spiritual interest is also capable of being the case with regard to pastoral leaseholders. It is not our fault that the High of this land ruled by the narrowest margin4:3 in respect of Wik-to create the coexistence of a title situation which is so impossible and impractical.",68
77,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What did they do in Newcrest and Coronation Hill?,69
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Banks.,69
79,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But we are going to fix it up, we are going to provide for certainty and jobs, and we are going to stand up to Labor's scaremongering on the issue. Asian Economic Crisis",69
80,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House what steps are being taken to provide a framework for currency stability in the Asian region?,69
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. A meeting of finance secretaries and central bank officials took place in Manila on 19 and 20 November to discuss financial instability in the South-East and North Asian region. At that meeting it was resolved that a new mechanism be established for regional surveillance and for dialogue and information exchange between the ministries and banks concerned, with support from the IMP, World Bank and Asian Development Bank. It was agreed that a cooperative regional financing arrangement be developed where participants would provide, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, supplementary financing on a case by case basis for IMF supported programs. It was also resolved that the IMF examine the possible establishment of a new mechanism to provide short-term financing to augment traditional IMF financing. On Monday and Tuesday of next week a meeting of ASEAN finance ministers and six other countries-including China, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea and the United States-will be meeting together to consider the work of the deputies and to endorse these proposals. In addition to that, members of the House will be interested to learn that at the Court APEC leaders forum in Vancouver it was suggested that early next year there be a meeting between APEC finance ministers and European finance ministers to discuss developments and ways in which initiatives could be developed to deal with the currency instability in the region. Australia has been actively involved in all of these regional initiatives. We have contributed to an IMF-Ied package in relation to Thailand, we have announced our availability for second-tier financing in relation to Indonesia, and there will be discussions between all of the finance ministers concerned at meetings starting early next week. As I have said before, a downturn in the South-East or North Asian region affects Australia. It affects our exports and it affects our jobs - It is not only in the interests of the region but it is in the interests of Australia to see financial stability return to the region and economic growth strengthened. That is why Australia is taking the position that it is in relation to these regional initiatives. That is why we are contributing expertise and have announced the two packages of loan funds that we have agreed to to help the adjustment process in those countries. The events in South-East and North Asia also demonstrate the importance of adequate policy responses in advance. They underline the importance of governments attending both to fiscal positions and to their current account and trading positions. They also underpin the importance of open, transparent and well regulated financial systems. The developments which are occurring in Asia are as much financial regulation problems as they are general economic problems, and considerable adjustment will be required in relation to financial supervision to get those countries into strong growth. From Australia's point of view, we have an interest as a good neighbour in the region, we have an interest as a nation, in stabilising the situation in South-East and North Asia and we will be making a major contribution in relation to that at the meetings to come early next week. Superannuation Surcharge",69
82,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question .is to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, I have been advised by the directors of a WA small business that the AMP has advised them that their superannuation fund, which supports 30 of their employees, will be required to absorb up to $11,000 annually in costs to administer the superannuation surcharge, including $3,000 for an actuarial certificate alone to allow for the provision of an estimated $6,000 in surcharge to the government from the one or possibly two employees liable to pay the surcharge. How does this situation sit with the government's promise to reduce the administrative burden on small business?",70
83,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has introduced some important reforms to the superannuation system to provide for a fairer system in the level of taxes that people pay. The fact is that the system that we inherited from the previous government provided a very significant tax advantage for people on high incomes. And that was not a fair system. We also inherited a $10 billion deficit that needed to be addressed. I will tell you why it needed to be addressed. If the government was not able to get its house and its finances in order, we would not have seen the fantastic reductions in interest rates providing real benefits to the people that you refer to. Some people have short memories, but not on this side of the House. Go back to the late 1980s and the early 1990s and you will find small business paying 15, 18, 20, 21, 22 and 23 per cent interest rates when Labor was in government. When we went to the 1996 election, one of the strongest claims upon us as the incoming government was to get this nation's finances back in order to finally give some real assistance to the small business community. Obviously there are administration costs involved in the scheme that we have introduced; but we as a government have been committed to reducing the workload for· the small business community. For example, iin the area of ABS collections, we have seen. a significant reduction in the red tape burdens on the small business community; In my area of industrial relations, with the transfer. Of industrial jurisdiction from the Victorian parliament to the federal parliament, we did not just remove a few forms but removed. a complete and entire layer of red tape which had been in the system since Federation. When it comes to red tape for small business, the fact is this government has got the runs on the board and we are committed to. going further. Employment",70
84,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of the changes to assistance for job seekers occurring next Monday, 1 December? How will these changes impr()ve the services for the unemployed and get more people into jobs?",70
85,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Swan for his question. This government is determined to address effectively the tragic legacy of unemployment left by the Labor Party. We are doing that of course by bringing through increasing numbers of real jobs. The government is also determined to address effectively the quality of assistance to unemployed people. Next Monday, 1 December marks the beginning of the government's overhaul of the way that unemployed people are helped into jobs. I can announce that from next Monday $16.2 million of Commonwealth funds will be available to 300 private and community agencies to find jobs for 65,000 unemployed people between 1 December this year and May next year. This is the first time ever that federal government funds have been provided to private agencies to place unemployed people in jobs. These 300 agenciesor probably somewhat over 300 agencieswill be in direct competition with the Commonwealth Employment Service in the provision of job placement services. This reform will help to place more unemployed people into jobs. It will do that because, first, these agencies will have access to many more job vacancies .than the CES. The CES has access to only some 20 per cent of job vacancies, and of course it is trying to place the bulk of unemployed people using its services into that 20 percent of vacancies. So the first thing the government is doing is expanding significantly the number of vacancies that will be available for unemployed people. Secondly, the job placement services will be using the expertise of people throughout the private and the community sector in these agencies to provide this job placement service. Assistance, for the first time, will be tailored to the needs of the unemployed person, because a very significant feature of the reforms the government is putting in place is the moving away from the rigid program structure that was so characteristic of the Working Nation programs of the Labor Party. Instead of unemployed people being placed, and in many cases forced, into these programs whether or not there was a job at the end, for the first time agencies will be paid when they place someone in a job and the assistance that they provide will be assistance that is best tailored to meet the job needs of the individual person. So we are seeing a very significant improvement in the job placement services that will be available to unemployed people. From 1 May next year, the CES network as a whole will be replaced with improved services for unemployed people by contracting out the $1.7 billion that would flow through the CES over the 19 months following that time if the Labor Party had been in power. Those services will be contracted out to community and private job placement agencies that will be paid not for program placements but for getting people into jobs. This puts to an end Working Nation. It drives the nail finally into the coffin of Working Nation and its inefficient, demoralising, expensive job placement programs which failed utterly to provide the sort of support that unemployed people need. The Leader of the Opposition knows this because on Perth radio earlier this year he admitted, 'It is true that out of a lot of ing programs people didn't get a job at the end of them.' But that has not stopped the Labor Party in their new draft platform bringing back these labour market programs that failed, reviving the $10 billion failed Working Nation program. They have run completely out of ideas about how to help unemployed people into jobs. The government recognises that there is a huge equity issue to be tackled here. We are putting into place the equity programs that will give unemployed people the chance they never had to get a job under the Labor Party. Native Title",70
86,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Yesterday the Acting Prime Minister agreed with the assertion that the $630 million Western Australian Yakabindi nickel project was 'effectively vetoed' as a result of overlapping native title claims, ending any immediate or significant development of the project. Is it not the case that the project has now been put on hold not for this reason but as a result of Dominion Mining's inability to raise the funds needed to lock its joint venture partner, the Korean Daewoo Corporation, into the project as a consequence of the slump in the world nickel price, the Asian economic crisis and the resultant share market nervousness crippling Dominion's fundraising drive? Mr Tuckey interjecting",71
87,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am very happy order.,71
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Chifley has a legitimate point of order?  draw your attention to the fact that the honourable member for O'Connor is interjecting and is not in his place. It is highly disorderly.,71
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have sighted the honourable member for O'Connor. He is already under warning today and I am sure, with great deliberation, he is returning to his seat to uphold the honour and propriety of the parliatrainment. I call the Acting Prime Minister.",71
90,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Perth for his question, but I put to him that there are a range of considerations which brought about the decision aimounced by the company with regard to Yakabindi yesterday. Perhaps one of those which might have indirectly had bearing was what happened at Bremer Bay in Western Australia. What happened at Bremer Bay I think many of you are about to hear for the first was set down forMr Stephen Smith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order",72
91,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is Western Australia. Mr Stephen Smith-My question was a very specific question in respect of a nickel project. It had nothing to do with Bremer Bay.,72
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,72
93,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has everything to do with Western Australia and indeed the very question you asked. Bremer lots 695 to 730 were listed for public auction on 7 October 1995. The land in question had been subdivided and serviced in 1993, prior to the commencement of the Commonwealth Native Title Act.",72
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order and it clearly goes to relevance. What on earth has this got to do with the question that deals with the Yakabindi claim the Acting Prime Minister made yesterday and the Korean Daewoo Corporation's inability to raise funds in relation to the situation which they confront as a result of the Asian economic crisis?",72
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition. There is no point of order, but I am sure the Acting Prime Minister is about to address the thrust of the principal question.",72
96,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It has everything to do with the legitimate issue of sovereign risk to which Australia was fully exposed. In respect of this, on that auction date",72
97,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,72
98,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You do not like this because you want to put in jeopardy freehold and we do not.,72
99,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order. Relevance is stretched very broadly and I understand why you would follow precedent on that. But there is also precedent for asking ministers to come back to the point when they are so far off it that they make themselves time. An auction look ridiculous.",72
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I am listening very carefully to the Acting Prime Minister's response and urge him to address the thrust of the question.,72
101,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, there were 27 lots sold at auction and, under conditions of sale, the freehold title issued to the purchasers are under payment of purchase money. It is now a matter of public record that those freehold lots were subject to a native title claim on 4 October 1995. That is fact and an incidence which could have had influence on the mining companies of Western Australia.",72
102,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this is becoming humorous, I accept that, but this is so far off the question that was asked. The Acting Prime Minister has had now two or three minutes going at it. Surely he could either be brought back to the point or sat down.",72
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. The Acting Prime Minister is using existing precedence to embellish an order, a-d I do invite him to resume his answer to thIS complex question.",72
104,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What our legislation seeks to do is provide certainty for the mining industry, for Aboriginal people and for leaseholders-particularly pastoral leaseholdersand jobs for Australians. That is why the sooner our legislation is in place, the better prospect there is for that mining project in Western Australia. Industrial Relations",72
105,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. In the lead-up to the election of the coalition government last year, there were many statements made that industrial relations disputes would increase. Can you inform the House of the effect that the place Relations Act has had on the industrial climate in Australia?",72
106,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for his question. I remember those headlines after a speech by the Secretary of the ACTU, Bill Kelty. Members may remember !We'll go to war for pay rises' and 'Unions prepare for war' in the Age. Remember, there were 1,000 shop stewards in the Melbourne town hall. In the Australian there was 'Kelty warns Howard: It's war over wages', and 'ACTU threatens wages push if coalition wiris'. Then the day after those headlines, members might remember the remarks of the member for Hotham-who is momentarily absent from the chamber; perhaps that explains the quieter tone in the place at the moment-in the article headlined 'Crean backs wage war threat'. This was followed up with memorable lines from Mr Crean-when asked about Mr Kelty's promise of wage claims and industrial war, et ceterasuch as 'I think they are statements of realicouraged ty,' and 'You'll get interest rates up and inflation up. That is a recipe for economic chaos.' Mr Crean made it clear that the blame for industrial and economic consequences he expected should be laid at the coalition's door. When the last set of monthly industrial disputes figures came out, I was rather interreputation ested in the results so I asked my department to do a bit of research so we could actually see what has been happening. Mr Crean said that the blame would be at our feet. I thought it was time that I stood up and accepted it. The figures are very interesting indeed. These more pay. are the official figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. You can count the number of industrial disputes by either the number of disputes or the number of working days lost per thousand employees. I have got both lots of statistics for you. The first lot show that in 1996 we had the lowest number of industrial disputes since 1940. We did not have World War III, we went back to 1940. The latest figures show that working days per thousand employees for the 12 months to August 1997 were lower than for any comparable period during the whole 13 years of the Work- previous government. We had the lowest number of actual disputes in 1996 since 1940. We have achieved a lower number of working days lost than the Labor Party achieved. On the number of disputes, the latest figures show we are on target for an even lower number of disputes this year than for that whole period, which is a quite incredible result. In terms of the figures being lower than they were for the whole of Labor's period, in fact it goes back much further than that. The figures for the 12 months to August are also lower than any previous annual figures since the ABS began compiling these figures in 1967. So you can go back 30 yearsMr Downer-Before Vietnam.",73
107,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before the Vietnam War, or before its conclusion, back to 1967. In terms of working days lost, 1997 is on target to be the lowest since 1959. The reality is that the legislation that we have introduced has enpeople to take a cooperative attitude to the way in which they deal with wages and conditions. Obviously, one of the chief objectives of our legislation is to encourage a cooperative attitude to work. The benefits of that are there for all to see. Not only do we reduce the number of disputes and, therefore, the lost wages-which are, of course, borne by employees-but we improve Australia's as a reliable supplier. So that means we are likely to get more export contracts, more jobs and higher living standards .. Immediately people take a more cooperative attitude to work it gives them a chance to do a deal where they can take home Rather than inflation being up, inflation is down. Rather than there being economic chaos-in fact we have had a good result in the time we have been in-and workers being at war, they are in fact better off with more dollars in their pockets. It goes to show you what incredible lies were told in the 1996 election and what the benefits of good lost government are for ordinary working people in the reforms that we have introduced.

108,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. It follows the answers he gave earlier both on investment expectations and the Asian economic situation. In the light of the deterioration in Asian economies which has now extended to North Asia, which President Clinton, among others, has described as a threat to the rate of world economic growth, what is the Treasurer's current estimate of the extent of the negative impact of all this on Australian growth and jobs next year? Is it realistic for investment expectations to be maintained at the level they may have been when tested just before the crisis extended to North Asia? Is it realistic hope, if this was ever the case, for four per cent growth in 1998? Do you now expect lower growth than you forecast in the budget?",74
109,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will try to answer it seriously.,74
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Thank you so much.,74
111,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Leader of the Opposition does not interject, I will try to answer it seriously. That would be a different event because, as I have said, I thinkMr Crean-It's Precious Pete. Go home, you great wuss.",74
112,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hotham interjects and he reminds me of a cocky in a pet shop. Cocky want a cracker! Just transport, he says every time. The question was in relation to growth. As I have said on a number of occasions, obviously there will be a downturn in South-East Asia and indeed in North Asia in relation to the currency and financial crises. That will affect Australian exports. Exports are part of the Australian economy and that will have an effect on Australia. To attempt to quantify it would be misleading at best because nobody knows the full extent of the fallout on Asia or the full extent of the fallout on Australia. You would not make assessment until you were aware of the full fallout in relation to that. I have said that on a number of occasions and the position is always the same. What would be the point of making such an estimate? We will make an estimate of growth in the Australian economy at the time of next year's budget. That is the time at which we do it and that is the time that we will put it out. I cannot see any significance in doing otherwise now. What we can say in relation to the Australian economy is that, if you want an indicator as to where the Australian economy is, you will get the best indicator in the national accounts which will be released· next week. Over the course of the last two quarters of this year we have had growth of about one per cent which is consistent with an economy growing between three per cent and four per cent-probably closer to four per cent than three per cent. As I have said before, that is very strong by world standards. The other to point I would like to pick up in the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question was that somehow we should not trust the investment expectations because they were taken before the full brunt of the Asian economy fallout. They were taken at the time of the financial instability in Asia. Mr Gareth Evans-When you were saying that it was before the crisis extended to North Asia.",74
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,74
114,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Most people in Australia would have said that they would have affected investment expectations. Mr Garf!th Evans interjecting,74
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,74
116,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Most people in Australia would today say, 'Wasn't it good that they didn't.' That is what people in Australia would say. They would say, 'Wasn't it good that there is strong investment intentions in Australia.' I think all Australians would say that, apart from one. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on the grounds of relevance. He is answering a question I did not ask.",74
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Gareth Evans-I asked a question about the implications of the extension of the crisis to North Asia, not what it was in the first part of October.",74
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--,-I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.",75
119,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order.",75
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Fine. The Deputy Leader of the' Opposition will leave the chamber forthwith. .The Deputy Leader .of the Opposition thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,75
121,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was exercising his right: to raise with you a point of order on relevance.",75
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I ruled it out of order. . Mr BEAZLEY --:-The standing orders provide for relevance, Mr Speaker. They provide for relevance.",75
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I invite the Leader of the Opposition to go and examine the standing orders in their totality. Is that your point order?,75
124,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My point of order is a question to you, Mr Speaker. Is there an entitlement upon members of this parliament to raise questions in relation to the validity of somebody's answer with regard to relevance?",75
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,75
126,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, Mr Speaker, there is.",75

131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Leader of the Opposition.,75
132,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I resume my seat in deference to you, Mr Speaker, but we want an understanding about our capacity to raise these issues in parliament, and we will persist in doing so till we get it.",75
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for MCPherson.,75
134,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, Mr Speaker, I am still going. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the fact that earlier today you warned the member for O'Connor, who has continued to interject and indeed was interjecting when the Leader of the Opposition was on his feet.",75
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat. I have warned the member for O'Connor hitherto. Mr Crean-Well why have you not,75
136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are not going to debate the issue. Resume your seat. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Having given the call to the member for MCPherson, you cannot now take that away and return it to the Treasurer.",75
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Treasurer had not completed an of answer and was kind enough to remind me of the circumstances regarding the concluding of his answer.,75
138,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was coming precisely to the question that I was asked by the honourable member for Holt which was that, because the investment expectations were taken at a time of instability in Asia, we could not believe them or we could not believe them fully. They were the investment intentions which were taken at the time of the survey. They were taken at the time when the fallout was very clear in South East Asia. Mr Speaker, I think all Australians, with the possible exception of the Australian Labor Party, would say, 'Wasn't it a good thing that Australian firms, knowing what they did, still had strong investment intentions.' Why would anybody go around as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did and say, 'Well, look, don't think that there are good investment intentions because if you timed it differently we could have actually had a bad result,' and a bad result would be a good result for the Australian Labor Party. I just do not understand the negativism and the antiAustralianness of this negative way in which the Australian Labor Party is now operating. I do point out that perhaps while the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is outside he will think about that and he will actually welcome the fact that we have strong investment intentions in Australia. Maybe even the Leader of the Opposition will rethink his position too and will welcome investment, jobs and growth and all of things that this government is about producing for the Australian people.",75
139,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence. Has the minister seen recent proposals regarding Australia's defence capability? How do these proposals compare with those of the government?,76
140,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCPherson for his question. I have seen a document which purports to be the ALP platform for Australia's armed forces, which no doubt was authorised by the member for Brisbane. I expected to find some substance and ideas in that document. Labor's master plan for capability, as that is; the structure, the equipment, the readiness, the sustainability of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, the planning and the resourcing framework which underpins all of those things-amounted to 11'h lines. Even the member for Reid, who is the newly appointed shadow minister for defence science and personnel, managed to get 70 lines in the 17 paragraphs that he put forward. It is extremely disappointing because when you initiate something like Army into the 21st Century and the defence reform program you would expect to see a platform that had some substance. Those three scant paragraphs that the member put forward are nothing different from Labor's record in the past, which resulted in hollow hulls and empty platforms. As I have said before, and people have recognised in the past, the policy of fitted for but not with. I have often thought the member for Brisbane was similarly fitted. The difference is that if we spend enough money we can fix the hulls but nothing can be done for the member for Brisbane. We should not be too surprised. After all, this policy is a platform from the party whose unofficial defence spokesperson Senator Reynolds in the US the other day opposes the US alliance, wants defence cut by five per cent and who says, 'Our priorities will be right when the Department of Defence has to have a cake sale to raise money for its battleships.' That is .one of your members in the Senate speaking. In regard to the second part of the member's question, I can only assume that these policies do not differ from the coalition's policies. There is not one word of Defence criticism in the platform about the coalition's policy. That is the first reason.",76
141,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We don't know what they are.,76
142,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You know what they are. The second reason is that the member for Brisbane has recently applied to become a member of the coalition. Mr Costello-Really?,76
143,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. He wrote to me on 17 November and again on 18 November. The letterhead states: he describes itRon Arch Bevis MP Federal Member for Brisbane Comer of Days and Grange Roads Grange, Brisbane Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. I will put that application forward to our backbenc-. I am sure they will consider it but not for long. I also table the document. Defence: Offshore Patrol Craft",76
144,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Minister, earlier this year you unsuccessfully urged your cabinet colleagues to cancel the proposed purchase by the Australian Navy of the Australian designed offshore patrol craft-the same design that was bid for Malaysia but which was recently beaten by a German bid. Minister, did you also instruct the secretary of your department, Mr Tony Ayers, to inform the Malaysian authorities that any Australian naval purchase of the offshore patrol craft would be equipped for peacetime tasks onlythat is, effectively without any weapons-and that he should make no commitments at all about the number of vessels that Australia would buy? How could you possibly justify undermining such an important Australian naval and industrial project? Minister, if you were not going to support the Australian designed ship, how on earth did you ever think the Malaysians would? M,r MCLACHLAN-I thank the member f9r Bri-bane for his annual question. Mr Speaker, as you know and as everybody in this chamber knows, the Transfield bid was a very professional bid.· It offered a vessel specifiCally designed for regional conditions. It was a collaborative joint project which had advantages for both the Malaysian and the Australian navies. The decision was one properly for the Malaysian government. I d not intend to comment on anything that might have happened in the cabinet. All I can say to you is that via the Prime Minister and the Treasurer who were in Malaysia weeks prior to their decision and via the secretary of my department we gave great support to that project. I will say this: the government is currently reviewing its overall strategic and investment priorities. There are pressures from other ADF investment proposals. I think it is worth recording the quote-this is a bit of revisionism on your part-by the shadow minister for defence, who said: We have just seen the Malaysian government decide not to go ahead with buying an offshore patrol boat that was designed here in Australia. Now instead of looking for the bigger ship-that is that ship-that we were discussing with Malaysia, we now have an opportunity to rethink all that. Bougainville",76
145,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to talks in Cairns regarding the conflict in Bougainville. What was the outcome of the talks? What is Australia's role in helping to resolve the long standing conflict in Bougainville? Have recent events in Papua New Guinea had any impact on the peace process?,77
146,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I know the member for Boothby has a very great interest in Australia's foreign policy. I am particularly pleased with the interest he has shown in establishing the Casey group. I am pleased to report to the House that the meeting in Cairns between 19 and 24 November between the parties involved in the tragic Bougainville conflict was a meeting which made important progress in advancing the current peace efforts. I myself went to Cairns on 19 and 20 November and had the opportunity to discuss the matter with many of the participants there. The Australian government is very happy to be able to playa role in facilitating the peace process. In the case of the Cairns talks, we obviously provided the venue and we made the travel arrangements for around 50 delegates who attended. At the conclusion of the meeting, the parties issued what is known as the Cairns commitment on the implementation of the agreement concerning the neutral regional truce monitoring group for Bougainville. This commitment, which was endorsed by all parties to the peace process, declares the bodies and groups represented will ensure that the truce monitoring group is safe at all times from attack, interference and hindrance. I know members on this side of the House would be very interested to hear that particular commitment because it is important to the Australians. Above all, from our perspective as Australians, it is important to the Australians participating in that truce monitoring group. The commitment also made it clear that the parties will provide all possible assistance to the truce monitoring group in performance of their mandate and urge all other bodies, groups and persons under the authority to do the same. So the Cairns meeting was a very important stepping stone in what is, frankly, a delicate process and what is likely to be a long running peace process. I will just make the point that it does disappoint me that the Australian Labor Party treats the Bougainville peace process with such disdain. I know that the current spokesman-he will not be the spokesman for long, I imagine-regards the previous foreign minister as a man who suffered from 'foreign policy fatigue', and he was happy to say so publicly. But I would have thought that the Labor Party would be interested in the efforts of many Australians to promote the Bougainville peace process, including this government, and would regard it as a serious matter. Clearly, you are a party that does not take public policy issues seriously at all. The last point the honourable member raised in his question was to ask whether events in Papua New Guinea have any implications for the peace process. Can I just say that I have seen reports of allegations made against the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister, Mr Skate. Can I make it clear that from the perspective of the Australian government this is, of course, a matter for Papua New Guinea-the Papua New Guinea government, the Papua New Guinea parliament and the people of Papua New Guinea. It is not appropriate for the Australian government to comment on those things. Papua New Guinea is an independent country making its own way in the world. Those allegations will have no implications for the Australian government's strong commitment to the current Bougainville peace process or assist with the drought relief effort in Papua New Guinea. Tourism",77
147,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport and Touris-. Minister, I again refer you to the recent comments by Bruce Baird, the Managing Director of Tourism Council Australia, where he noted that up to 50,000 jobs could be lost in Australia's tourism industry due to the Asian economic crisis. Can the minister confirm that the government has cut the budget of the Australian Tourist Commission by approximately $18 million? Can the minister also confirm that overseas visitor arrivals from Taiwan have fallen by seven per cent, South-East Asia by nine per cent, Indonesia by 11 per cent and Thailand by 63 per cent? Will the minister outline what strategy he will adopt to turn around this alarming outlook for Australia's second largest export earning industry and to protect Australian jobs?",78
148,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. It is true that since we last discussed this matter question time there have been one or two other developments in the markets and in the financial stability of some of our neighbouring countries that you referred to. But, as I said at that time, what is important is that we be realistic about this and not hysterical in any way. We recognise that not all our eggs are in one basket in the tourism sense. You can have slow growth in markets that are low yielding and, at the same time, you can have high growth in markets that are high yielding. In that sense I would point you to figures from October which indicate an increase in arrivals from the United Kingdom, year on year, of about 30 per cent. This is an extraordinary jump from a market that is generally more high yielding than the ones you specified. Further, I would indicate also the importance of the durability of Australia's brand as a tourist destination. In that sense let me simply say that it is very. unhelpful, in what is a very difficult and passionate debate taking place in this parliament concerning native title, for some players to be making statements using hysterical language, describing the government, for example, as racist scum. These sorts of statements go out on the wire services, travel all over the world and convey entirely the wrong impression about this country. Judiciary Amendment Legislation",78
149,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Attorney-General. It relates to the extraordinary stance taken by the opposition this week to vote against such a practical and worthwhile measure as the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1997. Can the Attorney-General tell the House what the implications will be for the Commonwealth and other consumers of legal services if the bill is blocked by Labor and the Democrats in the Senate? How does this backflip by Labor compare with the stated aims and policies of the Keating government?,78
150,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Indi for his question. It seems the opposition, and in particular the shadow Attorney General, Senator Bolkus, have a failing memory. The senator left the member for Banks out on a limb, telling him to oppose in the Judiciary Amendment Bill. One wonders what support was given by caucus to that opposition and whether the Leader of the Opposition knew or approved of that opposition, and one wonders whether the legal committee knew anything about it. The decision to oppose such a sensible bill is made quite remarkable when you think of what it actually builds upon. It builds upon significant decisions taken by two of my recent predecessors, Michael Lavarch and Michael Duffy. What SenatorBolkus is doing is hampering the reform process that the Labor Party actually put in train. Senator Bolkus wants to prevent the Australian Government Solicitor from taking full advantage of opportunities in the government legal services market. In doing so, whether he knows it or not, he is placing at risk the ability of the AGS to compete with private law firms. The bill will mean that the Australian Qovernment Solicitor, the government's own law firm, is placed in the best position to compete effectively in that market. It also means that consumers of legal services will benefit from competition through lower costs and more efficiency. Michael Duffy and Michael Lavarch opened up significant nonpolicy legal services to competition, but it seems that Senator Bolkus does not know that, or at least did not tell his caucus. Michael Duffy and Michael Lavarch knew that if departments had to pay for their legal services out of their own funds, they would be more prudent and more selective in seeking that advice. Michael Lavarch, in a press release in 1994, said: Charging for legal services on use by departments and agencies. Introducing competition for the supply of government legal services is an important part of the reform agenda for the legal profession as a whole. One might ask how the opposition position on this bill fits in with the new Labor platform, which is headed 'Community security and access to justice'. It says that the Labor Party has a policy to abolish anti-competitive practices engaged in by the legal profession. Its opposition to that bill entirely opposes and ignores that policy. I wonder whether Senator Bolkus told caucus about that point. We have a backflip on the previous government's policy and a bellyflop on its new policy. Tourism: Reef Tax",78
151,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Minister for Sport and Tourism. Does the minister acknowledge that there will be severe implications for Australia's tourism industry, particularly in Queensland, as a result of the introduction of the second tranche of the reef tax due to come into effect on 1 January 1998? Is the minister aware that in September 1995, in response to a proposal to increase taxes on the marine tourism industry, his colleague Senator Parer wrote: The coalition has made a public commitment not to increase or introduce any new taxes in the tourism industry. In the name of maintaining our export industries and to honour our publicly stated commitment to the tourism industry, this measure should not apply to the marine tourism industry. Why have you ignored your own internal advice and imposed this job destroying reef tax?",79
152,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once again, I thank my honourable friend for another question. With regard to the user charge for the reef, let me put it in a larger context. What is important in the tourism industry is not simply the promotion of Australia as a destination but the profitability of the enterprises that work in that industry, many of them being particularly small. The reforms that this government has undertaken since taking office have gone squarely to that issue, especially in the area of industrial relations. In that respect, I took some time to peruse the Labor Party's draft platform, this poisonous document. When I turned to the section about had a significant impact tourism",79
153,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I realise that the chances of actually getting anything through on this are remote, but I raise a point of order on relevance. A highly specific set of questions on the reef tax were asked and now we are getting a general rave on the Labor Party's platform.",79
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,79
155,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If they want to talk about the reef, we might have to talk about the native title claim over the reef as well. But I will not trespass into that area just yet. What I will talk about and explain to the House are some of the phrases in the section on tourism in this draft platform. In particular, there is a commitment to increase flexibilityMr Crean- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order that goes to relevance. This is beyond a joke. The question was specific. It was about the reef tax. The minister is now going to Labor Party policy. Get him back to answering the question.",79
156,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,80
157,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me simply say that, on the issue of the profitabilicoverage ty of enterprises in the tourism enterprises, including those that pay the user charges over the reef, have an interest in trying their best to improve their profitability. One of the chief things, especially in service industries such as those in the tourist business, is the issue of industrial relations. Your platform maintains that you propose to introduce flexibility.",80
158,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is way out of relevance. It is not conceivable that this could be regarded as relevant.",80
159,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have some sympathy with the point made by the Leader of the Opposition. The minister will return to the thrust of the question.,80
160,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They want to introduce flexibility in workplace relations.,80
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister, your digression from the thrust of the question is bordering on the extreme. I invite you to return to the thrust of the question.",80
162,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed. As they pay the user charge over the reef and they think about all that flexibility, they turn to another part of the platform that deals with industrial relations. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Even I would have drawn the issue of relevance to the attention of the minister at this stage. The question was specifically about the reef tax; that is, $4 per head per trip in a boat for every person who goes out to the reef.",80
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I very much remember some of the well-established precedents you made. One phrase constantly returns to my mind, and I think it is 'no point of order'. However, the minister would be unwise to test my patience much further.",80
164,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have had a bit of flexibility from the chair as well as from the Labor Party. I take your point, Mr Speaker. All I say is that measures taken to restore profitability to the tourist industry to enable them to deal with issues such as the user charge require not comprehensive award in the tourist industry but our sort of industry, those IR reforms. Sales Tax",80
165,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, could you please advise the House of the difference in equity and efficiency between a value added type, broad based consumption tax, a wholesale sales tax and a point of sale tax? Have you heard reports that there are those in Australia who favour retaining our current wholesale sales tax? Can you advise the House how many other countries still utilise such a tax mechanism?",80
166,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. As somebody who has extensive business experience, he would know that one of the things that business really wants in this country is tax reform and, particularly, that any party that wanted to support manufacturers would want to reform the wholesale sales tax, wouldn't they,-because the wholesale sales tax is one of the biggest burdens on manufacturers in this country. I do not think there would be any political party of goodwill that might would not be in favour of tax reform in Australia-not one party of goodwill in Australia would be against tax reform. As it happens, I actually have a copy of the caucus briefing note on tax reform issues from Gareth Evans, the Deputy Leader of Opposition and the shadow treasurer. He has a whole lot of questions and answers. I will see if I can answer the questions. The first one is: is it true that Labor doesn't want to be part of the tax debate? Government members-Yes!",80
167,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I think so. The second one is: is Labor looking backwards on tax reform? Government members-Yes!",81
168,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. The third one is: has Labor backflipped on GST since 1985? Government members-Yes!,81
169,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Will Labor vote for the GST if the coalition is elected? Government members-Aah!,81
170,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Aah! The next one is: why does the Labor Party oppose a GST? That is a good question. Question 6 is: isn't the Australian tax system broke? It then goes on. I am going to release that during the course of the tax debate. I thank the member of the caucus who sent that to me, because it will be of great assistance. Mr Speaker, they are not all against tax reform. I wanted to tell you about that. International work on the tax system has actually shown that multi-stage tax is better than single-stage tax because it is much harder to avoid, and value added taxes are better because they are much simpler. They allow everybody throughout the chain of production to actually claim an input credit. The difficulty with our wholesale sales tax system is that there are so many exemptions and so many users, you have to collect numbers, you have classification problems, you have different rates, and it increases complexity for small business. One of the things about single-rate multi-stage tax is that not only is it simpler for business, but they get inputs on all of their taxes and taxes do not cascade through the system. Any party of goodwill that wanted to help our exporters would also want to rebate input taxes for exporters. At the moment, around the world, Australian exporters are putting their goods onto the world stage with taxes built into their price. Everybody else around the world is taking those taxes out and allowing their exporters the opportunity to compete on international markets. Why would we penalise our exporters like that? Why would we refuse to reform a tax system that does not give them a fair go? It is important to be part of the tax debate in this country. We would have liked it if Labor could have been forward thinking rather than reactive and negative in relation to this issue. But it is important that there be leadership in relation to this. As usual, it will be the coalition that will be leading, the coalition that will be taking up the argument, and the coalition that will be standing to help manufacturers and exporters who deserve a fair go.",81
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I call the next questioner, I am always reluctant to send the honourable member for O'Connor home to Perth early, but your constant and continual interjections this day have ensured that even my patience has worn thin. I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for O'Connor. The honourable member for O'Connor thereupon withdrew from the chamber. Small Business Innovation Fund",81
172,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Can the minister confirm that part of the government's response to the Bell report in March this year was the establishment of the small business innovation fund? Can the minister confirm that the guidelines have now been changed and that the small business innovation fund has been renamed the innovation investment fund, to exclude small business and to concentrate solely on medium sized enterprises with very high growth potential? Will fund managers in the new IIF still be announced in December 1997 as promised? Does this sleight of hand make a mockery of the government's pledge to small business? Was the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business consulted on this change or was the SBIF, like many others, just a non-core promise?",81
173,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The innovation investment fund is a great step forward by the government in terms of harnessing risk capital to develop research and development projects in Australia. It is a great initiative by the government, and it is available to both small and medium sized business, as well you would know. If you did your homework and read the statements you would understand the situation. Right at this very moment, the applications are being judged by. the Industry Research and Development Board and I anticipate that the schedule will be met. Irrespective of the times and the dates, this particular initiative of the government is one which will do more for the development of research and development in Australia than the Labor Party ever thought of doing. It is a remarkable achievement to be able to get the private sector to raise their money and to manage it and to pick their projects so that they can develop research and development in Australia to commercial outcomes for the benefit of the whole of Australia. Exports",81
174,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware of the success of Fitzroy River Meats in Rockhampton in the electorate of Capricornia? This is a new company that has fallen on its feet because of good management and development of overseas markets. Is the Acting Prime Minister also aware that the company last week increased its production from 10 tonnes a week to 60 to 70 tonnes a week?,82
175,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Capricornia highlights another export breakthrough of which he can be proud, Austrade can be proud and Fitzroy River Meats can be proud. It is about effective linkage with regard to our export networks and flows in part from the operation of the Austrade office in Rockhampton, an outrigger office manned by Mr Robert Armstrong. It is one of a set of pilot associate offices operating in Wagga Wagga, Bathurst, Nowra, Coffs Harbour and, as I mentioned, Rockhampton. It is located in the business centre and it is supported by the local shire councils, the university and other local organisations, including chambers of commerce. It has a particular focus on the Pacific and PNG. It is helping companies, small and large, around Rockhampton to identify export markets, to provide the linkage to get into export and then to start exporting. So I am delighted to learn of Fitzroy River Meats' breakthrough-a further expansion in meat industry exports to this part of the world. I add one other thing in respect of exports and the export market development grants scheme: in that area around Yeppoon and Rockhampton, under the coalition government's efforts, we have given the tourism industry full access to the EMDG for the first time ever. Exports",82
176,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. We have already seen the cancellation of significant orders for live cattle from North Queensland and the Northern Territory as a result of the currency devaluations in Indonesia and Malaysia. What is the government doing to try to sustain Australia's agriculture and food processing opportunities in the face of the wider currency changes now beginning to emerge in the region?,82
177,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A very bland question at the end of a successful set of question times for the coalition government. We are providing real assistance to exporters in northern Australia. We are doing that by way of a range of activities-the export market development grants scheme is one; the AAA package launched by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is another which provides indirect assistance to put primary industry on the front foot and contend with all the tough circumstances and times which confront primary production in northern Australia and export activity in northern Australia. It is certainly not easy to adjust to all that has been happening during the course of October and November 1997 to a number of our trading partners. It is a very serious situation in relation to Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and now more broadly in relation to events in Korea and Japan. So the Australian government is conscious of the need to look at every possible step which we can responsibly take to ease the burden of the situation. I join the Treasurer in reiterating that Australia is better placed to weather the storm as a consequence of our macro policy settings on the economic front, our fiscal policy, our five consecutive lowerings of interest rates and the other steps which have been taken to provide more competitive circumstances for our exporters. I note that the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Shane Stone, has commented that what is making it very difficult for investment and, inter alia, export activity is the whole question of jeopardy that has been created by native title and the need to have our native title legislation passed. It will help greatly if the Senate gets on with considering that particular piece of legislation. Women in Parliament",82
178,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for the Status of Women. Can the minister advise the House whether the coalition government will reconsider its position not to introduce quotas to increase the number of women in parliament?,83
179,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have achieved outstanding results in this place without quotas. We do not intend applying a quota system. I thank the member for Makin for her question. You only have to take a quick glance around this place and it is quite easy to see which of the parties has a genuine commitment to increasing the number of women in parliament. It is the coalition-the parties without quotas. We have 18 women sitting on our benches in this place; there are four sitting opposite. It is not that Labor women are not trying and it is not that Labor women are not interested. The Labor Party just does not have the political will to achieve its own targets. As recently as last week its policy platform was released without the full endorsement of the party, and commitment No. 22, chapter 11, says: Labor will increase the representation of women parliament. I have to say that this rings pretty hollow; they are just words again. You only have to look at Labor's actions to see that there is no genuine commitment to women at all. There have been ample opportunities in recent weeks for them to preselect women. There has been Mitcham, Gellibrand, Bowman, Lilley-in all these seats the Labor boys have closed ranks and shut the women out. It was even reported that the Leader of the Opposition called in the big guns and flew ALP national secretary, Gary Gray, to Perth to help beat off attempts by Helen Creed to contest his own seat. I read in this morning's West Australian: 'ALP backslides on women for election'says elder stateswoman, Pat Giles. That was the headline this morning. Mr Beazley came under fire also for dumping a high profile woman candidate for the seat of Gellibrand in favour of a man. What was his response to the criticism, Mr Speaker? It was to dump the man as well and reopen nominations to cover himself. He is so transparent and his party is so transparent, and women of Australia are not going to be fooled by them. Labor has found one seat for women-the seat of Dickson-and again Labor women were just not good enough. The Labor boys had to poach Cheryl Kernot from the Democrats, and this is a real slap in the face for Labor women. It is their party alone which is saying to Labor women, 'You don't matter. Your views don't matter. Your policy suggestions don't matter. We don't want you.' That is what Labot"" is saying to women of Australia and to women in this place. When push comes to shove, Labor men get pushed into parliament and the women are shoved aside. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Native Title",83
180,Mr TIM FISCHER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I seek to add to a question from the member for Perth. I am advised that a Mr Ken Dredge of Dominion in Mining has provided information to a member of the government saying: They could not get overseas funding because of the title uncertainty arising from native title claims. To assist the member for Perth, I pass that information on to the House. NA NA Report",83

184,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: could we get some indication from the Leader of the House as to how long we will be sitting next week, whether he still expects us to be sitting on the Friday and adjourning or whether he has been able to ascertain when the Senate is likely to conclude the native title debate that may require us coming back the following week. We would be keen to know what the government's intentions are because I am sure there are members on both sides of the House who have important electorate commitments which they have had to reorganise because of this extra week of sitting. They want a bit of certainty as to what this government is doing in managing this joke of a program in both houses.",84
185,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Hotham has brought up a topic that, I think, should properly be addressed outside the chamber. If the honourable minister wants to amplify the situation, then I am happy for him to do so.",84
186,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I will respond briefly, Mr Speaker. Obviously, the Wik debate is continuing in the Senate and time has been put aside for that next week. The government would like the matter completed next week and, as I understand it, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate has been attempting to obtain sufficient time from the opposition parties, including the Labor Party in the Senate, so that they can have sufficient government business time to bring the matter to a conclusion. It is quite incredible for the Manager Opposition Business (Mr Crean) to be pressall ing us when the Labor Party has 400-plus amendments in the Senate and clearly, as political ploy, would like to obstruct and delay the timely passage of that legislation. You would love to obstruct and delay it, wouldn't you? It is part of your tactics. view is that this matter ought to be dealt and dealt with expeditiously. You should do all in your power, in discussions with your colleagues in the Senate, to talk some into them. As to the position as at this point in time, on the basis of the discussions I have had with my colleagues in the Senate, they would hope for additional time to be agreed. My expectation is that all members of this House should make plans to be here on Friday of chose not to. next week and I would hope that the matters would then be concluded on the Friday. I have no information other than to say that the schedule of the Senate provides them the opportunity to complete matters. If it is late personon the Thursday night, time would be required for the transmission of to the lower house and we would then debate it on Friday morning. Mr Crean-And if they do not conclude until Friday?",84
187,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Quite frankly, if they do not, you will have complaints to lodge with your own side in the Senate.",85
188,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,We have had sufficient debate on this issue.,85
189,Mr CREAN,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"On indulgence: if the Senate does not conclude until Friday-and the Leader of the House has acknowledged the time that it is going to take to get the material over-what is the point in us sitting on the Friday if we have not got material to deal with until, presumably, Sunday?",85
190,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"My fear is that the Labor Party is preparing the ground for further delay tactics in the Senate. The fact is that time has been of made available to give ample opportunity to members of the Senate to debate the various issues before the Senate. The schedula ing has been arrived at after discussion between the parties going back now for many weeks. All these matters have been discussed in the Senate. The truth is that you and the Our Democrats and the Greens have the capacity with to agree upon a schedule for the timely consideration of all matters before the Senate. As I understand it, you have failed to do so, sense but there are ongoing discussions.",85
191,Mr MELHAM,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,That is not true.,85
192,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"That is true, Daryl. That is the fact. Mr Crean-That is a lie.",85
193,Mr REITH,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"You could easily have come to an arrangement with us weeks ago, but you",85
194,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Hotham will withdraw that remark. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, today this same",85
195,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am asking you to with the documents draw the comment. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I withdraw, but I point out that you did not require him to it withdraw when he used the same term.",85
196,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Resume your seat. Mr Crean-This is inconsistent.,85
197,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"There is no debate. Resume your seat. NA Application of Standing Order 304A  to you about the application of standing order 304A. As we witnessed in question time, two members were ejected. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was warned-and I suspect he did not hear the warning-but was ejected 30 seconds later. The honourable member for O'Connor was warned, was disorderly in removing himself from his chair and interjecting, returning to his chair and interjecting andMr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: members are entitled to ask you questions but they are not entitled to ask you questions as a disguise for challenging a decision you have made during question time. That is what is being done here, and I believe you should rule the question out of order.",85
198,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the minister. His . obviously a point, and I will address the substance of it because I think it needs to be addressed, in light of some of the reactions that we saw. The reality is that I had warned the Deputy Leader of the Opposition earlier. The point of contention was that he ignored my ruling when I declared that there was no point of order on the point of order that he had raised. We were not addressing the substance of the issue. He merely defied my ruling continuously by debating the issue. That is the reason 304A was applied. In respect of the honourable member for O'Connor, who is no longer with us, I think that speaks for itself. NA",86
199,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: . The government's mismanagement of university policy and its damaging impact on the educational opportunities of young Australians. I therefore call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",86
200,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Werriwa) (3.41 p.m.)This is a government without leadership, a government without purpose. It is a government with no idea as to where it is taking Australia. This is especially true in the area higher education policy. All that our great national institutions, our 36 public universities around Australia, have received from this government is funding cuts and policy drift. The truth of the matter is that in the first coalition budget in August 1996, they abolished $840 million of growth funding for Australia's universities and with that funding cut 21,000 university places: 21,000 university places were cut under this government's funding policies. It is always interesting to hear. from the spin doctor opposite, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp), so labelled by his Victorian colleagues. He is not referred to with any amount of respect; he is just dismissed as the spin doctor who is always trying to put a false interpretation on these figures. It is always interesting to hear from Minister Kemp his interpretation that these massive funding cuts actually represent growth in the system. I have to say that, for all her many other faults, at least Senator Vanstone had a bit more honesty when it came to this question. The interesting thing about Senator Vanstone is that whenever she was in 'trouble over the question of her unpopularity, the fact that she could not visit Australian universities or the fact that academics, students and parents Education across the board were dissatisfied with this government's policies, she would simply say, 'Well, we've made the largest funding cuts for universities.' Her department had to take the largest share of the government's so-called fiscal consolidation program. This is what she told Meet the Press on 2 February this year: The general premise is that when you have gone in and made very substantial changes and made very substantial savings there is obviously not much more to get. That was Senator Vanstone's piece of honesty: very substantial changes, very substantial savings. It is a reflection on this government's poor priorities for education policy that, in relation to. the $120 billion envelope of Commonwealth funding, they would decide to make education and training the No. 1 target for their funding cuts. The reality with the coaliof tion budgets is that education and training is the No. 1 target for funding cuts while at the same time other large areas of Commonwealth expenditure are quarantined totally from the funding scalpel. Senator Vanstone at least had the honesty-the honesty this minister has not got-to own up to the fact that there were very substantial savings. The No. 1 priority for funding cuts was found in the education and training portfolio. As a consequence, the minister has no substance whatsoever. Dr Kemp-Time has moved on.",86
201,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, time has moved on since you put the knife in her back. The funding policies have not changed. You have inherited her funding policies. and the very substantial savings that are abolishing 21,000 university places. At least when Senator Vanstone was in trouble she was honest enough to own up to the truth. These funding cuts are having an horrendous impact on universities around Australia. As I travel around the universities I hear of courses being abolished and academics being faced with redundancies. A whole campusthe St George Campus of the University of New South Wales-is being closed down. It is a tragedy for Australia that the University of New South Wales is to lose 1,900 student places and $14.4 million from its budget. This is a story that is being repeated at university after university. The greater tragedy is what it is doing to the aspirations of young Australians, the aspirations of those young Australians who want to work and study hard at school and take their very best opportunity in life-a university education. It has destroyed those aspirations for a generation of young Australians. The applications for enrolments are in free fallDr Kemp-The numbers are up.",87
202,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister is at it again. The figures are in free fall; he is saying they are up. It is the Orwellian approach of saying that the biggest saving cuts in the budget in fact equal growth. It is the work of a spin doctor-so labelled by his own Victorian colleagues-a spin doctor through and through, to adopt the Orwellian approach of somehow thinking that the figures have gone up when they are in free fall. The number one target for budget cuts has been education but somehow in this distorted, weird mind of his he has the temerity to say that there has been growth in the sector. Minister, the figures are fairly simple, and they are in free fall. In New South Wales and the ACT: a fall in applications for 1998 of 8.7 per cent-a large drop from applications for 1997. In your own state of Victoria there has been a fall of 2.5 per cent. Queensland is four per cent down in applications, South Australia is 1.3 per cent and Western Australia is 2.6 per cent down. What sort of minister could sit there undisturbed about those figures? What sort of minister could face the prospect of driving away a generation of young Australians from aspiring to a university education? I do not know what problems you have had in your miserable existence, Minister, but to do that to young Australians is one of the saddest things that anyone in a position of public responsibility could do in this parliament. It is a terrible thing for this country and its young people and for all those parents and friends who support their aspirations to see these figures and for you to sit there denying the truth, for you to sit there and try to tell this House that the figures are not in free fall. Dr Kemp-Is this the best you can do?",87
203,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, is this the best you can do? Is it the best you can do to drive a generation of young Australians away from a university education? What sort of pride do you take in doing that to young Australians? What sort of pride do you take in doing that with your narrow ideology and your miserable existence trying to force that on to other people? You should be ashamed of yourself.",87
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)Order! The minister will refrain from interjecting and the member for Werriwa will please address his remarks through the chair.,87
205,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Out of this terrible situation for universities and the aspirations of young Australians the government tried to throw one sop to the university sector. It was to be called the West report.. Their one idea in policy formulation was to establish a committee. This government of flip-flops and policy reversals in this instance decided to set up a committee. Again, to quote the words of Senator Vanstone, it was not going to be a committee that was of little consequence. This is what she had to say in announcing its terms of reference in January this year: The panel the government has chosen will be well equipped to carry out a review that will have reaching consequences for Australian universities over the next two decades. Far-reaching consequences over the next two decades? The truth is that it did not last two minutes. The report was jettisoned by this minister here with a press release late at night before the release of the West discussion paper. It did not get two minutes of public consideration. And under this minister's manipulation of due process it might not even get to a final report. So all those supporters of the university sector in Australia who are looking for a bit of guidance, a bit of direction on policy issues, face a minister now who took the document to cabinet in unusual circumstances and selectively leaked to the media the fact that he is not planning to commission a final report from the West committee. That is an absolute outrage for all those people who troubled themselves to make a submission and who took this government at face value when it said that this would be a report with far-reaching consequences over the next two decades. The truth is that the West committee has long gone west under this minister. This is something that is just typical of the way in which the minister has conducted himself. He is only interested in funding cuts and cheap publicity. He is only interested in two things in the discharge of his responsibilities: funding cuts and cheap publicity. His decision to jettison, to undermine, the West committee has either wasted $2 million of taxpayers' money or the minister cannot be believed in his press release when he claims that he does not support vouchers. One thing I will say about Minister Kemp is that we would give him credit for the virtue of consistency. For 30 years, either advising politicians or being one, he has not changed his mind on one single issue. And the minister nods. So why would anyone think for a moment that he is now opposed to vouchers? Why would anyone see the minister nodding about his narrow ideology and his rigid adherence to policy when he puts out a press release saying that he does not support vouchers? This is the man with the passionate gleam' in his eye, with the ideological obfarsession, who strode around Australian universities in 1993 loyally carrying his copy of Fightback, the last man standing with a copy of Fightback under his arm in 1993. He took the boos, the jeers, the tomatoes of Australian university students while saying that if he stood for one thing it was going to be vouchers. Minister, it is a bit rich-I know you like putting the spin on, being the spin doctor on every single interpretation-and we all know it, for you to be saying that you do not support vouchers. It is a like your saying you do not support labour market deregulation; you do not support the free market. You have not changed your mind on a single issue for 30 years. Every single Australian student and supporter of universities knows that, if the coalition were to be re-elected, as sure as night follows day you would be introducing those university vouchers. It really is rich indeed-like Dracula saying that he no longer supports the Red Cross-for Minister Kemp to be saying that he no longer supports vouchers for universities. The one thing about university policy is that it exposes the wide gap in ideology and attitude when it comes to education. It is certainly true-and people say this as I move throughout the university sector-that in aspects of policy the gap between Labor and the coalition in the past decade narrowed in some areas. But the policy gap in education is large and growing, because we are not a political party which would ever make education and training the number one target for budget cuts. We are a party which believes in the public purpose of education. The coalition engages in this narrow debate about whether education should be treated as a private or a public good. Their conclusion is that you should attach a user charge and an up-front fee to every single aspect of private benefit out of education. The ALP has a totally different approach. When we hear the term 'user pays' in education our assumption is that society is the user and the beneficiary of education and, as a consequence, it should be the funder of universal education access through the work of the Commonwealth and its revenue raising powers. At a time when education has become so important, the ultimate expression of national sovereignty in a world of economic globalisation, knowledge as an economic input has grown in significance. The overall importance now of lifelong learning, the fact that good citizenship needs to be based on a sound education in an information rich society-all these things bring education and training even higher on the Labor agenda. An even greater priority will be given under the next Labor government to the significance of education and training. I use an outdated term that somehow got a bit of use in the parliament earlier this week: socialisation. If we want to do one thing, it to socialise knowledge, to socialise the public access to knowledge. It is the belief that in a fair and decent society every single citizen needs to access information and knowledge, the power of lifelong learning. For those people on the other side who want to attach to our side some adherence to socialisation, I proudly say: let us socialise knowledge; let us socialise the public access to lifelong learning. Under a Labor government there could be nothing more important for the fairness and the decency of our society than that commitment. It means regrowing post-secondary access in Australia. It means the inevitability of the Commonwealth taking even greater responsibility for all the postsecondary functions in education, in TAFE, in vocational education, in universities, in adult and community education, and in Third Age institutions. It means abolishing the up-front fees that this minister is supporting and is prepared to extend. We should not have in Australia, in a fair society, one rule of access for the rich and another rule of university access for the poor. I say that if students work hard, study hard, and display all the virtues of intelligence and hard work through their school days, they deserve one set of rules for university access, on the basis of merit-not on the basis of having $100,000 spare in the bank, but on the basis of merit. In terms of the spin doctoring and the fantasy, he was even here in the House earlier on this week saying, 'Oh, this could cost 90,000 places.' Do a bit of mathematics: there are eight universities in Australia that are levying the up-front fees. If you say they are going to collect 90,000 places, you are talking about 11,000 places at each university. An average university in Australia has 20,000 places. This minister, so deluded and so in a state of fantasy, has the belief in his head that some time in February next year these universities will be accommodating an additional 11,000 students each. Minister, it is just not going to happen. You are in a constant state of delusion and fantasy about the impact of your policies. The Labor Party will further broaden access by returning HECS to a moderate repayment is scheme, instead of this punitive scheme that is driving away a generation of young Australians from taking on their best opportunity in life through a university education. The Labor Party will simplify and strengthen the Austudy scheme, which this government has systematically butchered to the point now where the Commonwealth Ombudsman has said that you need a PhD to understand Austudy. A law that cannot be understood is a bad law, and a funding system which cannot be understood by a single student in Australia is a bad system-butchered and manipulated by this government. The further initiative of the ALP in building the virtues of universal access for educationthe power of lifelong learning-is to take on something the minister never talks about, the need for Australia to be competitive in its university sector, to face up to the fact that learning is becoming internationalised. As you cut the funding, as you cut the places, as you run down the status of academics around Australia, you diminish our capacity to face up to that international competition in higher education. This is a government which believes in little, a government which may have a significant majority in the House but has only a small mandate and a small set of ideas for change. Their only concept in higher education is funding cuts, narrowing access and policy drift. It is the worse possible time in Australia's history for these policies to be introduced. The Labor Party will take great pleasure after the next election in reversing every single one of them.",87
206,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Goldstein-Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (3.56 p.m.)We have certainly reached the fag end of the Labor Party's policy initiatives. What we heard in the speech from the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is nothing more than empty rhetoric. It is rhetoric from a party with an appalling record in education and training-a party that never had, throughout its 13 years in government, any commitment to decent literacy standards in this country, and it has not, in its draft platform, committed itself to setting decent standards for literacy. . Therefore, it has doomed many young people in this country to prolonged unemployment. It is a party that through ·ut its 13 years government, according tv the member for  tional education and training opportunities. It is a party that let the apprenticeship system die or attempted to run down that system to the point where it simply disappeared from sight. As we know, in 1995 this country had the lowest number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships for 30 years. In its university policies it was a party which discriminated relentlessly against Australian students in favour of students from overseas. It forced tens of thousands of qualified students to stay out of universities, although they wanted to gain entry, while at the same time admitting overseas students. It gave greater rights to students from other countries than it gave to Australian students to gain entry to Australian universities. Mr Latham-They are not taxpayers. They do not pay taxes.",90
207,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Would you prefer students outside to be paying taxes so others could be educated in the universities? This is the sense of equity that the Labor Party has. In what kind of fevered imagination is it fair to shut qualified Australian students out of universities, force them to pay for the education of other Australian students and deny them the right, although they are qualified, to invest in their own education? That is the kind of sick, vicious, ideological attitude that the Australian Labor Party applied in its higher education policies. This government believes that all young Australians ought to have access to the education and training opportunities that they will need to get jobs and keep jobs in an increasingly competitive world. It is the Labor Party that refused to provide those opportunities to tens of thousands of young Australians-whether they were the young Australians that they would not let into the universities, whether they were the young Australians that they Were denying apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities to, or whether they were the tens of thousands of young Australians on the unemployment queues who were there because they did not have the literacy and numeracy skills which they desperately of needed to get jobs and which throughout 13 years of government the Australian Labor Party did nothing whatever to help them obtain. The member for Werriwa is well known for the fact that he has some interestan ill-informed, misconceived, ideological interest-in university policy. He seems to have no interest whatever in the 70 per cent of young Australians whoMr Latham-Sixty per cent!",90
208,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He does not understand. It is 60 per cent of year 12 leavers, but the member for Werriwa might like to understand the fact that many young people do not get through to year 12. It is 70 per cent of school leavers who do not go on to university. He has no interest in them whatever. They had no interest in these young people during their 13 years of government. The member for Sydney had the honesty to admit this, but the member for Werriwa did not show any interest and does not show any interest in these young people. The government believes in expanding places in universities and expanding the resources available to universities. The member for Werri wa criticises the government for the efficiency decisions that were made in our first budget. He is criticising the government, as the Labor Party so often does, for not keeping the Labor Party's promises about the ftiture-promises that were unkeepable because of the $10 billion hole that the Labor Party left the Australian people and which this government has responsibly dealt with. . This government has pursued policies which are changing the mix of funding between public and private for Australia's universities with the objective of opening up places in universities and expanding the resources available to Australia's universities so they can provide an internationally competitive education. In 1997, there are 17,000 more undergraduate places in Australian universities than there were in 1996. The number of HECS liable undergraduate places will increase each year to the year 2000. Over 368,000 undergraduate places will be available in Australia's universities by that year, compared with less than 353,000 in 1996. From 1998, next year, the government will pay the universities, for the first time, for students who are over-enrolled above their target numbers. The universities will receive the minimum differential HECS for those over-enrolled students. For the first time, there will be payment for those additional places to encourage the universities to admit those students. The Labor Party did not pay a cent for those places, and that is one of the reasons the number of students in Australian universities will be increasing over the next few years. I am sorry the member for Werriwa was not here to listen to some of these key facts, and I will just repeat them for his benefit. This year there will be 17,000 more undergraduates than there were last year. In every year between now and the year 2000, there will be more government funded undergraduate places in Australian universities and more government funding than there were in the last year of the Labor government. This year it is expanding. From now to the end of the century, this government will be funding Australian universities at a higher level than the Labor Party funded them in its last year of office, and there will be thousands more places in Australian universities. The member for Werriwa may not want to face up to these uncomfortable facts, but they are the realities. He is still enmired and enmeshed in the empty rhetoric that accompanied the efficiency savings in this government's first budget. He still cannot get past those unkeepable promises that the Labor Party put forward in its forward estimates because it left a $10 billion hole which someone, whichever government was in power, would have had to address. It is sheer fantasy for the member for Werriwa to suggest that those moneys would have been left there. What we are doing is freeing up the universities so total university resources can increase. There will be over $700 million derived by the universities this year from sources other than Commonwealth funding. We will see over the next few years an increasing amount of university revenue derived from those sources, and we will see a very significant expansion in the total resources available to universities. Mr Latham-You are privatising universities.",90
209,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Werriwa wants to stand up in this House and tell the Australian people that one of the great policies of the Labor Party at the next election will be that it will reinstate the discrimination against Australian students in favour of overseas students. The Labor Party will be happy to welcome in students from Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong and allow those young people and their families from those countries to invest in their future education in Australia-education that will make those countries more competitive, that will challenge Australian jobs through international competition and that will take those skills out of Australian universities back to their home countries so they can compete more effectively with Australia-while forcing Australian students, if they want to get entry to an Australian university on the same terms, to give up their Australian citizenship and change their passport. Why should an Austral·· Ian student be forced to give up their Australian passport to get access to one of those places in Australian universities? That is sick, vicious and ideological attitude to equity that permeates the Australian Labor Party. cannot even see straight in devising its empty policies. I will be very happy to fight the next the election on the basis of those policies that Labor Party has put forward-policies which are discriminatory, unfair, inequitable and reduce the number of places in Australian universities available to Australian students. They will restrict the number of places. Why is the Labor Party planning to go to the election with the policy of cutting the number opportunity. of places in Australian universities? Over and above the HECS funded places, which are quality increasing and which will increase further beyond next year-there will be 13,000 tralian additional HECS funded places in Australian universities between 1998 and the year 2000; so the government is increasing placesencourage Australian students, having had that discrimiawards nation removed, will be able to invest in their own education. The universities can offer up to 25 per cent of the government funded places in their courses to those students. That could lead to a very substantial increase in the number places. I certainly do not believe that we will see an increase up to the figure of 90,000 I used, which is based on 25 per cent of the 360,000 undergraduates in Australian univerprogram sities-a conservative figure of what is perted missible under the government's policy-but we will see Australian students coming into Australian universities on those terms expanding the number of places. The government is, of course, also offering extra help for disadvantaged Australian students. There will be 4,000 merit based equity scholarship students in Australian universities by the year 2000. I point out that the University of Western Sydney, I know, attended by many young people from the seat of Werriwa, is in 1997 getting more of these places than any other university New South Wales. There is now much more opportunity for students to get a quality education in Austremains ralia's universities. Not only has the governhe ment provided an additional $90 million for the research infrastructure, an additional $9.3 million for Australian postgraduate awards It and an additional $30 million for collaborative research in a strategic partnerships program with industry but also it has given universities the opportunity to increase the the resources that are available to them. They are better resourced today than they have ever will been before in Australia's history and they will be better resourced tomorrow than they are today and than they have ever been before as a result of this government's policy. Our next policies are throwing open the doors to One of the most important things is that the of teaching in the universities should continue to be raised to make sure that Ausstudents get the best education in the world. The government has instituted the Australian Awards for University Teaching to teaching excellence. The first were handed out in the Great Hall of Parliament House earlier this week. I can tell you that the effect of those awards, the inspiration that they give to university teachers, is really quite outstanding. It complements the government's initiative in establishof ing the Committee for University Teaching and Development to facilitate further practical that improvements in university teaching. In addition, the higher education equity helps disadvantaged students admitto university. There is a need to increase opportunities for all young Australians in those post school years. There are very large and numbers of students now coming into the traineeship and apprenticeship system. The numbers of young people in traineeships was up some 44 per cent last year over the previous year. There has been an increase in students in vocational education and training and there has been an increase in university which is, places. (Time expired)",91
210,Mr SAWFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister for Employment, Educain tion, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) in this Howard government will leave a most undesirable legacy for this country if he in his current position. Not only does undermine individual young people, he undermines the society in which we all live. He undermines the future of all of us. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) referred to the Orwellian style of this minister. It is a very valid point, for when George Orwell wrote that famous essay, Politics and the English Language, 50 years agoDr Kemp-I will challenge you.",92
211,Mr SA WFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will challenge you in a moment. He had a politician exactly like the minister in mind. Fifty years ago Orwell argued that some politicians debased and manipulated language to such a degree that it was against the will of the people. He often referred to the British statement of 'the pacification of India' and a Stalinist statement of 'elimination of undesirable elements'-. In reality, of course, we all learned that they meant something completely different. Orwell would be equally contemptible of the terms used these days such as 'ethnic cleansing', 'death by friendly fire' and what we have known in this house as 'Kempspeak'. If I remember the essay correctly, Orwell argued that the use of meaningless language was nothing more than a strategy to escape accountability for vile action, to put unacceptreading able policy into a more positive light and to freeze out any rational debate on that particular issue. The minister has learned well the techniques Orwell spoke about so eloquently 50 years ago. The minister is not, as Stalin did, actually murdering people, but he is placing a deathly gloom over education in this country. He is denying opportunities for young people in higher education, particularly those who come from working-class and lower middle-class families. He is discouraging public investment in human capital resources for the next generation of young Australians. Unlike the Asian tigers who have quarantined public expenditure cuts from the universities' from the vagaries of the market, this minister applies the market blowtorch to all that he touches in education and training. He gained enormous publicity from his dishonest revelations about literacy levels in this coun- moretry. His exposition on literacy levels was selective, dishonest and downright wrong in its assumptions. The actual average literacy levels have not changed a great deal in the last 20 years. What has changed is that the top 20 per cent have streaked way ahead of the average while the bottom 20 per cent have been virtually abandoned. What this minister refuses to acknowledge is the resource implications of an increasing number of exiting primary school students who have been subjected to cuts by, largely, state governments. for the past 20 years. He stonewalls resource implications. He promotes testing. He blames the teachers. He really just exacerbates the literacy problem. Similarly, in higher educational matters, he has become the minister for 'expenditure cuts lead to opportunities', 'loss is gain', 'decrease is increase' and 'less is more'. No wonder the science and mathematics communities in this country regard him as some sort of sick joke. 'Student centred funding' does not mean 'vouchers'. 'Vouchers' does not mean 'student centred funding'. Pull the other leg, Minister. 'It is not strictly a voucher system,' he said. You really have to be kidding. When you are looking at 'less is more' , have a look at the words of the minister in his second speech on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill yesterday, if you think I am pulling your leg. He said: To spread the burdens of fiscal restraint fairly, the Commonwealth has phased in the reductionslessin the growthmorein the amount of money for higher education. Here. is another one: ... provided the opportunitymorefor the sector to expandmoreand become less dependentless. Do you want some more? His speeches are full of them. He said: . . . one committed to expanding the number of places in higher educationto improving the resources in higher educationmore. He went on to say: ... funding of $3,783,052,000 in 1999 ... and ... $3,581,640,000 in 2000. That is $2,100,000 less. It actually means less. He is going to promote access to higher education and build quality. He has a deliberate strategy to expand both places and resources from the university and, at the same time, change the mix of public and private funding. More is less. He assists himself by publicity seeking in the press gallery. He is very quick to learn that most journalists up there synthesise information to meet the deadlines that they have every day for their stories. They do not analyse very thoroughly any data and information relating to his portfolio. Education is one portfolio where synthesised stories are next to damn useless. The minister has taken advantage of the extremely unreliable database that typifies all levels of education in this country. He cannot even find out the number of students here. It is 630,000 in one publication, 580,000 in another and 430,000 in another. No-one seems to know what it is. This is a tactic to discourage rational debate. The minister, once he is in control of that microphone over there, and whenever the facts and figures are raised that question the authenticity of his government's action, goes into denial mode. In fact, he goes much further than that: he turns himself into the 'less is more' mode resulting in the debate becoming so confused that no-one in the press gallery can ever be motivated to seriously take up the matter. Good politics some cynics would say, but absolutely rotten policy, Minister. There seems in this a deliberate and a consistent intent to whittle away opportunities for young Australians who come from working-class or lowerto middle-class backgrounds. Several months ago I read an article by a prominent education writer on the history of public and private education in Victoria. I started to wonder, 'Why does this person think like this?' The writer pointed out that 50 per cent of the people in the Who's Who in Victoria were educated not just in a private school but in four private schoolsMelbourne Grammar, Geelong Grammar, Scotch College and Wesley College, if I remember correctly. The minister was educated at Scotch, if I remember correctly. Talk about narrow privileged elitism-you need to look no further than Victoria for that. Of course, the minister, part of the blue-blood establishment, was also educated in one·of those four schools. By comparison, when you look at the people in the Who's Who in New South Wales, you see that the majority come from public education. The member for Goldstein would have to have the worse attributes, the worse resume and the worse personal experiences to be a minister responsible for managing any public education in this country. He does not care a damn for public education-and it shows. The management of higher education now has a focus on the West discussion paper 'Learning for life', a review of higher education, financing and policy. Chapter 1 of that discussion paper is instructive. It says: There is a feeling of unease in the universities. Higher education has lost its way and is rudderless in a sea of change. The morale of academics is low. Change is unavoidable and urgent. In setting the framework for the discussion paper in chapter 1, West says that - we must lift our sights and look to the 21st century'. That is a big ask for you, Minister. The member for Werriwa said that you have not changed your mind for 30 years; I was going to be kinder and say you have not changed your mind since 1991. You were the champion of the Fightback proposals before the 1993 election-and still are. On equity, West states: ... no Australian with the intellectual ability to succeed in higher education is denied access owing to his or her social or economic circumstances. That admirable aim is quite incompatible with this minister's background-narrow, elitist and privileged. West sums up the first chapter by stating: We should not be blinded to different ways of doing things by the status quo. The reality for this minister, however, is quite clear. He is not just a believer in the acceptance of the status quo-he goes further-he believes in the diminution of the status quo. He is a rare bird. He believes in it going the other way. The last sentence is the most telling as far as this minister is concerned. West says, 'We look forward to an open and rational debate.' The minister has deliberately tried every tactic, every strategy, to frustrate any open or rational debate. I think that has been demonstrated by the member for Werriwa and by me. This is a minister who could not manage a changed process-assessment of the status quo, adoption, adaption, creation of new paradigms, assessment and evaluation, and continuous review. They are really anathema to you, aren't they? They are not what this minister stands for. This minister is not capable of the challenges of the 21st century. West points out at the end of chapter 2 that there is a great need for flexibility to meet the challenges. He also states: It will be through flexibility, adaptability and responsiveness that Australia's higher education system will deliver the kind of education necessary for the 21st century needs and remain competitive in a global arena. But no-one on this side of the House is holding their breath for this minister to manage that considerable challenge. Nearly 40 per cent of those who complete year 12 enter higher education within two years of leaving school compared with other OECD countries. Australia's higher education rates for 18to 21-year-olds are pretty high. We are a good exporter of education. Access by indigenous people has trebled over the last decade, but there are weaknesses, and West points those out. On the voucher system, you just ran. On student funding, you just ran.

212,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this MPI. In the past the Labor Party has attacked this government's policy on university education places and also on the alleged lack of educational opportunities available for our young kids. I and the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) are members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. He well knows the comments that have been made as we moved around the country. We spoke to over 300 young kids all over Australia about their educational opportunities. It is interesting that those opposite referred either directly or indirectly to the West report. The member for Latham made the pointMr Latham-I am the member for Werriwa.",95
213,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Werriwa. I think the member for Werriwa has a bit of an ego problem: he probably would like a seat named after him. He says that we are neglecting to acknowledge the benefits to society of higher education. The member for Port Adelaide also goes on to talk about the West report and university's place in society and its benefits. I do not disagree entirely with what they are saying. Obviously, university has always historically had a very important role to play in our society in promoting the concept of learning and education. However, in the 196 pages of the West report-as shadow minister, I hope you have read the report in terms of its implicationsWest has damned the record of the Australian Labor Party. There has been no change in the social composition of students who have actually enjoyed the educational opportunities of this country. Labor did not encourage the alternative educational ladders that these kids have demanded. What was the end result? As night follows day, as the member for Werriwa has mentioned, these kids were put on the unemployment queues. I make mention of this because the educational system in this country is more than just simply tertiary education. It is a broad approach in terms of offering educational opportunities for all kids. The former government seems to have had a fixation that the 30 per cent of kids who go to university are the only concern that we should have in this country. They have neglected the other 70 per cent who are also looking for that educational ladder, for that helping hand, to go on and benefit themselves and their families and be worthwhile contributors. In one of the submissions that was made to the employment, education and training committee-I hope the member for Port Adelaide has read page 56 of the report; I know he was there at the time it was written- Mr Graeme Trompf from ACT Youth JobIink states: Having a qualification these days does not guarantee a job at all-and that leads to frustration. We have some young people on our books who have graduated from ANU in disciplines that employers regard as fairly esoteric. He then goes on to say: Employers say to them, 'That is fine, but how does this help me run my business?' Those young people feel frustrated . . . They have come through the system, they have put in four years at university and find that, on the surface, their qualification of little assistance in getting a job. What we find is that the kids out there who are benefiting from this government's policy are looking for a broad approach in terms of the opportunities that are available to them. Yes, university should playa part in benefiting society. But there are benefits to society in getting those young kids off the labour market queues and into jobs. This government is taking an integrated approach, not compartmentalising education in terms of secondary school, TAPE and universities. We need this approach. In my own electorate of Deakin we are seeing that taking place. I will speak more about what this government and this minister have done to benefit the young kids who are graduating this year and those who are unable to graduate because of their own difficulties in working their way through the system, but are still looking for a place in society in which they can benefit. These young kids are looking for a system which incorporates all aspects of opportunities-the TAPE sector and the university sector. Let us not forget about this. Let us not simply look at this in terms of what we are doing for the university sector; it is also what we are doing in terms of overall vocational education. Education is very important. Our nation needs our young kids to be educated and trained. We recognise the importance that it has in terms of personal development and the employment prospects that are required. Around Deakin about 7,000 students are either at university or in TAPE colleges. We are well served by two excellent TAPE institutions-Box Hill TAPE and the Outer Eastern College of TAPE. Yet Labor is criticising our broad approach to education and ignoring this other component. The kids that we spoke to are saying that they require a job at the end of their education, not simply some sort of esoteric approach, which you are taking. The other 70 per cent, who cannot go on to university, also have an opportunity to benefit from the educational opportunities that are available to them. The ALP criticise the coalition government for reducing funding and therefore reducing is opportunities. They criticise us for the negative impact of differentiated HECS and for the undergraduate fees. What we find is that the university sector, as the minister has so well put, is estimated to have $33 million more. The member for Port Adelaide may talk about cuts but there is more Commonwealth revenue in 1997-that is, $5.84 billion. For the normal mortal human being-and the member for Port Adelaide is a normal mortal human being, as I am-putting our mind around billions is very hard but the university sector will be receiving more money-$33 million more-in operating grants. That is equivalent to $11,100 per student. I see that as a very firm commitment by this government to the 30 per cent of kids who are going to university in addition to the work we are doing for the other 70 per cent. The government is providing increased access for young Australians and the Commonwealth will be funding undergraduate places. This will achieve an increase of nearly 13,000 between 1996 and 1999. That is a 3.7 per cent increase in three years, of the undergraduate places that we are funding. The government policy will also enable an increase in funding from the new flexibilities we are introducing. Flexibility is something I would have thought you would encourage rather than perhaps some sort of dogmatic, ideological, hard and fast stance. This government is about flexibility. We do look at the entire scope of education rather than simply, as I mentioned before, the narrowness that you keep talking about. For the first time, in 1998 universities will be able to offer additional undergraduate places above the core level of Commonwealth funded places. Mr Sawford-Do you really believe that?",95
214,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not believe you. You have made so many promises over the years that people have forgotten what you actually stand for. They did not even believe your recent party platform. Do you know why? There is absolutely nothing in there. Not only has this government made core promises to our kids but it is fulfilling its promises as well. It is important for me to talk about my own electorate for a moment because this is where we are really making a difference. We have a system in Victoria that the entire nation can time. be proud of. It is an educational system where TAFE and the university system are so well integrated that the 7,000 kids in my electorate have an opportunity to benefit. In this year alone, over 2,000 kids have made contact with the one-stop shops that the minister opened to look at other opportunities for their future, in terms of apprenticeships and traineeships. We have, for the first time, jobs pathway. Out of the 76 schools in Australia which are participating in that program, 29 are from the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, my area. They will now be benefiting in school based apprenticeship programs. This government has taken an integrated approach to education. (Time expired)",96

217,Mr MILES,SUPERANNUA TION LEGISLATION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (4.33 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the superannuation legislation to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the superannuation supervisory framework. Superannuation plays a significant role in the government's commitment to increase national saving and in the government's retirement income policy. It is therefore vital that an effective regulatory regime is in place and maintained to enhance the security of members' benefits and to ensure that superannuation entities operate for genuine retirement income purposes. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act) provides for the prudential regulation of the superannuation industry by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. An important aspect of prudential regulation is the monitoring and investigation powers of the commissioner. This bill will improve the commissioner's monitoring and investigation powers by increasing the flexibility of the existing powers, expanding the parties to whom they apply and increasing penalties for non-compliance. It is vital to the prudential regulation of superannuation moneys in Australia that the commissioner have effective monitoring and investigation powers. Another important aspect of the regulatory framework is the existence of a complaints handling body to deal with members' superannuation complaints. The Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (the SRC Act) established the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to resolve fund members' complaints about trustee decisions in a manner that is fair, informal and quick. This bill will enable the efficiency and productivity of the tribunal to be improved, including by allowing single member review panels. This will enhance the tribunal's role in promoting public confidence' in the superannuation regime. The bill also contains a number of measures which will finetune and clarify. the operation of the supervisory framework which will assist trustees in discharging their obligations to fund members. In conclusion, this bill implements miscellaneous amendments to maintain and strengthen the superannuation supervisory framework. The amendments will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulatory regime and improve confidence in the superannuation system more generally. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT BILL (No. First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",97
218,Mr MILES,SUPERANNUA TION LEGISLATION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (4.36 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Tax Law Improvement Bill (No.2) 1997 is the third instalment of legislation that is progressively replacing the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This year parliament enacted the first two instalments of rewritten law. The first instalment established the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as the main income tax law. It has a new more logical structure, a flexible and user-friendly numbering system and is written in plain language appropriate to its audience. The 1997 act now contains the core provisions of the law and most of the rules that apply generally, such as the provisions about assessable income and deductions. It also includes some other more specialised rules covering such subjects as mining and primary production deductions. The main feature of this bill is the rewritten rules about capital gains and losses, colloquially known as the capital gains tax or CGT. Capital Gains Tax From its inception in 1985, the CGT provisions have been compromised by the unnecessarily complex approach that was taken to their presentation and expression. The aim of the CGT is to tax income gains made on the disposal of assets and on the receipt of certain capital amounts. Although the CGT applies to many transactions that do not involve the disposal of assets, the existing law squeezes them into its uneasy structure by treating each of them as though it did involve such a disposal. This has left a complex and extremely confusing system of artificial deeming provisions that can confound even experienced professional advisers. The rewrite does away with this 'deeming approach' and replaces it with statements which directly describe in clear words the transactions that come within the coverage of the CGT. 2) 1997 The key to the rewrite is the breaking up of the law to identify each 'CGT event'. The concept of disposal is to be limited to where there actually is a change in ownership of an asset from one person to another. Other kinds of transactions that can give rise to a CGT liability !,lre brought together so that the reader can be confident that all circumstances that can give rise to a capital gain or loss are comprehensively listed. By bringing together in a coherent way material that is scattered throughout the old law and by doing away with unnecessary text, the rewrite supports a more readily gained understanding by taxpayers of the CGT consequences of their decisions. Other Areas Rewritten A range of other rules with specialised application have also been rewritten and included in the bill. These cover the treatment of company bad debts, intellectual property, horticultural plants, expenditure on protecting the environment and on environmental impact statements, the averaging of primary producers' liabilities and evening out the effects of above-average special professional income. Minor Policy Changes The re'written rules include minor. policy changes which will help to make the law simpler, clearer and less burd-nsome for taxpayers. They wil- do this by: replacing impractical rules with ones which facilitate compliance; simplifying rules which are unnecessarily complex; deleting unnecessary rules; removing anomalies; - md clarifying ambiguities. Revenue Impact The measures in the bill are expected to have a small overa,ll cost to revenue but this is well justified by the better compliance that should flow from the clarification of obligations. None of its individual proposals will have a measurable revenue effect. Date of Effect The government intends that the bill will apply from the beginning of the 1998-99 income year. Joint Committee of Public Accounts The government proposes that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which has maintained an active interest in the tax law rewrite, should consider the detailed contents of this bill and report back to parliament on it by 12 March 1998. Transitional and Consequential Provisions In order to ensure that the joint committee has adequate time to thoroughly consider the bill and report back to the House, the ment has introduced the bill without the transitional provisions and consequential amendments and will support the rewrite of the CGT and intellectual property provisions. These provisions will be made available for public scrutiny as soon as possible and will be moved by the government as amendments when the House debates the bill. I present the explanatory memorandum, which includes summaries of all the rewritten areas of the law and detailed explanations of the minor changes to the law that the bill contains. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Kelvin Thomson) adjourned. Reference to Committee Motion (by Mr Miles) agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister moving a motion to refer the Tax Law Improvement Bill (No.2) 1997 to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for consideration and an advisory report by 12 March 1998.

HMAS Stirling provides operational, logistic, administrative, personnel and recreational support for assigned and visiting warships as well as port, berthing, shipside and administrative services. The Collins class submarines will be home-ported at Stirling. At present, the base supports 2,433 naval and civilian personnel. By the year 2004, when half the Australian fleet is home-ported there, this is expected to increase to approximately 3,160. Support demands are, therefore, expected to rise early in the next century when the number of home-ported major units is planned to increase from 10 to about 14. For the benefit of honourable members, I should mention that these units are expected to include seven frigates, comprising both· FFG and ANZAC class ships, six submarines and one fleet vessel, together with associated shipborne helicopters. The. development of HMAS Stirling has spanned almost three decades . and has involved a number of stages. The parliament, through the public works committee, has been involved throughout this process. The committee has calculated from the five previous reports on the development of naval facilities on the island that the total expenditure so far in 1997 prices has been $459 million. Report As a Western Australian and as a chairman of the committee, I can say that all Australians can be proud of what has been achieved. Facilities at HMAS Stirling are a credit to the Defence Force and to the designers, engineers and the construction industry. The committee has concluded, based on the evidence presented and a detailed inspection of existing facilities, that there is a need to further improve operational support, training, logistics and personnel support facilities at HMAS Stirling, either by the provision of extensions to existing facilities or through new construction. The committee also concluded that the extent of the proposed works can be justified as meeting anticipated requirements. The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence should review two components of the proposed works. The first is extensions to facilities proposed for the naval diving clearance teams. The committee has recommended that the review should include the benefits of the construction of a new facility at a more suitable location. The second involves a review of the siting of the flight deck procedural trainer in relation to the overall cost, including the provision of power, without compromising safety or the realism of training scenarios. In terms of benefits to the local community, the committee was advised that an average of about 70 personnel will be directly employed on construction activities during the 14-month construction period. It is likely that local subcontractors will be used on the project. is also worth noting that the base already contributes about $200 million to the local economy each year. The report highlights that the Department of Defence has established an exemplary record in the environmental management of the island. It is worth mentioning that this outstanding record comes at considerable cost: the annual cost of environmental management of the island is at least $430,000. In keeping with past practice, extensive environmental investigations were carried out. Each component of the proposal was tested in relation to justification, siting, the exiting environment and environmental impact assessments were then made. This was. a thorough process and a number of changes were made to what was originally proposed in response to recommendations by the Garden Island Environmental Advisory Committee. The Department of Defence has demonstrated a commitment, within operational constraints, towards the conservation and protection for public use of the environmental values of the island. The second report which I have tabled concerns the proposed Australian National Maritime Museum Maritime Heritage Centre at Wharf 7, Pyrmont, New South Wales. The museum was opened in November 1991 and the USA Gallery, the bicentennial gift from the United States of America to the people of Australia, was dedicated in January 1992 by Mr George Bush, then President of the United States. Since its opening, the museum has achieved a number of significant milestones, including the number of visitors attracted by the many artefacts and exhibitions on display. During the current financial year, the total number of visitors passed the two million mark, thereby establishing the museum as one of the most popular museums in Sydney and one of the world's most visited maritime museums. The museum's outreach and travelling exhibitions attract a further 200,000 visitors per annum nationally. The proposal examined by the committee involves the acquisition by the Commonwealth of a 99-year lease for a 2,852 square metre site known as Wharf 7, Pyrmont, and for the construction of a building to provide It accommodation for its back-of-house activities, including collection and display areas and a library. The cost of the development, $19.5 million in all, will be borrowed from a major bank or financial institution and repaid over a period of approximately 12 to 14 years, using rental offsets and income earned from commercial activities on the site, which include the renting of some of the space. The committee has recommended that the work shoul- proceed. The committee has concluded that the Australian National Maritime Museum, as a national institution, plays a key role in reflecting Australia's maritime heritage and culture through public displays, restoration, storage and research. Leased premises, some distance from its main exhibition building in Pyrmont, house museum support activities, including the growing store of artefacts and other material. The lease on these premises expires in mid-1999, when the site will be available for redevelopment. There is a need to find other suitable accommodation to house the museum's support activities, preferably adjacent to the main exhibition building. The Commonwealth has been offered a property adjacent. to the main exhibition building for development, contingent upon the inclusion of elements of the Sydney Maritime Museum in any new facility and that any museum development adhere to local planning schemes. Based on the evidence provided to the committee, the site is considered suitable for the proposed building to house the museum's library, laboratories, workshops, collection display areas, meeting rooms, amenities and offices. The design of the proposed building recognises planning parameters and, based on the evidence, will meet the museum's functional and spatial requirements. The committee believes the success of the proposed development depends on providing a readily identifiable link between the main exhibitions building and the centre and the resolution of public liability issues. This will require the museum to discuss further with the City West Development Corporation and the Council of the City of Sydney issues of public liability and the placement of objects within mantime themes in the public park which separates the two buildings. The cost of the proposed work will be met from savings offset from rent being paid for the presently leased premises and from commercial tenancies in the proposed facility. I commend both reports to the House. Publications Committee",100
222,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,I present the 15th report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report· are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-agreed to. NA BILL (No.6) 1997 Cognate bill: NA BILL (No.2) 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.,102
223,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Before I was interrupted by the minor distraction of question time, we were talking about a number of diverse provisions in this omnibus bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1997. The fourth of the provisions to which I want to draw attention relates to the payments of tax by small companies. The definitions of small, medium and large companies are to be varied for the purposes of payment times for company tax. Small companies will be able to pay their income tax slightly later than at present. The cost this proposal is negligible, which, of course, means that any benefit conferred on small business is negligible. However, the opposition is happy to provide even a small benefit for small business and we are supporting the proposals in schedule 5. The next area relates to dividend imputation and retirement savings accounts. When retirement savings accounts were introduced, the government quite rightly promised they would be taxed in the same manner as complying superannuation funds. The original legislation is effective for ordinary companies. However, the government mucked up the treatment of life assurance companies. Schedule 6 of· the bill will ensure that franking credits or debits will be prevented from arising from. the payment or refund of tax .where those amounts are attributable to the retirement savings account business of a life assurance Report company. This treatment is consistent with the special rules that already apply to life assurance companies, reflecting the unique structure and regulation of the industry; The Labor Party supports levelling the playing field in this area. I note in passing that this is yet another area of superannuation that the government has not got right. We have had the incredible saga of the new surcharge tax which has shown the superannuation industry just how bad this government can be if it really tries. I certainly hope that these provisions are more effective than the surcharge mess that the government has created. The sixth item concerns deductible expenditure and capital gains tax cost bases. The amounts that are deductions for income tax purposes which also form part of the cost base of assets for capital gains tax purposes will now have to be excluded from cost bases. This is to eliminate an effective double deduction for such expenditures-that is, they both reduce the taxable income flow from an asset and the amount of the gain on the holding of the asset. This measure isestimated to raise $330 million over a period of four years when introduced. On 2 November this year, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) issued press release No. 117 which of provided transitional relief worth $135 million over four years which will ameliorate the provisions as they were originally announced. The opposition welcomes this change, as we were concerned about the short-term impact of the measure on employment, especially in the building and construction sectors and possibly also in the tourism and hospitality sectors. We have not yet had sufficient time to fully consult on these changes. However, I understand they have the support of industry. We will examine them closely prior to Senate consideration of the bill and will make our views known more fully at that time. The seventh . item concerns the passive income of insurance companies. The fonnulae used for determining the passive income-that is, the non-trading income-of the controlled foreign companies of insurance companies is flawed. Accordingly, a new formula is to be adopted from 1 July this year to fix that problem. The measure is estimated to raise $10 million per annum. The opposition supports measures which ensure that foreign jurisdictions cannot be used to unfairly reduce the amount of tax paid by business. These amendments ensure that Australian tax cannot be avoided and Labor also supports these proposals. The eighth item concerns the average calculated liabilities of life insurance companies. Currently, the tax law requires that companies use calculated liabilities at the end of the financial year for determining the amount of income to be allocated to immediate annuity policies, the amount of income attributable to policies issued by overseas branches and the amount of income and capital gains to be allocated to each class of assessable income. The bill proposes the method of calculation will change to the average calculated liabilities. The reason for the change is that using calculated liabilities at the end of the year cause distortions to the life companies' income calculations if the proportion at the end of the year does not reflect the experience during the year. Changing to the average calculated liabilities method will address this problem. The issue, while being obscure and technical to most people, is very important and the amendments are expected to protect revenue of about $100 million per annum. Labor believes this $100 million ought to be available to the public for providing health care, education services and other vital public services and should not be at risk. Therefore, we also support this measure. The ninth item concerns depreciation of assets. The final area of this complex bill concerns previously tax exempt entities, usually government businesses which .have been privatised. Schedule 10 of the bill clarifies the Taxation Office's interpretation of existing depreciation provisions applying to fonnerly tax exempt entities which became the subject of taxation between 1 July 1988 and 2 July 1995. There have apparently been some disputes between taxpayers and the tax office about the correct technical interpretation of the existing law. Hopefully, these provisions will clarify these matters and protect the revenue. It is of some concern that the opposition was notified only this morning that there will now be amendment to these provisions, which will apparently preserve the position of a particular taxpayer who has already obtained one of these binding private rulings on this issue. I will speak later to this amendment, but the opposition accepts that it would be unconscionable to override a binding ruling, life obtained by a taxpayer in good faith, in a situation which, at least on the face of it, does not involve tax avoidance. As usual, the opposition is very cooperative in protecting the interests of the Australian community by supporting clamp downs on tax rorts, as I have just detailed. The opposition has a very constructive proposal in this areaan amendment which has twice been supported by the Senate to the charter of budget honesty legislation. That amendment requires the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secrecan tary to the Treasury to provide a report on any material threats to the integrity of the tax system, including the fiscal impact of any of these threats, as a pennanent and integral part of fiscal reporting; that is, in the budget papers, the mid-year review. This is a very important proposal because it will allow the government, especially the Treasurer, to be held accountable for the conduct of tax policy. The opposition believes that there can be few duties of higher importance of the Treasurer than to maintain a fair tax system. Critical to that is that the current tax base be maintained. We are concerned to ensure that the revenue authority's concerns are made public to enable scrutiny of the Treasurer's perfonnance in his duty of protecting the public revenue. The Commissioner of Taxation can advise the Treasurer on matters that should be undertaken to maintain the tax base, but he has no power to force the Treasurer to act in the national interest. The discretion is all with the Treasurer-to either accept or reject the advice of the tax office and the Treasury-all in comfortable secrecy. This amendment does not seek to alter the Treasurer's right to make tax policy on behalf of the government, but we do seek to ensure that material threats to the taxation system codified on a systematic public basis so as to enable the performance of the Treasurer, in dealing with these revenue threats, to be openly evaluated. Future Treasurers will still be able to refuse to act on the advice of the revenue authorities, but they will not be able to hide their actions--or lack of action-from the Australian people. In opposing this measure, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell) made two ludicrous claims: firstly, that the few pages of information in the statement of risks in Budget Paper No. 1 actually cover this issue. This is rubbish. We are looking for an independent statement which will provide much more detail on specific schemes and issues which will complement the broad information already provided. Secondly, the laughable notion that publication of information about schemes or other threats to the tax base will in fact increase their use. The Taxation Office does not dream up theoretical schemes. The Taxation Office and the Treasury detect taxpayer behaviouroften many years after it has become established practice-and then advise the government of the problems and possible solutions. It is simply wrong to suggest that the tax office could advise the taxation industry on ways to avoid tax; the contrary is the case. If this principle were correct, then the tax office should never take any taxpayers to court on the basis that a loss in the courts would alert taxpayers to possible schemes. Clearly that is utterly at odds with current practice. What we do know, though, is that the tax system and the threat to its integrity is under constant and sustained attack and, in some instances, this is as a direct result of governdependent ment legislation opening up loopholes such as the family trust loss changes which we deb ated recently. In other cases, it arises through a lack of action on tax avoidance through allowing such things as salary repackaging by senior public servants. As we believe that risks to the integrity of the tax system will always exist, the opposition is convinced that one way of ensuring that these risks are properly dealt with by the Treasurer is by ensuring that the government are can be held accountable for inaction. That amendment achieves that goal. The government has now laid aside the bill which had this amendment made to it; that is, they are afraid of the Treasurer being held accountable for his actions, or lack thereof, in dealing with tax avoidance schemes and other material threats to the tax base such as the ones in the bill before us today. The opposition and the Australian public are very concerned by this behaviour by the government and I urge them to reconsider our proposals, which would make more open and transparent the revenue threats faced by the government. In this cognate debate, we are also considering the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997. I would like to touch briefly on this bill before concluding. The Medicare levy is a revenue measure which is levied to partially offset the cost of Medicare, the national universal health insurance system. The Medicare levy is a flat rate yet progressive levy which is not paid by low income individuals, couples or low income families. The exemption threshold below which no Medicare levy is payable increases by $2,100 for each dependent child in the family, which recognises that families with children face higher costs than couples with no children. The bill continues the annual practice of Labor to adjust the Medicare levy low income exemption thresholds upwards. Each year in the budget, the new thresholds are announced and this annual bill legislates the announced changes. The bill proposes to increase the exemption thresholds for 1997-98 to $13,389 for individuals and $22,594 for families. The family and single parent exemption threshold continues to be increased by $2,100 for each child. The cost of the measure is $3 million in 1997-98, $35 million in 1998-99 and $18 million in each of the next two financial years. In continuing past Labor practice, it is supported by Labor.",102
224,Mr HARDGRAVE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1997 and Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 before us this evening are joined at the hip in this debate because they are both about equity, responsibility and incentive. In fact, those three words sum up some of the hallmarks of the Howard government and they certainly stand for that to a great range of Australians. Everybody in this nation has a part to play in looking after themselves while also contributing to others in the country who are perhaps less able to look after themselves. I would like to deal with a number of the measures in particular in the taxation laws and then go on to the medicare levy bill. But, before doing that, I would like to take a moment of the House's time to comment on the contribution by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). People on this side of the chamber find it extraordinary that those opposite have now decided to very publicly amend the government's fine Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996. Those opposite talk about measures and say if only they had had a 14th or 15th year in office they might have done the same things themselves. In this debate we are hearing, quite rightly, support from those opposite for a number of the sensible measures this government has put forward in these bills. We are getting support and recognition from them now they are in opposition that this government is doing the right thing by the people of Australia in trying to close down some rorts in a couple of areas and ensuring that companies in the corporate sector as well as individuals pay their share of contributions to this country. Their support tonight is welcome, but it is worth noting in this debate that in the time they were in government these same things existed but nothing was done. All we saw from those opposite for the small business sector was a series of reports-27 reports in 13 years-all recommending further reports and further inquiries going absolutely nowhere. Mr Ronaldson-How many?",105
225,Mr HARDGRAVE,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"For the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, at the table, 27. The bills before us contain a number of measures. I do not intend to detail them all. As the member for Wills said, some of them might seem obscure and technical. I agree with his comment: they are all important, that is why they are there. One measure relates to capital loss changes to prevent companies from amplifying the effect of their losses several times through the capital gains tax provisions. We are tidying this up, we are making it fairer and we essentially are closing down what some could see as being a bit of a rort of the system. It is really important to small business in bill my electorate that we recognise the need to extend the time that is needed by small business companies to pay tax. This measure provides them with an extension of time. It gives them an opportunity to plan their payment of tax into the system. So they pay their share but with greater sympathy to their need to plan properly. Under this legislation, they will pay their likely tax liability on 15 December following the income year and they will pay the balance of their tax liability, if applicable, by 15 March the following year. This measure is consistent with a result that came out of one of our inquiries into small business. We have looked at small business a couple of times, but we have actually come up with results. The More Time for Business announcement-the response by the government-on 24 March detailed this measure and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) quickly responded to the Reid report on small business activities which came up with a whole bunch of other measures which were before us in this place as legislative measures within a handful of weeks of that report being tabled. There js a direct contrast between this government and its predecessor. These measures will take effect in the 199697 tax year, so next year small business taxpayers in my electorate of Moreton will have that extension of time: I think it will assist small business to be able to plan, particularly in that lead-up to the Christmas busy time when there is a lot of extra expense and the possibility of staff going on holidays. I think that is a very good measure. Another one of the measures I particularly want to highlight is the· reversal of the absolutely pathetically stupid Labor Party measure in relation to fringe benefits tax for employees of small businesses who happen to park their car on the premises. That was regarded as a fringe benefit and was taxed. Employers, mainly small business employers, were particularly penalised. They had to tell their employees to park their cars down the road well away from the business. They had to set a minimum distance from the door, otherwise a fringe benefits tax was involved. What a ridiculous measure! It was an anti-small business and downright un-Australian measure the Labor Party presided over for many years. Today the Australian Labor Party are actually supporting this reversal of their stupid policy. I welcome the support, but it strikes me as being strange that, in all the years they were in power, they never did anything about it. The only exception will be those businesses which pay employees to park at a commercial car parking station. I think Australians agree we have got some common sense, some good sense, back into the running of this country through this particular measure alone. This is part of the government's response to the deregulation task force report of November last year. Here is another practical response from the government as a result of an inquiry. That is in direct contrast to This measure takes $5 million out of the budget; it is well spent. The next measure I want to talk about is the savings rebate measure which establishes the criteria by which people are encouraged to save and enhance their private income system, particularly in view of their retirement years. The technical measures involved allow people who are in business in particular to contribute up to $3,000 a year to their retirement. In fact, these measures encourage people to do just that. Let us face it: one of the big complaints we got before the last election was people were sick to death of being taxed on their savings. In the main, their money had already been taxed before it was put in the bank and it was being taxed again. The government has not completely removed that quite sad situation which discouraged saving. It has, though, taken the first step in the right direction. Unlike those opposite who promised l-a-w tax cuts which were g-o-n-e right before our very eyes, this is f-a-c-t It has happened. It will apply from next year. I want to spend the rest of my time contributing to the second of the two bills we are talking about-Medicare Levy Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997. This is another sign of this government's commitment to Medicare: a universal health system which we all make a contribution towards. We want to ensure that all Australians have access to medical services at a fair cost. This measure lifts the low income threshold, the exemption threshold, so that more low income individuals, low income married couples, low income sole parents, low income families, are actually exempt from the Medicare levy. I am not a low income earner. Nobody in this place is. By comparison to so many Australians, it seems fair to me that we should pay in a progressive sense a greater all contribution to ensure the system does look after those who cannot afford to pay a contribution. I do not think anybody really regrets the levy we pay towards Medicare, even though it meets only an infinitesimal part of the overall cost of the health budget-and I will go into that in a moment. These increases Labor. were announced in May in the second Costello budget. The thresholds for the 199798 financial year will be increased to $13,389 for individuals and $22,594 for families. The family threshold will continue to rise $2,100 for each dependent child. These increased exemption thresholds result in changes to income ranges over which the particular exemptions are shaded out. The new upper limits of the ranges for individuals and families 'will be $14,474 and $24,425 respectively. Of course, no-one is going to argue against this measure. It is an equity that measure and it ensures that those who are in the poorest position of all in this country are going to be afforded access to Medicare, access-o. bulk-billing, even though they are Q9t in the position of making a contribution. There is no additional contribution cost to taxpayers as a result of this measure but the cost to the budget is $3 million this year, $35 million in the next financial year and $18 million in 1999-2000 and also in the following year's budget. There is certainly a great deal of balance in this whole area of publicly funded health versus private health. Increasing costs are, I guess, part and parcel of that. Those who pay for the benefits received by low income earners certainly would have an expectation that low income earners themselves would not overuse this service, this benefit; because there is a real house of cards potentially in the area of health insurance. Medicare should be and will continue to be, as a result of this government's commitment, there for all Australians as a measure of absolute certainty. But those who can afford to pay for private health insurance arrangements should of course be doing so. That is certainly what this government has done with what you could call, I guess, its carrot and stick approach. As far as private health insurance incentives and penalties for higher income earners are concerned, that is what that approach is all about. It is frustrating when you are trying to run a health insurance and a health system to note there are some who really are not doing the right thing by all taxpayers and all Australians. One of my local pharmacists told me a story the other day which I would like to offer to the chamber for consideration. He said an older lady came in the other day and wanted to buy a box of Panamax, which is a paracetamol product. She refused to pay the $5.50 for the box of Panamax; in fact, she wanted it for $3.20, which is the PBS rate and the rate she would have paid if she had a script for this product. It is interesting to the dispensed value of Panamax is in fact $7.43, which is paid by the government less whatever it is the particular purchaser contributes. So if you and I were to go in, we would buy Panamax, I guess, for $5.50, which would offset the $7.43. A pensioner or somebody on a pharmaceutical benefit would pay only $3.20. At the end of the day, the lady went down the corridor to a particular doctor who bulkbilled, which cost the Australian taxpayer $21. She got the script, went back to the pharmacist, and paid her $3.20-which was $4.23 worth of taxpayer subsidy on top of the $21 it had cost to go to the doctor. All round, there was a total cost of $25.23 to buy a box of Panamax, which was $5.50 retail. I am sure a lot of people in this place would be disturbed to know that the system which we are providing to ensure all Australians have equitable access could be so abused. There was another story earlier this year in the Bulletin magazine---certainly a reputable magazine. It recounted the story of the woman who cut her finger. She went to the doctor, who said, 'This cut to your finger does not require a stitch. Why are you. here? It just needs a bandaid.' She said, 'To buy a box of bandaids will cost me a couple of dollars. If I come to you, I put my card down in the machine, you bulk-bill, and the bandaid costs me absolutely nothing.' I do not think that is the spirit in which Medicare is meant to operate. It is a very sad indictment that some Australians could feel so desperate and could be in a position where a couple of dollars is all-important. I accept that can be the case. So it is very hard to know what to do about it, because it is a hornet's nest. To start to raise some concerns like this raises a whole bunch of issues and additional pressure perhaps on the system. The last thing I want to see is pressure building to the point where cost built into the system starts to bring the system down, because it is an important system to maintain. I turn to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which released a report earlier note this week called Health On Line. Its recommendation 6.32 talks about components relating to Medicare bulk-billing and the fact that we need to look at the MedClaim system which looks at electronic transfer of the transactions. So doctors could be literally paid overnight, and the relationship becomes doctor to Medicare. The doctor might require the patient to top it up, as my doctor does. I have to pay about $8 to $10, I think, on top of the Medicare amount to my doctor. That is a separate relationship. So doctors could be paid directIyand that may in itself provide something. Rather than go into the ins and outs of this report from the standing committee, it is worth noting that the Labor Party in their minority and dissenting report essentially agree with the government members' findings of this committee. I commend it as a document which is worth reflecting upon. I hope the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in his reply to the report reflects upon that, because there is some good sense in what they are saying. It is drawing out the value and the cost of the services and making it obvious to the person who uses the service that Medicare is not a free thing; it does actually cost money. So maybe we will see fewer examples of the lady who wanted the Panamax and the person who wanted the bandaids. I think that would be a good thing and would restore a greater deal of faith in the overall system, as far as all Australians are concerned. As this measure before us shows, this government is committed to Medicare. We are committed to bulk-billing. We know that low income people in particular need this. I know plenty of friends of mine whose families need this. They need to know they do not have to rustle around looking for money to pay the doctor's bill if their child needs access to a doctor. We understand that bulk-billing has an important place and this government is committed to it. It is also very important, which is why I raise it in this place today, for all Australians to understand there is a cost involved in our health insurance schemes, both public and private. The community-the taxpayer essentially-pays for Medicare, but individuals in the community of course pay the cost of the community. The total amount of money generated as a result of the Medicare levy is only $3.7 billion. The total health cost in this country is $40 billion. So less than 10 per cent is actually generated from the levy. The federal government kicks in another $22 billion on top of what is generated out of the levy. So the government is certainly putting money where its mouth is. So we have to rely upon and hope that individuals do their best to make a contribution themselves. If they are able to afford it, they should take out private health insurance, because it takes pressure off the public system. Likewise, those who cannot afford to do so-low income earners in particular-should realise they too have a duty, which is not to overuse and abuse the privilege afforded them because of government policy as far as access to health care is concerned. We should make sure that, while we are looking after those who need care, we do not run the risk of bringing,down the whole house of cards. It is important to reflect upon the fact that the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, never took out private health insurance. It is interesting to note that the current Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Mr Beattie, was appointed health minister in the dying days of the failed Goss government and the first thing he did was ta{<:e out private health insurance because he said now he was on a ministerial allowance he could afford it. I cannot understand how somebody like Peter Beattie could never have taken it upon himself, as some sort of civic duty as a leader in the community, to actually contribute something towards offsetting .the cost to the community of providing health services to those who desperately need it. You do not need people who are on $80,000 a year standing in the queue at public hospitals. They are mainly there for the lower income earners. I think that is the beauty of Medicare. I certainly do not mind, and I am sure you do not, Mr Deputy Speaker, making your contribution to ensuring the system works and continues to work well. As I said at the beginning, these bills before us are all about equity. They are all about responsibility. They are all about accountability. They are all about ensuring every Australian plays their part in making a contribution to the cause of the better running of this country. It is very important those higher income earners who stay out of private health insurance are in fact in private health insurance, because the more of them who stay out of health insurance the harder it is for the lower income earners. I am very pleased to be part of a government which has shown - he lead in this. It has taken a carrot and a stick approach. It has offered incentives for people to get into private health insurance and penalties for higher income earners who are not in it. I say. that is fair enough. There has been a turnaround in recent weeks in the number of people who are staying in private health insurance. I was delightAustralia ed, in a response the minister gave me to a question in this place about this matter last week, to see the graph start to kick up. After so many years of the Labor Party turning its back on the fact people were leaving private health insurance, the government has done something about it. Those opposite spend a lot of time carping about it, complaining it not good enough and not enough is being done, but something has been done. It is a sign perhaps the richer people in our community realise they will get a are not in private health insurance. I do not care what reason is attached to it: the more people who are in private health ins-rance, the better it is going to be for lower mcome Australians, because they are not going to be in such a long queue at the public system. I think it is a great pity private health insurance providers have not played their They have essentially upped premiums to soak up the government's own initiatives and incentives. There are plenty of people in my electorate who are very angry about it. But I was delighted to see the Minister for Health and Family Services today introduce another measure, which will be debated next week, relating to the need to force private health insurance providers to give a greater range of products and a greater range of flexibility to reward people who have been in private health insurance for years-another positive and constructive measure from this government, as this bill before us here is today. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Tanner) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Ronaldson) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Marjanovic, Mr Dusan",105
226,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I want to recount the circumstances of a person who was a constituent of mine for a year or so who had the unfortunate experience of being taken for a ride I think by an immigration consultant. I want to tell the House about the situation of Dusan Marjanovic, a young man who arrived in in 1986 on a tourist visa. A few weeks before his visa was due to expire, Dusan was introduced to a Mr Reg Faulkner, who is the principal of International Lobbyists. He told Dusan that, with his contacts in politics, in the police and, might I say, .even iIi ASIO, he could arrange permanent reSidency for him and that all it would take was is some money. To start with, that was $3,500. Six weeks later Dusan parted with another $1,500 because Mr Faulkner said the applications would be difficult. As time marched on penalty. if they little occurred. In November 1988, Mr Faulkner advised Dusan to return to Yugoslavia so that the immigration process could be arranged from there. In Yugoslavia he received letters from Reg Faulkner inviting him to come to Australia for six months to learn about the country before being appointed his company's Yugopart. slavia based agent. You might be asking about the quest for permanent residency in Australia, because so was my former constitueht, but he had invested so much money and time in Reg Faulkner and his company that he felt he had no choice but to continue down that track. In May 1990, after selling his possessions, Dusan returned to Australia. By August, Dusan had paid Faulkner and his company another $4,200 for so-called governand ment fees and for 'priority consideration' by an influential-as it was reported to himimmigration officer, taking the total amount to $9,200. A week later, Faulkner told Dusan that the influential immigration official that he had contacts with had retired and that no-one in Canberra knew where he had gone. For five more years this went on. Dusan claims that Faulkner has actually asked him for money on at least 60 occasions. In total, over a period of about eight years, Dusan paid Reg Faulkner $27,000 and still had no permanent residency. In March 1995, Dusan decided to forgo Reg Faulkner's assistance. Yet he knew that, if there were to be any chance of retrieving any of the money he had invested, he would have to stay on friendly terms. Interestingly, I might add, between 1990 and 1995, Dusan worked for Mr Faulkner but received no pay. For a period of five years, he received board and lodging but no pay. In August 1995, Mr Faulkner applied for a Parliament House photographic security pass. The application was sponsored and signed by the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), and the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock). By January 1996, Mr Faulkner was reassuring Dusan that 'his people'-being his contacts within the Liberal Party-were about to come to power, and he boasted about his connections. To be fair, I think Mr Faulkner used to boast about his connections everywhere, in all parts of the system. On this occasion, he was certainly boasting about his contacts in the Liberal Party. In May 1996, Dusan thought it was time to seek legal advice. Several months later, he came to my office seeking help. He got it. Just after Easter year, his permanent residency was approved. The immigration officials told my staff that someone had lodged an objection to Dusan Marjanovic's application for permanent residency, but the claims against him had not been substantiated. I think it would illuminate the situation if we were to know the details the people behind that objection to Dusan's application for permanent residency. Members of parliament frequently find themselves having a number of acquaintances whom they either do not really know or have never really met, but in the case of Mr Faulkner and the endorsement of his photographic pass by the member for Warringah and the minister for immigration, this seems to be more than a passing acquaintance. Those members signed his parliamentary security pass in 1995 and, just this year, on 28 May, both members attended a meeting with the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to discuss a matter of compensation for the Faulkners. That matter goes back to the 1960s, when the Faulkners,believed they had had a contract with the army. (Time expired) Domestic Violence",109
227,Mr EOIN CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"Shortly I will seek leave to table a paper prepared. for me by Elizabeth Lang, from Grinnell College, Iowa, in the United States. Elizabeth is in Australia as part of the Australian national internships program, and I have been fortunate indeed to have Elizabeth prepare for me a paper titled, It's like being in a war: Children's programs in women's refuges in' Australia. In her outstanding paper Elizabeth states that, traditionally, the family home has been a safe haven, a place where people love and respect one another. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In Australia, as many as one in three households suffers from domestic violence. Women are not the only victims of domestic violence; children are often the silent victims. Although they may not be physically abused, children must bear the emotional scars of seeing one parent attack another. Even when the violence does not occur in their presence, children are usually this aware of any violence which occurs in the home. Children suffer because of the emotional atmosphere in an abusive household. One 10year-old boy likened his home situation to living in a war. Many children become so upset that they are unable to attend school of after a domestic violence dispute. As many as 11,000 students in New South Wales and 8,000 in Western Australia miss school every day because of domestic violence. Children who witness violence learn to become inured and believe that this is acceptable. They grow up believing that men should be. dominating and women should be submissive-that women do not deserve men's respect. Children from violent homes tend to have more significant behavioural and social problems than other children. They may also experience depression, withdrawal, anxiety, eating disorders, nervous disorders, self-abuse and nightmares. School work no longer becomes important to children so grades tend to fall dramatically. Adolescent boys and girls from abusive homes are themselves more likely to become involved in abusive relationships because that is all they know. Children are the majority of the residents women's refuges. These children have their own needs separate from the needs of their mothers. Unfortunately, these needs are often ignored because the main focus is on the mother. Children in refuges have been torn away from all that is familiar, leaving behind their homes, their toys, their clothes, their friends, their schools and their fathers. dren in refuges need someone they can trust, who is interested in their fears and feelings and who can help them work through them. A child worker can fulfil these needs by helping children build self-esteem, teaching them that they are special and worthwhile and teaching them how to take care of themselves. The child worker in many refuges becomes the child's helper, working one on one with the children, learning about them and helping them to recover from their traumatic experiences. A child worker also reassures children that the violence is not their fault. The worker teaches the child that violence is not acceptable and that men do not have the right to hit a woman and a woman does not have to accept the violence. If children do not learn that violence is inappropriate, then the cycle of violence will continue in future generations. Children also need interaction with other children who have experienced domestic violence. Group programs assist children to understand their situation, work through their fears, raise their self-esteem and learn appropriate behaviour. These programs focus on a different issue each week, using techniques appropriate to the child's age. Refuges also need a counsellor who can work directly with the children. By having counsellors on staff, children can develop a stronger relationship with them and heal that much faster. Children who have lived in a violent home suffer from psychological, emotional and behavioural problems. They need a child worker, a counsellor and group programs in the refuge to help them overcome the experience and move on with their lives. Without these programs to help children overcome this trauma, they will not only suffer as children but also as adults as they in themselves continue the cycle of violence. I would like to thank Elizabeth Lang particularly for her thoroughly researched report, It's like being in a war: Children's programs in women's refuges in Australia and again commend the Australian national internships program to the House. This is the fourth intern I have had in my office and I would Chil- recommend the program to other members of this place. It is a thoroughly worthwhile program. I now seek leave to table the report. Leave granted. Family Resource Centres",110
228,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,Scullin) (5.38 p.m.)Tomorrow sees the closure of the Whittlesea Plenty Valley Family Resource Centre. Mr Latham-Shame.,111
229,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"I agree with the honourable member for Werriwa that it isa very shameful act. It arises from a very mean spirited decision in this year's budget which came under the innocuous heading 'Broadbanding of family services' . It went on to state: Savings will be achieved by refocusing some projects and programs from 1 January .1998. Itwill make savings of $3 million in 1997-98 and $6.4 million in 1998-99. Nowhere did it directly say that what this meant was that the 11 family resource centres throughout Australia would have to close. I am proud to be associated with the family resource centre which has operated in my electorate. I am proud that I can say that I was there and chaired the first public meeting to get it on the road. I am proud that an organisation such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence was the interim sponsor. I am proud that an able group of local people came together to be the committee of management. I am proud of the work that was done by the family resource centre. I wish all those who previously worked for the family resource centre all the best in their futures. I wish Michael Gourlay, who has managed the program since its inception, all the best in future career. I regret that we have come to this outcome. I regret that we, here today, have to talk what is going to be a devastating blow for the many organisations and families that have gained some benefit from this family resource centre. The community, post the budget decision, has acted responsibly. They have not only continued a campaign to try to have this decision reversed but also looked at ways they can maximise ongoing benefit from the years that we have had the family resource centre. Family resource centres were first mentioned in the Governor General's speech in May 1990. The Whittlesea Plenty Valley FRC was opened in September 1992 and has successfully operated since then. In response to the budget this year, I organised a meeting of those interested and formed a group called Friends of the FRC. I will read a number of the organisations that were represented on Friends of the FRC. They include organisations such as: Lalor Living & Learning Centre; North Eastern Health Care Network Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services; Bitola Macedonian Senior Citizens Group; Whittlesea Northern Cypriot Women's Group; Thomastown Greek Elderly Citizens Group; Whittlesea Maltese Senior Citizens Group; YMCA-Mill Park Leisure Centre; CD Counselling Services; Women's Health in the North; Children's Protection Society; Happy Faces Child Care Centre; Kildonan Child and Family Services; Plenty Community Credit Union; Anglicare Plenty Valley (St John's) Care Force; Northern Melbourne Institute of T AFE; Home Tutor Scheme; RMIT Social Work; and Community Information Whittlesea. They are a number of the organisations which thought it important to come together to try to have the decision reversed. They are only a sample of the literally hundreds of groups that were helped by the family resource centre. In the letter that I received from the then Minister for Family Services she alleged that one of the reasons that the program was to be finalised was that it had completed its task. I can assure you that in his my electorate the family resource centre is a continuing, well needed resource. The fact is that the family resource centre had set out a about strategic plan and it had developed a community needs project to see what it could continue to do. I really wonder what this government thinks it is doing. It artificially thinks that by saving paltry amounts of money it is really working to the community's good. I put to the government that for the money that was spent on the family resource centres in my area there was a multiplier effect that cannot be estimated. It cannot be thrown aside. Each of the groups was assisted, had training for their committees of management or was able to use the volunteer register that was put together. We cannot just look at these things in dollar and cents terms, the bottom line, and take it out of the budget. What we have to look at is outcomes. If this government is really on about expending money in the most efficient way and getting the best results, it should not repeat decisions like this to close down the family resource centre program. (Time expired) Parliament House: Visit by Students",111
230,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"This week I have had the pleasure of hosting four final year students from Bomaderry High School, which is in my electorate of Gilmore. I invited these young women-Rachael Cooper, Heidi Wootten, Clare James and Kate ONEILL-here to give them a first-hand view of the political process. I have admired the way they have handled themselves and I am extremely proud of their maturity and sincerity in the way they have approached the issues of the week. These young women have just completed their HSC at Bomaderry High School and I look forward to hearing more about them and their success in their future careers. That is all I am going to say on my behalf, but with your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I will read an adjournment speech written by Rachael, Heidi, Clare and Kate. They wrote: What images arise from the word ""politician""? Perhaps a dark-suited male, publicly defending his seemingly corrupt behaviour trying to convince Australians that he is actually working for the good of the nation not merely exploiting the tax-payer dollar. Whether he is believed is another matter! This is the stereotypical image of a politician, a conception by which we ourselves had been blinded prior to our visit this week. While Question Time during our visit proved controversial amongst heated debate, we have watched history in the making with the Wik debate beginning in the Senate. Both glimpses at Parliament in action has at times been humorous, at other times inspiring. However we do note a lack of women on the front bench of both parties, and often question the lack of respect shown for fellow members. Indeed, experiencing Question Time for the first time we were astounded at the moments of seemingly disrespectful loudness of some Members and felt sympathy for those hardly heard. A way from the Houses our week has offered a glimpse at the vast network of politicians and their staff who work long hours, tirelessly, for the people they represent. We would like to thank those Members and Senators who kindly gave of their time to meet and talk with us. We discussed higher education, youth in politics and the role of the Democrats and the Senate with Senator Natasha Stott Despoja who we found to be motivating and vibrant. Our meetings with the Member for Jagajaga, the Member for Fremantle and the Member for Hughes proved to be equally poignant and the short time we spent with the Member for Oxley was indeed thought provoking. Our conversations were informative on careers, life within the Parliament and party ideologies. Many members' staff, including Greg Hunt from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Tony Nutt from the Prime Minister's Office, offered their time and provided an opportunity for us to learn about the vast number of career options behind the scenes at Parliament House and the means of achieving them. We would also like to thank the Member for Holt for taking the time to discuss Australia's role in Indochina, particularly Cambodia, which is directly related to our recently completed studies. The Speaker of the House was also kind enough to explain his role in Parliament and how he arrived in such a role despite his busy schedule. During our stay we had the opportunity to meet influential and inspiring people. We were fortunate to hear the CEO of the Office of the Status of Women, Ms Pru Goward, speak on women's issues and her role in advising the Government. We were also given the opportunity to hear, speak and meet with Angela Woods, mother of the late Anna Woods, on an issue that is close to us as youth, drugs. Indeed the many highlights of our visit included a tour of the Prime Minister's office and apartments as well as the Cabinet rooms. As we explored the issues of the day and the policies of different parties, it became more and more apparent to us the extent of misrepresentation and distortion by the media often in relaying to the public important issues. We all feel strongly that the public of Australia has a right to hear the policies of the Government clearly, comprehensively and in a non-biased way. Likewise, we see the importance of broadcasting to the people of Australia debate in the Senate and Lower House so that policies and issues of debate can be heard and understood by people who can then make their own conclusions. Communication with the people of Australia is fundamental to democracy. Clear and non-biased communication with its people needs to be made a priority in the workings of Government and as young Australians we call upon the Parliament to continue working towards this essential goal. For a week of endless opportunities and learning, our sincere thanks and gratitude go to Joanna Gash, our local member for Gilmore, and the people of her office for accommodating us and allowing us to meet with other members and Parliament House workers who have also been generous in giving us their time. Controversial, humorous and inspiring-words that describe our four-day visit behind the scenes at Parliament House. From Question Time to meeting and talking with Members and Senators of all parties, these four days have opened our eyes not only to the work of a politician but more importantly challenged the stereotypes very much alive within the community that are so often reinforced by the media-stereotypes that label all politicians as liars, cheats, ""bludgers"" and after power and prestige rather than for the good of the Australian public. Overwhelmingly we have found politicians to the contrary. The vast majority are hard working, dedicated and generally caring leaders of the people they represent. The friendliness and enthusiasm of the Members and Senators and their staff have made Parliament House an inspiring place to visit. Watching the workings of Parliament and the protests of people outside Parliament House reinforced the fact that we are fortunate to live in a democracy and can be truly proud of a country that belongs to all its people. That is the voice of just four of these young people in the electorate of Gilmore, a point of view which I think must be taken into account when we look at the dealings of parliament and the future directions of Australia. We must give young people hope for the future and we must lead by example. Most importantly, we must listen and not forget to hear the voice of young people, for they are the future of Australia. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",112
231,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,And congratulations to those four wonderful young women from the south coast of New South Wales. Harrick's Homestead: Preservation,114
232,Mr SERCOMBE,ADJOURNMENT,"I think it is quite encouraging that Australians are increasingly taking an interest in their history and heritage issues. The preservation of heritage and historical sites is particularly important in growing urban areas r of the country. think the Commonwealth has a very important role to play in assisting in that respect. There are 16 hectares of Commonwealth owned land in my electorate which the Department of Finance and Administration presently has on the market. It is land that is industrially zoned but somewhat limited in its use because it is on the southern approaches to Melbourne airport. However, it is the site of a historic homestead for that particular part of Melbourne. Harrick's Homestead, as it is known, dates back to 1861. It housed, amazingly when one sees it, aJamily of 12 during the 1880s. It has become part of the area's history. It has ongoing associations with the area because descendants of the Harrick family remain in the area. It is not just local people who recognise the significance of this particular site. The Australian Heritage Commission notified the Keilor Historical Society in August this year that the site had been added to the register of the national estate. Local and regional historical societies are all actively supporting some form of protection for this particular homestead in the context of the Commonwealth disposing of the 16 hectares. What the Brimbank City Council is requesting that the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) give urgent attention to, as a minimum, is excising 1.1 hectares from the 16 hectares to enable a contained area of this Commonwealth land to be preserved so that Harrick's Homestead can be preserved as part of the local history of the north-west of Melbourne. The local council is also, in association with the Heritage Commission, asking the Commonwealth to consider developing a conservation plan for the site in the terms that are required by the Australian Heritage Act and are seeking assistance from the Commonwealth in assessing the work that needs to be done to restore the property to permanent ongoing public use. If the site is lost, a valuable piece of history of that part of Melbourne will be lost in the process of the Commonwealth disposing of the site, jf the minister is not prepared to act promptly. As I indicated, the land is very much on the southern approaches into Melbourne airport so there are somewhat limited potential uses for it despite the industrial zoning. I do not have a valuation on what 1.1 hectares of it would cost the Commonwealth, but it is certainly not going to be a huge sum of money. It seems to me that, given the sort of focus the Commonwealth is wanting to give to heritage and historical issues in the lead-up to the centenary of Federation, this is a most important opportunity for the Commonwealth to show that it will work with local communities, local historical societies and local councils to ensure that important heritage and historical locations all around the country are protected so future generations can see how pioneers of the last century lived and what sorts of houses and homesteads they lived in. I think that is very important for our sense of ourselves as a nation and in terms of understanding where we have come from. I urge the minister, as I will be doing in writing tomorrow after having made this contribution to the adjournment debate, to give very rapid attention to the excision as requested by the local community and to ensure some Commonwealth support for the conservation and planning process in ensuring that proper attention is given to restoring the property. Western Australia: 'Three Strikes and You're In' Law",114
233,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to bring to the attention of this House an alarming interference by the Australian Law Reform Commission into Western Australian justice. This involves the law called the 'three strikes and you're in' home burglary law. This law was generated by the Western Australian government in response to the overwhelming amount of juvenile crime and home burglaries. The head of the Australian Law Reform Commission is one Mr Ala- Rose. We know Mr Alan Rose because he is the same progressive President of the Australian Law Reform Commission who took it upon himself to involve himself in the native title debate! Mr Alan Rose shows that he is part of the out of touch judiciary and the socialist left that want to see this country in a situation where there is possible anarchy on the streets. Under the 'three strikes and you're in' law, offenders convicted of a. third home burglary must be sentenced to a minimum of 12 months detention. What the Australian Law Reform Commission, through Mr Alan Rose QC, is saying is that because of Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child this law should be outlawed by the federal government. I am not going to be part of a federal government that gets involved in outlawing laws of any states. In fact, Australia is far too involved in United Nations conventions at the moment. Under the previous government, this parliament took on so many United Nations conventions that it actually has adopted more conventions than the United States of America, which is just unbelievable. We seem to take on a United Nations convention without even thinking about it and the effect it will have on Australian society. The 'three strikes and you're in' law was, as I said, formulated because of the increase in juvenile crime. I want to speak specifically about a case involving Mr Byrne-King, who was beaten outside his home this year. He went out to see who was breaking into his car and was bashed absolutely senseless. His family was inside and when they pursued the thugs who were bashing him, the thugs turned on them also. Just by way of interest, when the witnesses attended court this week the parents of the boys charged bashed them. The accused, a 16year-old boy, and his 15-year-old cousin failed to appear. They did not bother turning up to the court case. But their supporters turned up and bashed some of the witnesses. My point is: if you commit an adult crime, you should expect an adult punishment. I am very concerned that some people think because you are under the age of 18 you are above. the law or above receiving the same justice the law would deliver to an adult. I have had to deal with people who stole my car out of my garage. They were 14 and they were pretty big. I can assure you that it would have been a nice old to-do if I had tried to tackle them, and I am not as small as some people. What I would like to say to Mr Alan Rose QC and Justice Fenbury of the Children's Court of Western Australia is: yes, there are education programs to deal with juvenile criminals. I would like to praise one within my electorate in the City of Belmont run by the sergeant of the Belmont police station, Sergeant Fred Healed, who has recently been decorated for his efforts in education and reduction of crime. In fact, since he has come to the City of Belmont crime has been reduced by 40 per cent. There are programs, but society and its citizens have a right to be protected. I say to people like Mr Alan Rose QC: you should address laws that address the victims of crime and the people who are the objects of those who do not wish to obey the law rather than being creative in the legal system and trying to strike down laws which are dealing with the matters in Western Australia.

NA The following answers to questions were circulated: (Question No. 2078) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Further to questions Nos. 1803 (Hansard, 25 August 1997, page 6778) and 1804 (Hansard, 25 August 1997, page 6779), what procedures are in place to check and verify that requirements placed on private car hire firms are implemented. (2) What action will be taken in relation to private hire car firms who fail to (a) adopt or (b) maintain required standards. (3) What action will be taken in relation to private hire car firms which directly tout business from Comcar customers or which encourage Comcar customers to bypass Comcar altogether when making bookings. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that: (1) In addition to the requirements under Purchasing Australia's Hire Car Services (Chauffeur Driver) Common Use Agreement-Buyers Guide 20, COMCAR has tightened its requirements of contractors, particularly in regard to safety and security of passengers. COMCAR has briefed contractors .about these additional requirements and has required all contractors to advise COMCAR of processes they have put in place to ensure that they comply with these requirements. In addition COMCAR continually monitors contractor performance and undertakes periodic visits to contractors. (2) (a) and (b) Hire car contractors who fail to adopt or maintain the required standards will not be engaged by COMCAR. (3) COMCAR will immediately investigate the matter, contact the hire car contractor direct and instigate corrective action. If such service failures continue, the contractor's priority or preference on the contract will be reviewed. NA Comcar World War I Veterans' Entitlements (Question No. 2106) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: Are World War I veterans entitled to benefits which are not available to World War II veterans; if so, (a) what and (b) will he consider extending the benefits to all World War II veterans. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Health Care Benefits Currently, the Gold Card, which gives access to Veterans' Affairs health care benefits for all conditions whether service-related or not, is available to veterans of the Australian defence forces who: served in World War I; were prisoners of war; are receiving a disability pension at or above 100% of the general rate; were receiving a disability pension for pulmonary tuberculosis before 2 November 1978; are receiving a disability pension at or above 50% of the general rate and are also receiving any amount of service pension; are receiving an additional amount under section 27 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (YEA) for specific service-related amputations or blindness in one eye; are receiving a service pension and satisfy the treatment benefits eligibility income and assets tests; are receiving a service pension and who are permanently blinded in both eyes; or are returned ex-servicewomen of World War II, that is, who served in the Australian Defence Force between 3 September 1939 and 29 October 1945 and incurred danger from hostile enemy forces. Pensions and Allowances There is no difference in the eligibility criteria for pensions payable to both World War I and World War II veterans. The same applies to the eligibility criteria for all allowances except the telephone allowance. The telephone allowance is currently $59.20 per year, paid in quarterly instalments of $15.40. In respect of World War I veterans the telephone allowance is paid at $42.50 per quarter representing the entire cost of the telephone rental. Eligibility for the telephone allowance equivalent to the entire telephone rental charge was extended to World War I veterans in recognition of their service and in recognition of the extreme age and frailty of these veterans and the fact that they need access to communication facilities in times of emergency. The Government appreciates that some veterans of WorId War II, and later conflicts, are also in failing health and need access to emergency alert devices. Such devices are already available to veterans on a needs basis through my Department. (b) The Federal Government is always willing to consider the merits of requests for extending benefits. Various Governments over the years have extended Veterans' Affairs health care benefits to an increasing range of veterans of the Australian defence forces. Informal Complaints by Comcar Drivers (Question No. 2133) Mr Eoin Cameron as';:ed the Minister representing the Special .vlinister of State, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Were informal complaints lodged by Comcar drivers against Members and Senators in the period 1992-96; if so, (a) how many informal complaints were lodged, (b) against whom was each informal complaint made, (c) what was the substance of each informal complaint and (d) what action was taken. (2) Is there a policy to enforce counselling or other action for Members and Senators against whom informal complaints are lodged; if so, what is it; if not, (a) why and (b) will he consider such a policy. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) none; (b) not applicable; (c) not applicable; (d) not applicable. (2) This is a matter for the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives. Medicare Office Closures (Question No. 2173) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 1 September 1997: (1) Is the (a) Auburn Medicare office at the Auburn Shopping Village, NSW, and (b) Merrylands Medicare office located at the Stockland Mall, to close; if so, when. (2) What leasing arrangements apply to the properties referred to in part (1), including the (a) duration of and (b) monthly rental under, the leases. (3) Will additional penalties apply if the leases are terminated before the specified expiry dates.",159
285,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Auburn Medicare office closed on 26 September 1997. (b) The Merrylands Medicare office closed on 17 October 1997. (2)-(3) All Medicare offices currently provide both Medicare and Medibank Private services. The Health Insurance Commission (HIC) negotiates leases with a range of major commercial property owners and managers. These arrangements are commercial-in-confidence. In some offices designated for closure, leases have expired (with month to month arrangements in place). In others, they will expire around the date of closure or later. In a number of cases, the HIC is currently negotiating termination arrangements. The outcome of these negotiations may vary from site to site. Releasing information at this stage in relation to specific locations may compromise the HIC's ability to negotiate the most favourable terms for the Commonwealth. Testing Procedures for Entrance to the Australian Public Service (Question No. 2203) Mr Lee asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, upon notice, on 22 September 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to claims that testing procedures for entrance to the Australian Public Service discriminate against applicants with dyslexia and other reading disabilities. (2) Has the Commonwealth instituted special testing conditions or procedures for applicants to the Australian Public Service who are dyslexic or have other reading disabilities; if so, (a) what, (b) how many applicants take advantage of the special procedures and (c) what proportion of these applicants have been successful in their applications since 1997. (3) Has research been undertaken by the Commonwealth to ensure the testing procedures adequately cater for the special needs of dyslexic applicants; if so, what. (4) Are further changes to testing procedures planned. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1-2) The issue of possible discrimination has been raised by potential applicants for entry level positions in the APS. Dyslexic applicants for entry level positions in the APS are given extended time to complete the Public Service Recruitment Test-twice the time provided for mainstream applicants. This time is provided because dyslexic applicants may need more time to read the Test than mainstream applicants. During the recent Australia-wide recruitment campaign for entry level positions in the APS seven applicants identified themselves as being dyslexic and received extended time to complete the Test. The proportion of successful dyslexic applicants is not known at this stage. The pool of applicants from the recent round of testing will be used to' fill entry level positions in the APS over the next twelve months. (3-4) Providing dyslexic applicants with extended time to complete the Test directly addresses the possible impact of dyslexia on their test performance and ensures that the testing procedure best caters for their needs. Specific changes to the procedures are not currently planned. However, APS entry level testing procedures are reviewed regularly and changes to the procedures will occur from time to time. United Nations: Death and Disability Payment Reductions (Question No. 2333) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) Did the UN General Assembly in June 1997 reduce death and disability payments which would be available to Australian troops serving on UN deployments; if so, will the Government make up the difference; if not, why not. (2) Did the Government oppose the death benefit reduction of about US$35 000 at the UN General Assembly; if not, why not. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) United Nations General Assembly Resolution 51/218E of 16 July 1997 formalised a consensus agreement reached by the United Nations Fifth Committee on new arrangements for the payment of death and disability compensation. The new selfinsurance arrangements include uniform and standardised rates of payment for death and disability for all member States. The system acts to guarantee a minimum level of compensation for death or disability for the troops of all countries contributing to United Nations deployments. This new scheme does not affect the amount of compensation for death and disability paid to Australian troops serving on United Nations deployments, as they are provided with compensation cover under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. (2) No. The new scheme was adopted on a consensus basis in response to wide and strongly held views that the former system was inequitable; its administration time consuming, cumbersome and inefficient; settlement of claims protracted; and the existing backlog of claims unacceptably high. In keeping with our ongoing efforts to streamline peacekeeping administrative processes, the introduction of the new system was supported by Australia. Australian Defence Industries, Lithgow: Gun Buyback Scheme (Question No. 2338) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) Has Australian Defence Industries (ADI) Lithgow handed in weapons under the Government's buyback scheme; if so, what weapons. (2) How many of each type of weapon have been handed in. (3) What payment was received for each weapon handed in. (4) Were weapons earmarked for destruction prior to the buyback scheme being announced. (5) Has ADI received payment from his Department for the destruction of the weapons prior to the buyback scheme being announced; if so, (a) for which weapons and (b) what was the sum involved. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. ADI has advised that weapons have been handed back under the guns buy-back scheme. These include Bren and Thompson machine guns and Self-Loading Rifles. (2) (3) and (4) Details of the Company's participation in the scheme are a matter entirely for ADI, which has an independent board of directors responsible for all day-today business decisions. The shareholder is not privy to details of the Company's day-today commercial transactions. (5) No. Child Support Agency: Income Guidelines (Question No. 2384) Mr MCClelland asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 October 1997: To what extent do the guidelines for the Child Support Agency require the Agency to have regard to the extent to which the income of a custodial parent is supplemented by income through a de facto relationship in the calculation in the child support obligations imposed on the non custodial parent. Mr Costello---The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Child support liabilities are calculated by the application of a formula contained in the Child Support Assessment Act (1989). The income of new partners, whether married or de facto, of either the liable parent (non custodial) or the carer (custodial) is not taken into account in this formula. This is in line with the family law principle that the primary responsibility for financial support of children rests with their natural or adoptive parents. The Child Support Assessment Act (1989) does provide for a departure from administrative assessment on anyone of nine grounds. In some instances the income of new partners, married or de facto, may be relevant to a decision whether or not to depart from administrative assessment. One example of when this may occur is where a parent and his or her partner are involved jointly in business activity. Austudy Payments: Guidelines (Question No. 2412) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 23 October 1997: (1) What guidelines apply to the payment of the independent rate of Austudy due to homelessness. (2) Under what circumstances are parents not consulted before a decision is made to pay the homeless rate. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Austudy grants a reviewable independent rate of assistance to students who may be at risk of not entering into, or giving up study because of traumatic family circumstances. This includes instances of extreme family breakdown or circumstances which pose a serious risk to the student's physical or mental well-being due to violence, sexual abuse or other similar situations. The provision is not a means for students to choose to leave home so that they can get a higher rate of Austudy. To approve an Austudy application on the ground of homelessness, the Policy Guidelines Manual used by Centrelink requires: a personal statement from. the student stating reasons why it is unreasonable for the student to live at home. This must be supported by a statement from an independent health/welfare workers, (statements from parties such as police officers and ministers of religion are also acceptable). a statement from the student that no financial or other support is being received, directly or indirectly from any other person or Government source. Detailed policy and procedures for granting the independent rate of Austudy on the ground of homelessness are set out in the Austudy Policy Guidelines Manual which is used by all Centrelink assessors (Chapter 6, pp 18-52). Students whose applications are not supported by a statement from an independent health worker/welfare officer are offered an interview with a Centrelink Social Worker. Where this proceeds, the case is investigated and a report is prepared for assessment against Student Homeless Rate (SHR) policy. (2) Assistance will not normally be approved until the student's parent(s) have been given the chance to comment. Parent(s) are contacted irrespective of whether they are natural or legally adoptive parents, whether they live in separate households and irrespective of who has custody or guardianship. Parents' comments are sought to ensure that: decisions are made on the basis of full information and to ensure SHR operates fairly; parents have the opportunity to give their point of view in respect of their family's matters; and to explore the possibility and appropriateness of mediation, counselling or family therapy. The Policy Guidelines Manual specifies that in making decisions in relation to SHR applications, the Department must be accountable and fair to all parties, including the parents (Chapter 6, page 18). However, comments from one or both parents will not be sought where: there is sufficient evidence indicating that the student's or another person's safety could be at risk if the parent(s) were contacted; there is independent evidence from a government welfare department, medical or police authority of domestic violence or abuse; or there is no doubt as to the authenticity of a written statement from one parent (Chapter 6, p29). Furthermore, a non custodial parent will not be contacted if they have had no contact with the student or have not paid maintenance for more than two years. Where a student's parent(s) have not been contacted for comment, the application must be considered and signed by the manager of the Centrelink Student Services office (Chapter 6, p29). In accordance with privacy requirements, the student must give permission before parents can be contacted. Students refusing without good reason may have their SHR application rejected or payment cancelled on the basis that a proper investigation was not possible (Chapter 6, p28). Ingleburn Army Camp (Question No. 2413) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 October 1997: . (1) Is the Ingleburn Army Camp, NSW, of historical value. (2) Will there be an independent heritage review of the Ingleburn Army Camp; if so, will he bring the review forward to ensure all aspects of heritage significance currently on site are recorded and assessed. (3) What action is being taken to ensure the buildings at the Ingleburn Army Camp, particularly those located at the entrance of the site and theatre, are recorded and photographed before any plans are made to demolish them. (4) Will local historians and the Campbelltown City Library, through Campbelltown City Council, be consulted before any demolition plans are devised or enacted. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Some elements of the site are thought to have historical significance. (2) The Department of Defence recently commissioned a heritage assessment of the entire site. The heritage assessment is now being undertaken and is expected to be completed by 31 December 1997. (3) There are no plans to demolish the old theatre or the buildings at the entrance of the site in advance of the completion of the heritage review. However, some demolition work of buildings with no historical value is proceeding elsewhere on the site to prevent the ongoing problems of rubbish dumping, stealing, trespass and vandalism. (4) The Department of Defence has given an undertaking to provide the Campbelltown City Council with copies of the heritage review when it is completed. Public Office Holders: Federal Elections (Question No. 2467)  the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 17 November 1997: (1) Is the Minister able to say how many candidates in NSW at the Federal election in March 1993 (a) had been public office holders in local government, (b) had been elected to public office at the 1991 NSW local government elections, (c) were required by s 44(iv) of the Constitution to resign from public office in local government prior to nominating for the March 1993 Federal election and (d) who resigned from their elected positions in local government were (i) elected or (ii) not elected to Federal Parliament. (2) Is the Minister able to say how many candidates in NSW at the Federal election in March 1996 (a) had been public office holders in local government, (b) had been elected to public office at the 1995 NSW local government elections, (c) were required by s 44(iv) of the Constitution to resign from public office in local government prior to nominating for the March 1996 Federal election and (d) who resigned from their elected positions in local government were (i) elected or (ii) not elected to Federal Parliament. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State the old has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2). No. The requisites for nomination, as specified in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, do not include any requirement for such information to be provided by intending candidates at federal elections. The information is not collected by the Australian Electoral Commission.
