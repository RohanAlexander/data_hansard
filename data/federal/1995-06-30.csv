2,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Menzies) (10.03 a.m.)The amendments which the government is now acceding to are those in relation to the tax on building materials, which were moved here when the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Excise) Bill 1995 was before the House on a previous occasion. We have here the best indication for some time of the truth of the old adage: in politics, a week is a long time. I say it is an indication of that adage because one might recall the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) standing at this dispatch box on Monday, the start of this week, with all his usual arrogance. He said that the blockage of these measures through the opposition's voting against them in the Senate would lead to an increase in interest rates in this country. In answer to a question on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Let me say to the member for Bennelong that if interest rates in this country do not fall further he will be the responsible party. I notice that the National Australia Bank on Friday night reduced its fixed rate from over 91,4 per cent to under nine per cent-8.75 per cent. If those sorts of declines that we have seen in interest rates and in the long-term bond rate-which has come from 10.1 to now 8.8 per cent-are not further compounded and consolidated, then, as a consequence, SENATE the guilty person will be lW. Howard. He will be the person standing in the way of falling interest rates for Australians. That is what the Prime Minister of this country said on Monday this week when he stood at the dispatch box here with all his usual insufferable arrogance. This measure was going to blowout the budget, change the current account deficit, force up interest rates and have all the dire consequences you could expect for Australia. But what do we have by the end of the week? On Thursday, an article in the Sydney Morning Herald referred to a speech made by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to the Economic omit Society of Australia in Melbourne. What did he say there? He did not say that this is going to force up interest rates. He did not say that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who from opposition can dictate government policy, is going to be the most powerful opposition leader in the history of Australia. He said nothing of that sort. It is always interesting to .hear what the Treasurer says. There is something about the Treasurer of this country which makes him different from the Prime Minister. There is a modicum of integrity, decency and plain truth in what the Treasurer says. The fact is that the Treasurer cannot quite tell a lie. He will not come in here and say that black is white when in fact it is the other way round. He will try to move around an answer as best he can, but he will not come in here and say barefaced that black is white when that is not the case. That is what we get from the Prime Minister. In the Sydney MorningHerald the Treasurer is reported as saying: Obviously a difference of that order is I1:0t to have a dramatic impact on policy, but It moves in the wrong direction . . . So on Monday we had the Prime Minister saying that interest rates are going to go up because we blocked a tax that was not promised to the Australian people. He also said that this is going to have dire consequen-es for the Australian economy and the Austrahan people. In fact, we are blocking a tax which the government sought to impose on the Australian people. This comes after the last election when the Prime Minister said, 'What I am promising is not to put up taxes. Not only am I promising that but it is l-a-w, law that there will be no increases in tax.' He then comes along with a raft of tax increases-including on building materials and cars and increases in the corporate tax rate-and we said, 'Enough is enough. How about a bit of integrity in politics in this country?' After the Prime Minister had said what he did on Monday at the dispatch box with all his usual arrogance, we then got the Treasurer saying by Thursday that it is not actually going to have those consequences for the people of Australia - d - hat it is not re-lly going to have a dramatic Impact on pohcy. What the Treasurer did not say was that the Prime Minister was wrong and that as usual he was exaggerating things in his typical arrogant way. That is the code for what the Treasurer was saying to the economists. So on Monday of this long week of politics we had the Prime Minister standing up here and saying that somehow the actions of t-e opposition, by keeping the government to I-S word, were going to have dire .economlc consequences for the people of this COUl1:try and then on Thursday the Treasurer saymg that this is· not going to have any major impact on policy at all. That gi-es us. a.n indication of the rhetoric of the Pnme Mmlster in this place this week. He is searching around frantically for a target to aim at. He has fired off his republic. He has fired off on his Accord. He has fired off here, there and everywhere using a scatter gun approach but he has no target. He knows it and he looks increasingly desperate as he stands in here. Rather than having the rottweiler that we going had at the dispatch box on Monday, what we now have is a puppy that is slinking aw.ay n-t even with a yelp or whimper. It has ItS tat! between its legs and is racing out of this place as the week comes to an end, without having dealt with this issue. The reason for opposing· this measure. is most important. We will continue to remmd the people of Australia of those - eas-ns from now until the day the next electIOn IS called and the day the next election is held. How can you ever trust anything that the Leader of the Australian Labor Party says or any promises that he makes. The events of this week alone demonstrate that he will say anything, he will twist any words or statement an- he will change any position in order to - attsfy what he sees as being politically expedient at the time. The Labor Party went to the people of Australia at the last election saying that not only would it not put up taxes but that it would be l-a-w, law. Now we find ourselves in this parliament considering legislation .that will increase sales tax on a range of matenals. I say to the people of Australia: how can - ou ever trust anything that this man says agam? How can you place any store on the integrity of this government and this leader when this is the way he treats the Australian people? If you do trust this government then you face grave consequences. Remember what this particular measure is about. This is a measure which deals with sales tax on a whole range of ordinary household items. This is a measure which puts a 12 per cent sales tax on nuts, bolts, scre-s, ta1?s, nozzles for showers, bathroom vamty umts and kitchens. Under this measure, a whole range of ordinary household ite-s is g-i-g to be taxed at 12 per cent. The Pnme Mmlster says 'Well, at the last election you proposed a GST of 15 per cent on materials.' That is true but at least we told the Australian people that'that was what we were going to do. Mrs Moylan-And we were going to remove taxes.",11
3,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"As has been pointed out by my colleague the member for Pearce, we . were going to remove a whole range of taxes as well. But what we have here is taxation by stealth, and it is still continuing. It is relevant that this debate should occur today because as of tomorrow-l July-the Australian people will face a whole range of tax increases.",13
4,Mr CADMAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,KST.,13
5,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,":-The KST-Keating's sales tax. It is not the GST that you might have got under us; it is the KST that you are getting, and you are getting it in a big dose tomorrow. Let me remind people of the increases in taxes which are going to occur surreptitiously, without fanfare, without comment and almost in secret tomorrow-1 July 1995. All wholesale sales tax rates will increase by one percentage point. The wholesale sales tax paid on a whole range of ordinary household items will be 22 per cent and 32 per cent. It is going up one per cent tomorrow. What will this bring in for the government in the 1995-96 taxation year? Some $600 million. Some $600 million in extra tax will be raised because of this measure being introduced tomorrow. Wholesale sales tax rates on wine and cider will increase by two percentage points as of tomorrow-Saturday, 1 July. Company tax rates will rise from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, bringing in $320 million to government coffers. Excise on light fuel oils will be introduced, bringing in another $100 million to government coffers. Then there is the Medicare levy. Have you heard much from the Prime Minister in the press over the last few days? The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) said that the Medicare levy would not be increased, but tomorrow it will be increased to 1.5 per cent, raising another $230 million to government coffers. The Prime Minister was running around the country saying that $215 million is somehow going to put a hole in the government's budget. Here is an extra $1,280 million that will be raised by the government in the next financial year due to the tax increases which commence tomorrow. We do not hear any fanfare about it whatsoever. These are just the secret taxes that are increasingly being introduced and increased by· this government throughout its period in office. The simple point about this is one of integrity and honesty-whether or not you can place any trust in what is said by this government any more. The simple message we will continue to make is this: here is a Prime Minister who categorically and in clear, unambiguous terms said to the people of Australia, 'It's not just a promise; it's a lawan l-a-w, law: we're not going to increase taxes.' That is what he said to the people of Australia prior to the last election. One clear, unambiguous mandate that the Prime Minister gave the people of Australia prior to the last election was, 'We will not increase taxes.' Mrs Moylan-No new taxes.",13
6,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"No new taxes. They were his words. Yet here we have a raft of new taxes. We are pleased that the government has finally seen sense and recognised the anger of the Australian people concerning these matters. We are disappointed that the minor parties in the Senate did not have the courage to stick to their own mask in terms of the tax on cars, which is also going to be increased, the corporate tax and the other new taxes, which break a promise made by this government. But we can say to the people of Australia that as of tomorrow they will not have to pay the 12 per cent tax on a whole range of building items and housing items because of the action that we have taken in trying to keep this government honest. We will continue to do so through to the next election. The lesson of this story is not just that you can no longer trust the Prime Minister of Australia in anything that he says, in any promise that he makes or in any statement that he commits himself to. The clear message is that, regardless of what the government promises at the next election in terms of policies, it will put up the tax on building products. It is clear. The government has already increased wholesale sales tax and will be doing so again tomorrow on a whole range of products. This is a party whose election commitment so far, going into the next election, is to increase taxes. Make no mistake about it. The government is not proceeding with this measure simply because the minor parties joined us in the Senate to defeat it. What did the government proceed with? It proceeded with increasing taxes on cars. It proceeded with increasing the corporate tax, and it proceeded with increasing other taxes which I listed before. There is one clear message from this: what we are dealing with is a government which will increase taxes, which has increased taxes and which will increase taxes in the future. There is no doubt. The record is there to see. The facts are written in the Hansard and in the Votes and Proceedings of the Commonwealth parliament of Australia. There can be no doubt about that. So, as I said at the outset,. this has been a long week in politics-a week in which we had the Prime Minister stand arrogantly here at the dispatch box on Monday and say that somehow by our holding him to his word the whole economic future of this country was being placed in dire straits. Yet three days later the Treasurer of Australia is saying, somewhat more honestly, that that is not the case, that it will not have these dire consequences and, in fact, it will not make a huge difference to the government's economic policy at all. That is the lesson of this government. We have a Prime Minister who will say anything, who will reverse any position, who will twist any statement, in order to advance what he perceives are his short-term political ends. I say to the people of Australia, 'We have had enough of this. We believe you have had enough of this. We will show the government at the next election that that is the case.'",13
7,Mr LINDSAY,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (10.17 a.m.)-It is some time since I have heard from the opposition such a response which is covered in deceit, motivated by a colossal hide. I will never forget the words of royal commissioner Mr Frank Costigan when he said that the only growth industry during the period when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer was tax avoidance and tax evasion. In other words, during that period we had seen a collapse in public morality in this country where evasion and avoidance were the order of the day. Nothing was done about it by the then Liberal-National Party government. It took the Costigan royal commission to expose it chapter after chapter after chapter. One measure of ascertaining a person's credibility, integrity or honesty is to look at his record. The people of Australia will remember the Leader of the Opposition promising tax cuts in the 1978 budget. I will never forget the headlines of the lllawarra Mercury when it described the Leader of the Opposition in terms which the people of Australia will never ever forget. The people of Australia will also remember the way the then Fraser-Howard government changed and mutilated Medibank after promising the Australian people at the 1975 and 1977 elections that Medibank would remain intact. Who can ever forget that at the time the Fraser-Howard government lost office in March 1983 we had double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and double digit interest rates. May I say categorically that the interest rate on a 90-day commercial bill in March 1983 through the Bank of New South Wales was 23 per cent. The highest income tax rate was 60c in the dollar. The lowest marginal income tax rate was 30c in the dollar. Company tax rates were 46c in the dollar. Above all, this government inherited a deficit in 1983 dollar terms of $9.6 billion-$9,600 million. We have never heard any person from - he opposition, either in the Senate or the House of Representatives, repudiate the policies of Fightback. I certainly have not heard it. I have not heard them repudiate a goods and services tax, their pledge to cut $10,000 million from government expenditure or their pledge to dramatically render upheaval in the industrial relations system in this country by cutting youth wages to $3 an hour, or $3.50 an hour depending on the age of the employee. I have never heard them repudiate that they would cut Medic;are to all except low income earners and pensioners. We have two shadow ministers at the table here this morning. I am going to put a question to them. They should think about it very carefully because this government has information about the antics of the opposition which they want to be very careful of. I ask them: will you pledge and guarantee that you will not introduce a goods and services tax in this House and impose a goods and services tax on the Australian people if you ever become a government? That is the question I put to the opposition, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition. Will you pledge and guarantee that you will not introduce a goods and services tax in this House and impose a goods and services tax on the Australian people if you ever become a government? That is the question the Australian people will demand be answered at the next election. I know the answer to that. We have information that those opposite will campaign deceitfully on this issue and that within two months, in the unlikely event that they ever gain government, they will impose a goods and services tax on the Australian people. They will not be allowed to run away from that issue. In every town and city and every street of every town in this country, the Australian people will be reminded that the Liberal and National parties stand for the introduction of a goods and services tax, probably at 15 per cent. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (CUSTOMS) BILL 1995 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with a request for amendments. Ordered that the requested amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's requested amendments No.1 - Schedule 2, page 9, items 1 to 11, the items. No.2 - Schedule 2, pages 10 and 11, items 13 to 16, omit the items. Motion (by Mr Lindsay) proposed: That the requested amendments be made.",14
8,Mr CADMAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I am sure you will understand that there appear to be many opportunities for members to speak on these issues because there are many bills on sales tax. It just goes to indicate how avaricious this government is in raking in funds. I remind the House of what has been said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In 1991 the Prime Minister said: I will deal honestly with the people and tell them the truth. In the tough times, of course, the temptation is to gild the lily. I'll be resisting that temptation as much as it's humanly possible. I'll speak honestly with the in ... and realistically, and I'll listen accordingly. The Prime Minister said that 1991, running up to the last election. Then in 1992 on a Lateline program the Prime Minister said: What I am saying is that taxes will not increase. Running into the 1993 election, the Prime Minister said, 'You can have all the Liberals have offered. There will be no new taxes, no GST-and you will get a tax cut as well. Trust us.' The Prime Minister made the statement 'I will deal honestly.' He then said, 'There will be no new taxes.' He then went to the electorate, saying, 'You will get all the Liberals have promised, with no GST, and you will get a tax cut as well.' What have we seen in fact during the life of this government? We have seen the Prime Minister himself deny the promised tax cuts. He said, 'They will be l-a-w law.' We had legislation in this House to prove what he meant. What did he do? He scrapped that law and said 'no tax cuts' - just like that. He did it to the Australian people. He did not even blush, did not even remember the words of a few months before when he said, 'I will deal honestly with you and there will be no tax increases.' First of all, he wiped out the tax cuts, and now we have the second step. The bills before the House today increase taxation. Maybe wholesale sales tax does not mean a great deal until you start to analyse omit the cost increases for the average mum and dad and average family. Wholesale sales tax affects us all. It is built into the cost of everything. For instance, wholesale sales tax has increased and is increasing the cost of motor cars. The man who promised to be honest and not to increase taxes has increased the taxon motor cars by 46 per cent. What are we faCing right now? These bills would have increased the cost of an average home by $1,000 to $2,000. The cost of every renovation and every addition to every house in Australia would have increased because these taxes, built into the cost of· building materials. These taxes are collected secretly by the government from wholesalers-from timber yards and hardware warehouses. There would be an extra impost of 12 per cent on all building materials. The Prime Minister is dealing not honestly but dishonestly. In this budget, in addition to taxes.' these bills, he is raising taxes. These measures will increase costs to Australian families. In addition to that, he said, 'But now I have got another plan. In 50 years time. I am going give you a great super deaL' The Australian people will not believe that. How can they believe it? He has broken his word on this matter. The practical demonstration of it is the House today. I will just give the House some idea what is implied by the Keating sales tax. Tomorrow is KST day, because tomorrow is when the taxes start, when they come into effect. I remind the House that there is alwill ready wholesale sales tax on food. The Prime Minister is increasing that tax, starting on July-tomorrow. That tax will be on biscuits, snack foods, popcorn, chips, muesli bars, health food bars, ice cream, ice blocks, candy and non-medicated throat lozenges. All of those things have got a sales tax on them. There are sales taxes on drinks, including fruit juice. Fruit juices have a wholesale sales on them. That is increasing tomorrow. Where is the promise not to increase taxes? This is the Keating sales tax. We had the GST; this is the Keating sales tax. The Prime Minister is doing what he promised he would the next year. not do-right across the board. Now he wants, with this legislation, to put a tax building materials. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has said, 'No, we are not going to cop that. You have to live up to your promises at some stage in the history of this nation. You have had 12 years of breaking promises to the Australian people and we going to stand up and oppose this new tax because you promised you would not bring it in.' We are going to stand up against you. I find it hard to follow the way the Senate makes decisions but, fortunately, some of the people in the Senate said they would agree of with us. Today we have amended bills before the House of Representatives saying that the Senate will not allow the wholesale sales tax to go ahead. The Senate has blocked the legislation. Back in the House of Representatives the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said, 'We are not going to push it. We are going to have to agree with you and so the government is not going to go ahead with those wholesale sales Just in case anybody should think that is the end of it and nothing is happening, the Prime to Minister said, 'I am .not going to increase taxes.' Those were his words on Lateline. Let me tell the House what he actually is increasing. The wholesale sales tax, the Keating sales in tax, is over everything, but the rejection of the legislation by the Senate will only block the sales tax increases on building materialsof the impost on building materials. The rest of it will go ahead and tomorrow it will start. Tomorrow the wholesale sales tax start on biscuits; muesli bars; ice creams; garbage cans; compost bins; floor coverings, 1 carpets and vinyl; lighting appliances; washing machines; dryers; refrigerators; kitchen and cooking utensils; matches; candles; and linen, blankets and sheets. The Keating sales tax will start tomorrow on the items I have named. The one area where it will not go ahead is on the building materials, and that is tax what is being blocked today. The government, despite the Prime Minister's promise that he would not be increasing taxes, is going to raise $600 million out of the tax increases on these goods across the board in Australia in The government is going to increase the on wholesale sales tax on wines and will collect $30 million extra from that. It is going to increase-it has increased--company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent and will get $320 million from that. The government is going to increase the excise on light fuel oils and will are raise $100 million from that. The Medicare levy will rise by 0.1 per cent, and the government will collect $230 million from that. The total increase in revenue from these measures in the budget is $1,280 million; an increase that the Prime Minister promised in 1992 that he would not deliver, after saying he would deal honestly with the Australian people. Is it any wonder that people do not trust him on taxation or on any other thing? Is it a wonder that they believe this superannuation package for 50 years hence will never come to fruition? That is supposed to bring back into play the promise broken about tax cuts, but it just does not work. I need to point out to the community and to the House that the new tax that was supposed to apply to the housing industry would have been a disaster for people seeking to build their first home and would have been a disaster for those wanting to put an extension on-those who want to build a granny flat out the back because mum and dad have got a bit old and they want to live as a family. All of that would have cost extra dough. Can you imagine what it would be like? People in my electorate have signed contracts and are now trying to work out with their builder whether they will be up for another $1,000 or $2,000 on the house they have not commenced. Some builders are saying, 'Yes, we're going to pay it,' and others are saying, 'No, we haven't paid it yet, so you'll be right.' That is Regardless of the fact that we are blocking the sales tax on building materials today, and the government has had to yield on it, the Keating wholesale sales tax will increase the taxes on office chairs, hairbrushes, travel rugs, sleeping bags, maps, street directories, gift wrapping and ribbons. Even poor old Fido does not miss out, because the tax on dog blankets is going to go up too. There is hardly a thing that the Australian people touch or deal with that is not going to be affected by this tax increase in the bills we are passing. Only the building materials element has been knocked out. So the tax will be on stationery; videotapes, black and white, prerecorded for advertising and personal use; and cassettes and compact discs. Even the tax on the CDs that kids use is being increased. The tax covers teething rings, nappy washes, sterilisers and baby oil. Even the little kids, the babies of the family, are going to be affected by the horrible side of this Prime Minister. He prbmised that he was not going to attack anybody and then he attacks the babies of the nation by putting a tax increase on nappy washes and the intimate things of every household. He said, 'I am going to increase the taxes in this budget.' We have blocked it and I am proud that we have blocked it. It is time the Australian people really understood the complexities of government and the manipulation by the current leader of the nation. I could go on to list so many things that will increase in price as a result of the government's increase in sales tax. For example, all cleaning materials in the house-the detergents and the buckets-doormats, spare parts for the car and pet foods will go up. Even transport and freight costs will rise. Sports and leisure gear, travel equipment, photography and cling wraps will also rise. I do not know where to stop. Hundreds of thousands of items will increase in price. This bill came about because in the last election campaign the coalition said, 'We believe this ought to be simplified. We ought to get shot of this mess. We want a simpler tax. We are going to wipe out some taxes and bring in a simpler tax.' We are not going to a mess. do that. We have made a commitment. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table, knows that the Leader of the Opposition has said on a number of occasions that we are not going ahead with the goods and services tax. Mrs Moylan-And we keep our commitments.",15
9,Mr CADMAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"That is a good point. We have kept our promises. Honourable members only have to look around Canberra to see whether we keep our promises. Before the last election if we had spoken to Commonwealth car drivers they would have said, 'We believe that the Australian Labor Party would not wreck the Commonwealth car fleet. We know they will stick by us because we are TWU and Labor supporters.' Well, they were dudded in the biggest way! If we spoke to them now they would say, 'We would have been better to trust members of the Liberal Party. We did not like what they said prior to the last election, but they would have honoured their promise, unlike the Australian Labor Party.' Those opposite should talk to the people who want to buy homes. They cannot believe that before the last election the Prime Minister said, 'I will deal with you honestly. I will not increase taxes,' and he then turned around and increased those taxes with this legislation. Let us trace the record of the current Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. He said that there would be no capital gains tax and no tax on superannuation. In case after case he has ducked, weaved and dived and said what was expedient for the moment hoping to draw the attention of the Australian people and then, shortly after, he changed his mind, changed his commitment, thereby breaking his word. We have had 12 years of that. This is the most blatant example of the Prime Minister seeking to deceive the Australian people, but he has not succeeded. He has not deceived us, the Senate, the Australian people or the home buyers of Australia. Fortunately, they are going to be relieved of this impost. Many families in Australia will pay much more because of this budget, because of the Keating sales tax that will come into play tomorrow. All the supermarket items I have mentioned will increase in cost. As I have said, the government is going to collect another $600 million from these taxes. It is going to increase the taxes on a range of items across Australia, including fuels and Medicare. In all, it will collect $1,280 million more than it has collected before. This is the way the Labor Party honours its promise not to increase taxes.",17
10,Mr LATHAM,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I accept the common sense of the government's position in accepting these amendments from the Senate. In so doing, I think it is very important for the House to reflect on the proper role of the Senate on budgetary measures and understand the way in which the Senate is misusing its charter set out in the Australian constitution as defined by the constitutional conventions 100 years ago. I noticed that yesterday the Australian Democrats launched a campaign under the slogan 'Keeping the Senate strong' to try to portray the WA Greens as feral obstructionists and present themselves as the party of responsibility in the Senate. On this matter-,-and on these amendments from the Senate-it is very important for the chamber and the Australian people to know who the feral obstructionists in the Senate really are. It is not just the WA Greens; it is the Democrats as well. On the issue of the extension of the sales tax regime to certain building materials, the Democrats have exposed themselves as more opportunistic and more populist than just about any other party at any other time in the history of this parliament. Every couple of months the Democrats issue a statement to try to prove to the financial writers in Canberra and around the nation that they are not fairies at the bottom of the garden; that they have an economic plan for the country . The most recent instance of this pronouncement by the Democrats and their leader, Senator Kernot, came on 14 December last year. At that time Senator Kernot issued a statement saying that she was keen to encourage private savings and also public savings. She stated: The second action to reduce pressure on interest rates would be to make further use of fiscal policy to slow the economy. This requires accelerating the deficit reduction program to reduce the stimulus provided by the $12 billion deficit. On this measure Senator Kernot has taken the totally populist line that the sales tax extension to building materials should be rejected. By so doing, she is preserving the active incentive within the Australian taxation system for Australian households to put more money into housing consumption than private savings. Senator Kernot has moved in exactly the opposite direction to that which her press release of 14 December last year espoused. She has also made it more difficult for the federal government to add to the public savings pool in Australia, again moving in exactly the opposite direction from that which she set out in her press release. Further, it is most interesting to note that Senator Kernot, on 1 March 1995, issued a statement about how she would deal with the current account problem. She stated: ""We must tackle that at source, by using a tax on imports (a tariff) to reduce demand. would also have the added advantage of reducing the deficit and raising public sector savings. ""By extending our general tariff reduction by just one year we could raise an extra $600 million and directly tackle the current account problem."" Further, Senator Spindler, a spokesperson the Democrats on these economic matters, came out on 4 May and said that the Demonormally crats would support a $3 billion tax on ports. It should be understood that a lot of Australian building materials are imported. So here are the Democrats saying that they will not accept a modest extension of the sales tax regime to building materials just over $200 million of federal revenue, but they will support a new regressive, indirect tax of $3 billion on imports, including importtheir ed building materials. This is opportunism and populism at its very worse. It demonstrates that the Democrats in the other place will only support economic and fiscal measures when they know they will never be impledebates mented. The Democrats know the government never implement a new $3 billion regressive, indirect tax on imports including imported building materials, so they are willing to put it forward to demonstrate some fiscal plan. But, when it comes to a fiscal measure which tries to even out the imbalance on the taxation treatment of various forms of savings in Australia, the Democrats are in there playing to populist tendencies in the electorate; they are thinking that, with an election coming they need to preserve their place and numbers in the Senate. As I mentioned at the outset, it is very useful for the House-and I encourage the opposition to take this on-to consider proper role of the Senate on budgetary ters. I am a great believer that, with the internationalisation of the Australian econinterests. omy, rapid movements in capital and rapid fluctuations in business confidence, it is important and in the national interest for the executive government to run the economy. It is not an unusual or complex proposition that the government should run economic and modest fiscal policy. In that respect, the Senate This should accept its proper role. We are always being lectured by the opposition-and it has been party to this in the program Senate-about the proper conventions and practice of the Australian constitution. In the Australian constitution a hundred years ago, determined by the conventions, the Senate for was given more power on money bills and more power on fiscal measures than would be the case in a Westminster system. imThis was done because the smaller colonies, which were soon to become states, feared that a government may discriminate against them on fiscal measures. Therefore, they wanted some extra powers in the states house to to raise guard against that. Now we have these matters being considered by the Senate-not with regard to impact on the people of the various states of Australia, but solely according to the political agenda of the Australian Democrats, the WA Greens and the Liberal and National parties. It is interesting to read the Senate on these tax measures. Not a single senator raised legitimate concerns about their would impact on the states. The closest we came was when Senator Panizza from Western Australia said he opposed the extension of sales tax to a small range of building materials because he owns a lot of properties in Perth. So more self interest than state interest was expressed by that senator. The only other senator who came close was Senator Ian Macdonald from Queensland who expressed opposition to these on, measures because he owns an old home, a Queenslander type home, in the north of Queensland that requires a lot of renovation, and he did not want to pay the extra cost on the building materials through this sales tax the measure. So, again, the issues raised by matsenators were closer to self-interest and pecuniary interest than any concern for state The Senate on these matters has got well very out of control. The Senate has gone beyond its original charter of a states house that judges matters according to their impact on the various states. The Senate has forgotten all about its role set out in the Australian constitution and confirmed by the conventions 100 years ago. It is absolutely disgraceful that the Liberal and National parties, who come in here and lecture about the need to uphold the proper place and conventions of the Australian constitution, do not recognise the proper of the Senate. They should appreciate when the time comes-as I suppose it will one day in the distant future-for them to form a coalition government they will face inevitable prospect of a hung Senate. coalition government at some time into the next century will have to deal with these problems. It will face the prospect of internationalised economy, the need government to govern, the need to secure business confidence and have sensible fiscal plans, yet being obstructed in the Senate by small, unrepresentative parties that are totally populist and opportunist in their political agenda. I urge the member for Menzies (Mr Aning drews) and the member for Pearce (Mrs consistent Moylan), who are at the table, to take this message back to their shadow cabinet meetknock ings: they should remember the commitment the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave prior to the Senate. the last election-if the coalition had been elected, Labor would have passed the GST through the Senate based on the principle that the government of the day should be allowed to govern. There is no more important task for the national government than to run the economy and to run an effective fiscal policy. The states house should not be allowed to misuse and abuse its role. It should recognise that if the people's house-the House of Representatives-passes a budget measure, according to the will of the people, then Senate should also pass it. Both major parties, the coalition and the Labor Party in this place, should recognise the need to repeat the commitment the Prime Minister the last election. One day those opposite will be trapped by the opportunists and populists just as this government has faced these spoilmeasure, ing and scragging tactics on the 1995-96 budget. I tum to the substance of what the Australian Democrats-the same Democrats who supported a $3 billion new indirect regressive tax on imports-have had to say. The Democrats are rejecting a modest sales tax extension to building materials to raise over $200 million. They are doing this after one of the greatest housing booms in Australian history. role From June 1991 to September 1994, almost that 600,000 new homes were commenced in Australia. In September 1994, the variable mortgage interest rate was at its lowest in 20 the years, at under nine per cent. From March A 1992 to March 1995, Australian household indebtedness on housing rose by 72 per cent from $88 billion out to $152 billion. We have an come off the largest housing boom in the for a history of the Australian economy. The Democrats have argued in the Senateas have opposition senators-that, coming off that large boom, it is inappropriate to impose a new modest extension of the wholesale sales tax regime to building materials. Shame on the coalition, shame on the Democrats and shame on the WA Greens not only for ignorthe economic sense that this measure was with the housing market as we find it in 1995-not only having the indecency to back the proposition-but also for being so improper in misusing the powers of Every time coalition members stand up and say they respect the Australian constitution and the decisions of the constitutional conventions 100 years ago, members on this side of the House should, as should the Australian people, ask them: if they respect the Australian constitution and they respect the intention of the founding fathers, why does the Senate not act as a states house? Why is the Senate trying to get a sniff of executive government the power, trying to get a sniff of a people's house, when that was never intended and goes way beyond its charter and responsibilities and leads to decision making contrary to the gave prior to national interest? Whether members of the House of Representatives agree with this particular tax they should agree with the principle that this House represents the majority will of the Australian people. If that majority expresses itself in a certain fiscal measure and it passes the people's house, it should pass the Senate unless-one problem could arise-the Senate determines that a fiscal measure discriminates against a certain state or group of states. If the states house cannot find a reason according to its proper charter why the measures should be rejected then they should be allowed to pass. I again caution the coalition that one day in the distant future it will find this problem. It should have the common decency to understand what the Prime Minister said before the last election-that the Labor Party would pass the GST. If the· coalition understood the way in which our economy has been internationalised, the rapid movements of capital and rapid fluctuations in business confidence, it would appreciate there is nothing more consistent with the national interest in 1995 than the government being able to govern, run the economy and run fiscal policy. I conclude by reinforcing my distress and disgust at the Senate acting in this fashion and the absolute hypocrisy of the Democrats, Senator Kernot in particular, for appearing in the press this morning claiming that they are the responsible party of the Senate. They are as feral and as obstructionist as the WA Greens and the coalition, the Liberal and National parties. They have no credibility whatsoever. This is a sham built on a sham. The Democrats only ever support economic measures when they know they will never be implemented. They are populist and opportunist to their bootstraps. I express my absolute dissatisfaction. There is no more pathetic sight in Australian politics than Senator Kernot trying to lecture this House, the government and the Australian people with that sanctimonious, holier than thou, patronising look on her face. It is a sickening sight. It is sickening for the national interest. The sooner the coalition wakes up to these things the better.",18
11,Mrs MOYLAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"In addressing the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Customs) Bill, I have to reply to some comments made by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). If the minor parties are using what he calls spoiling and scragging tactics, it is because of his government's lack of integrity, and the government can take full responsibility for it. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) said earlier today that we have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) say in this place that, if this bill does not go through and interest rates go up, it is the fault of everyone else except him. We have also heard the Treasurer (Mr Willis) refute the importance of getting this measure through the Senate and say that it will not have the kind of effect that the Prime Minister has more than alluded to in this place. Tomorrow-Saturday, 1 July-is Mr Keating's billion dollar tax day. The Australian electorate will pay more tax despite all the reassurances before the last election that taxes would not be increased and that the Australian electorate would get tax cuts. Not only have people in the Australian electorate not got their tax cuts but they will have tax increases and will have to pay additional sales tax. So tomorrow we are going to see the wholesale sales tax rise by one percentage point. We are going to see company tax rise. We are going to see an excise on light fuel oils introduced, and we will see the Medicare levy rise. We are certainly getting the whole run of it. I wish to speak today because, at the last election, this government told the Australian people that it would not raise taxes or impose new taxes and that it would give tax cuts to the general Australian electorate. Well, the government has done worse than that. With these measures, it has focused all of its attention on the small business sector. Most of the taxes that are being raised will further damage and impede the growth of small and medium businesses in Australia today. People might wonder how that affects the average person in the street. Let me recount some of the facts about small and medium business in this country today. Ninety-six per cent of all business in this country is small or medium. It provides 47 per cent of the jobs in Australia and contributes 29 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, generating $130 billion. Eighty per cent of small and medium businesses are owned by families, and 30 per cent are owned by women-and the that is a growing statistic. It is these 859,000 small businesses in Australia that are suffering the effects of this government's lack of ability to make the long-term, tough decisions that are required to give a strong foundation and economic This future for this country. That is important small because it means jobs for the children of the average mum and dad, a greater prosperity for statistics. all Australians and a higher standard We are driving business today not to vide jobs for other Australians or to improve their standard of living; we are driving them out of business. We have seen an increase the rate of bankruptcy recently-and that has to worry all Australians. It affects all Australno ians, not just the business community as small sector of our country. The worse of it is that the government introduced taxes damaging to the business sector at a time when it had ample evidence showing that things were not going well. The Prime Minister said to small business, 'This is as good as it ever gets. The conditions are fantastic and, if you can't wear it, you'd better get out and get yourself a PAYE job.' I remind the Prime Minister that more than 800,000 people unemployed in this country today. They are the official figures, and some say that the real figures are excess of that. The Prime Minister should rethink his comment to small business. About the same time as he was making those comments about this being the best it has ever been and this is the best it is ever going to be, the industry groups were doing some surveys. While the government was making the decisions about how it was going to tax Australians and who it was going to tax in this year's budget, was also being given information by magaA zines such as the National Business Bulletin, which was doing a survey on small The heading of one article is entitled 'Small business is doing it tougher in 1995 after years of gains'. They are doing it tougher all areas: their profits, investment and growth are all down. The .government was given this information before the budget was brought down. It was specifically delivered to Prime Minister and the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), but it was totally ignored; When the National Business Bulletin finished collating the survey information, it wrote an editorial about its findings. Part of that editorial states: overview condenses the current concerns of business. It will be interesting to see if the budget echoes those forward looking concerns or whether it introduces policies based on out of touch Let us hope that it is not a case of of living. looking back in anger! proIt certainly is a case of looking back in anger-and small to medium business in this country should be very angry, as should the in broader electorate. They were made promises that have not been kept. They were promised new taxes, no increase in taxes-and tax a cuts, which have not been delivered. They certainly should be angry. Around the same time, a second business survey was done-the Yellow Pages: Small Business Index. It is a very well regarded survey in this country and, at that particular time, it said: Economic conditions are now at their worse level since 1993. During the three months to April 1995, sales, growth, employment, profits and investment we still have have plummeted. Why is that bad news for all of us in this in country? Because small to medium business is the engine that drives this economy. It is the sector which is providing, and has provided, 47 per cent of all the jobs in this country. It affects all of us in a very dramatic way. What did we hear after this . survey came out? We heard that the small business sector had suffered more than any other sector from the impact of this year's budget. The minister for small business was so out of touch that he it sent the publication entitled 1995-96 Budget: synopsis for small business to people in the small to medium business community, who business. are under his portfolio. On 2 June he distributed to the National four Small Business Coalition a synopsis which in relied on information out of the Small Busijobs ness Index published in February 1995. He already had the updated survey showing that things were very bad for small business but he chose to use outdated figures that allowed him to gild the lily, to say the least, in relation to what the position was in Australia for small business and how the budget would affect small business. He obviously was unaware, or perhaps conveniently chose to ignore, that this later edition, published after the release of the budget, stated: Economic conditions are now at their worse level since 1993. During the three months to April 1995, sales, growth, employment, profits and investment have plummeted. The sharp drop was in line with expectations signalled in the February 1995 survey and continues the significant decline in small business growth since mid-1994. This decline in growth has been going on since mid-1994, and this government chose to totally ignore all of those indicators and still bring down a budget which is going to further exacerbate the problem for small to medium business in this country. It is time the Australian people were also told that post-recession to May 1994, while government and big business were decreasing employment opportunities for Australia by 7.2 per cent and 9.5 per cent respectively, it was the small business sector that was growing, developing and improving its efficiencies and economies and was employing Australians. They were increasing employment opportunities by nearly 12 per cent providing over half a million jobs over that period of time. This is the area· in Australia which is critical to our economic well-being. Often, these businesses are family run. As I have said, 80 per cent of small to medium business in this country is owned and operated by families. They· contribute not only to the economic fabric and well-being of the country but also to the social fabrics of the communities in which they so capably operate and participate. The government has not only gone back on its promises to the electorate at large but also brought down further measures in this budget that are extraordinarily damaging to small business-the engine that drives the Australian economy.",21
12,Mr LINDSAY,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (11.05 a.m.)-In closing the debate, I want to put on the record that the comments of the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) in the debate on the sales tax legislation were very erroneous and in line with the deceitful campaign by the opposition in relation to the goods and services tax which it intends to impose on the Australian people. His reference to Comcar was quite mischievous. I say loud and clear that it was the policy of the opposition at the last federal election to abolish Comcar. Only a congenital idiot would have supported its policies in that regard. In so far as integrity and honesty are concerned, I go back once again to the comments of Frank Costigan when he conducted the investigations into the bottom of the harbour schemes. He said that the growth industry in this country was tax avoidance and tax evasion. If you look at a person's records, you will have some idea of what they will do in the future. If there is, as a result of the opposition's mischief in the Senate, an increase in interest rates in this country, we can truthfully say that it is a Howard interest rate rise. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) MODIFICATION (GENERAL) BILL 1995 Bill returned from the Senate with a request for amendments. Ordered that the requested amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's requested amendments No.1 - Schedule 2, page 9, items 1 to 11, omit the items. No.2 - Schedule 2, pages 10 and 11, items 13 to 16, omit the items. Motion (by Mr Lindsay) proposed: That the requested amendments be made.·",23
13,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Menzies) (11.07 a.m.)The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifica:.. tions) Modification (General) Bill is the third bill in a package· of sales tax legislation that has been returned to the House of Representatives from the Senate. The requested amendments referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) indicate, in effect, the rejection by the Senate of this government's attempt to impose a 12 per cent sales tax on a range of building and housing materials such as nuts, bolts, nails, screws, nozzles, taps and vanity units-just about everything that goes into the building of a house apart from the timber on the walls and the tiles on the floor. The reason .the Senate requested these amendments be made is the same reason coalition members in this place said they would vote against these measures and other taxation measures which the government sought to introduce. We voted against them because, prior to the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said to the people of Australia in clear terms that he was. going to introduce no new taxes. The reason the government has capitulated to the view of the Senate in relation to this legislation is that the Senate is holding the government to its promise of not introducing new taxes, particularly taxes which are going to affect the building industry at a time when there is a free-fall in that industry and taxes which will affect ordinary Australians. In the course of the debate a number of statements have been made by members of the government that deserve a reply. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said that the government should run the economy.",23
14,Mr CADMAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Some government; some economy.,24
15,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Some government and some economy, as my colleague says. When this government was in opposition in 1983, did we hear the now Treasurer (Mr Willis) say those same things? Did he, as a member of the Labor Party in opposition, say, 'We'll allow whatever comes from the Liberal National Party coalition to go through the Senate untouched, unmentioned, without amendment, without request'? Of course he did not. In 1983, he was proposing to reject a whole raft of measures in the Senate that had come from the then government. If the member for Werriwa wants to get up in this place and say that the government should run the economy and that everything that goes from here to the Senate ought to go through automatically, then all I can suggest to him is a small lesson in history-because history indicates otherwise. In terms of running the economy, there is one basic underlying value that any government ought to employ and that I would have thought the people of Australia would expect from any government, and that value is integrity. That is what this issue is fundamentally about. It is about the integrity of the government and, in particular, the integrity of the Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister of this country went to the election, he did'notjust say to the people of Australia, 'Read my lips,' as George Bush did in his famous message to the American people, and, 'This is a promise.' He also said, 'There will be no new taxes,' and in relation to other matters, 'This is l-a-w, law,' as he spelt out at the National Press Club. Yet, despite these words, he comes in here and introduces a whole raft of new taxes. In terms of running the economy, the basic issue is: where is the integrity of the government and where is the integrity of the Prime Minister? That is the fundamental issue in terms of running the economy. Mr Bevis-That is not what he said. You check the quote.",24
16,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"The parliamentary secretary at the table says that is not the issue; that is not exactly what he said. I would defy him to go out and argue to any person in this country that it was not the promise of this government not to introduce new taxes. In fact, the whole purport of the campaign was to say, 'We're not going to introduce new taxes. We're going to give you everything that the coalition will give you, and we won't give you a GST.' We were honest with the people of Australia. The reality is that you were not and that you changed these taxes afterwards. That is what we are objecting to and will continue to object to. We are pleased that on this. occasion the Democrats and the Greens m the Senate, along with Senator Harradine, joined with us so that we could maintain that. The simple fact is that governments should be able to run the economy, and nobody disagrees with that. But I would have thought all Australians would believe that governments ought to conduct their affairs with some integrity. The final point I wish to make is that twice in this debate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) made the assertion that after the next election the coalition, if elected, will introduce a GST. In fact, he went further than that. He said that a couple of months after the next election we would introduce a GST. I have a couple of things to say about that. First of all, where is your evidence? This is just a baseless allegation; it is an assertion. That is what you expect. Where is your evidence? Put your evidence on the table. The second point I wish to make is that we do denyMr Lindsay-Answer the question.",24

19,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I give the answer to the parliamentary secretary in clear, unambiguous terms, as did the Liberal and National parties after the last election when they said that Fightback was dead and buried. Like the then Leader of the Opposition said and leaders of the opposition since then have said, we are not introducing a GST. That was the question; there is the answer. If over the next few weeks or months you hear government members running around the country saying that we are going to introduce a GST, it is an allegation which is as baseless as other allegations which you are seeking to make. Mr Lindsay-We've got proof.",25
20,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"This nonsense about having proof is simply a lie. Mr Lindsay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order",25
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will withdraw the remark. The parliamentary secretary will resume his seat.,25
22,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I will withdraw. It is an untruth of massive proportions. It is easy to stand up and say-this is the way in which this government carries on-'We will stand up and say something. It does not matter whether it is true or not. We will simply stand up and say something.' That is what the Prime Minister did prior to the last election'I'll stand up and say whatever I need to say in order to have the people elect me and elect this government. I will make any statement. I will say anything in order to get elected.' Mr Bevis-Where do you want to make expenditure cuts, Kevin? You don't want to worry about that question, do you?",25
23,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"We will give you our policies in good time. I know it piques you that we are acting how an opposition traditionally acts. I know it piques you that we are doing what the Leader of the Labor Party in Great Britain, Mr Blair, says an opposition should do. Even if those opposite did not know that is what he said, we are taking the advice of the great hope of the Labour Party in Great Britain. We are accepting his advice. In good time you will see our policies, just like before the last election you made your policies clear in the election campaign itself, just like the then Prime Minister Mr Hawke brought out his election policies in the 1983 election campaign. That is the reality of the matter. To make this baseless allegation, baseless assertion, when it has been repeated over and over again that the GST is not only dead and buried but rotting in the ground now, is simply what one can expect. It reinforces the point that we, on this side of the House, have been making this morning-that is, you will say anything. You cannot believe anything that is being said by not only the Prime Minister but also other members of the government. You will say anything. You will do anything. You will twist any statement. You will reconstruct any set of words in any way in order to gain some political advantage. Those days are over. Mr Lindsay-I've got it in writing.",25

The reality is: it does not exist at all. This is simply another baseless allegation, baseless assertion, that is being made. The question in relation to this bill is one of integrity of the government and integrity of the Prime Minister. So far as these measures are concerned, there is not much evidence.",26
29,Mr SMYTH,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) has it in writing that the coalition will introduce a GST after the next election, perhaps he should table it and let all Australians know what the coalition is up to. However, he has probably found one of his old Labor Party documents from the mid-80s that said that the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), thought that a GST was the best thing since sliced bread. He has had to eat humble pie because he wanted a GST and he was not allowed to use it by his populist driven government of the day. The real question today about all these sale tax bills is one of integrity and honesty. That is what the Australian people want to hear. The Prime Minister said on Lateline, 'What I'm saying is that taxes will not increase.' That is his promise of November 1992. It is a promise that all government members conveniently forget. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said a minute ago that the coalition should remember what the Prime Minister said before the last election. Perhaps the government should remember what the Prime Minister said, that there will be no tax increases and there will be l-a-w, law, tax cuts. Where are they? What has happened to them? Where is the integrity in government when a government does not keep its promises, when it will say anything and do anything to be re-elected and will not keep the promises it has made to the people? The 12 per cent tax on housing products is a tax on the great Australian dream. It is a tax on every hammer strike and on every nail driven into a building project in every renovation done by home owners. It is a tax on every stroke of the paintbrush. In rejecting it, the Senate has said to the government that it here must keep its promises. There must be honesty, there must be integrity, and the government must do what it has said. The government is quite willing to throw the debate over to us and, as an opposition, we are pleased to lead the debate in raising parliamentary standards of integrity, but it is common practice that oppositions do not release their policies until they are ready. Mr Hawke did not release any policies in. the lead-up to the 1983 election. Where were the promises of the 1993 election? They all came out after the start of the election campaign. Australians are heavily taxed today. The average household of four Australians now pays in excess of $60 a week in indirect taxes. The tax increases that will occur tomorrow on Mr Keating's sales tax day, the KST, will see mammoth windfalls to the government-a government that cannot balance its budgets, a government that ignores its deficit, a government that has driven all Australians into debt and a government that has stolen much of the hope of the average Australian. As a new member of this House, I have been surveying my electorate to find out what they want and to find out whether they are happy with the government's performance. One of the questions I asked was: do you feel that you are better off after 12 years of Labor? I also asked for their voting preference and age group. All voters across all age groups, including ALP voters, said, 'We don't feel one cent better off after 12 years of Labor government.' It is about time the Labor government began to realise that it cannot during election campaigns make promises it cannot keep. What is tomorrow? Tomorrow, 1 July, is a billion-dollar tax day. All wholesale sales tax rates will go up by one percentage point. That alone will raise an extra $600 million for this government. There is a tax on wine. The tax on wine and cider will go up by two percentage. points. That alone will raise $30 million-$30 million worth of cider. It is ridiculous. Company tax rates will go from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. At a time when Australians are struggling to come out of some of the worse recessions we have had, we are going to increase company tax. We are going to tax small business and small business people, who are struggling hard and who are not able to employ fellow Australians. Having worked in small business for the majority of my life, I can say that all small business people are well aware of the hidden taxes that come with our wholesale sales tax system. They are not happy. They are not happy because they will be unable to employ new staff; they will not be able to expand. It goes on. The excise on light fuel oils will raise $100 million. The Medicare levy will raise $230 million tomorrow on Mr Keating's billion:-dollar tax day-the Keating sales tax day. An extra $60 per household per week will be raised in taxes. It really does get back to a question of integrity. These taxes will go up on the everyday goods that Australians need and use. We just saw the Newcastle Knights up in the gallery. They have gone now, but I say good luck to the fell as for tonight. They are going to need it against the Raiders. Tomorrow they will be paying an extra per cent tax on their sporting goods. Footballs and tennis racquets will go up. All sorts of things will go up. It is amazing. Mr Bevis-Tell us about the aggregate tax take on GDP.",26
30,Mr SMYTH,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"No, let us talk about what you have done. Let us talk about the way these things are going up and the way they affect the average Australian. Average Australians are disgusted that we have a $27 billion deficit, they are disgusted that we are not able to pay our way, they are disgusted that we are falling behind Mexico in the world scene and they are disgusted with a government that will not keep its promises. These are the government's promises and it is ashamed of them. The government talks about integrity, but when you start talking about nappy wipes, babies' baths, cleaning sponges and baby bottles going up, you really have to wonder whether it represents real Australians. When you talk about gift wrap and ribbons going up, you have to talk about little kids' birthday parties. You have to wonder whether the government is in touch with real Australians. Let us talk about the bathroom. The government ran this wonderful scare campaign during the 1993 election. It pointed out the 15 per cent GST. It failed to mention the concessions that were made. Here we see that sanitary units are going up and toilet systems are going up. Septic tanks and filter tanks are all going up tomorrow in Mr Keating's billion-dollar tax day. This is it. Tomorrow everything goes up. There are average Australians in the gallery. Are they aware that tomorrow the Prime Minister will take $1 billion out of their pockets? On behalf of the average people of Australia, I say that, if we keep going through these monstrous tax rises, everything will go up. Let us start at the bottom. Let us look at pets. Dog blankets will go up another 12 per cent tomorrow. Stationery will go up; sporting and leisure goods will go up. Business products will go up. Mr Bevis-How much will it go up by?",27
31,Mr SMYTH,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"The tax will go up by one per cent, raising an additional $1 billion for a government that said there would be no tax increases. If those opposite can ignore $1 billion as a broken promise then the integrity of this entire government is at stake. Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak here. As an ordinary Australian, I am grateful to be able to come here on behalf of the people of the electorate of Canberra to say that they are sick of broken promises. They are sick of the billiondollar broken promises of this government and we look forward to the next election. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL development First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Lindsay; leave granted for second reading to be moved forthwith. Second Reading",27
32,Mr LINDSAY,INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (11.27 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Industry Research and Development Act 1986 is the legislative basis for a number of government programs which encourage research and development in industry. The 150 per cent tax concession is the cornerstone of this suite of programs, and it encourages companies to be more internationally competiInterpretation tive by: increasing companies' investment research and development; encouraging better use of Australia's research infrastructure; improving conditions for commercialising new technologies; and developing a greater capacity for the adoption of foreign technology. . In 1987 this program was augmented by the introduction of syndication, which allows or more eligible companies to register jointly for the concession. This development meant that the concession became available projects which were too large or too risky for a single company to undertake. The great strength of the tax concession that it runs on self assessment principles which allows industry to respond to changes in the market as they occur. A company simply invests in the research and developovercome ment it needs to pursue, and claims back per cent of the cost of the eligible activities when it lodges its next tax return. This reduces the after tax cost of research and development to around 50 cents in the dollar. Since the concession was introduced in 1985, business expenditure on research and has doubled in real terms. The 1995 government remains committed to the 150 per cent tax concession as an integral part of building.a nation that is more competitive in the international arena. To help companies and other bodies use the concession effectively, the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 currently requires the Industry Research and Development Board to make guidelines addressing Uve key areas of the tax concession. These guidelines are: adequate Australian content; registered research agencies; finance schemes; commercial government bodies; and research and development activities carried on outside Australia. These guidelines are. disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Act 1901, which means that they must be gazetted and laid before both in houses of parliament within a prescribed period of time. Until this year, guidelines covering the first four of these key areas-adequate Australian content, registered research agencies, finance schemes and commercial government bodies-were gazetted, but not laid before parliament. As a result, the guid-lines lapsed 15 sitting days after the guidelines were made. This was not brought to light until recently, two and as a consequence, the Industry Research and Development Board has been making decisions using these lapsed guidelines in the for those belief that they were valid. This discovery has caused an understandable amount of uncertainty in the business is and research and development communities. In recognition of this, the government has acted quickly by indicating its intention to proceed immediately with legislation to the problem and give a clear signal 150 that this government continues to support innovation in Australian companiesThe amending legislation before you seeks to reinstate ,certainty and continuity for users of the tax concession. The guidelines were well understood within industry and are widely considered fair and effective. This amending legislation retrospectively validates the lapsed guidelines and the decisions made on the basis of these guidelines. This means that the decisions made by the Industry Research and Development Board and accepted by industry on the basis of the lapsed guidelines will have full legal force. The amending legislation also provides that secondary decisions made on the basis of the guidelines, such as actions taken by the Commissioner of Taxation in· response to certificates from the Industry Research and Development Board, are made valid. Let me reassure you that this validity provided by the amending legislation only extends to decisions and actions inasmuch as they relate to' the lapsed guidelines. If some other component of a decision or action renders it invalid, then the amending legislation has no jurisdiction to change that This legislation purely addresses those doubts caused by the failure to lay the guidelines before parliament as required by law. In addition, it does not remove any right of legal action that a person may have as a result of any invalidity. This validation of the lapsed guidelines does not in any way affect the power of parliament to disallow the four sets of guidelines before the Senate at the moment, nor does it inhibit the power of parliament to disallow any guidelines to be tabled in the future. It is now widely recognised that developing an innovative culture which continually creates new areas of competitiveness, enhances efficiency and achieves greater productivity is a key factor in securing Australia's future. The 150 per cent tax concession program is an important way of achieving these goals, and the amending legislation is essential for the continued success of this program. This action by the government has the support of the major financial promoters of syndicated research and development. The amendment bill also incorporates a time extension into the provisions covering the new grant approvals under the Industry Research and Development Act. The sunset clause amendment addresses the fact that the Industry Research and Development Board cannot enter into new grant agreements after 31 December 1995. The 1995-96 budget initiatives for the industry, science and technology portfolio included a commitment that the program would be extended to 30 June 1996 to allow the government sufficient time to respond to the Industry Commission inquiry into research and development. This is an extension of time only and does not represent an increase in the appropriation.' I commend the bill to honourable members.",28
33,Dr KEMP,INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND,"The Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1995, which amends the Industry Research and Development Act 1986, has two purposes. The first is to extend the sunset clause in paragraphs 28(2)(a) and 31(2)(a) from 31 December 1995 to 30 June 1996. The second purpose is to rectify the failure to table in parliament disallow able instruments made under the four sections of the act within 15 days of gazettal. The sunset clause amendment addresses the fact that the Industry Research and Development Board cannot enter into new grant agreements after 31 December 1995. The 1995-96 budget initiatives for the industry, science and technology portfolio included a commitment that the programs would be extended to 30 June 1996 to allow the government sufficient time to respond to the Industry Commission inquiry into research and development. According to the explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill, this is an extension of time only and does not involve any increase in appropriation. The second set of amendments addresses the fact that disallow able instruments relevant to the four key areas of the 150 per cent tax concession on industry research and development were not tabled in parliament as required. Under the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, disallow able instruments must be laid before both houses of parliament within 15 sitting days of gazettal otherwise they cease to exist. This bill attempts to validate both the guidelines and any decisions made on the basis of those guidelines. According to the explanatory memorandum, there will be no financial impact arising from this bill. The four disallow able instruments. in question are: firstly, guidelines to enable eligible companies to ascertain whether proposed research and development activities will be regarded as having adequate Australian content as described in section 39E of the act; secondly, guidelines to enable eligible companies to ascertain whether finance schemes in relation to research and development activities will be taken to be ineligible finance schemes as described in section 39EA of the act; thirdly, criteria to be met by bodies wishing to be registered as registered research agencies as described in section 39F of the act; and, fourthly, guidelines setting out criteria to be met by eligible government bodies wishing to be entered on the register of commercial government bodies as described in section 39HB of the act. The purpose of the guidelines made under these four instruments is to enable companies and the IR&D Board to determine whether particular schemes and activities would involve arrangements that would be likely to result in the board either refusing to register companies under the relevant sections of the act or issuing a certificate to the Commissioner of Taxation under the relevant sections of the act. In my previous capacity as the shadow minister for science, I commented on many occasions on the government's incompetence in science and the manner in which it was alienating scientists. and discouraging industry involvement in research and development. In fact, the government's record. in this area, despite the continuing rhetoric of success, is abysmal. The chronology of events in this matter only serves to highlight the incompetence abounding in the government's ministers for science. They have failed to properly manage their portfolios-the government's record in science and technology has been appalling-and their handling of the portfolio has seen a complete loss of faith in them and their ability to understand science generally and the research and development infrastructure needed in Australia. On 10 March 1993, finance scheme guidelines were sent to the minister's office and recommended for approval. The requirement that the instrument be gazetted was referred to, but no reference was made to tabling of the document. On 12 March 1993, the minister agreed to the recommendation. On 12 March 1993, the department's legal section advised the R&D tax concession section that the guidelines had to be gazetted and tabled. The legal section believed that. it had confirmed that the R&D tax concession section was aware of this. The financial scheme guidelines were gazetted on 24 March 1993 but not tabled. . On 7 May 1993, the Australian Taxation Office advised the tax concession branch that gazettal and laying of the instrument before both houses of parliament were necessary. On 6 October 1993, an information paper was provided to the tax concession committee on the finance scheme guidelines, which had been gazetted more than six months previously. This paper proposed revised guidelines and stated that these should be ready for tabling in the autumn sitting of parliament so that the revised guidelines could take effect from 1 July 1994. There was no mention of gazettal in this note. In December 1993, the tax concession committee released the financial scheme interpretation. In February 1994, the IR&D board delegated all powers of the board to the tax concession committee or to specified officers of the Department of Industry, Science and Technology assisting the committee from time to time to make determinations under these guidelines. On 28 April 1994, officers of the department became aware that the guidelines had not been tabled in parliament and had therefore ceased to exist as far back as 1988. It was noted at that time that the guidelines could be challenged on the ground that they were not valid in accordance with the processes set out under the Acts Interpretation Act. It is apparent at this time that the department was aware that the guidelines had not been tabled as required and could therefore be deemed to be no longer in existence. It was proposed that the four guidelines which we are now considering under this bill be legitimated and that it might be useful to confirm that procedures necessary to give these instruments validity were complied with. At a subsequent meeting of the tax concession committee in May 1994, all powers of the IR&D Board were delegated to the tax concession committee and the finance scheme guidelines were discussed. On 15 June, the IR&D Board met and was advised that decisions had been made in the areas of finance schemes and advance rulings as a result of. discussions on administrative efficiency improvements. On 3 and 4 August 1994, a paper was submitted to the tax concession committee consisting of background information on the committee's concerns about continued participation of private sector tax exempt research organisations in syndicates characterised by guaranteed returns. A letter was sent from the board to the minister setting out these concerns. In mid-August members of the committee referred to the concerns which had been raised in April about the validity of the guidelines and requested confirmation of tabling, procedures for tabling and timing issues. This was in light of a recent decision by the tax concession committee to reject an application, and it was recognised that the concerns voiced in April were all the more relevant as a result of this rejection. On 17 August 1994 the tax concession committee confirmed that there was no record of any instruments relevant to the IR&D Act on the departmental databases. On 18 August the tax concession committee further confirmed that the guidelines had been gazetted but never tabled and, as a result, were no longer effective. An agenda item was drafted for the tax concession committee meeting on 7 September last year .advising the tax concession committee that the four guidelines had to be both published in the gazette and tabled to become legally operative. This agenda item was not submitted to the tax concession committee meeting. Some two weeks later the tax concession committee sought advice on tabling the guidelines and an indication of when this could be done, if the !R&D Board approved this action in December 1993. In October the IR&D Board delegated its power under the IR&D Act 1986 to undertake administrative matters relating to the tax concession cases before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to the tax concession committee. Minutes flew back and forth around the tax concession committee about the appropriate date for tabling and the timing of approval and signature by the !R&D Board, and the tax concession committee was advised of a company claiming negligence on the part of the tax concession committee due to its refusal to approve a finance scheme. Once again, on 10 October, the tax concession committee was advised that failure to table the guidelines meant that they ceased to have. any effect in the same way as if they had been revoked. In fact, under the Acts Interpretation Act they had ceased to exist. In November 1994, the tax concession committee delegated those same powers to specified members of staff assisting the committee, with the exception· of the power to approve statements of reasons requested under the Administrative Appeals Act. The tax concession committee recommended that amended finance scheme guidelines be approved together with an associated proposal form and instructions. On 8 December 1994, the IR&D Board advised an applicant for an advance ruling as to whether or not a proposed finance scheme would satisfy the act and the finance scheme guidelines that its proposed scheme did not comply with the guidelines. This applicant submitted further schemes during December and had correspondence with th- department and was advised on 16 December that the proposed schemes did· not comply with the board's finance scheme guidelines. This applicant lodged EOI appeals and appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Throughout the whole period of 1993 to 1995, more and more applicants sought to utilise the appeals processes of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. On 10 February this year the department, apparently unstoppable, circulated new finance scheme guidelines which included new global eligibility criteria to industry for comment. It is interesting to note that on 27 February offshore R&D guidelines under the act were correctly tabled. The IR&D Board and tax concession committee made decisions under these guidelines from the time they were gazetted until the end of March this year when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decided that it had the jurisdiction to review a decision of the !R&D Board made on 19 December 1994 relating to a submission under the finance scheme guidelines. On 3 April 1995, at a meeting of the tax concession committee to discuss the above matter, it was indicated that the tax concession committee was aware that the guidelines had been gazetted but not tabled. Further discussion ensued, and the tax concession committee advised that it and the board could be· in breach of the Acts Interpretation Act and the IR&D Act. The next day serious concerns about the tax concession committee and the board were expressed. In the culture of silence which seemed to pervade the branch, the fact that the guidelines had not been tabled was common knowledge through the branch but was not discussed, and the integrity of the finance scheme was questioned. A series of discussions took place, including the issuing of a minute concerning the time line for reissue of the guidelines. Those discussions culminated in the decision by the department to advise on 10 April 1995 that, following the decision of the AAT, it had come to light that the finance scheme guidelines had not been tabled in parliament within 15 days of being gazetted and that there was an urgent need to rectify this situation, particularly in light of any potential legal actions that may arise in relation to past decisions of the tax concession committee. On that same day, the minister was advised that a remaking of the guidelines could be effected by submitting the original guidelines to the !R&D board, regazetting them and tabling them. The finance scheme guidelines, adequate Australian content guidelines, register of commercial government bodies guidelines and registered research agencies criteria were endorsed by the board on 12 April 1994. In an attempt to cover its omission, the government tabled all four guidelines in the Senate on 10 May 1995. Its explanation statements omitted to mention that they had not been tabled in 1993 and 1988. The shadow minister for education, science and technology, in a question without notice on 1 June 1995, asked the minister about the validity of the four guidelines. Later that day at an estimates committee hearing, Senator Cook said that he had 'moved swiftly in accordance with the action· recommended to him' and, further, that he was not aware that the Commonwealth had incurred any liability as a result of what he termed this 'administrative glitch'. According to the minister: ... what we have here is an administrative oversight which occurred well before I was appointed as Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. The minister seeks absolution, but it was not his fault anyway, according to his statements. According to the minister, he acted properly and promptly on the advice provided to him and said: There has been no dereliction at all of ministerial responsibility in this matter. It is very important for this chamber and this parliament to realise that what we are dealing with here is not simply an administrative glitch; we are dealing here with a very serious matter. Because this matter concerned the minister in the Senate, I have sought the comments of the Clerk of the Senate on the significance of this failure to table the guidelines. I have received a letter from Mr O'Keeffe, Clerk Assistant (Procedure) in the Senate, which sets out very fully for the members of this House and the parliament the real significance of what has occurred here. I want to read some of this letter into the Hansard: At the outset, it is worth stating the obvious, even if it is somewhat tautological: the power given to the Governor General, ministers or officials to make legislative and quasi-legislative instruments is a power to make law, otherwise exercisable by the Parliament, but here delegated to those subordinates by means of an Act of the Parliament. Seen in this light, the power assumes its proper, ie large and significant, proportions. It is because these delegated powers are so important that for many decades, the Parliament, through the Acts Interpretation Act, has imposed a series of requirements designed to circumscribe the power it has delegated to ensure that the laws made under its authority are promptly published, are not retrospective, are reasonably promptly tabled in each House of the Parliament, are disallowable, cannot be repealed and/or remade while a notice of motion of disallowance subsists and if disallowed, cannot be remade within 6 months without parliamentary permission. The tabling requirement is fundamental. Without tabling, there can be no power of disallowance. Without a power of disallowance, Parliament has . no control over its ""own"" delegates and legislative instruments. The powenvhich Parliament delegates to its agents to exercise on its behalf, becomes a power of its agents to exercise unaccountability, as they choose. The delegated legislative power then becomes, to some extent, equivalent to a discretion. ary or prerogative power. Instead of the parliamentary accountability procedures being an integral of the power to make delegated legislative instruments, the power enlarges in the mind of the delegates to be a power in its own right. Recognition of the constitutional theory behind delegated legislation, and detailed appreciation of the parliamentary control process which is an integral part of the very power itself, is a first requirement of any delegated law-maker. Compliance with these control procedures of tabling and so on, are not mere minutiae of administration to be delegated to the lowest level and forgotten about. They are inherent in the delegated power itself and, legally, the powers evaporate without such compliance. Failures to table do occur. However, when they occur on such a scale and to such a degree as is revealed in the case of the Industry, Research and Development Board, it suggests the possibility that there has been a systemic failure of administration at the very highest levels: a failure at the highest levels, not the lowest, properly to understand the nature, limits and conditions of the powers which Parliament has chosen to confer on the Board (and through it, the portfolio). Such understanding should surely have been the first, not the last requirement and concern of the delegates. As a rule, where officials consider that, like the government of the day, they are in opposition to, or in incommoded by, parliamentary values, standards and processes, and where they assume a right to the enactment of laws and the unencumbered conferral of legislative powers, there can be little prospect that such systemic failures of administration will not occur again. Such failures are, in reality, failures of parliamentary democratic values within the corps of those who execute Parliament's will. That is a very clear statement of the full significance of the failure to table in this regard. It relates to a failure of an understanding of basic democratic principles at the highest levels of the administration in the portfolio. Ultimately, it is the minister's responsibility to ensure that these principles and values of parliamentary government are understood and conveyed to all officials in the clearest possible terms. It is greatly disturbing to those people who value these principles of democratic government that the minister saw fit in the Senate to refer to this matter as an 'administrative glitch'. I am afraid that the use of that phrase reflects the fact that there is not on the other side of this parliament a proper respect for, or even an adequate understanding of, the instipart tutions of government in this country. We know that the Labor Party has been very weak in its understanding and respect for the institutions of parliamentary government. We have seen that in the continual contempt with which the. Prime Minister (Mr Keating) treats this House. Unfortunately, that attitude flows from the very top through the ministry to the senior levels of the administration. So long as officials are under the impression that their superiors-the ministers, representatives of the people, who do not regard these matters as of great importance-we cannot have any assurance that the systemic failure which is evident in this case will not be repeated at future times. It seems to us that the minister is presiding over a department in which, as the assistant clerk in the Senate says, there has been a systemic failure of administration· at the very highest levels to properly understand the nature, limits and conditions of the powers which parliament has conferred on the board. I think it is of great concern that awareness of this breach was common knowledge in the department for some time before the minister was informed. It is proper for us to ask: what action has the minister taken in relation to those officials who knew of this breach and failed to act upon it or to advise the minister-which would have been the appropriate thing to do-as soon as they knew of it? Has the minister taken appropriate action in the department in relation to these officials who have shown this disrespect for the parliamentary institution? In 1994-95, some 2,087 disallowable instruments of delegated legislation were made, some 70 per cent by officials. The question must be asked: how many of the disallowable instruments in use by the Commonwealth are valid? How many have been properly gazetted and tabled? No doubt lights have been burning late into the night as these instruments are checked and rechecked. The integrity of this parliament should be of the highest value. So that all members have access to the advice from the clerk assistant of the Senate, I seek leave to table the letter to me. Leave not granted.",29
34,Dr KEMP,INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND,This debate will be very clear in the Hansard. There is a lack of interest on the part of the government in the procedures and values of this institution. It is not surprisThe ing that the government has refused leave to table this document because the last thing it wants on the public record is an authoritative statement of the values of parliamentary government. Mr Lindsay- Mr O'Keeffe?,34
35,Dr KEMP,INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND,The member could do well to listen to the assistant clerk in the Senate. Mr Leo MCLeay-Only if I want to be totally bored.,34
36,Dr KEMP,INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND,Let us be quite clear about this in Hansard: the Chief Government Whip has just made very derogatory remarks about the assistant clerk in the Senate. Mr Leo MCLeay-I am happy to put it right on the record.,34
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND,"Mr Rocher)If the chief whip continues to behave like that, he can do it outside. That is his last warning.",34
38,Dr KEMP,INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND,"The arrogance and disrespect of the government whip are fully outlined in the Hansard record. I am sure people will make their own conclusions if they need any further support about the government's attitude to the institution of parliament. We know the Prime Minister believes that the members of the Senate are swill. We know there is no regard whatever for the other chamber-ne of the most important legislative chambers in the Western world-under our constitution, which again the Prime Minister clearly does not understand or have any regard to. As this parliament goes into recess, we see again reflected the lack of regard for the institutions of government, the democratic institutions, and the values of this country. I am sure the Australian people will take note of that. We do not oppose this legislation, but we are deeply concerned at the defects in administration at the highest level of the government that its necessity reveals.",34
39,Mr LIND SAY,INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (11.57 a.m.)-in reply-We have just been served a 25-minute series of claptrap from the shadow minister, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), on this matter. fact is-the member knows this very well from the submission by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee-that action has been taken to identify incorrect efficiencies in this area. Mr Michael Jacobs, former Deputy Auditor General, is to conduct an inquiry into the. circumstances surrounding and the causes of the non-tabling of the guidelines. Mr Jacobs is to provide a second report containing recommendations on any measures he considers desirable to address the administrative or other deficiencies he may have identified during his inquiry. The fact is that, as soon as the minister became aware of the deficiencies, immediate action was taken to rectify them, and indeed this legislation is proof of that. In refutation of the shadow minister's opening remarks about this government's science policy, I put on the record that I recall very vividly the policy of the opposition during the time that the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) was shadow minister for science. I understand that at that time it was opposition policy to dramatically alter-in fact abolish-CSIRO. That of course provoked outrage in the scientific community. That was public knowledge at the time. Representations were made to me about this issue. It was only as a response to the public outrage by the scientific community that the opposition reversed its policy. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay) read a third time. LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1995 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendmentClause 6, page 6, at end of clause, add the following subclauses: ""(6) National principles formulated under subsection (1), and revocations or variations principles under subsection (4), are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. ""(7) If there are no national principles in force under this section, paragraph 11(2)(d) is to be read as requiring the Commission to make the recommendations on the same basis as the basis on which the Minister is, under subsection (2) of this section, required to act in formulating national principles (see paragraphs (2)(a) and (b))."".",34
40,Ms CRAWFORD,INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND,"Forde-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development) (12.01 p.m.)-I move: That the amendment be agreed to. This government amendment explicitly identifies the government's intention in relation to consultation with state and local governments on the formulation of national principles and its preparedness to subject these principles to scrutiny. It is designed specifically to address the concern that was expressed by local governments. We wish to allay those concerns. We see ourselves in this role as a responsible and representative government, and we take very seriously our partnership with local government. We therefore propose to amend the bill through the introduction of two new subclauses. These subclauses provide for, firstly, the formulation of national principles by way of a disallowable instrument and, secondly, in the case of the national principles to apply for 1996-97 being disallowed, the elements in clauses 6(2) and 6(3) for which the minister must have regard when formulating national principles will continue to apply. This amendment is minor. Despite the significance of the issues it addresses, it does not in any way alter the intentions or purpose of the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL 1995 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gear; leave granted for second reading to be of national moved forthwith. Second Reading",35
41,Mr GEAR,COMPETITION POLICY REFORM,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the central element of a new national competition policy. It will establish processes and institutions to encourage competition, not just in particular sectors, but across the whole economy. This bill and the associated agreements between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments have the potential to trigger reform initiatives for many years to come. Implementing this policy is the most important single development in micro-economic reform in recent years. Ultimately, the ability of the economy to grow and provide jobs and an improved standard of living depends upon how well the productive potential of the economy is employed and enhanced. As the federal government set out clearly in its white paper on growth and employment, creating the conditions for new job growth is its principal task. The pay-off from this bill for ordinary Australians is very real. It paves the way for cheaper prices, more growth and more jobs. It is an important element of our ambition to reduce unemployment to around five per cent by the end of this decade. These reforms affirm the role of competition policy as an explicit element of the broad range of considerations the federal government brings to policy decisions; complementing social justice objectives delivered through comprehensive social security and community services programs; protection for consumers, employees and the environment through specific laws; industry development through infrastructure investment and business assistance programs; and stable macro-economic policy settings which maximise the rate of sustainable economic growth. The origins of the bill may be traced to 1991 when the Commonwealth and the states and territories agreed to examine a national approach to competition policy. In 1992, the government commissioned the national competition policy review, chaired by Professor Fred Hilmer. The Hilmer report was completed in August 1993. Since then the government has been engaged in extensive consultations with state and territory governments on implementation of the report. The report was discussed by the Council of Australian Governments in February 1994 and August 1994. This culminated in the historic Council of Australian Governments meeting of 11 April 1995, at which the Commonwealth, state and territory governments agreed to implement the new national competition policy. The vision of the Hilmer report was for a national competition policy in which the Commonwealth, states and territories cooperated to ensure that universal and uniformly applied rules of market conduct apply to all market participants regardless of their form of ownership. The Commonwealth has worked hard to realise this vision with the cooperation of the states and territories. Australian business is increasingly operating on a nationally integrated basis, and a more national approach is needed for business regulation. Businesses and consumers will benefit from the uniform protection of consumer and business rights that a national competition policy will provide. The full measure of these benefits can only be achieved with all governments working together to provide consistent and certain competition rules. This bill has been prepared with the benefit of wide ranging consultation with the public since 1992. The Hilmer committee received more than 130 public submissions. In preparing draft legislation in response to the Hilmer report, officers of Commonwealth, state and territory governments, met with a range of business, consumer, union and environmental representatives. A package containing a draft of this bill and draft inter-governmental agreements was released in September 1994 for public comment. The package attracted more than 60 substantive submissions from the public. The broad thrust of the package met with general community approval. As a result of public comments received, various changes were made to the draft bill to tidy up matters of detail and to streamline and increase the flexibility of processes established by these reforms. The package was also amended to better reflect the fact that competition policy occurs in the context of the broader policy concerns of governments and the community. The main elements of the bill take the form of amendments to the Trade Practices Act and the Prices Surveillance Act. The Trade Practices Act will be amended so that, with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia. A new legal regime will be created which facilitates businesses obtaining access to the services of certain essential infrastructure facilities. The Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority will be merged to form the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and a new advisory body, the National Competition Council, will be established. Prices surveillance processes will be streamlined, and their jurisdiction extended to state and territory government businesses. The bill is complemented by three intergovernmental agreements. The first of these agreements, the conduct code agreement, sets out processes for amendments to the competition laws of the Commonwealth, the states and the territories, and for appointments to the commission. The competition principles agreement sets out arrangements for appointments to, and deciding the work program of, the National Competition Council. It also sets out the principles governments will be agreeing to follow in relation to prices oversight, structurterritory al reform of public monopolies, review of· anti-competitive legislation and regulations; access to services provided by means of essential facilities and elimination of net competitive advantages enjoyed by government businesses where they compete with the private sector. By signing the competition principles agreement, governments will be agreeing to processes for further micro-economic reforms. In general, individual governments will be responsible for setting their own timetables and agendas for progressing these reforms. The agreement does not compel specific reforms by governments. It is not about competition for competition's sake. This is reflected in the fact that the agreement provides a consistent requirement for public benefit tests to guide policy decisions. Many such decisions are taken currently by governments without the discipline of public benefit tests, other than through the normal parliamentary processes. In particular the agreement, and indeed the package of reforms in total, does not compel, or even encourage, governments to privatise government business enterprises, nor to abandon or reduce community service obligations. The package, as with the report by the Hilmer committee, is silent on the issue of public versus private. ownership. The agreement sets out certain processes that should be followed where a government business enterprise is to be privatised or exposed to competition for the first time. The decision as to whether, and when, a government business enterprise might be privatised remains the exclusive responsibility of the owning government. As the Commonwealth has illustrated in the telecommunications industry, privatisation and the introduction of competition are entirely separate decisions. It is possible, and in many cases clearly desirable, to introduce competition and realise its economic benefits while retaining public ownership. The competition principles agreement will facilitate a more careful and systematic consideration of the delivery of community service obligations, CSOs, by state and governments where they decide to undertake structural reform of their bUSIness enterprises. It includes no mechanisms or incentives for governments to reduce their commitment to the effective delivery of these CSOs. The Commonwealth already has in place a set of administrative arrangements for the delivery of CSOs by its business enterprises. These are contained in the accountability and ministerial oversight arrangements for Commonwealth government business enterprises. These arrangements provide for CSOs to be explicit and transparent, to be provided at minimum cost and, where provided by government business enterprises through cross-subsidies, to be reflected in the financial targets of those enterprises. These arrangements are already operating effectively in the delivery of CSOs such as those in telecommunications and in postal services. The third agreement, the agreement to implement the national competition policy and related reforms, provides for the provision of financial assistance to the states and territories in return for their continued progress in implementing the new national competition policy and related reforms. Under this agreement, the Commonwealth will tpaintain the real per capita guarantee of the financial assistance grants pool on a rolling three-year basis and also provide general purpose payments to the states and territories. These payments will commence in the 1997-98 financial. year, at $200 million per annum increasing to $600 million per annum by the 2001-02 financial year. The new National Competition Council will be charged with determining whether the states and territories have met the agreed conditions for payments. Taken together, the bill and the three intergovernmental agreements represent a complete response to the recommendations of the Hilmer committee. In many respects the package is simply a statement of common sense. It is not a radical notion that businesses should not be permitted to engage in anticompetitive conduct. It is not a radical notion that consumers generally benefit from greater competition and that, where possible, greater competition should be encouraged. It is not a radical notion that, in reviewing legislation or market structures, due consideration should be given to opportunities to enhance efficiency through competition. But the great step forward made by this package is that it sets out these statements of common sense for all to see; it creates new institutions better able to encourage businesses and governments to act in accordance with these statements of common sense; and the resulting principles will be applied to all Australian businesses regardless of ownership or legal form. The government is very proud of its record on micro-economic reform, which is delivering significant benefits to Australian consumers and businesses. Until now these reforms have largely focused on particular industry sectors such as telecommunications or domestic aviation. The reforms· which result from this package may not be individually as large as some of the earlier initiatives, but taken together they will produce significant gains for the Australian economy. The Industry Commission's analysis of the growth and revenue benefits of Hilmer and related reforms shows that these reforms are overwhelmingly good for the Australian economy and will produce gains in output, consumption and employment. Moreover, these benefits are widely distributed throughout the community, with very few industries projected to lose from the reforms. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth recognises that while the benefits of reform are shared widely throughout the community, any adjustment costs may be borne by much smaller groups. The introduction of competition in previously protected sectors can, for instance, affect the employment conditions of people working in those sectors. The government has developed labour market programs, including training and retraining, to assist the process of adjustment for these people. It is important to understand that this government is not interested in reform or competition for its own sake. The package recognises that economic efficiency is one element of a broader public policy context which also includes social considerations. Explicit recognition is given to these broader elements of the public interest in the bill and in the competition principles agreement. The package gives appropriate recognition not only to competition and efficiency considerations but also to all the other policy objectives which governments must balance in making policy decisions, such as ecologically sustainable development, social welfare and equity considerations, community service obligations and the interests of consumers. The package gives clear recognition to these other objectives, with the clear intent that governments should give full and proper consideration to these matters when they make decisions about economic reform. There has been some concern that implementing a national competition policy will lead to the wholesale dismantling of the public sector. This is a serious misunderstanding of the proposed reforms. For the most part, these reforms are relevant only after governments have taken the threshold policy decision to introduce competition, and then only to 'significant' business activities. Many public sector organisations have both commercial and non-commercial functions, and these reforms are not designed to affect the non-commercial functions undertaken for governments. In sectors such as education, health, welfare, community services and labour market programs where the public sector has, and will continue to have, a dominant role, the relevance of competition policies will be limited to those circumstances where enterprises are engaged in business activity. In most cases where this is an issue at all, this is a small part of their overall role or is ancillary to the provision of core services. For instance, government schools are not normally engaged in business activity. While they may be seen as competing with private schools for students, this is not competition to earn revenue and profits and is therefore not a 'business' activity to which the competitive neutrality principles apply. Similarly, these reforms will not be relevant to public hospitals treating public patients or providing inhouse hospital services, but may be relevant where those hospitals are· treating private patients or operating commercial cleaning services. In these areas a public hospital would be directly competing with private firms. There will always be a legitimate role for the public sector in Australia, but this role is evolving and changing over time. The government does not see these reforms accelerating those changes in the public sector's role, but the competition principles will provide a coherent framework for responding to the implications and consequences of those changes, particularly in the areas of third party access, prices oversight and competitive neutrality. In view of the evolving nature of the public sector, the Commonwealth has established arrangements to provide safeguards for its employees. The treatment of employment conditions in Commonwealth public sector agencies is primarily governed by legislation, including when those agencies undergo changes such as a transfer of ownership. Employees in Commonwealth agencies derive most of their employment conditions from awards and enterprise agreements. Where there is no change of employer-that is, where the agency is incorporated and the sale is by way of sale of shares-awards and enterprise agreements are unaffected by the change. Where there is a change of employer-that is, where the agency's assets are sold-it is usual for awards and enterprise agreements to transmit to the new employer by operation of section 149 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. If there is any doubt as to transmission, it has been the government's practice to consider taking other steps to ensure transmission, such as including appropriate provisions in sale contracts. There may be occasions when some conditions, such as long service leave, are not derived from industrial agreements. In such cases, the government has encouraged the parties to negotiate any changes to these conditions with an objective being to maintain broad equivalence in the overall package of employment conditions. The Commonwealth considers that all governments have a responsibility to have in place appropriate safeguards for their employees. The government does not see this package as a device for reducing the wages and conditions of public sector employees. Erosion of their wages and conditions does not equate with the 'benefits' in the competition principles agreement against which policy changes need to be assessed. The government's vision, as enunciated in Working Nation, is to achieve an economy based on high wages and high productivity. The package provides strong incentives for state and territory governments to participate in the new regime. Participating governments will retain the capacity to exempt specific conduct from the competition laws. They will also have a role in making appointments to the new institutions, in determining the work program of the new National Competition Council and in a range of other matters. Nonparticipating governments will not obtain the benefits of involvement in the new regime. For example, they will not have the power to exempt conduct from the competition laws, although in all jurisdictions it will be possible to obtain administrative authorisation for anticompetitive conduct which on balance is in the public interest. I tum now to examine the main provisions of the bill. Amendments to the Competitive Conduct Rules of the Trade Practices Act (Part IV) Part IV of the Trade Practices Act prohibits various forms of anti-competitive conduct, such as contracts which substantially lessen competition, misuse of market power and mergers and acquisitions which substantially lessen competition. One of the main features of the bill is that it extends the operation of these competitive conduct rules to currently exempt businesses, and facilitates their further extension by state and territory legislation. Limitations on the Commonwealth's constitutional power have meant that unincorporated businesses operating solely in intrastate trade are currently not covered by the competitive conduct rules in the Trade Practices Act. This sector of the economy includes major businesses, such as those operated by some legal firms. This bill is part of a cooperative legislative scheme, involving the Commonwealth and the states and territories, which will apply the competitive conduct rules to these businesses. To achieve coverage of these businesses, the bill creates a form of text to be known as 'the competition code'. The competition code contains the rules set out in part IV of the Trade Practices Act, modified to refer to 'persons' rather than 'corporations'. The text of the competition code is to be made operative by state and territory laws which will apply the code within each jurisdiction. It is envisaged that the state and territory legislation will commence within 12 months of the commencement of this bill. In order to ensure there are no gaps in coverage, there will be overlap between part IV and the competition code. Most businesses will be subject to both. However, it will not be possible to award penalties under both part IV and the competition code in respect of the same conduct. There will only be one enforcement agency, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and all enforcement action will be brought in the Federal Court. The inter-governmental conduct code agreement indicates a commitment to maintain consistency between the prohibitions in part IV and the prohibitions in the competition code. Another major extension of coverage which is achieved by the bill is the removal of 'shield of the Crown' protection from state and territory government businesses. A state or territory government department or authority, which represents the Crown, will now be required to comply with part IV of the Trade Practices Act to the extent that it carries on a business. Certain forms of government activity, such as taxing, licensing and compulsory acquisition of primary products are unlikely ever to be legally construed as 'business'. To avoid any doubt, provisions have been included which expressly indicate that such activities do not amount to business. Similarly, it is not legally possible for an individual entity to carry on business with itself. Provisions have been included which make clear that there is no 'business' activity when two government departments deal with each other, because they are both part of a single legal entity, the Crown. Presently, the Commonwealth, the states and territories can legislate or make regulations which provide for exemptions from the competitive conduct rules of the Trade Practices Act. Under this bill, the potential for such exemptions from the Trade Practices Act will be considerably restricted. The Commonwealth and participating states and territories will only be able to make exemptions by laws which expressly refer to the Trade Practices Act. Existing laws which do not comply with this new requirement will cease to provide exemption after three years. The conduct code agreement requires parties enacting such legislation to inform the commission in writing within 30 days of the legislation being enacted. Where there is an urgent need for exempting legislation, regulations may be passed, but these will only be operative for two years. In addition to these measures, the Commonwealth will remove from the Trade Practices Act the provision which expressly permits regulations exempting particular classes of conduct. An objects clause is to be inserted into the Trade Practices Act, indicating that its purpose is to enhance the welfare of Australians, through the promotion of competition and fair trading practices and provision for consumer protection. Some modifications to the competitive conduct rules are being made, prior to extension of the rules to currently exempt businesses. These will give the act and the commission a greater capacity to deal with modem business practices and minimise the need for separate exempting legislation. The modifications will make it possible for the commission to authorise agreements between competitors to fix the price of goods and to authorise firms to engage in resale price maintenance. The commission will only give such authorisation where it assesses there is a benefit to the public in the arrangements. The prohibition against price discrimination is to be repealed as the provision is largely redundant, and the conduct it is designed to address is adequately covered by other provisions of the act. Prohibitions dealing with the re-supply of goods are to be extended to deal with the re-supply of services. A scheme of notification is to be introduced in respect of conduct known as third line forcing, which includes practices such as selling goods or services on condition that the buyer also buys goods or services from a third party. Under the notification scheme, people proposing to engage in third line forcing may notify the commission of the proposed conduct, and they will gain immunity from legal action in respect of the conduct. The immunity commences a prescribed period after notification and operates unless or until the commission issues a notice to the effect that the detriment of the conduct outweighs any benefits. Access The bill inserts a new part into the Trade Practices Act, to establish a legal regime to facilitate third parties obtaining access to the services of certain essential facilities of national significance. The notion underlying the regime is that access to certain facilities with natural monopoly characteristics, such as electricity grids or gas pipelines, is needed to encourage competition in related markets, such as electricity generation or gas production. Access to such facilities can be achieved if a person seeking access is successful in having the service 'declared' and then negotiates access with the service provider. The new National Competition Council will consider applications for declaration of particular services. It may recommend declaration of a service if it is satisfied the service would promote competition, that it would be uneconomical for anyone to develop another facility to provide the service, that the facility is of national significance, that access would not cause undue risk to health or safety, that access is not already the subject of an effective access regime, and that access would not be against the public interest. The council's recommendation will be considered by the designated minister, who will decide whether or not to declare the service. Where a facility is owned or operated by a state or territory authority and that state or territory is a party to the competition principles agreement, the designated minister will be the responsible state or territory minister. Otherwise, the designated minister will be the responsible Commonwealth minister. Ministers' decisions will be subject to appeal to the Australian Competition Tribunal. Once a service is declared, parties will be free to negotiate their own terms and conditions of access, including through private arbitration. If it is not possible to reach agreement, they can notify the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of a dispute, and the commission can make a determination setting the terms and conditions of access. Private arbitrations can be enforced using the new access regime if, subject to a public interest test, they are registered by the commission. Determinations by the commission may be appealed to the tribunal. As an alternative to this process, the owner or operator of a facility can offer· an undertaking to the commission about the terms and conditions on which it will provide access to third parties. If the commission accepts such an undertaking, the services provided by the facility cannot be declared by the council. This provides a means by which an owner or operator can obtain certainty about access arrangements, before a third party seeks access. Similarly, this process could also be used to formalise access arrangements in industry codes of practice that are being developed as part of the reform process in the electricity and gas industries. that access to Prices Oversight The existing functions of the Prices Surveillance Authority will be taken over by the Australian Competition and Consumer CommISSIOn, and to the eXIstmg functions of prices surveillance and price inquiries will be added price monitoring. Under prices surveillance, the price of a declared product will not be permitted to be increased above its endorsed price or its highest price in the previous 12 months, without notification to the commission. Price inquiries involve studies of limited duration of matters relating to prices for the supply of particular goods or services, and result in reports to the minister. Under prices monitoring, the minister may request ongoing monitoring of prices, costs and profits in any industry or business. It is expected that price monitoring will be less intrusive and involve less administrative burden for businesses than prices surveillance. Surveillance will continue to be appropriate for firms with substantial market power in substantial markets, where there is strong reason to believe firms will use their market power to increase prices. Price monitoring may be appropriate where there is concern about the effectiveness of competition, a history of price problems or community concern about price levels or movements, or where industries have been recently reformed or deregulated. Where price monitoring fails to resolve unacceptable pricing practices or uncovers structural problems in the market, firms may be declared for prices surveillance. In keeping with the aim of achieving a truly national competition policy, the Prices Surveillance Act 1983 will be amended to permit, in certain circumstances, price oversight of state and territory government businesses. Prices surveillance will be possible where the state or territory concerned has agreed or where the National Competition Council has, on the request of an Australian government, recommended declaration of the authority and the Commonwealth minister has consulted the appropriate minister of the state or territory concerned. The council can not recommend declaration if the government business is already subject to effective prices oversight. Price monitoring of state or territory businesses will only be permitted with the agreement of the state or territory concerned. Institutions The new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be formed by merging the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority. The Commission will be responsible for enforcement of the competition and consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act and the provisions of the Competition Code. It will also make determinations under the new access regime, and be responsible for prices surveillance, inquiries and monitoring under the Prices Surveillance Act. The National Competition Council will be an entirely new body, with a council president and up to four other councillors, and around 20 staff. It will make recommendations about access declarations and prices oversight of state or territory government businesses. It may also conduct, or provide assistance with, reviews under the competition principles agreement. The reviews it undertakes will be in accordance with a work program determined by participating governments. The Trade Practices Tribunal will be renamed as the Australian Competition Tribunal. It will retain its current responsibilities, including appeals from authorisation decisions of the commission, and it will assume new responsibilities for appeals from decisions in access matters. Timing It is anticipated that amendments to the competitive conduct rules will commence in July 1995, and that state application laws will be operative within a further 12 months. The new institutional arrangements, the access regime and amendments to the Prices Surveillance Act will commence in the second half of 1995. Financial Impact Statement The bill will result in a substantial increase in the workload of the commission and, possibly, the tribunal. The competitive conduct rules will extend to areas of the economy now excluded, both by virtue of the amendments directly made in the bill and pursuant to the conferral of functions by state and territory laws which the bill facilitates. The commission and the tribunal will also have important new functions under the access regime. The commission will therefore require additional resources to those currently provided to the Trade Practices Commission and Prices Surveillance Authority. The National Competition Council will require resources for up to five councillors and around 20 staff. The Commonwealth will be funding both the commission and the council. Conclusion This bill ushers in a new era in national competition policy. The new integrated and complete approach to national competition policy, which balances economic efficiency and broader elements of the public interest, will give Australia one of the most sophisticated competition policies in the world. It will help to dismantle private and regulatory barriers to competition, and to promote competition across the economy. It will provide the domestic policy arrangements we need to realise the opportunities arising from our external trade policies and the dynamic developments in the international economy. The reward will be an economy that provides more opportunities to satisfy the aspirations of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House. For the information of honourable members, I table three intergovernmental agreements which were executed at the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 11 April 1995: the conduct code agreement, the competition principles agreement and the agreement to implement the national competition policy and related reforms. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. NA (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 1995 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.

Motion (by Mr Gear) agreed to: That Senate amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 be agreed to.",35
42,Mr GEAR,TAXPAYERS,"I move: That Senate amendments Nos 4 to 6 be disagreed to. The Senate has amended this bill to remove the provisions on sales tax refunds. This provision was attempting to ensure that sales tax payers seeking refunds of tax are required to use the provisions provided in the sales tax legislation for that purpose. The provisions in the sales tax legislation have two main requirements for refunds to be paid. The first is that the taxpayer-that is, the wholesalermust pass the benefit on to the retailer. The second is that refunds can only be claimed back three years. That is the same requirement as is placed on the commissioner. These are reasonable requirements. They simply try to avoid situations where a wholesaler gets a payout from the public pursethat is, from taxpayers generally-with no requirement to pass this benefit on even though the original tax payments were passed on in the prices charged by the wholesaler. The Senate amendment will allow wholesalers to make common law challenges seeking sales tax refunds even though they have not ultimately borne the tax. This is an appalling situation and surely contrary to what any reasonable person would consider is an appropriate use of taxpayers' money. Potentially up to a couple of hundred million dollars are at stake here-money that could go as a free kick to large wholesalers who simply have not borne the burden of the tax in the first phlce . .The government will very reluctantly accept the Senate's amendment at this stage, but will consider its position and consider bringing this measure back next session in the hope that wiser heads prevail. On the small company tax threshold, the to pay government understands the opposition will not be pressing this amendment at this stage, given that the Senate Economics References Committee has just this week handed down its report on the taxation of small business. The government will be considering the recommendations of that report and responding to them. The government thanks the opposition for taking a reasonable position on this issue and, as I said, will be giving consideration to the recommendations of the Senate committee report in a considered manner, rather than having the parliament give rushed consideration to a matter which requires much more careful consideration. It is estimated that the Senate amendment to increase the threshold for small company tax payers from $8,000 to $10,000 would cost revenue up to $20 million in 1995-96.",44
43,Mr ANDREWS,TAXPAYERS,"I note the remarks of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in relation to two of these matters; namely, the proposed change in company thresholds and also the claims for sales tax refund and the common law claims that may be made under that. I also note that the government will not at this stage be pressing those matters. I will not say anything in relation to that matter. I noted that Senator Cook indicated in the Senate that the matter of company thresholds-namely, the improving of tax treatment of small business-had been referred to the Senate Economics References Committee for inquiry and that the government is committed to responding to that report. In those circumstances, as the Assistant Treasurer indicated, we will look forward to the government's response to that report. These amendments also relate to the proposed change in provisional tax treatment. This legislation proposes that the provisional tax rate be set at eight per cent. We have sought previously, both in this place and elsewhere, to have the provisional tax uplift factor set at six per cent rather than eight per cent, and have moved amendments to do that. In doing so we were acting on our commitment to small business and to self-funded retirees. About 800,000 small businesses and investors pay provisional tax in Australia and they, of course, are the ones who are most hit by this budget measure. The coalition believes that the uplift factor should be set at a realistic level which is consistent with expected rates of income growth and inflation. For example, headline inflation for the year to March was 3.9 per cent. Why then does the government assume, through this legislation, that an average income for a provisional tax payer will rise by eight per cent? That is more than double what the headline rate of inflation was until March of this year. The government has refused to nominate factors-other than the inflation rate-which have been taken into account in setting this uplift rate at eight per cent. At the end of the day, taxpayers pay taxes assessed on assessable income. If provisional tax payers' incomes do not rise by eight per cent, they can apply for a variation. This is an additional administrative burden and carries with it some risk. If the provisional tax payers' estimate is within 15 per cent of the amount, they can be liable for additional tax. Alternatively, they can pay it and claim a credIt when they file their end of year taxation return. But in claiming a credit when the tax return is filed gives the tax office the benefit of having the tax in the meantime. The tax paid eventually is evened out, but the cash flow advantage under this flows to the tax office while the cash flow penalty goes to the taxpayer. If we look at the submissions that were made on this when the matter came before the Senate Economics Reference Committee, we see that many groups gave compelling evidence for the uplift factor to be examined and reduced. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants gave evidence that it is hard for its members and advisers to tell small businesses that the rationale behind an eight per cent increase is an assumption of an eight per cent increase in their income. Everybody would be happy with an eight per cent increase in their income, but the fact is that most do not find and will not find this to be a reality. The society gave evidence that if there is an uplift factor it should be in the order of the current level of inflation. As I indicated earlier, the headline rate of inflation was 3.9 per cent to the March quarter. The Taxation Institute of Australia gave more evidence to the same effect. The Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Australia said that the low inflationary environment of recent times and the determination of the monetary authorities to maintain inflation below three per cent has made a mockery of the federal government's refusal to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor. We say to the Assistant Treasurer and to the government: if you were being realistic and not simply greedy about the amount of revenue which you can bring in-if only for a period during the tax year-and if you were basing the uplift tax factor on the real rates of inflation out there in the community, you would not be basing it at eight per cent as you propose in this legislation but would have it closer to the inflation rate of 3.9 per cent to March. We have moved amendments to bring the provisional tax uplift factor back to six per not cent, which is a much more realistic leveland even that allows for some area of flexibility . We regard the government's proposed eight per cent as being greedy. It is simply ripping off small business and making it increasingly difficult for small business in this country. It is ripping off those who rely upon their own self-funded investments to maintain their retirement incomes and is unwarranted on the basis of the underlying economic circumstances of this country. Because of the way in which this particular measure has been drafted, the reality is that, if we do not support it here, it will go back to 10 per cent. Ten per cent is obviously worse than eight per cent. We would certainly support eight per cent rather than the current 10 per cent. If the government were being realistic and not greedy it would set the provisional tax rate uplift factor at six per cent, which is a realistic level. If it is concerned about small business and the people living off their own retirement incomes, then it would not be ripping them off an extra two per cent under these .provisional uplift factors. We say, again, that the provisional tax rate uplift factor ought to be six per cent but, because of the way in which the measure has been drafted, eight per cent is better than 10 per cent. We will therefore support eight per cent-but reluctantly, because we believe it ought to be lower. Question resolved in the affirmative. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Gear) agreed to: That Mr Sawford, Mr Griffiths and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendments Nos 4 to 6 of the Senate.",44
44,Mr GEAR,TAXPAYERS,"On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6 of the Senate, I bring up such reasons, which have been circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsAmendment No.4 This would reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from 8 % to 6% Treasury estimates are that provisional incomes are likely to grow by at least 8% in 1995-96, and the House therefore considers 8% to be the appropriate uplift factor. Amendment No. 5 This would change the small company threshold from $8,000 to $10,000. The House considers that the lower threshold is appropriate as it matches the threshold at which provisional taxpayers must make quarterly payments. The House will consider the recommendations of the Senate Committee report on the tax treatment of small business before making any adjustments to this threshold. Amendment No. 6 This is an amendment consequential to amendment No.5, and is therefore not accepted by the House. Motion (by Mr Gear) agreed to: That the committee's reasons be adopted. NA BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed.",46
45,Mr COSTELLO,COMPETITION POLICY REFORM,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) notes that the imperative of competition policy reform has assumed even greater priority, in light of Australia's disastrous current account deficit situation, with the May deficit of $2.9b. being the highest on record; (2) calls on the Prime Minister to provide today an outline of additional measures to enhance Australia's competitiveness in response to the record May current account deficit; and (3) although welcoming State and Commonwealth co-operation to enhance competition in Australia, notes that the Bill fails to deal with some areas requiring enhanced competition and deliberately omits. any application of competition rules to the labour market, an area requiring substantial reform and improvement in Australia"". On this, the last day of the financial year, 30 June 1995, Australia has posted its worse deficit in Australian history. The deficit for the month of May, which was released at 11.30 this morning, was $2,900 million for one month-$2,900 million of deficit for one month. If we disaggregate those figures, Australia in the month of May, it has been announced at 11.30 this morning, went backwards in its deficit at $94 million a day, or $4 million an hour. If this House sits in debate for one hour ::>n the Competition Policy Reform Bill 19Y5, which is before it, Australia's trading deficit will have gone backwards by $4 million. Not only was this the worse current account deficit in the history of Australia but, further, it was the worse current account deficit in the history of Australia by nearly $500 million. What we are seeing now is not just Australia being run over by $2 billion deficits; we are seeing Australia being run over by a convoy of $2 billion deficits. We have seen Australia in 10 of the last 11 months nm over by a convoy of $2 billion deficits. Today, on behalf of the coalition and on behalf of the opposition, I feel a cold anger for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of this country. I feel a cold anger that he has run our country into deficit in the way that he has. I feel a cold anger that, after 12 years, it is not just a case of it not getting better, it is a case of it considerably getting worseconsiderably getting worse in relation to his economic management, considerably get ceterating worse for our fellow Australians, considerably getting worse in relation to the currency, considerably getting worse in relation to interest rates, and considerably getting worse in relation to the debts that this Prime Minister is hanging around the necks of future Australians. I stand up here today on behalf of future generations of Australians and I protest at the policy of this Prime Minister to hock them into debt in the way that he has done. Let 30 June 1995-the end of the financial year, the end of this year's business and the end of this year's fiscal Commonwealth accounts-say one thing. Let it etch into the tombstone of this Prime Minister: the worse current account deficit on record from the worse Prime Minister on record. This, the worse Prime Minister on record, is somebody who was parading himself decades ago as the world's greatest Treasurer. I tell honourable members, he is the world's worse Prime Minister. He is the person who has produced, in the whole history of Australia, the worse trading account balance we have ever had. We had the news about a week or two ago-the shameful, I believe, humiliating news-that Australia's current account deficit is worse than Mexico's. Out of a table of 25 industrialised nations, Australia ran 25th. I say to the Prime Minister: is that as good as it ever gets? Is that as good as you can ever do? Is that the kind of future you hold out for our fellow country men and women-25th out of 25, a current account deficit worse than Mexico's? If we thought the news was bad when it turned out that our current account deficit was worse than Mexico's, the news today is even worse: after posting that result, we have sunk even further. In the 1960s and before, Australians believed, with reason, that we had one of the best countries in the world. It was the aspiration of every Australian to share in what was a rich continent and to share in what was a rich way of life. Today, after a decade of the Keating government, they share in the worse deficits in the industrialised world. That is how much things have turned. Members of the government should not come in here and tell us that they were expecting a disaster and that they have met their forecasts. They should not come in here and talk about how it was that they achieved their forecasts. They should not come in here and say everything is going according to plan because everything is not going. according to plan. The Prime Minister should be in here today. Why is he not in here? Why is he not apologising to the Australian people? Why does he not come down to the chamber? If we can have a debate in this parliament on the republic, why can't we have a debate on the bananas? Why does the Prime Minister not come into this House, which is the forum of the Australian people, and explain how badly he has failed? The Prime Minister ought to begin his speech with an apology. Firstly, he should say, 'I, Paul Keating, apologise to the Australian people for running the worse deficits in Australian history.' Secondly, he should concede that his time as Prime Minister has been an absolute failure. Thirdly, he should concede that he will have to change all of his economic policies. Fourthly, he should say we will have a new industrial relations system in this country. Fifthly, he should say that he will introduce a new era of competitiveness for the ports, the roads, the wharves and rail. Then he should say that he and his government will start building savings in this country and that they will not tax the Australian people in the way they have been with the highest taxes in the world in relation to . savings. Then he should say that he failed in relation to the budget. Let us look at some of the consequences of today's current account deficit--consequences that are already becoming apparent. One example is the Australian dollar. This year the Australian dollar has fallen against every major currency in the world. In response to today's figures, the Australian dollar. has fallen even further. If we look at the value of the dollar at the beginning of the year, we see that it has fallen against the US dollar by 7.4 per cent; against the UK pound by 9.6 per cent; against the Korean won by 10.6 per cent; against the New Zealand dollar by 11 per cent; against the German deutschmark by 17.3 per cent; and against the yen by 22.8 per cent. A nation's currency is a mark of how its economy is perceived in international markets. In international markets the mark that has been given to our currency and to this Prime Minister's economic management is a fail-an absolute fail. We saw on this morning's 11.30 news that the Australian dollar had fallen by up to half a cent in the time that had elapsed since the figures came through. The National Australia Bank announced today that it has lifted interest rates for business borrowers. I refer to all of the talk we heard three weeks ago, when the Prime Minister was in his pre-election mode, about how interest rates would fall or about how interest rates are falling. In the light of these sorts of figures there will always be pressure on interest rates, on home buyers, on businesses, on those who have credit card bills, on those who are trying to pay off their cars and their mortgages and on the families of Australia who are trying to educate their children. Let there be no doubt who is placing that pressure on them: Paul Keating. It is Paul Keating who has had his hands on all the levers for 12 years. It is Paul Keating who has been running this economic policy. Let there be no doubt who is gUilty of failureit is Paul Keating. If he cannot come into the parliament of Australia on the day we post our worse deficit ever and if he cannot explain to the Australian people his failure, leaves but· one conclusion: he does not have the honesty to face the Australian people and he no longer has the credibility to continue in office. There is only one thing that will get the economic change in Australia that we need: a new government under John Howard's leadership at the next election. If we cannot have that election earlier, the government ought to come into this parliament and acknowledge its failure and start changing its policies now. Every month it delays is another month the situation gets worse. How long do we have to put up with this? How long do we have to watch this· convoy of trucks run over Australia month after month? How long do we have to hear the Treasurer (Mr Willis) put on his Life of Brian-'always look on the bright side'-act? How often do we have to hear these excuses that keep pouring out of the mouths of the government ministers and out of its even more inane backbenchers? How long do we have to put up with that? How long is it going to be before we start dealing with our problems and making. things better, rather than watching them get worse? How long must the Australian people watch this humiliating performance in world and economic terms? The recent OECD forecasts-and these ought to be etched into the minds of every Australian-show that Australia now has a current account worse than Mexico. The problem is not just that we came last, but that we came last by such a long shot. Australia's forecast current account deficit of six per cent in 1995 was the highest in the OECD, and the second highest was 2.7 per cent-less than half that of ours. We had a deficit of six per cent of GDP, compared with Mexico's 1.5 per cent. Our current account deficit was four times worse than Mexico's. Let me make this point: Mexico's current account last year was worse than ours. Last year, we were forecast to have a current account deficit of 4.6 per cent, while Mexico was forecast to have a current account deficit of 7.8 per cent. What happened? What made that turnaround in Mexico? The answer is that it was it the warning that was indelibly etched into the OECD report. It warned that negative or adverse investor sentiment can change things. What happened in Mexico at the end of 1994 is that investor sentiment turned against that country. When investor sentiment turned against Mexico, its currency collapsed. Its interest rates went to 50 per cent. It went into a severe recession and it fixed its current account problem, but at what cost? It was a 50 per cent interest rate, a severe recession and a bailout package from the United States. Do we want to see that happen in Australia? Of course we do not. The message from the OECD was, 'You either fix these things yourself, or you run risk of losing confidence; if that happens, others· will fix it for you. If others fix it you, the pain that is inflicted on your own citizens is enormous and horrendous.' What does the government say in light of this? 'Yes. We will fix it'? 'Yes. We are in parliament acknowledging our mistakes'? 'Yes. We don't want to run that sentiment amongst international investors'? No. We hear nothing-not a word of explanation, not an appearance in the parliaseizure ment, not a turning of policy and not apology to the Australian people. Government members show all the hallmarks of a group of people who have been closeted in their ministerial offices, closeted in their ministerial cars and closeted away from the people of Australia; as a result, have lost all sight of why they are here. They have lost all sight of building for the future. They have lost all interest in anybody themselves. The attitude of government members is, 'As long as we are on those benches and in our ministerial cars, who cares?' That is what you are saying-'Who cares?' As long as you get the opportunity to aggrandise yourselves with titles such as 'parliamentary secretary' or 'minister', you are happy-that relevant. is all you want. The Australian people are asking more. The Australian people are asking for a government that cares; the Australian people are asking for a government that is concerned about the future. The Australian people are asking how it is that after twelve years government we are in our third fully-fledged current account deficit? How is it that things are now worse than they were when Minister was warning about the banana republic? The reality is that things are worse than when the Prime Minister was warning about the banana republic. Will he go on the John Laws program and renew his warning? He has been working on his republic-what about the bananas? Why will he not be out there explaining to the Australian people how he let things get so bad? One of the most pathetic arguments that the government is parroting-the most pathetic argument in relation to this current account the deficit crisis that could be imagined-is that it is not their fault. Guess who is at fault? It for is our fault-and we have been in opposition for 12 years. I suppose it is our fault for being in opposition, because if we had been in government it would not have occurred, but the if you want to make the argument on any other basis whatsoever, it is supposed to be the risk of losing all our fault. Here he is, the Prime Minister. He has his hands on all of the levers, there has been a in the machine, and who is at fault? an It is the guys who have been over there watching. It has nothing to do with his maintaining the machine or greasing the oils or pulling the levers. He says, 'Do not ask me who is responsible. It is all the opposition's fault.' The latest argument is that because the they opposition has defeated $215 million of new taxes in relation to building materials-$215 million to be collected over twelve months, but 365 days-it is all our fault.",46
46,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMPETITION POLICY REFORM,"I rise on a point of order. My point of order is that we are debating the Competition Policy Reform Bill. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has not even mentioned the bill and has said nothing about the bill. Under standing order 145, he is not",49
47,Mr SPEAKER,COMPETITION POLICY REFORM,The parliamentary secrefor much tary will resume his seat.,49
48,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMPETITION POLICY REFORM,It is not relevant.,49
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMPETITION POLICY REFORM,Mr Vaile)Resume your seat. The parliamentary secretary was not in the chamber when the Deputy of Leader of the Opposition moved an amendment to the bill which has broadened the debate. He is in order. The Deputy Leader of the Prime the Opposition will continue.,49
50,Unknown,COMPETITION POLICY REFORM,Government members interjecting,49
51,Mr COSTELLO,COMPETITION POLICY REFORM,"I have got a piece of advice for the parliamentary secretary. Before you take a point of order, always read the motion that is before the House. It generally helps and you would not embarrass yourself in the way that you just have: We find that the government is very sensitive about debating these matters-so sensitive that today it has abandoned question time. I point out to those people who are in the gallery that normally when the parliament sits, the Prime Minister would come in here and he would be asked questions. But there is no question time today, it is another one of the rostered days off. We have a current account crisis-and a rostered day off from a part-time Prime Minister who could not care less. That is the reality. If the government wanted a real debate, we would bring it on as a matter of public importance in relation to these matters, but we are not allowed to edly discuss matters of public importance in· the parliament today. The Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Mr Reith) has written to the Deputy PrIme Minister and Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), asking if we could have a special debate in relation to the current account crisis-but we are not allowed to about that either-and if the government interests wants to talk about competitiveness, this bill is a classic example of how it has failed. Here we have a bill to promote competition, yet we find all these sectors that have been cordoned off from the competition rules. there anything in this bill about shipping conferences? It might be thought that on a day when our exports have fallen, ment would be interested in promoting cheaper shipping. It might be thought that there would be something in a competition bill about shipping conferences, but they are not allowed to be touched, 'Do not touch them. There are people in the shipping conferences who are our friends. You are not allowed to touch them.' The member for Wills (Mr Cleary) would know all about this. In football certain people who cannot be touched, because the umpire will always give them a kick. The shipping conferences cannot be touched, because if you do, it is a free kick. It is always a free kick to the maritime unions and those others who are getting the protecinvented tion from the umpire, which is this government. What about industrial relations? Do we see anything in this about industrial relations? No, you are not allowed to touch the unions. You are not allowed to touch the industrial relations system. You can have competition in relation to local government, you can have competition in relation to government business enterprises, you can have competition in relation to corporations, but do not touch those unions. You are not allowed to touch them. You cannot have a competitive labour market because that does not suit the vested interests that the Labor Party represents. Let it be known that the Labor Party is the party of vested privilege. It is here unashamto look after the vested privileges that it represents. The one consuming interest of its policy is to look after vested interests. You just know that whenever those interests comes up that members of the Labor Party are never going to touch them. No, you cannot touch them. You have to make sure that you are talk always the party of privilege and vested and this bill absolutely confirms it. We used to have provisions in the Trade Practices Act, which this bill is starting to amend, which said that you could not engage in secondary boycotts to prevent the supply of goods and services. What happened to them? Is They had to be taken out because the vested interests that you represent demanded it. That was the reality. Why are there no such provithe governsions in this bill? If you look at the Hilmer report on which this bill is supposedly founded, Hilmer recommended that the provisions go back in. However, we have a government that took all of the Hilmer reforms up to the point where the vested interests and the special privileges that they represent were to be affected. As a consequence, this is not genuine competition. This is good as far as it goes but it does not there are go nearly far enough. We have made it absolutely clear that we free support enhanced competition. In fact, we released a competition policy before the last election, the first competition policy ever released by a political party in Australia. We the word. We even invented all of the recommendations that Hilmer made in relation to rolling the PSA into the TPC and calling it a competition commission. Professor Hilmer would have been quite assisted by our policy. If it takes Professor Hilmer to urge our policy on you, and for you to accept it, so much the better. Perhaps we will ask Professor Hilmer to urge our industrial relations policy on you too. I have a better idea. What about getting Professor Hilmer to report on current account deficits. That might really get this government to change its policy. What about getting Hilmer to report on the way in which you are driving the Australian currency down. Let me make this point absolutely clear. To the extent that this government drives down the Australian currency it impoverishes every Australian. Is that right? Of course it is right. Ten years ago Australians went off to Singapore to buy bargains because the Aussie dollar bought so much in Singapore. But now that our currency is approaching parity we have Singaporeans coming to Australia to buy bargains because in comparative economic terms Australia's position has declined whilst Singapore's position has gone up. Look across the Tasman where you will see that the value of the Kiwi dollar is approaching that of the Aussie dollar. You will see the New Zealand economy closing its current account deficit and delivering budget surpluses. Despite this you are stuck in this time warp when the international evidence is clear as to what is happening in relation to the Australian currency. We are getting to a situation where Australians who travel overseas no longer feel that they are rich people in the world, as they used to, they feel now that their position has been marginalised, which is the case. If you want to look at the effect on wages, the effect is all too clear to see. A building worker in Los Angeles earns more than a building worker in Sydney. Let the parliamentary record show this. If you are a bus driver in Taipei you earn more than a bus driver in Sydney. That is the reality, that is the international comparison produced by the Union Bank of Switzerland. Is this government proud of the fact that it has driven down real wages? Is it proud of the fact that real wages are lower now than when it came to office? Let me make it absolutely clear: we want to see Australians lifting their earnings. You are the people who want to depress them. Let me make this absolutely clear: we are the people who want a strong Australia. We want a strong currency. We want Australians sharing it. You are the people who get up in parliament and tell us what a great thing it is that you have depressed wages. What does the Labor Party stand for? Depressed real wages and selling off Commonwealth banks. That is what it has come to. And let us make it absolutely clear why the Labor Party is selling off the Commonwealth Bank. Does the parliamentary secretary really believe that selling off the Commonwealth Bank is in the interests of private enterprises? Is that why it is being done? I think the parliamentary secretary is worried about government-owned enterprises. He thinks they should be in the private sector. He thinks there should be efficiencies in the private sector. That is why he is a great supporter of the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. What about Qantas? This is the government that wants to sell off Qantas as well-and not just sell it off, but lift the foreign ownership to 49 per cent. Are Australians pleased that so many of our assets go into foreign ownership? Let me tell you why it happens. It happens because we have such a savings gap in this country that we need foreign equity and foreign loans to continue. That is why it happens. That is why it has been forced on us and if people out there are concerned about assets being flogged off overseas, it is a consequence of government policy. The Labor Party is doing this in relation to Qantas not because its members suddenly sat down and said it was necessary to have 49 per cent of Qantas in foreign hands because this would somehow make Qantas operate better; Labor Party members were told to do this because it was necessary to get the government out of the budgetary hole. I could not help but laugh yesterday when the Prime Minister was saying, 'What about the policies? Have you shown them to the backbench?' When was the Commonwealth Bank sale shown to the cabinet? Half an hour before the budget! Who would have the gall to do that? Here we are, the budget is about to be delivered at eight o'clock. 'Oh, fellows. I have some news for you. We are selling the Commonwealth Bank.' Oh, shock, horror! It is a wonder the parliamentary secretary did not have an epileptic fit.",49
52,Unknown,COMPETITION POLICY REFORM,Opposition members interjecting-He did.,52
53,Mr COSTELLO,COMPETITION POLICY REFORM,"He did. Well, he is actually showing all the signs of somebody who is absolutely committed to privatisation. I love to see the Victorian Left's new feeling of commitment to privatisation. That will be a wonderful tonic for Mr Brumby down in Victoria to know that his parliamentary colleagues in Canberra are the people who really want to privatise things. The government has said it is all our fault. It is all the fault of the opposition, this current account deficit, because $215 million per annum has been cut out of the government. Do you know what the tax increases coming into effect on KST day-Keating's Sales Tax daytomorrow amount to? One billion dollarsone billion dollars of extra taxation tomorrow and it is all our fault for knocking off $215 million. Here we are on a beach which is being lapped by huge waves that are eroding it and what is the Treasurer worried about? He is worried about a kid with a bucket and spade taking some sand out, far in the distance. It $215 million in $124 billion worth of revenue that is the problem-not the $27 billion of current account deficit that was announced today! That is $4 million an hour, $94 million a day, $2,900 million a month-that is the dimension of the problem. Do not come in here and worry about fleas when the government's real problem is the elephants. What does the government say about these taxes? Does it really say that pushing up the cost of housing is necessary to bring down the cost of mortgages? Does it really say that we have to harm home buyers to help them? Does it really say that at a time when we have a current account deficit, the answer is to whack up taxes on companies? Is that the argument? Does it really say that we need to put up sales tax on Australian cars at a time . when we have an export problem? None of !hese taxes. - s directed at either slowing Imports or lIftmg exports. In fact, it is entirely the reverse. They are taxes which are misdirected. . - is is the bill which has some good directIOn m a government which has no direction. This is a day on which the Prime Minister should hang his head in shame. This is a day wh-n he .sho-ld apologise. This is a day on which thIS WIll be etched into his political tombstone: the worse current account deficit from the worse Prime Minister in Australian history. Mrs CROSIO . (-rospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the MmIster for Social Security) (1.15 p.m.)-Never before in parliament have I heard so much rhetoric and so much illconceived discussion of a bill before the House. Time and time again, when members of the opposition have not read a bill do not want to debate a bill, or are not co-cerned about a bill or its consequences, they have put forward these types of spurious amendments and put on performances like the one we have just witnessed. As I listened to the Deputy Leader of the O.pposition (Mr Costel-o), it went through my mmd that the leadershIp battle in the Liberal Part- . of - ustralia - ust be on again. The coalItIOn IS not floatmg policies and if an is opposition ca-not float policies, it ke-ps its backbenchers m the dark and treats them like mushrooms. If the Leader of the Opposition then feels that he is facing a leadership challenge, he says to his backbenchers 'Don't worry about it boys and girls, there's - n early election coming.' The performance from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is obviously part of that debate. I bring to. the notice of the people present today-partIcularly the people in the gallery and the people who are watching this debate on television or listening to it on the radiowhat the bill before the House is all about. The Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 was drafted in response to the Hilmer report. This bill .ha- been circulating for 10 months, and publIc I-pU.t on it has been sought and receIved. ThIS bIll marks the beginning of the removal of monopolistic markets through regulation; The Competition Policy Reform Bill will mean that prices will no longer be set accordam ing to the dividend that a state or a territory government needs to receive from a monopoly enterprise to pay for. the services it provides to the community, or according to how much it needs to service its debts or to balance budget. This bill will put in place the Industry Commission report on national policy. Full implementation of this bill and the policy behind it will put the equivalent of $1,500 per annum into the pockets of every Australian family. The opposition does not want to debate this bill because it knows it is a good news bill. The opposition does not want to debate this bill because it knows that this bill will create 30,000 jobs and increase real wages by three per cent. The opposition does not want to debate this bill and its ramifications because it knows that it will add $23 billion-or 5.5 per cent-per annum to the gross domestic product. The opposition does not want to existed. debate this bill because it cannot. It is too ashamed to praise the government for what has achieved. The federal Labor government has introPost. duced competition into areas where there a monopoly. This government has introduced competition into the telecommunications industry. It has created a level playing field between the two telecommunications carriers by legislating to' gi ve Optus access to Telecom's infrastructure. Consumers have felt the benefits of competition through substanies. tially reduced prices and a better range of services. This government has introduced competition into certain aspects of the operation of Austariffs tralia Post. The voters of this country who post offices will be aware of how much more efficient and how much more customer oriented Australia Post has become. The government has also legislated, through this and other bills, to allow competition in airline industry. Anyone who opens a newstralian paper today will see how consumers have sion. been the beneficiaries of greatly reduced airfare prices. This bill is concerned with all facets of government policy which influence competitive economic behaviour. (Quorum formed) I sure that members who have just conie into the chamber have been listening to niy speech through the other avenues available to them. I was saying that never in the five years that I have been in this parliament have I its heard such a speech as the one just given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his competition run-up for leadership. Obviously, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is perturbed and worried. He sat there listening, trying to keep the knives out of his back. Then the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) called for a quorum because he did not want to hear the debate. The honourable member did not want to hear the truth about the Competition Policy Reform Bill. He did not want this bill debated in the parliament because this bill is about what the people of Australia want. The people of Australia know that they are going to benefit from this bill because this bill is about freedom from the monopolies that have Before I was so rudely interrupted, I was it talking about what the Labor government has done for telecommunications and for Australia. I talked about where the government is was going with competition policy and how competition policy is concerned with all facets of government policy. The most important aspect of this bill is the national approach that the government has taken. That is shown in the increasing integration of economic activity across all states and territorThe importance of internal borders has continued to decrease. The importance of international borders has also diminished as and other barriers to free trade with use other countries have been dropped through the forums that the government has created, such as APEC. National competition policy provides a framework of laws, principles and processes, as well as two key institutions-the the National Competition Council and the AusCompetition and Consumer CommisThe bill before the House-which the coalition refuses to debate because it has no concept of what it is about-has, in the 18 months since that Hilmer report was released and in the 10 months since the draft legislation was made available for comment, been the subject of extensive consultation. The government has had extensive discussions with various concerned groups. I will address the concerns of a number of those groups. The state governments fear a loss of revenue from areas where they have been monopoly service providers. The ACTU is concerned about the loss of jobs and conditions and the reduction in the role of the public sector, which was of prime concern to it, and the public sector's ability to continue to meet community service obligations once it is subject to competitive pressures. Related concerns are about such public interest issues as whether the environment and equity will be ignored in the new competitive marketplace if efficiency is narrowed to economic items. I believe that the government has addressed all the concerns about the bill which is now before the House. At the COAG meeting in April 1995, the states and territories reached agreement with the Commonwealth on all outstanding issues. The Industry Commission report found that the states and territories will not lose revenue when competition is introduced. In fact, it estimated that the states and territories will have a windfall gain of some $3 billion. That is an addition, because the Commonwealth will also experience those gains. The states and territories have until June 1996 to provide a detailed program so that they can share the pool of money that will be available to them. On the ACTU's concern about potential loss of conditions and jobs if government enterprises are opened up to competition, it needs to be recognised that, through productivity bargaining over the last 10 years, the government has been instrumental in downsizing some areas of the public sector. There has also been increased efficiency within the public sector. There is no reason to expect major job losses in areas where efficiencies have already been made. The federal government recognises that while micro-economic reform benefits the society as a whole the adjustment costs may fall disproportionately on some groups of workers. That is why we have developed our white paper initiatives, such as our labour market programs, including training and retraining, to assist those few who may' be adversely affected. ' The wages and the conditions of our workers in areas opened up to competition through corporatisation or even privatisation are already protected, and they are protected through transmission of business provisiotls in section 149 of the Industrial Relations Act, which the honourable member for Higgins wanted to decry in this parliament. If there is any doubt about transmission, the government can take other steps, such as including provisions to protect our workers in the sale con· tracts. In the case of corporatisation, there is a charge on the employer, so existing awards and agreements continue to apply. The government does not see this exercise as a way to reduce wages and conditions but as a way to achieve an economy based on high productivity and high wages. We have only a limited time on the bill. There is so much more I would like to say. It is one of the finest pieces of legislation ever introduced in this House. It has taken a lot of consultation. I commend the minister on introducing the bill, a bill that needs to be adequately debated, not treated with disrespect by the coalition, which has abused its role as a so-called altemative government. I commend this bill to the House. Motion (by Mr Leo MCLeay) put: That the question be now put. Mrs Bishop- Mr Deputy Speaker, I know one cannot speak to such a motion but, on indulgence, I think you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have a problem. Mr Leo MCLeay-It has to be put without debate. Mrs Bishop-We have to determine precisely what question it is that has to be put.",52

It is ironical that on a day on which we are dealing with competition policy members opposite will not even stay in here and debate it. That is how much competition you are actually assisting. Walk out, that is right; cut off the debate. That really reeks of this government. On a day when you have got a $2.9 billion current account deficit, what do you want to do? Run away, that is what you want to do, and that is what you are saying to the Australian people. There are two amendments which have been circulated in my name which I wish to move. The first one is to amend the Trade Practices Act as it relates to the conditions of appointment of commissioners of the new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. We believe that it is desirable and healthy that there is a regular turnover and replacement of commissioners, and for this reason the first amendment which is being circulated in my name amends subsection 8(1) to remove the words relating to the eligibility of commissioners for reappointment. The second set of new clauses which has been circulated is to have the effect of reinserting sections 45D and 45E into the Trade Practices Act, where they were before they were emasculated by the Minister for Industrial Relations. In the Industrial Relations Reform Act, the government transferred sections 45D and 45E to the Industrial Relations Act. The legislation also removed the $250,000 penalty applying for a breach of the Trade Practices Act. Sections 45D and 45E were important restrictions on anti-competitive conduct. They prohibited the interruption of the supply of goods and services by secondary boycotts and prohibited arrangements preventing the supply of goods or services to a corporation. By weakening the secondary boycott provisions, the current law was designed to grant trade unions privileges under the law, that is, the privilege to engage in anti-competitive conduct. This action removes protection for small businesses against irresponsible union boycotts. Relief from secondary boycotts is now available only at the discretion of the Industrial Relations Commission and only after 72 hours. Employers denied immediate injunctive relief from the Federal Court will bleed to death while a commission vacillates about whether it is able to resolve a dispute. The reality is that the Hilmer report actually recommended the retention of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. We have a government that tells the people of Australia that through this legislation it is.implementing the recommendations of the Hilmer report, but it is implementing it only up to a point. When it comes to dealing with sections 45D and 45E, which the Hilmer report itself recommended the implementation of, the government says it cannot go that far; it has to protect its own vested interests; it cannot implement the Hilmer recommendations across the board. The Labor Party has gutted the notion of equality before the law for trade unions. In its 1992 amendments to the Trade Practices Act it protected trade unions with a special rate on penalties 40 times lower than that which applies to corporations. The Industrial Relations Reform Act of 1993 effectively scrapped penalties for trade unions all together. The Hilmer committee provided an independent assessment of competition policy and did not distinguish nor discriminate between the anticompetitive actions of trade unions and those of corporations. This is what the report said: The Committee did not receive any compelling evidence supporting refonn of the primary or secondary boycott provisions, which appear broadly consistent with overseas practice. In these circumstances, the Committee does not propose any amendment to the current provision. Those are the words of Professor Hilmer and the Hilmer report. He said that competition is a good thing for this country and we ought to have more of it. The government is saying competition is a good thing for this country as long as it does not have any effect on any of those vested interests that it represents in this place, namely, the trade unions. The opposition says that if we are going to have competition policy let us apply it across the board and apply it to trade unions just as you do to corporations, and that is the effect of the amendments which have been moved. I ask leave of the House to move these amendments together.",56
58,Mr CADMAN,AYES,"I want to support the amendments that have just been moved by my colleague. M""otion (by Mr Leo MCLeay) agreed to: That the honourable member be not further heard.",61
59,Mr GEAR,AYES,"In response to what the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) had to say about Hilmer's views on sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, Hilmer did not say anything of the kind; in fact, he was silent on 45D and 45E. As far as his assertion that somehow we should have adopted the Hilmer report holus bolus, that is, make no changes, of course the government was never going to be in that position. Wide consultation with the community led to significant changes to the legislation which improved it. Listening to the responses after we had released the draft legislation and the intergovernmental agreements led to significant changes which streamlined the operation of the legislation but also gave it a much wider focus because, as I said in my second reading speech, we .are not introducing competition for competition's sake; we are introducing competition where it is for the public benefit. The public benefit test is enshrined in the foreword to the legislation and also in the inter-governmental agreements. There is a wide area that has to be covered when this legislation and the principals that governments have signed up to actually introduce competition. We did not introduce the Hilmer report as it was presented to us, but it did form the basis of the final outcome and of the Competition Policy Reform Bill, which is before the House today. Another area where we did not agree with the outcome of the report was that the prime focus on competition should be on economic efficiency . We stayed with the public interest test. Another area where we deviated from the report was in pricing. If you read the Hilmer report and you have a look at the final outcome of this bill and the inter-governmental agreements that go with it, you will find that the government has moved a long way from the rather limited recommendations that were contained in the Hilmer report to the government. So it is absolutely wrong to think that, just because a report to a government favours certain things, the government should automatically adopt those things. They are just recommendations to the government. The opposition is always running around the country talking about sections 45D and 45E and labour market reform, as though this is part of the Hilmer package. It never was. It was not in the terms of reference, and the report that we received never referred to it because it was not in the terms of reference, and neither should it have been; It is an entirely different agenda. . The other thing I would say about this package, and I stress this as often as I can, is that it is not about privatisation; this whole package is about competition. If you were to sell tomorrow any public monopoly in Australia so that it be€ame a private monopoly, you have not increased competition. You have still got the one operator, a new one, but you would not have any more competition. So we have got in place procedures where governments choose to go down that path. We do not support the amendments moved by the opposition. The first one would mean that you could not reappoint anybody that had been appointed to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Why would you do something like that? If we have commissioners who are doing a good job, who have the expertise, why would you not leave them there? Why would you take that option out? Obviously, if they are not performing, or if there are different needs, or if you need to put somebody in there with a different view about competition policy, you are free to do it. It does not mean to say you have to keep them there, but we do not close off the option. As for sections 45D and 45E, which are the amendments moved by the opposition in relation to clause 12A of the bill, of course the government does not accept those. Those provisions are more properly addressed in the Industrial Relations Act. The government is not going to support these amendments moved by the opposition. Motion (by Mr Gear) agreed to: That the question be now put. Proposed new clauses negatived. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Gear)-by leaveread a third time. HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING· AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) First Reading Bill presented by Dr Theophanous, for Crean, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Dr Theophanous; ordered that the second readTransport ing be made an order of the day for the next sitting. SYDNEY AIRPORT CURFEW (AIR NAVIGATION AMENDMENT) BILL Consideration resumed from 26 June. Second Reading",61
60,Mr HOWARD,AYES,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. It is no exaggeration to say that it is very rare indeed that private members' bills, Transport. particularly those moved by the opposi-ion, actually get to a second reading stage. I cannot recall any occasion in the 21 years I have been in parliament when that has happened. If I had thought that was a remarkable people achievement, my hopes achieved Himalayan levels two nights ago, when I received a tentative indication from the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) that not only would it be debated, but that the government might agree to it-albeit with one or two amendments. But I am sorry to tell the long-suffering with people of the member for Lowe's electoratething those people who live in Haberfield, Five Dock and Drummoyne who, along with my constituents.in suburbs like Hunters Hill and North Ryde, have been shamefully penalised by this government as a result of its punitive, discriminatory, anti - residential aircraft policies-that it looks as though the government is now going to bury my private member's bill. The member for Lowe may shake her head, but she knows and I know that she knows, that there is a great deal of confusion in the tanks of the government on this issue. The original idea was that the government was going to support the bill, subject to the amendment moved or suggested by the member for Lowe. That is how the media was briefed a couple of nights ago; but apparently there was an argument between the member Mr for Lowe and the Minister for Transport and member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). It is most instructive that the Minister for is not going to participate in this debate. Laurie Brereton is .the author of the punishment of the people of Haberfield, Drummoyne and Five Dock. Those people who live in those suburbs in the member for Lowe's electorate have one man, and one man 1995 alone, to blame for the penalty that they are now suffering. Since the opening of the third runway, noise has increased over their homes and has dramatically affected their enjoyment of life. Those people know-as does the member for Lowe-that the man who, more than anybody else, is responsible for that increased aircraft noise is the Minister for It is pretty shameful, but entirely in character, that the Minister for Transport is not in that the chamber. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) does not have the decency to come into the parliament today and apologise to the of Australia for the worse trade deficit in the history of this nation.",62
61,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AYES,Get on with it.,62
62,Mr HOWARD,AYES,"I will get on with it. I have 30 minutes to get on with it, and I am going to enjoy. every moment of getting on it. It is entirely in character. There is one you have to say about those in the New South Wales Right-that is, when they get it wrong, they run for cover. They do not have the guts to front up and say, 'I'm sorry. I got it wrong. This is the explanation.' Just as the Prime Minister cannot explain noise away the almost $3,000 million current account deficit, so too the Minister for TransWrt cannot explain away why people living in the electorates of Lowe and Bennelong shpuld be singled out and punished. That is eX:,actly what is happening. The shameful thing is that the member for Lowe is prepared to\go along with the punishment of her own constituents. That is what she is doing. Ihope everybody who lives in suburbs like Haberfield, Five Dock and Drummoyne understand what is happening. Both the member for Lowe and I have constituents in a similar situation, and she should join with me in supporting two measures-one of which is the entrenchment into law of the curfew. If the government were prepared to do that, it would become the law of Australia . tonight. This legislation could go through both houses of parliament this afternoon. It is open to the government to do that but it will not do it. I want to know, on behalf of not only my constituents but also the constituents of Haberfield, Drummoyne and Five Dock, why the member for Lowe, who is their representative in the national parliament, is letting them down. She should be agreeing with me and persuading her ministerial colleague to let the measure go through. If it went through tonight, at least those people could be told over the weekend, 'It doesn't matter if the privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport goes ahead because no changes can be made to the curfew without a change in the law that is passed through the parliament' .That is a fair, reasonable and, I would have thought, absolutely unexceptionable measure. What is the government doing? It is shunting it off to a committee, despite the fact that the member for Lowe originally wanted the matter dealt with this week-she knows she did. That was the story all around the building a couple of nights ago and she rolled over in the face of opposition from the minister. She can shake her head but that really does not alter the fact that two nights ago she wanted to agree with me and put this bill through this week. We both could have gone home to our constituents and .said, 'We have achieved something for you. We have entrenched the curfew into law. Therefore, if KSA is privatised in the future, no owner or lessee of the airport could possibly interfere with the curfew arrangements.' But, no, instead this government has conjured up a proposal to send this matter off to the Morris committee. The people of my electorate, and the people of the member for Lowe's electorate, do not need the Morris committee to tell them whether or not it is a good idea to entrench the curfew in law. They know it is a good idea. They demand it as minimal compensation and minimal protection, given what has been done to them by the policies of the Minister for Transport over the past six months since the opening of the third runway. That is the first area in which the people of Five Dock, Haberfield and Drummoyne in the member for Lowe's electorate, and the people of Hunters Hill and North Ryde in my electorate of Bennelong, have been let down. But an even worse area where they have been let down, and where there is absolutely no colour or pretence on the part of the government to give any kind of support to my proposals, is in relation to the opening of the east-west runway. I foreshadow, and would like circulated, an amendment to the private member's bill that I have presented.· In that foreshadowed amendment, we insert a new part 2 entitled 'Sydney airport operations'. It reads as follows: As soon as possible after the commencement of this Act, the Minister must give a direction under section 15 of the Air Services Act 1995 to require Airservices Australia to revise the noise abatement procedures for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport to disperse more equitably the noise generated by the operation and use of aircraft landing at, or taking off from, the aerodrome by increasing the use of the runway known as the east-west runway. What that means indirect language is that I want this bill amended to insert a direction to the minister to reopen the east-west runway. That is what my constituents are demanding. That is what the constituents of the honourable member for Lowe, in Haberfield, Five Dock and Drummoyne, are demanding. I want to know on their behalf, because she is no longer representing them in this issue, whether or not she is prepared to stand up in this parliament and support the insertion of this amendment into this legislation. If the government were to agree, do you know what we could have through the parliaknow ment tonight? We could have a piece of electorate legislation that would achieve two objectives: firstly, the entrenchment into law of curfew, and, secondly, the opening of the east-west runway. That would concerns of the member for Lowe's constituents in Five Dock, Haberfield and Drummoyne and meet the concerns of my constituents in Hunters Hill and North Ryde. Why will the member for Lowe not do it? Why will you not stand up for your people in Five Dock, Drummoyne and Haberfield? fact is that your obedience to the Labor Party is of more importance to you than your held. serving the interests of your constituents. You ations. ought to be in here supporting me. You will have to go back. to your electors and explain why the Labor Party would not take steps today to ensure that the law of Australia, at the close of business of this parliament tonight for the winter recess, did not establish two situations: firstly, the entrenchment into law of the curfew and, secondly, the opening of the east-west runway. It is within the capacity of this parliament to do those two things. Opposition members are prepared to support the passage of the measures. We have taken the initiatives. are only the opposition, but a private member's bill. Why did you not put up a private member's bill? If you really cared about this issue why did you not get onto your mates in the government? You ·have the numbers. What has the member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) done about this? Absolutely nothing. He has rolled over as well. I explaining needs to be done because together we could do something for the people who It are being unfairly tre.ated. You know, I know and everybody in the parliament knows that in the short term this is the only thing can be done, before Badgerys Creek is coninternational structed, for the noise over your electorate and my electorate to be spread around more equitably. Why should the member for Lowe' s con-!. stituents and my constituents cop it all in the neck? Why should not somebody else:!s constituents share some of the noise? Ydu as well as I do that people in t-e of the Minister for Transport and in the electorate of the member for Watson (Mr the MCLeay) have had the planes taken away from them and they have been dumped over meet the your seat and my seat. The difference between the member for Lowe and me is that I am prepared to stick up for my electors and you are not. The difference between you and me is. that I am prepared to do something about it and you are not. I think .the people of Haberfield, DrumThe moyne and Five Dock are going to have something to say whenever the election is I think you should prepare your explanI would like to know what explanation the member for Parramatta has got for this. The only fair, Australian thing to do when you have a problem and there is a burden to be carried is to share the burden around. I think it is unfair that the people who live under the north-south flight path-they are in a limited number of suburbs; they are in the member for Lowe's electorate and my electorate as well as in the electorates of the member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) and the member for two Grayndler (Ms MCHugh). Why should those We people cop all of the noise? Why can it not we have put up be spread around? Do you know the miserable excuse of your minister, your factional mate? His miserable excuse is that it is dangerous. That is not the view of jumbo pilots I know. It is not the view of international experts. It is not the view of people who operate crisscrossing airports such as O'Hare and Chicago in other think a lot of parts of the world. O'Hare is the busiest airport in the world. is a far busier airport than Kingsford Smith airport. It has crisscrossing runways. Heathrow airport in the United Kingdom has crissthat crossing runways and so does Los Angeles airport, and the list goes on. There is no earthly reason, other than miserable partisan politics, for this. The Minister for Transport wants to be able to beat his chest and say, 'There is no more noise over my electorate. I have put it all over the member for Lowe's electorate and the member for Bennelong's electorate.' That is a miserable, very un-Australian way to play politics with this issue. I know it is difficult. Sydney airport is the busiest airport in Australia. Obviously, plans to build a second airport must be embraced. The government says that that is its policy. It is certainly the policy of the coalition. But, in the meantime, something has to be done to relieve the noise affecting my constituents, the constituents of the member for Lowe and others. I have proposed practical ways in which something can be done. I am actually providing a solution. Today I am inviting the parliament of Australia to enact two laws-one of them to entrench the curfew; the other to open the east-west runway. If the parliament were to agree with me today, within a matter of days people living in my electorate and that of the member for Lowe could experience and enjoy some relief. They will want to know why the member for Lowe does not support it. They will want to know why her colleague the member for Kingsford-Smith does not support it. I support it. I can go back to my constituents and say, 'I have done something in the national parliament to try to respond to your legitimate concerns.' Mr Tim Fischer-And Senator CoIlins supports it.",62
63,Mr HOWARD,AYES,"Senator CoIlins supports it, and he represents the Northern Territory. He is showing more concern for the people who live in Haberfield, Five Dock and Drummoyne than is the member for Lowe. When the three mayors-two of whom would never vote for me in a fit, I imagine-came to see me the other day, they at least got a courteous hearing. They waited around for hours to see the Minister for Transport and then they were told he was too busy; he was not available. He was probably conjuring up some other transport or industrial relations disaster to inflict upon the people of Australia. If the parliamentary processes of this country mean anything, they afford two people-whether they are leaders of the opposition, ministers or private members-the right, when there is an issue that specifically and uniquely affects their electorates, to move a private member's bill. This issue is of particular concern to a small number of people, but most of that small number of people live in either my electorate or the two adjoining electorates. Therefore, I have a special obligation to try to do something about the problem. I have a special obligation to stand up for them. I have discharged that obligation. I have invited the parliament to pass a law that will give these people immediate relief. If the Labor Party were prepared to support my proposal, then that relief could be provided by the par-iament passing that law this afternoon. What does the government propose to do by way of response? It is going to put the thing off. It is going to refer it to the Morris committee. What guarantee do we have that it will ever c()me back to this parliament? No guarantee at all. What guarantee do we have that the parliament will not be dissolved during the parliamentary recess? That is a little less likely in view of the government's disasters. I notice that one of my friends opposite, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), smiles in acknowledgment. We have no guarantee the legislation is going to come back. It will probably get buried. The Minister for Transport will say, 'I've kept Mary Easson quiet and shoved it off to the committee. I'll conjure up some excuse during the parliamentary recess for this legislation not to come back.' Why should my constituents not get this relief? I say one thing to those opposite: immediately upon the election of a coalition government, we will take steps to reopen the eastwest runway and to entrench into law the existing curfew arrangements. You could join with me this afternoon in providing relief to those people, but you refuse-and let it ever be held against you by those people-to take steps to protect your own constituents. I hope all of those constituents are forcibly reminded of that. I can guarantee you that I will be taking steps to ensure that they are reminded of it, and I know many of my colleagues will be doing precisely the same thing. Why should our constituents wait until the election of a government? You will put the election off for at least another six months after the way you have been going lately. Why should they wait another six months? How are you going to explain to the people in your electorate that they have to endure flights every couple of minutes or even more frequently over their homes for another six months? Why will you not guarantee that the east-west runway will be reopened? Why are you so stubbornly determined to inflict all of this additional noise on a small number of people? Why will you not support an essentially Australian proposal to spread the burden equitably so that a greater number of people suffer a lesser amount of discomfort instead of requiring a smaller number of people to suffer all of the discomfort. That is what riles my constituents, and that is what riles me. That is why I have introduced this private member's bill; that is why I am proposing the amendment; and that is why I am going to oppose, and divide the House on, the referral of this legislation to Morris committee. I do not want it to go to the Morris committee. I want it to be passed by the parliament today so that I can go back to my constituents and say, 'I have done something to protect you and represent you.' I cannot, for the life of me, understand why the member for Lowe is not willing to do the same thing. I think the House understands the view I have on this measure. It is a very simple one. It is a measure designed, on my initiative as the member for Bennelong rather than as the Leader of the Opposition, to represent the people of Bennelong. I am happy to say to those constituents that I am protecting their interests today. I note with disappointment that the member for Lowe refuses to protect her constituents today. This legislation ought to go through. The act ought to be amended to ensure the opening of the east-west runway and to entrench the curfew into law. I invite the member for Lowe, when the division occurs, to cross the floor and represent the interests of the people in the Lowe electorate and not just toady to the Labor Party on this issue, because the interests of the Labor Party and the interests of her constituents are diametrically opposed on this proposal. She ought to have the courage of her personal convictions and join us. If she were able to take her party with her on this, she could go back to her constituents tonight and say, 'As from now the east-west runway is open, the noise is reduced over your homes and the curfew is entrenched into law .' You ought to be ashamed of yourself for being unwilling to do that.",65
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,Mr Andrew)Is the motion seconded? Mr Connolly-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,66
65,Mrs EASSON,AYES,"I wish to speak on the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation) Amendment Bill 1995. This bill does not make any effort to ease the burden of the airport's operations at night for the residents of Sydney. The proposal to place the the Sydney airport curfew into an act of parliament will change nothing with respect to the curfew at the airport. The curfew for Sydney airport is already established in legislation under the air navigation aerodrome curfew regulations made pursuant to the Air Navigation Act 1920. This proposal does no more than maintain the current provisions of the act. The bill proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) just does not go far enough. All of his gesturing here today still comes to nought because it is simply not a strong enough bill. What I am doing on behalf of my constituents is attempting to strengthen that bill and to improve the situation for the people of my electorate and other electorates, including the honourable member for Bennelong's electorate, that are affected by the airport's operations. Placing the current curfew arrangements in the act, rather than as regulations as at present, could make it more difficult to tighten the curfew arrangements as it would require the approval of both houses of parliament. While I support the strengthening of the curfew, this proposed current legislation is inadequate on several counts. It would entrench a current situation of quotas in the shoulder periods. Currently, 56 movements are allowed under this quota system, disturbing the sleeping hours of my constituents and others affected by airport noise. Secondly, there should be full consultation. The member for Bennelong in his first reading speech on Monday, 26 June said that his bill would require the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to consult widely before any attempts were made to alter the curfew. I am simply recommending public consultation about the entrenching of this quota system into law. There are grave misgivings amongst the public concerning the Civil Aviation Authori-.. ty, and there is no question that my constituents affected by KSA have been asked to endure horrific noise as a result of the opening of the third runway. The member for Bennelong must not be hypocritical. He and his party were virulent supporters of the third runway. To come into this House in the last week of sittings and introduce this bill, knowing full well that it would not come up for debate until the next sittings, is grandstanding in the extreme. The only reason that we are debating this issue today is that the government, at my urging, realises that the public cannot and should not be taken for granted and that they have the right to express their views about this issue. Although I agree with the principle of the member for Bennelong's bill with regard to public consultation, the section on consultation in his bill is poorly drafted. The parliamentary counsel should redraft it and a shorter time should be given for this consultacommittee. tion. On reflecting on this proposed legislation, one realises it also has other shortcomingsthat is why I am not moving an amendmentnamely, that the penalty provisions are inadequate. Under regulation, the maximum penalty for an individual breakage of the curfew is $5,000. For an airline, a corporation, it is $25,000. This is obviously not enough. If an airline is faced with the decision of either paying for overnight hotel accommodation for its people or breaking the curfew, at this rate it will be more inclined to break the curfew. We must toughen up these penalties and much more legislation is required to set them. They cannot be set under regulation. This must be addressed. Earlier this week I made the press, the public and my party aware of my intention to move an amendment to this bill. The amendment would have taken the form of recommending that the issues of the shoulder period, with the possibility of a sunset quota, and the minimisation of current quotas be examined by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure with a view to its being able to tighten the curfew provisions. After examining the legislation with its inadequacies-namely, the flight quotas, the shoulder periods, the poor drafting concerning the lack of community consultation and the inadequate penalties-I realise that this cannot be successfully amended without the entire legislation being referred to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. As we go into recess for seven weeks, I believe it is imperative that this time be used to resolve this issue which the opposition would have us shirk, and therefore request that this committee report back to the parliament by 31 August SQ that no time is lost in investigating this issue. I would move that myself, but standing orders place limitations on what backbenchers are able to do. I have spoken to the Chief Government Whip, who will be proposing later today that the bill and the matters I have raised be referred to the I consider that this bill, proposed by Mr Howard, does not go far enough to improve the situation for people in my electorate, and in his electorate as well. All of this posturing today does not relate to the fact that he knows there are many situations in which the shoulder period of the curfew is being abused. He is not prepared to do anything about it with his current legislation. It is a mockery to say that this legislation would be introduced and be passed in the Senate today. He knows full well that this is the case. I consider that the present quota for international operations in the shoulder period of the curfew should be ended with the result that there be no operations at Sydney airport between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. From the commissioning of the Sydney West airport, all freight operations currently undertaken at Sydney airport in the curfew hours will operate out of Sydney West airport. I consider that the current international movements allowed between 11 p.m.· and midnight, and 5 a.m. and 6 a.m., should be also required to operate out of Sydney West airport. At present, international operators are allowed a maximum of 14 movements per week between 11 p.m. and midnight, and a maximum of 42 landings per week between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. Without pre-empting the committee's findings, I am strongly of the view that there should be a sunset clause for the quota system and the 56 international flights per week that disturb my constituents. I know that the landings at this time are supposed to occur over Botany Bay, but there is a frequency of flights overshooting surrounding suburbs and causing distress. I personally believe that, with the commitment to Sydney West airport, commonly known as Badgerys Creek, by 1999, and whatever other resources are necessary, no flights should be allowed outside the designated curfew, other than for emergencies. The year 1999 is still a long way away. In the interim, I believe this committee should also investigate and report on mechanisms to reduce the number of flights during the shoulder of the curfew period. I realise that the quotas originated in 1989 as a direct result of international flight scheduling. Whilst I appreciate the importance of tourism to this country, you cannot keep asking the same people to keep enduring such excessive amounts of pain. In forming its view, the committee must ensure that the public has ample opportunity to make representations. I will be discussing this with the committee chair, the member for  want to revert to the original curfew hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Currently the hours are closer to 12 midnight and 5 a.m. I fought the last election campaign on the very issue of the retention of the curfew. There was a leaked letter from the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) explaining his belief that KSA should operate 24 hours a day. On Monday this week I tabled a report concerning the Olympics and Australian industry. During our hearings we took evidence from the New South Wales government-this was, of course, the previous Liberal government-and other representatives. They made it clear that in their opinion KSA should be curfew free for the Olympics. When I suggested that, if the curfew were lifted for the Olympics it might continue and be thrown out altogether,. they agreed. I informed them that my electorate was Lowe and suggested that this would be achieved over my dead body. I have been arguing in my electorate for the importance of entrenching the curfew in legislation. In this year's budget, three-quarters of a billion dollars was allocated for the fast tracking of Sydney West airport by 1999 for eventually a full international parallel runway designed for 24-hour per day operation. This will be curfew free. This stands in stark contrast to the Liberals. Recent action was taken by the government, at the urging of me and other government members of this House, to tighten up the curfew arrangements at Sydney airport. These include the elimination on 19 April 1995 of the previous quotas which enabled larger, noisier freight jet aircraft-such as the B737, the A300 and the DC9-during curfew hours; the promulgation on 19 April 1995 of the sunset provisions in the regulations, triggered by the opening of Sydney West airport, which transfer all curfew freight movements from Sydney airport to Sydney West airport; the provision on 22 December 1994 of fines of up to $25,000 for each case of a breach of the curfew; severe restrictions since November 1994 on the ability of the aviation industry to obtain dispensation from the provisions of the curfew; and daily monitoring of, and reporting on, curfew operations, with all detail of operations, flight paths and breaches provided to the Sydney airport community consultative committee chaired by the Hon. Joe Riordan and including community and local governmentrepresentatives, including me, from areas affected by the airport's operations. Many constituents of mine have contacted me about the privatisation of Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports. They are concerned that in any leasing arrangements the curfew will be an issue which is non-negotiable should the airports be in private rather than public hands. The action we are taking here today, by referring this legislation Standing Committee on Transport, Communication and Infrastructure, with a defined report back date, which is 31 August, is a strong stand. There should be legislation entrenching the curfew. Mr Ruddock-The hours should be re-.· duced and the legislation should reflect these changes.",66
66,Mrs EASSON,AYES,"The number of flights in the curfew hours should be reduced and the legislation should reflect these changes. The Howard bill is deficient. It does nothing for the people of my electorate or for the electorate of Bennelong, and the member knows this. The member for Bennelong might think 56 flights in the shoulder period of the curfew is okay, but I do not and my people do not. The Howard bill is deficient. I believe that we can have a better situation. Mr Ruddock-It is better to have nothing?",69
67,Mrs EASSON,AYES,I believe that we can have a bettering in terms of the shoulder periods and in terms of the penalties-because the penalties are inadequate at the moment. We can have better consultation over a shorter period-two months-and we will have even greater powers of the committee of inquiry to investigate this. Mr Ruddock-She has suggested it is better to have nothing.,69
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,Mr Andrew)Order! The member for Berowra does not have the call. I ask him to desist.,69
69,Mrs EASSON,AYES,"In the end, we will have a better bill.",69
70,Mr CONNOLLY,AYES,"Bradfield) (2.29 p.m.)It is my great pleasure to second the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation Amendment) Bill of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), because the people of my electorate of Bradfield-like the people in his electorate of Bennelong and like the people in other suburbs of Sydney which are in a direct line from Mascot to the edge of the metropolitan area to the north, as well as to the south-have been suffering grievously over recent months because of the decisions made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to the supported by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), supported by other members of the New South Wales Labor Party Right and supported by the whole organisation, including the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson). They are not prep'ared to come into this House to debate this issue and to support what is quite clearly a decision in the interests of their constituents. . It is simply not good enough to say you are referring this legislation to a standing committee. It is not good enough that one single constituent of yours should have to lose more sleep, have their health affected, have their children's health affected and have their whole environment affected because this government is simply incapable and unwilling to face up to the fact that the Minister for Transport'allowed these decisions to be made for purely political reasons. As recently as the last state election, he went on record as saying that, as far as he was concerned, there would be no change because there was no longer an issue. Why was it no longer an issue? Because no state seats changed hands. On that spurious argument alone he came into this House and arrogantly told the people of Australia, particularly those of Sydney, that no changes would be made; the decisions had been made and that was where it would stand. The two issues raised so well by the member for Bennelong in his private member's bill are quite simple. The first is to. change the curfew arrangements and entrench them in law so that between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. the airport may be used, but outside that time it may not be used, so that these hundreds of thousands of Australian people and their children at least have a prospect of a few hours of peace and quiet to get some sleep. The second most important part of his proposal before the House is that the eastwest runway should once again be open for normal usage. The significant fact is that the cross-runway was open yesterday for United Airlines flight 815. That runway is also used on occasions when wind circumstances are such that it is no longer possible to use the normal north-south route. As a result of this government's policy, the decision was made to not use the east-west runway. The effect of that, as has been so eloquently said by the member for Bennelong, is as follows. Whereas previously the overall noise effect around the KSA perimeter was reasonably fairly shared among the people of the suburbs in that area, that is no longer the case. A substantial proportion-something like 80 per cent-of all the noise now emanating from aircraft landing or taking off from KSA occurs mainly to the north and somewhat to the south. Suburbs to the east and west have almost a pristine environment. The politics of that are obvious. To the east and west of KSA all the seats are relatively safe Labor seats. A deal was done to sell out the interests of other parts of the community in the metropolitan area of Sydney to help the members in those particular electorates. It was an outrageous decision because it absolutely ran contrary to that fundamental principle that, while the airport remains-and it is certainly going to for the foreseeable futureand there is a noise problem in the Mascot area, the effects of it should be equitably shared among the people of Sydney. Like all members who have been affected, I have received hundreds of letters, petitions and complaints from constituents. I want to give two small examples of this. Mr Owen Carapet from Belrose wrote: Before the new .North-South runway became operational we used to get an odd high flying aircraft over our house. Now we have low flying aircrafts starting from around 6AM till IlPM, some days once every 10 to 15 min. Flying low enough for the noise to drown out a normal conversation or TV sound. I realise that we are not as badly affected as suburbs near the airport but Belrose is quite some distance from the Sydney airport and to the best of my knowledge was not mentioned as a suburb affected by the new runway. He is absolutely correct. Whe!l the EIS was done, when the plans were issued and when the maps were issued, the evidence was quite conclusive. There were no sound recordings taken north of the Parramatta River because it simply did not matter. I have another letter here from the Rusten family of West Pymble, who wrote: Tonight, I submit this, my protest, over the negative impact the third runway at Kingsford Smith Airport has had on our lives. Since the operation of the parallel runway system, we are situated directly under the incoming flight path. The aircraft have descended upon us at lower than expected levels. This has caused great distress, sleeplessness and a decline in our health and family life. Whilst aircraft are overhead, 1. We cannot hear telephone conversations. 2. We cannot converse outdoors. 3. I could not make myself heard to warn my child of an approaching car. 4. Our house vibrates. 5. Our television reception is interfered with. 6. We cannot hear the telephone ringing whilst outside. Our outdoor life is intolerable and our indoor life is not much better. That is just one example of now thousands of people have been affected in this way. In recent months, we have had two public meetings on this issue in the electorate of Bradfield and over 800 people attended. That is a demonstration of the level of concern people have at this time. Recently in Sydney evidence was requested by the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, and a submission was put forward by Ku-Ring-Gai council on behalf of the residents. The reasons for the scope of the noise impact, as noted in that submission, are quite straightforward. It is primarily because of the closure of the east-west runway, which has resulted in a concentration of fly overs to the north and to the south. The flights impacting on the northern suburbs exceed the forecasts because no effective empirical evidence was ever taken to assess precisely what those difficulties would be. The residents of Ku-Ring-Gai concluded that they were never told the truth regarding the potential impact of the operation of the parallel runway system with the utilisation of the new arrangements. Forecasts of the extent and impact of noise have proved to be gravely inaccurate and the criteria used to establish forecasts have now been shown to be totally inadequate, inappropriately applied and based on false premises. Putting it quite simply, fundamental errors were made. The community's cynicism can justified when it is considered the government was advised prior to the decision to proceed that it would get it wrong and that the founoperational dation criteria for the forecasts were inapproslow priate, inaccurate and the ANEF protocol, which was being used at the time, was used in a misleading manner. During the week of 1 to 8 May the council conducted noise monitoring at four locations within the area. It demonstrated conclusively the very significant noise nuisance arising from aircraft. The impact of the noise is also exacerbated by the time at which it occurs, particularly early in the morning at about o'clock. That is when I wake up to hear a 747 going just over my roof. We are told, 'Don't worry. They are flying 2,000 feet, or 600 metres, up. There are no problems at all. ' are not talking about areas of Sydney at sea at present. level. We are talking about areas of Sydney at significant altitude, which automatically means that the planes as they approach are much lower than they would be under normal conditions. This has affected not only the lifestyle of people and the health of their families but also property values, which are process. significantly influenced by features such as peace and quiet. They are the sorts why people live on the north shore of Sydney. The scope of the noise impact associated with the opening of the parallel runway at Kingsford Smith airport was also grossly underestimated. As a result, these problems are currently before us, and the government refuses to face them. The government is responsible and it is accountable for the errors which have been made. It is accountable for the fact that thousands of Sydney citizens were deliberately led astray by the CAA and the other authorities. The government must accept the responsibility for that. The effect has been nothing short of devastating on the people close to the airport and on people in areas which were previously regarded as being well outside the influence of the noise. There are a number of things that have to be done. The government must cancel the interim air traffic arrangements and restore the east-west runway to full operational use, as we are urging in this legislation before the be House. It has to extend the curfew between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. at least, as we have urged in this legislation today. It has to amend the procedures, including controls on turns, using increased thrust over residential areas and the speed of descent. It must also have constant descent speeds of 210 knots instead of 170 knots as required in order to reduce the noise even further. What people tend to forget is that the changes which have taken place are not just that aircraft are approaching on a lateral line to the KSA runway. In addition to that there is a fountain effect: they are coming in from the left and they are coming in from the right. 6 They tend to centre on what is known as the West Pymble beacon, a central point based 10 miles north of the runway. Therefore, in particular, families living around that beacon We are the ones who are suffering so grievously The failure to adequately test and review the foundation criteria after serious doubts were raised is an unconscionable and unforgivable admission. It brings into doubt the sincerity of the consultation and review  of reasons its analysis simply said: No part of the Ku-Ring-Gai municipality is forecast to fall within the 20 ANEF contour for the long term sceniuio. Accordingly it was not considered appropriate to undertake detailed studies of the noise effects in the Ku-Ring-Gai municipality. The distance of the municipality from the airport also indicates that it was not appropriate to undertake a detailed study of the effects of the proposal or other matters such as road traffic. In other words, distance was the excuse for doing no worthwhile scientific analysis in the first place-ignoring the fact that aircraft regard distance as of very little significance. When we are talking about distances of 10 miles, or 16 kilometres, it makes the point even clearer. Flaws in the foundation criteria deserved examination which they did not receive. The ANEF system, which apparently has been made the sole guideline and determinant to assess the impact on the community, fails to properly account for variations in individual reactions to noise. To intimate that any person outside the ANEF 20 contour will be affected clearly cannot be accepted because it does depend on altitude. It also depends on whether a person is in a valley, because valleys hold in sound which cannot escape. The response of the authorities, again through the FAC, was: Residents will become habituated or adapt-to the extent that they either do not notice the aircraft or they become accustomed to the noise and live with it-or they move away from the airport environs. What an extraordinarily cynical response to a serious human problem. It merely demonstrates how this government, particularly the Minister for Transport, has totally lost the plot. The minister simply does not understand that the role of the bureaucracy at a time like this is to identify the problem and look for solutions-not to simply ignore half the problem and hope that it will go away. As I said earlier, while the presumption is that the flight paths are well above the ground, the truth is that much of Ku-Ring-Gai is a thousand feet above sea level. Indeed, because of the topography of the ground, distance from the noise source is also critical. Had the ANEF calculation taken into account Sydney's topography, clearly the Ku-Ring-Gai area would have fallen within the ANEF 20 zone and, therefore, would have been subject to the analysis which was denied. The Ku-Ring-Gai area was also excluded on the basis of its distance from the airport. But that is meaningless, as I said, in terms of noise exposure. In addition to the topography, it is the distance between the ground level and the overflying aircraft which is the criterion that matters. However, both of those points were totally ignored. The data also relied upon to formulate criteria was shown to be invalid for the following reasons: the sample sizes were seriously inadequate; the sample areas did not extend beyond the anticipated ANEFzone which, to all intents and purposes, stopped at the Parramatta River; the adverse results from Sydney responses were diluted because they were averaged with responses from four other areas-and that clearly affects those areas which suffer most; the high level of dissatisfied responses from Sydney residents was simply ignored; and the base information was outdated and not representative of the existing, let alone projected, traffic volumes. The sad fact is that no actual monitoring was conducted to either establish or test the existing or potential·areas affected by aircraft noise. Those assumptions were made on an arbitrary basis, without any worthwhile scientific examination. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may well ask why the community is unhappy, why the community is asking for change. Why is it that somebody like the Minister for Transport can simply say that people on the North Shore do not have to worry about that? The truth of the matter is that family people are suffering just as grievously as are people living in other electorates even closer to the airport, such as Lowe. They may not be suffering as much as people living even closer in again to the airport who are literally receiving aeroplanes flying over their houses at an average of one a minute for some critical periods of the day. Their circumstances are simply horrific, and I feel for them very dearly indeed. Nevertheless, the critical fact is that thousands within the community now affected had been advised and assured that they would suffer no impact, that it would not affect them. They were told, 'Don't worry. Everything will be all right.' But they then found that the situation was exactly the opposite of what they had been advised both in the environmental impact statement and also by the FAC. The worry now is that the FAC is saying-it is now warning us, as the truth is out-that the impact will get significantly worse as the tower becomes fully operational and that there will be an obvious growth in air traffic through Sydney in the foreseeable future. What does it mean? It means that the maximum use of airspace over non-residential areas must be better utilised than it is at present and that the whole question of the utilisation of the Pymble beacon should be reviewed. Is the beacon now as technically necessary as it was, say, 20 or 30 years ago? Basically, the whole issue of the beacon was  needs to consider seriously the question of whether noise over the highest residential areas in Sydney-which are approximately 1,000 feet, or 300 metres-maximises discomfort for the people of Ku-Ring-Gai and can be helped when planes fly so low. Again, we were told there would be no noise over Ku-Ring-Gai, let alone the extreme concentration of flights which we now positively see on a daily basis. We were told that the problem would be solved by concentrating flight paths to reduce the number of people affected. That was Mr Brereton's response. It was a political response. It was not a response to address the main issue, which is that the situation is even worse for the people living under those flight paths. At present when landing from the north, many aircraft join the north-south flight paths near the site of the old DCA locator beacon at West Pymble, which is 10 nautical miles from the airport. Aircraft come to this area from the south, west, east and north to be distributed over the two parallel flight paths. The result is that a high proportion of aircraft have to execute turning manoeuvres in this vicinity, which adds time as well as airspace and noise to the problem. There is another element that I did not mention, and that is the question of environmental pollution. More aircraft flying over these suburbs means more fuel being discharged. It is affecting the quality of the houses; it is affecting the quality of the environment; and it is certainly affecting the quality of people's health. These are serious issues. These are not matters which can be simply ignored by the government. These are not issues which can simply be passed on to a parliamentary committee to review at some stage in the future. These are problems facing thousands and thousands of our citizens now. They demand a result from their representatives. They demand some action from this government. After the last election Mr Brereton may have said, 'It is not an issue because no state seats changed hands.' But let Mr Brereton, the right wing of the Labor Party and all members of the Labor Party in this parliament know once and for all that, when the people of those suburbs affected by KSA go to the polls at the next federal election, Mr Brereton will be the last person who will be able to say that it does not matter any more.",69
71,Mr ELLIOTT,AYES,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communieations and the Arts) (2.53 p.m.)-I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation Amendment) Bill today. I wish to take up the point that was made by the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) in relation to the need for this matter to be treated with sincerity and with the genuineness that all the residents of Sydney who are affected by aircraft noise would demand. It is worthwhile that we try to get on the record the process of sincerity that has applied up to this stage in this debate. The third runway at Sydney airport certainly was an issue at the last state election. In the electorate of Gladesville, the people there recognised who had been the great pushers and drivers for the development of the third runway at Sydney: it was the state government under Nick Greiner and then under John Fahey. They were the ones who kept pressing the charge saying, 'Build the third runway; Sydney is being held back because of the lack of a third runway.' I have been to meetings and heard them talk about this time and time again. They helped to activate the campaign in Sydney to ensure the building of the third runway. They were the pushers and urgers for it all the way through that process. Now we are being told by opposition members, 'We have a view as to what we do about aircraft noise.' The truth of the matter is that they were not concerned about the impacts of the third runway, the impacts that were going to flow from the increased air traffic volume in Sydney, when they were pushing the charge for the building of the third runway. We are now told that the EIS process in relation to the east-west runway was somehow a revelation of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). He now has a proposal to share the load. He dismisses safety considerations on the east-west runway. It seems this is of no concern to the Leader of the Opposition. The future of safe air traffic movements in the Sydney region should be of great concern to us all. It is irresponsible to be arguing for any course of action other than that which is to be taken to ensure safe air traffic movements in Sydney. The problems associated with air traffic in Sydney and air traffic planning attached to Sydney airport are indeed a major concern. A whole range of issues needs detailed considerat-on in that regard. The process whereby we WIll deal promptly with some of these matters is that the Morris committee will deal with them and bring back a report which addresses some of the issues concerning deficiencies in the Sydney airport planning processes which have applied up to now. One issue relates to the curfew. The Leader of the Opposition's bill proposes that we should continue to allow the 56 flights allowed outside the apron period of 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is part of the problem of the increased noise impact on residents throughout parts of Sydney, such as those in the electorates of Bennelong, Lowe, Bradfield, Parramatta, Mitchell and others. First of all we need to ensure that we have effectivpenalty regimes for strict compliance to the Sydney airport curfew. That is something we on this side of the House believe in. Mr Ruddock-Come on! You have been in office for 12 years. You don't believe in it at all.",73
72,Mr ELLIOTT,AYES,We have heard the opposition before the last election and more recently the new state Liberal government argue c?nstantly for 24-hour access to Sydney aIrport. Mr Ruddock-You've known about this for months.,74
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,Mr HolIis)Order!,74
74,Mr ELLIOTT,AYES,"That has been the opposition's approach to these issues. That is how many bona fides the opposition has on this issue. The government will come back with real proposals, in my view, as a result of the committee report from the honourable  take real steps to ensure both strong compliance with the 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and also do more towards the planning of broader air traffic to minimise the impacts on residents of the Sydney region. That is really the important test. It is not the grandstanding of the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Bradfield that we have been exposed to today. That sort of grandstanding does not count. The people of Sydney want to know that tangible, long-term steps will be taken to address Sydney airport noise and its impacts. They want to ensure - hat is done safely. I have not heard anyone III Sydney argue that that should be done in a way that is other than safe. Some international work has been done in this regard. Dr Robert Ratner conducted a review of the Australian air traffic services system in 1992. In analysing the impacts of the parallel runways versus the cross-runway in air operations at Sydney, he acknowledged that the airspace structuring principles being - sed are consistent with the best world practice and 'that parallel operations are ultimately the best way of getting high safe movement rates at Sydney airport'. That is the key issue as far as the east-west runway is concerned. The opposition's proposal is designed to j-opardise safe air traffic movement at Sydney aIrport. The other concern of reopening the eastwest runway can be quickly spelt out by saying that all that will do is increase the air traffic volume through Sydney airport. In the short term and in the long term, that will be no solution to better air traffic planning and better environmentally sound planning of air traffic movements in the Sydney region. We need to make sure we introduce a comprehensive piece of legislation following the Morris committee report-it will be brought down by the end of August, when the parliament gets back-and as a result of that strong steps are taken to ensure strict conformity to the curfew, to the apron periods. We should ensure that the strongest penalty regime is in place for breach of those curfew arrangements. The way the Leader of the Opposition's bill deals with the penalty regime is as weak as waterabsolutely pointless, absolutely hopeless. It is are. a very weak, poorly drafted piece of legislation. He should go back to square one in that regard. What Sydney needs is a stronger level of planning of the broader airport issues in Sydney. I would argue that it is very important that, with the development of Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek, we do not visit upon the residents of western Sydney whom I represent the same sort of short-term planning that has otherwise applied. That is why I would argue very strongly that we need to ensure the strictest environmental arrangements at Sydney West airport. It is not enough to implement a few shortterm measures to try to curry a bit of favour with a few people-as the Leader of the Opposition has done in the Bennelong electorate. He has not really achieved anything from that. The parliamentary committee has not been able to address some of the broader term issues to ensure real value and real benefits for the community living throughout the Sydney region. The airport issue is very much an integrated process in terms of getting the short-term air traffic movements carried out safely, in an environmentally sound manner and with a minimum of noise. That involves looking at current flight paths to see what further work can be done. It involves getting rid of the older aircraft that at times are a major part the problem with their increased noise. It involves ensuring strict compliance with both the take-off and landing altitude requirements that the airlines should be following at Sydney airport at the moment. It also means that, when it comes to the development of Badgerys Creek airport, the strongest environmental safeguards are built as part of the study process. It is absolutely crucial that, when Badgerys Creek comes online again, the take-offs and landings during the night-time periods again focus on that south-west corridor of Sydney which does not have the population. The residents of western Sydney are no more desirous of having large traffic volumes over them at night than the residents around KSA All of those reasons highlight the fact that we need to have the committee report. The government has a real commitment to ensure that that occurs. On behalf of the people whom I represent in Parramatta, I am concerned to ensure that we get proper solutions relating to Kingsford Smith airport and also Sydney West airport. Mr Ruddock-You want it both ways.",74
75,Mr ELLIOTT,AYES,Both areas are equally important. No thanks to the opposition and its colleagues in the state government have we. got any results in this regard. Mr Ruddock-Come on! You've been in office 12 years.,75
76,Mr ELLIOTT,AYES,All the way through the process,75
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,"Mr Hollis)Order! The honourable member for Berowra seems to think he can sit at the opposition table and talk constantly. He cannot do it. The Second Deputy Speaker recently exercised his authority and had someone put out of the chamber for a while. I do not want to do that, but I warn the honourable member for Berowra that I will not sit here and have him constantly conducting a debate across the chamber. If he wants to join the debate, he can join the debate-but not while he is sitting there. Mr Ruddock-I accept your judgment, Mr of Deputy Speaker. I will try to be restrained even under this intense provocation.",75
78,Mr ELLIOTT,AYES,"I have not seen the honourable member for Berowra making any comments to safeguard the residents of the region against aircraft noise. The same can be said for his colleagues in the state parliament. Premier Greiner represented part of the area that the member for Berowra now represents, and he led the charge to have the building of the third runway. That is what happened in that regard. The problems that have been visited on the residents of Berowra and Bennelong had their strongest impetus by the actions taken by Premier Greiner when he got together a group of Sydney business interests that pushed so hard for the building of the third runway at Sydney. Hoteliers and all sorts of people were put into that group to ensure that the third runway was built. The member for Berowra, by the fact that he did not stand up to Greiner at that time, has been· an accomplice in helping to ensure that did occur. Many of us on this side of the House have been raising real reservations about the third runway at KSA for many years. Many of us have been concerned about that problem, and those concerns were not shared by the opposition. Mrs Bishop-You built it.",75
79,Mr ELLIOTT,AYES,"At the last election, the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) called for a 24hour operation. He wanted the abolition of the curfew at Sydney airport. That was the opposition's approach. Now it thinks it might be able to get a bit of advantage out of the issue. As we saw at the state election in the electorate of Gladesville, the people did not fall for the opposition's line. They realised that the only way to ensure real solutions to the Sydney airport noise problems-and they are real for so many residents-was to have the combination of a Carr Labor government and a Keating Labor government in Canberra. These governments can address those issues, working fully to build the new airport in Sydney, ensuring that we minimise the implications of the air traffic noise with that process. The process outlined in support of the proposition of the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson)-the proposition I strongly supportis to have the parliamentary committee report quickly on this process. It should develop comprehensive arrangements that have strict penalty provisions to ensure a firm curfew from 11.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. rather than the weak, ill-conceived, hurriedly put together process outlined by the Leader of the Opposition. As a result of that, we could all have a confident expectation that the problems in relation to Kingsford Smith airport could be minimised for residents throughout the region. We will do that in a way that does not jeopardise airport safety. The key thing the opposition's proposal does is to exacerbate potential air safety problems with the opening of the east-west runway. There is no way the parliament should be condoning that course of Premier action when we have experts such as Dr Ratner who have made it very clear that they very strongly adhere to the view that parallel operations are ultimately the best way of getting high safe movement rates at Sydney airport. That is what we should be supporting. No air safety process has been undertaken or provided to the House by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the east-west runway. The Leader of the Opposition sets himself up as the expert in these issues. I say to the House that I think the parliamentary committee should have a good look at those issues rather than automatically accept that the Leader of the Opposition is the House's resident expert on air safety in the Sydney region. Mr Leo MCLeay-He never has been before.",76
80,Mr ELLIOTT,AYES,"Yes, and he has never taken too much interest in the whole issue before, I have to say. I thank the Chief Government Whip for his intervention in that regard. It is critical that we develop comprt!hensive arrangements. I think the parliamentary committee provides a real basis for that to occur. On behalf of the residents of the Sydney region, I am very concerned that the noise problems they experience as a result of air movements in Sydney be given very strong impetus by the parliament and the government. I have no doubt that the member for Shortland and his committee can help to ensure that does occur and that the whole range of issues in relation to KSA both on this issue and on the Sydney West airport issue with the particular demands that will occur there as it comes on line can be fully addressed. It is appropriate, having had a debate today, to ensure that the committee reports by the end of August. Hopefully, as a result of that, the residents of the Sydney region will be better off for the range of recommendations which I am sure will flow from that committee's deliberations. Debate (on motion by Mr Leo MCLeay) adjourned. NA NA Motion (by Mr Leo MCLeay) proposed: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation Amendment) Bill 1995 and the following additional and specific matters: (a) what measures could be considered to reduce the number of jet aircraft movements at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport between the hours of 11 p.m. and 12 midnight and 5 a.m. and 6 a.m.; (b) the appropriateness and quantum of the penalties contained in clause 25K of the Bill in light of current Commonwealth criminal law policy; and (c) measures to improve community consultation prior to any changes to the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airportbeing referred to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and fufrastructure for consideration and an advisory report to the House by 31 August 1995.",76

83,Mr OKEEFE,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These amendments to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act give effect to the government's decision announced in the budget on 9 May to restructure the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to enhance the primacy of its maritime safety regulation and marine environment protection functions. I do not propose to go through the amendments clause by clause, but I would like to highlight the key features. The insertion of an objects clause into AMSA's legislation will provide clear guidance as to the organisation's priorities. Amendment No. 10, which proposes to insert a new section 2A into the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act, clarifies that AMSA's primary consideration must be its safety regulation and marine environment protection roles, including responsibility for safety of shipping operations along the Australian coastli!le, maritime safety generally and protectIon of Australia's marine environment from ships or pollution and other damage. By removing commercial requirements from AMSA and emphasising its safety regulation and environmental protection roles, these legislative amendments will ensure that the highest possible protection is provided to both human life and marine environment. The amended AMSA Act 1990 will enable the authority to pursue its goals of service to the city and the community free of unnecessary commercial imperatives while ensuring full accountability and reporting to the government. Question resolved in the affirmative. . TRANSPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1995 First Reading . Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mr O'Keefe; leave granted for second reading to be moved forthwith. Second Reading",81
84,Mr OKEEFE,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends four acts. Some of the amendments are of a technical nature and represent finetuning and clarification of statutory provisions. I will not deal with the minor technical amendments in this speech, but instead will focus on the significant amendments contained in this bill. There are two notable sets of amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920: firstly, an amendment to section 27 which will extend the potential extraterritorial reach of regulations made under the act; and, secondly, a package of amendments relating to the security of civil aviation in Australia. On 1 November 1994, Australia entered into a treaty with the United States and Canada which requires each country to ban smoking on all passenger flights operated by its airlines between points in the territory of one party to the treaty and points in the territory of another party, excluding flights operated via an intermediate point in the territory of a state which is not a party to the treaty. The agreement came into effect on 1 March 1995 and regulations were made before this date to allow Australia to give effect to its international obligations under this treaty. The government has decided to extend these smoking bans to apply to all international flights operated by Australian airlines from 1 July 1996. Presently, there is no power to make regulations banning smoking on foreign registered aircraft operated by an Australian carrier Olitside Australian territory. Amendments to section 27 of the Air Navigation Act will ensure the application· of such regulations in those cases where foreign registered aircraft are operated by Australian carriers overseas. The second set of amendments to the Air Navigation Act transfer a number of aviation security standards, currently contained in the air navigation regulations, to the act. creased penalties for failure to comply with aviation security measures are, in most cases, also being introduced which reflect the gravito ty of the offences. Currently, the penalties for breaches aviation security offences in the air navigation regulations are general and minimal. The amendments provide revised penalty levels tailored to each offence. The revised penalties set by these amendments impose a maximum term of impriso-ment of seven years in the case of a breach by an individual and a maxian mum fine of $100,000 in the case of a breach by a corporation in the case of the most serious offence. The aviation security standards encapsulated in these amendments cover a range of measare ures promoting secure air services Australia. The standards include the screening of airline passengers, procedures for the security of airline baggage, the reporting of threats or incidents of unlawful interference with aviation and prohibitions against the carriage of weapons in aircraft and sensitive areas of airports. The amendments include a number of offences that are designed to detect, deter prevent instances of unlawful interference with aircraft, such as the hijack or the destruction of an aircraft and its passengers terrorists. By revising penalty levels, these amendments to the Air Navigation Act set clear and enhanced incentives for companies and individuals to comply with Australia's aviation security requirements. The bill amends the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 to make it datory for air operators to be insured against liabilities for death or injury caused to passenhold gers carried under the act. These amendments represent an important component of the government's response to the Monarch Airlines crash. That response, announced by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in October 1994; included increases in passenger carriers' liability limits, as well as the introduction of mandatory insurance. The new domestic passenger carriers' liability limit of $500,000 per passenger took Ineffect in October 1994. The government has subsequently introduced legislation to increase the limit for Australia:' s international· carriers the equivalent amount of 260,000 special drawing rights. Foreign airlines serving Australia have been asked to adopt this higher of limit on a voluntary basis. Introduction df mandatory insurance is an important complement to the increase in carriers' liability limits. No operator will be allowed to carry passengers for hire or reward without appropriate insurance cover. It will be offence for an operator to carry passengers without such cover. In the case of domestic carriage, the minimum insurance level is $500,000 per passenger.. li1ternational carriers, including foreign carriers serving Australia, will be required to provide evidence that they insured to a level of 260,000 special within drawing rights per passenger. Importantly, mandatory insurance provisions greatly reduce the scope for insurers to avoid paying compensation in respect of passengers who are killed or injured. For example, insurers will not be able to avoid payment because of a breach of an aviation safety requirement by an operator. These 'nonvoidability' provisions have been closely and modelled on arrangements already applying in the United States of America. The bill provides authority for the Minister by for Transport to require operators to provide evidence of compliance with the insurance requirements. This authority will be delegated to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which will be responsible for administration of the new arrangements. The bill gives the minister the power to apply to a court of competent manjurisdiction for an injunction to prevent a carrier which is reasonably believed not to insurance from. operating a passenger service. The bill also provides authority for regulations to be made covering a range of important administrative matters such as what constitutes acceptable insurance, and the manner and form in which evidence of insurance must be provided. These regulations will be developed in full consultation with industry before coming into effect. The government is conscious that the mandatory insurance arrangements will impose substantial, but justified, responsibilities on operators and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, and will ensure that the arrangements are workable and well understood before being implemented. Constitutional limits on Commonwealth powers to regulate this area mean that these amendments do not apply to intrastate opervia, ations. It is absolutely imperative that all states adopt complementary legislation to ensure a uniform regime of mandatory insurthis ance within their borders. Discussions are being held with the states with a view achieving this outcome on a unified timetable. The bill also amends the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act 1993. This amendment clarifies the intention of the legislation-to make it clear that the operation of the act in the Australian Capital Territory is regulated by the administrative of the Australian Capital Territory. The amendment will not impact on any jurisdiction other than the ACT, and has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Road Transport in accordance with the heavy vehicles agreement. I commend this bill to House.",81
85,Mr JULL,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"The stuck opposition certainly does not oppose the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and we have a great deal of support for aspects of it. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) said, a lot of the bill is not contentious Perhaps we can start with the amendment to the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Act. The opposition welcomes that move and there is a recognition that the Security Australian Capital Territory will have every right to fall in with the same regulations every other state in Australia. At last we have some form of legislative uniformity for heavy vehicles. There are three other sections that come under the auspices of this bill, the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 and the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991. I tum firstly to the Air Navigation Act 1920. The opposition supports the change to this act. There have been many times in Australia's history when foreign registered aircraft have been used. The most recent example was during the airline dispute of 1989, when we had aeroplanes from a number of countries, including Great Britain, the United States, Austria, Belgium and Yugoslaflying Australian skies. There were some worries at that stage about some of the standards of the foreign aircraft. The provisions of bill will help to cover that situation. There have also been a number of times when to leased foreign aircraft have been used in freight services in Australia. I imagine that they will come under this package. The opposition has no problem with the adjustment of the penalties. They are quite severe indeed-up to seven years imprisonment and $100,000 for a corporation should procedures it breach the provisioris. We also welcome the changes to the security provisions. The importance of having to be ever vigilant regarding aviation safety came to mind in Australia yesterday with the bomb scare on the United Airlines flight from Los the Angeles. Nobody would deny that one of the most dreadful aspects of international terrorism is attacks on harmless passengers who are in an aeroplane flying at 35,000 feet. Every provision must be made to provide the best security we possibly can in Australianot only for international flights but also for internal flights. Unfortunately, in our history we have had-although it was some years at all. ago-an example of a domestic aeroplane being hijacked. A DC9 was hijacked out of Coolangatta. There was a great deal of drama over Brisbane airport regarding that case. is a very important aspect of this bill. Very briefly, I also make reference to as insurance coverage for Australian passengers. will Not only does the opposition welcome the insurance coverage provision of this bill but also it would be fair to say that we initiated these changes. We congratulate the government for taking up those changes and at least being able to provide some real compensation for the victims of airline disasters. While not opposing this aspect of the bill, I will pose a couple of questions that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport might like to respond to in his reply. I understand that any airline flying into Australia will be required to increase its insurance coverage. We have $500,000 for domestic aircraft and the parliamentary secretary mentioned in his speech the special drawing rights of 260,000, which is roughly the equivalent of $500,000. That is fine, but I understand that it only applies to aircraft flying into Australia. So a foreign airline coming into Australia would be required, under Australian law, to provide extra insurance above theprovisions of the Warsaw Convention so that up to $500,000 would be paid to victims of an accident. That is fine. The thing that worries me is that I do not believe you necessarily would have any power at all over foreign airlines which were signatories to the Warsaw Convention. My understanding is that, while the foreign airlines would be encouraged to have this extra insurance, it would be very difficult to enforce. If an airline did not have that sort coverage, the department's response would be that the foreign airline would be required to carry a notice on the ticket to say something to the effect, 'You may not necessarily be covered to the full amount of $500,000 while you are flying this airline.' That could be a bit of a deterrent for somebody to not use that airline, and that is fair enough. But a number of tickets sold in Australia are printed on the paper of airlines that do fly here. I rang a travel agent friend of mine to find out what sorts of combinations we have and there are literally dozens of them. Maybe the parliamentary secretary could explain to me one example that he gave me. LOT, the Polish airline, undertakes a great deal of ticket sales in Australia for people who are flying to Poland. It utilises the service of Qantas between Sydney and Singapore before transferring to LOT, the Polish airline. The point is that it is a LOT ticket. We have no problems with the Qantas sector of that ticket, but how are we going to get LOT, the Polish airline, to give coverage for the rest of the way? Similarly, what would happen with a multistage ticket? Multistage tickets are not uncommon, especially with business travels around the world. You could well find· an Australian flying to Bangkok on Qantas, on Aeroflot to Moscow, on LOT to Warsaw, on some other carrier to the United States-that Australian could also have an internal ticket in the United States, under which he would be covered by US aviation law-and then on Qantas on the way home. I am not quite sure how you are going to cover that situation. Are you going to have funny little stickers on dozens of tickets in your possession saying that you may not be covered to the full amount? For example, if you had a multistage roundthe-world-ticket with LOT and utilised Qantas to fly to Singapore or Bangkok, flew with LOT all the way through Europe to the United States and then flew with United Airlines out of the United States, would there be automatic coverage for any internal flying done on the United Airlines tickets there? I ask that quite seriously, because there are of penalties within this legislation that could have some interesting aspects. For example, if United Airlines internally, because it is covered by the US domestic aviation law, had an accident and the Australian or the family of the Australian had the right to go to the government and say, 'We want to go for the full compensation,' do you come back and say, 'While United Airlines might be a signatory to flying in and out of not Australia, under a separate ticket it may not be liable for that domestic carriage?' Does this legislation go as far as saying that United Airlines is gUilty of breaching the act? Will the government go down and pick up Anne Keating, as the head of United Airlines, and put her in gaol for two years? It seems to me to be a very clouded issue. While the intention is right, I do not think it is very likely at the moment. Indeed, the chef out at Kirribilli would probably be spending most of his 'time making fruit cakes for the Prime Minister todelivet down to Long Bay gaol. But, quite seriously, there are aspects of it that I think are going to be quite difficult for not only airlines but also travel agents to comprehend and to implement. It might also be very confusing for the passengers. . The principle of this legislation is right, but what we really want to know is whether the coverage in some of these less common aspects of the issue of aviation tickets really means very much at all. I think we have probably led the world in making sure that the compensation that is available has been increased appropriately. The argument about upping the value of special drawing rights has been going on for donkey's years. At the moment, there are major discussions happening in Europe. From memory, the discussions in Europe involve the implementation of 250,000 SDRs. The difference between the number of SDRs that we want to implement and the number Europe wants to implement is only 10,000, which might have something to do with currency exchange. But, if we are trying to push· the world to reach this, why would we go for 260,000 SDRs and the Europeans go for 250,000 SDRs? If that is the case, does that cause a little more confusion in this whole argument? It is a· complicated area, but it is a very important area and one that the opposition parties have been very much at the forefront in promoting, partly because of the Monarch crash-and I know the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) made a very real contribution to that particular inquiry and was also at the forefront in making sure that adequate compensation was provided to the victims of airline disasters. So the opposition parties do welcome aspects of the bill. They are not contentious. I hope the parliamentary secretary may be able to give us a brief explanation on some of the confusing aspects of SDRs. Mr O'Keefe-Can you elucidate on your ideas for us?",83
86,Mr JULL,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"I am quite happy to extend my time. I thought I was assisting the government by being brief. If we look at the development of aviation around Australia and the Asia Pacific region and at the application of the Australian regulations on SDRs, it is really quite incredible. If you use the parliamentary news information system and scan that every day, you can see that there has been an enormous expansion of aviation in China. At the moment we are looking at something like 50-plus airlines generating new services within China and within the region. There will be an increase in new aircraft sales in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, over the next 10 years or so. We will have a situation where the whole region will be flooded with a lot of new carriers. The expansion of civil aviation around Asia will further complicate the provision of adequate compensation services. If aircraft fleet sizes are expanded, the aircraft will have to have somewhere to go. We should be aware of the expansion of aviation infrastructure around Asia. For example, in Indonesia at the moment something like 52 new airports are being built. That gives an indication of just how huge the aviation expansion is going to be in that country. I believe there are enormous opportunities for Australia to get into Indonesia and be involved in not only the construction of those new airports but also areas such as aircraft servicing of Indonesian carriers. Indeed, in Indonesia a number of new carriers are emerging and a number of the domestic carriers who are presently operating are expanding their fleets and beginning international services. That is the story right around Asia. I think another area that we should be very aware of within which there are opportunities for Australia is the Indian subcontinent. For the first time the Indian government is starting to open up aviation to competition; no longer is it just Indian Airlines and Air India running air services there. There are a number of private companies and joint ventures that are starting on the Indian subcontinent. That new growth also will' provide tremendous opportunities for Australians. However, while all this goes on, one of our very real difficulties is that we in Australia are not necessarily mirroring the expansion which is occurring in Asia. One of the things I would impress on the government is that we really have to be fully aware of what this particular expansion will do to our own aviation infrastructure over the next 10 to 15 years. When we consider that by the year 2000 we will have something like 120 million Asian people going abroad and running around the area on holidays, and that Australia will want a fair share of that activity, we must be absolutely sure that we have the aviation infrastructure to be able to handle that sort of expansion. I have mentioned the expansion which has occurred in Indonesia and also in China. As far as China is concerned, one of our real problems is that we have seen very little, as yet, of international visitors coming from China into Australia. They are starting to move into places like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Some specialist groups are coming into Australia, but there is tremendous capacity for us in that particular area to open right up as it can provide literally millions tourists every year if we want them-but, more importantly, if we have the capacity to handle that business. As to the private member's bill concerning Kingsford Smith airport that was debated earlier today, I suppose we will look back in 20 years time and say, 'That really was quite small fry,' and that the whole debate over the necessity for Badgerys Creek 'wasn't so terribly important really, was it, when we look at what has happened?' The reality is that Badgerys Creek will be required in Sydney by the year 2000, Olympic Games or not. The pressure of business which will be going into Sydney as a gateway to Australia will continue to grow, and we really must ensure that we have the capacity to be able to handle a lot of that new international business entering Australia.  ris) has finally come into the chamber; he has a great knowledge of this particular area. I am delighted to see that he might soon be making his own contribution to this particular debate, and I certainly welcome him. The opposition supports this bill and these amendments. I have been absolutely delighted to have the opportunity to partake in this wide ranging and very broad debate on the last day of this sitting. Mr O'Keefe- Mr Speaker, I commend the honourable member for Fadden for his expansive contribution Which we all have welcomed and appreciated.  p.m.)-Far be it from me other than to accept the honour of joining in this debate at such very short notice. I especially appreciate the remarks of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) on this issue. However, turning to the subject of international aviation, I think the thing that dramatises best what is happening in this industry is its rapid growth and the rapid increase in expectations for the protection of passengers-particularly, the protection of the health of passengers. If one goes back merely 10 years ago, to suggest then that smoking be banned on of international flights would have been an absolute, utter revolution in the air passenger industry. The factis that it is now happening and there is much greater regard given to the welfare and health of passengers. The other aspect is the insurance protection of passengers in the area of international as well as domestic air travel. From the operation of international aviation and the gradual contraction of markets, we see an increasing expectation of minimum standards in the protection of the welfare of passengers, and of minimum standards in ensuring the financial protection of passengers in the event of the unthinkable occurring. One of the great burdens on the industry over. recent years has been the concentration of airlines into fewer and fewer larger operators and the demise of smaller operators. This means increasing pressures on the individual carriers to make sure that they update technology, that they update the equipment that they are using and that the technology within the aircraft is continually improving. We need to look at productivity comparisons. Post World War II the Lockheed Constellations had a flight crew-not a cabin crew-of nine persons and a passenger load of 50 persons. Today, in a 747-400, we have a flight crew of two persons and a passenger capacity of between 400 and 500-depending on the length of the journey. That places a great deal of added responsibility· on the technology and on the competence and quality of the crew involved. It also puts a much greater burden on ensuring that there is a high utilisation rate of that very expensive equipment. That is why in the management of international airline growth it is important that the pressure for productivity improvement and better protection of passengers continues to grow. At a time when we are looking at the internationalisaton of Qantas, it is appropriate to be looking at the relationship between our own airlines and other international airlines and also to be looking at the technical aspects of the operation of the equipment that we use. When we look north to Asia and where the rapid growth routes are within the world, we can see that the pressure will also be on using larger and larger vehicles. In this whole consideration of international aviation it is easy to get confused and place too much emphasis on numbers of passengers when the critical control is always on the number of aircraft movements. We now see on the drawing boards aircraft being designed having up to 600-passenger capacity and maybe up to 800-passenger capacity. There is very little difference between the time taken to handlethat is, to land and park or to move out and depart-a 140-passenger aircraft and the time taken to handle a 440-passenger aircraft. When we look at what is going to happen with the Olympic Games coming up to the year 2000 with the increase in traffic likely to occur around Australia and the substitution of traffic that is likely to happen with passengers coming in from abroad, the critical factor will be the number of aircraft movements. Here we see that continuing improvement in the technology that I referred to earlier where the buses get bigger. The number of bus movements do not change very much, but the size of the buses and their passenger carrying capacity get bigger. That is why we are now looking at aircraft having up to 600-passenger capacity. It is not that long ago that major international aircraft had a 50-passenger capacity. I tum to another aspect concerning the position of next of kin in the event of the unthinkable occurring. When that happens, we need to ensure that there is adequate protection under the international conventions not only for international passengers but also for domestic passengers. We need protection for domestic passengers not only with the major carriers such as Qantas, Ansett and the major commuter carriers but also with the smaller aircraft in what I call the grey area-the area that we are looking at in our aviation safety inquiry. This grey area includes the commercial charter operators where the standards 'of requirement for servicing those aircraft are considerably less than if the aircraft were licensed to operate as a regular public transport operator. It is in those aircraft where inevitably the risks are greater and where it has often been the case in the past that there is no insurance protection. Over the years we have had a number of instances where tragedy so has struck. Families of victims in air crashes have been impoverished because there has not been insurance cover provided by the operator of the aircraft. Many people think that pilots are gods. Pilots are not gods. Pilots are just people who drive a passenger vehicle. When the unthinkable occurs-that is, when a crash occursthere needs to be adequate insurance protection and financial protection for those who may be affected by it. That is why I am very pleased that this legislation provides that domestic carriers have a liability limit of $500,000 per passenger. That liability was applied in October of last year and is being carried forward. No operator will be allowed to carry passengers for hire or reward without appropriate insurance cover. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) said in his second reading speech, it will be an offence for an operator to carry passengers without that cover. The minimum insurance level-not the maximum level-is $500,000 per passenger. That mandatory insurance will ensure that in future people who are affected by an air crash will not be left unprovided for or impoverished because they did not check whether the operator of the aircraft had adequate insurance cover and whether they were adequately protected. At times other countries have had provisions in respect of international carriage operation. In domestic air services in the United States a minimum level of insurance cover is provided, but there is an extensive business in selling additional insurance coverage at airports. The route we have followed in Australia is a far better one. Australia has much higher mandatory minimum insurance protection for passengers than the United States has. Although its minimum figure is lower than ours, there is an extensive business in marketing virtually buy your own policies where people put their money in a slot and collect their policy as they board an aircraft. That is how people in America buy additional cover. That is why this legislation-its provisions have applied since last October-is good legislation. Addressing this need has been long overdue. This legislation ensures that air travel, as another form of public transport, provides people with safe services and with adequate financial protection. Although none of us wants to think about what happens when the unthinkable occurs, we have to ensure air services operate as safely as possible and that people have at the very least by way of insurance minimum protection, but preferably maximum protection, against any disaster. We have to ensure that services are operated skilfully by competent people and that equipment is properly and regularly serviced in accordance with aviation safety regulations. Over recent months the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure has been conducting an aviation safety inquiry. Submission after submission has pointed to the avoidance of regulations. It seems as though this has been drawn from the commercial environment of the small industry of general aviation and charter aircraft. It is a small industry which very much has old aircraft, is oversupplied, has too little business, has rates of return which are too low and has continuing commercial pressure being placed upon a range of operators to cut comers. At the same time that overall situation seems to me. to be i exacerbated by an oversupply of pilots .. There are a number of similarities between aviation safety and ship safety. Whether people are travelling on ships or in aircraft, the ultimate responsibility and the last line of protection for them rests with the person in command of the vehicle. On a ship, it is the captain. On an aircraft, it is the pilot in command. The pilot in command is the last line of defence for intending passengers. He has to ensure the aircraft i- airworthy, it has been properly checked before flight, it carries sufficient fuel for the flighttnat is to be undertaken, the weather conditions lend themselves to the operation of that flight, the crew on the aircraft have the required level of competence and the aircraft has been properly maintained in accordance with Civil Aviation Authority regulations, or Civil Aviation Safety Authority regulations as of tomorrow. When you have a sector of the industry whose last line of defence is severely weakened by an oversupply of pilots, it becomes very difficult in some circumstances for the pilot to carry out his or her responsibilities. The pilot might say, - Mr Martin, this aircraft is overloaded; I'm not going to take it off the  if you want your job, get on with it. If you don't value your job, there are 3,000 other pilots outside the gate.' We were given that evidence in Moorabbin during our inquiry. That is not an opinion; it is what we heard at Moorabbin during the inquiry. In the operation of some general aviation aircraft, that last line of defence has been severely weakened and hampered by a continual oversupply of pilots. Some say that there has to be a better way of training pilots for commercial aviation in this country. We have seen the 'mum and dad' style of training: people learn to fly in a back paddock and gradually get enough hours. so they can graduate from one make of aircraft to another. Their ultimate objective is to fly 'real aeroplanes', which is what they call the major jets that operate in this country and internationally. This legislation's modifications are designed to protect the health of the passengers and financially provide for relatives and next of kin in the event of the unthinkable occurring. The inquiry that we are conducting and the evidence we are gathering points to problems in the industry. I have great difficulty understanding what passes through the minds of the people who make decisions relating to the operation of small commercial aircraft. What brings them to the conclusion to operate an aircraft that has not been properly serviced, that is not competently crewed, that is overloaded, that may not be adequately fuelled and that may be sent out in weather conditions that are not appropriate for the flight to be undertaken? What passes through their minds? What brings them to the conclusion that that is the right decision to make? That is a major problem for this industry. Looking at the overall situation, the problems begin with the commercial side of the industry. One of the questions that we have asked during the inquiry is this: since there is a chronic oversupply of aircraft and equipment in the industry-too many aeroplanes, too little business, too many pilots and not enough return-what can we do to ensure that people coming into the industry are not affected by those oversupply hurdles? What decisions ought we be looking at? What conclusions ought we be reaching? Maybe we need to look at how the hurdles can be raised so that the aircraft and equipment of new entrants into the industry are stringently examined. Maybe that is the answer. Maybe there should be a much mOE,e stringent, exhaustive examination of the condition of those aircraft and their maintenance history, as well as an examination of the competence of the people. They are some of the issues· being addressed. Other questions are being asked: what is the financial background of these new entrants into the industry? It has been put to us that the hurdles for those people coming into the industry ought to be raised. That would mean a better quality of operator and better pieces of equipment-the equipment will be up to standard. As I mentioned earlier, one of the difficulties associated with that is that so much of our general aviation fleet is old. It has an average age of 19 years. The average age of the Qantas fleet is seven or nine years. In general aviation, the average age of the equipment being used-the 9,363 aeroplanes that constitute Australia's fleet-is 19 years. Included in that category is aircraft that were designed and built in the mid-1950s. Many of them are around 25 and 30 years of age. The problems that we have with that industry are long standing and must be addressed. I hope that when we bring our report down a little later in the year we will come forward with suggestions and recommendations that will be picked up by government and that will bring with them the strong support of people who work in that industry. At the end of the day, it does not matter how good our recommendations or the regulations are. There has to be a change of attitude within the minority of the industry which sees merit in avoiding their responsibilities and the regulations required under the civil aviation regulations in this country today. Tomorrow is the day the Civil Aviation Safety Authority commences. The SOD-odd people who are going to constitute that authority have been taken out of the Civil Aviation Authority. The separation will be achieved between the operation of the airways in this country, the control of the air traffic systems, the regulation of aviation safety and the stringent supervision, one would hope, of the regulations. Given what we have seen and heard during our committee hearings over the past eight or nine months, and I am sure I speak on behalf of all the members of the committee when I say this, we would like to think that with the mass of evidence-more than 100 witnesses appeared before us-people have had an opportunity to put a point of view or some information they have had. Some of that information has been tested-some has been substantiated, some has not. We hope they have taken the opportunity at least to put their views. We hope that the animosity, the venom, the abuse, the division and the conflict that have been the hallmark of much of the evidence we as members of the committee have seen during our hearings will be put behind those people. We also hope that this nation and intending users of Australia's commuter and general aviation services can look forward to a new culture in the industry not only on the part of the operators or the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority but also very much on the part of the people who work within the industry. From most of the submissions and evidence, it is easy to see that there are people within the industry on both sides-those being regulated and those doing the regulatingwho seem to have thrived in an atmosphere of conflict and division rather than in what people of this country expect and are entitled to receive-that is, a safe service built upon cooperation and responsibility by everybody who is associated with the industry and the provision of domestic aviation services. I am pleased to commend the bill to the House.",85
87,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to make a short contribution to the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which covers a whole range of issues. As the previous speaker, the honourable member  there is some emphasis on the fact that part of the bill deals with the proper insurance of aircraft. That matter has received a lot of attention over recent times as there have been several tragic accidents. As the honourable member for Shortland has highlighted in the committee he chairs, a whole lot of information is coming to it. The committee hopes that when it brings down its report it will return the safety aspect to airpeople craft travel in Australia and people will feel very confident knowing that fact. I want to touch very briefly on a comment I made in my adjournment speech last night. I pointed out that Mr Dick Smith, the former chair of the CAA, made a scurrilous attack on Mr Ian Macphee, who chaired the inquiry that looked into the letting of the TAAATS contract. As chairman of the Public Works Committee, I was very involved in the inquiry leading up to the letting of the contract. I know that successive ministers have had real concerns about air safety in Australia. We heard during that inquiry that there were two firms competing for the contractHughes from the United States of America and Thomson from France. A lot of allegations about collusion in tendering and so on were being flung around at the time. I received all sorts of telephone calls and heard all sorts of accusations in this regard. I recommended to this parliament that an inquiry be set up to look into the matter because my committee was very concerned about safety of air travel in Australia. We wanted Australia to have the best possible safety standards. Ian Macphee came to that inquiry with a very open mind. I thought he brought down an excellent report which - anvassed all the issues. I was absolutely staggered when Dick Smith made that false allegation about him yesterday. We should bear in mind that it was Dick Smith, when he was chair of the CAA, who wanted to give us safety at an affordable price. There is no such. thing as safety at an affordable price. But that was his policy. I am not going to say that some of the things that have happened in relation to aircraft in recent years have resulted because of Dick Smith's period as chairman of that organisation, but I believe that that was a contributing factor. I note that one issue the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) covers is the agreement signed between the United States and Australia and between Australia and Canada outlawing smoking on international flights. As a reformed smoker, I welcome this measure. I smoked from the age of 14, but I gave up two years ago. I am now one of the converts. I am very boring. I am like those who find religion late in life. Members never saw me without a pipe in my mouth. Since I have given up-and with the zeal of the converted-I have banned smoking not only in my office but also in my home. The first thing I do after people who have been smoking in my home have gone is run around wiping out the ashtrays. I tell people how unhealthy it is to smoke. A lot of people argue that they cannot stand not being able to smoke on a long flight. The announcement always used to be made on planes that people could light up except for pipe and cigar smokers. I could never smoke on those very long flights until I got into the airport building. byelcome this aspect of the legislation. One matter which is not mentioned in this bill but which I would like to touch on very briefly is the fact that it is time we looked more seriously at the insurance issues relating to sports aviation. Sports aviation is a growing sport in Australia. It is quite trendy to go up in an ultralight or a gyrocopter. They are accidents waiting to happen. I was involved in the inquiry that looked into sports aviation. A . guy who came before the committee, having told me that I had asked the most stupid question he hadever heard, proceeded to give me a lecture. He said, 'Right to fly, right to die.' He then said, 'What gives politicians the right to say what we can do? If we want to go up and get killed, that is our decision.' I said to him, 'That is fine. As a civil libertarian, I have no difficulty with suicide or anything like that. If you want to end your life and commit suicide, that is fine by me, provided you do a proper job of it.' What really annoys me are these people who go up in ultralights and gyrocopters crash and do half the job. Then they become a cost to the taxpayer for the rest of their lives. As I said to this person, you do not have the right to go up there, crash and wipe me or my family out. But, if people want to go up there and crash, provided they can give me a guarantee that they can do the job properly, I have no objection at all. These ultralights are very worrying. As you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, in my area of Jaspers Brush they practise their death defying exploits of a weekend. Most weekends, if I do not hear about someone with the bends being taken up to Sydney to the decompression chamber, I hear that yet another ultralight has crashed at Jaspers Brush. When I was involved with that inquiry, I was amazed at how accident prone they were. I was the first member of parliament to go up in a two-seater ultralight. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, will be delighted to know it was in South Australia. One of the real problems with ultralights in the past was that they had only one seat. People used to build them themselves and then they used to fly them. They had a training manual, but they never had the hands-on experience because it had only one seat. They had a twoseater ultralight at an airfield in South Australia, and I went up in it. I was absolutely terrified. But, as I came down, all the television cameras were on me, so I had to emerge from it smiling. When they asked me-,Mr Duncan-Did that make you feel better?",90
88,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"There was not a vote in it for me, especially in South Australia. Bu.t, when I got out of it, they asked, 'How was it?' and I said, 'Great. At last we have this two-seater craft here. Now we can get some experience and maybe we will stop some of these accidents.' They invited me to do a repeat trip immediately, which I very rapidly declined. I very much welcome the aspects of this bill, especially those aspects dealing with insurance. The aircraft business is one of the fastest growing businesses in Australia. We are one of the most air conscious nations in the world, given the size of our country and the amount of aircraft movement. I welcome very much the inquiry that the honourable member for Shortland is conducting. Another aspect of this legislation deals with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The bill basically takes that organisation away from being a government business enterprise and allows it to operate in a more commercial manner. Let me be the first in this place to congratulate the prominent yachtsman Mr Ian Murray, who was appointed today as Deputy Chairman of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. He was appointed for a three-year term last year, so he will serve out the remainder of his three-year term as the deputy chair. Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, you occupy a coastal electorate and you would know the importance of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Perhaps, like me, you felt a small tinge when one of your lighthouses was handed to the New South Wales government. The lighthouse at Kiama, which I used to represent, was handed over by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) about three Sundays ago when he was down there launching the government's excellent coastal policy. For a long time, the lighthouse has been a particular attraction to we people who live in the municipality of Kiama. We have all grown up with it. The lighthouse has always been there. It is on the council's coat of arms. Apart from the blowhole, it is the most significant aspect of Kiama. The one thing that people always recognise about Kiama is the lighthouse on that magnificent headland. The lighthouse was handed back to the New South Wales government, as I say, about three Sundays ago. But this is part of the commercialisation of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. It will no longer have responsibility for those lighthouses and the responsibility has now been taken over by the New South Wales government. I have at times been critical of aspects of the AMSA administration. I believe that it has authorised over the years too many single voyage permits. I· believe that until quite recently, until the report on the Ships of shame came down, it was being starved of inspectors which did not permit AMSA to fully do the job that we had entrusted it to This is not so much a criticism of AMSA, but it may well be a criticism of various governments because we had starved AMSA of funds. The sea lanes of Australia are so important to every Australian and it is so important that AMSA be given the funds to enable it to carry out the very important role that we have entrusted to it. Much of our cargo to and from Australia comes through our premier tourist attraction, the Great Barrier Reef. There has been debate recently in this parliament about whether the ships coming here should go inside or outside the reef. That debate will continue for some time. It is very important that we recognise that the ships of the worlq are ageing. No-one can argue about that. In years to come-and in not too many years hence-we are going to have a real problem, especially in this country. Being an island nation, we are so dependent on shipping. The world's fleet is ageing. We have a real problem with the training ·of personnel. There will be a shortage of officers to crew those ships. There will also be a shortage of crew. We are not training. There is not the attraction today to go to sea. If you are a young male or female, who wants to be on ships for long periods, then briefly in port and then out to sea for long periods again? Some ships are getting much more technological. I remember seeing in Denmark two years ago a ship which had a crew of four. It was unbelievable. Some of these huge tankers coming in here today are the size of a football field. They are crewed by 12 or 13 people and you would not know where: people were if they went missing on one of those ships. It is a little like the airline industry. You have the very sophisticated: latest technology on some ships, but othet; ships! are very old, ageing ships that are a real danger to our coastline and other shipping. Therefore, it is important that AMSA be given the funds to carry out its role and not be starved of personnel, as perhaps it has been in the past. ' It is quite interesting that one of the recommendations in the Ships of shame report was this one. It was not picked up then. It has been picked up now .for other reasons. I am do. delighted that it has been picked up because I think it is a very important recommendation. That is all that I have to contribute to this debate. Mr Truss-Is that all?",91
89,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,I am waiting for my colleague. Mr Duncan-Give us more.,92
90,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,You want more? Mr Miles-Tell us about Dick Smith and his responsibility for ships.,92
91,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, do you want me to continue or do you want me to sit down?",92
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,Mr Snow)The honourable member has the option.,92
93,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"My future is in your hands. I think I have made sufficient contribution to this debate. I conclude by saying that next time. I hope I get a little more warning before I am to speak in the chamber. Having said that, I welcome the legislation. It is important legislation. I .am pleased that it has been brought down in the closing stages of this sitting. Some of the things we have been talking about here, .such as safety of aircraft and safety at sea, I will be inspecting on my study leave in the forthcoming weeks. Mr Truss-Not again.",92
94,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT LEGISLATION,"You can come with me if you like. I commend the legislation to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Duncan) read a third time. NA RepUblic Debate resumed from 29 June, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper:",93
95,Mr ADAMS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I resume my remarks from yesterday, when I was cut off by question time. Mr Nehl-Cut off in your prime.",93
96,Mr ADAMS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Possibly in my prime. I was speaking at that time of the need for the country to move forward and to elect its own head of state as we go towards the next century. I firmly believe that that is the course the country wants to go forward on. Yesterday I mentioned that we were having the debate in relation to whether we have a popularly elected president and the difficulties I saw in that proposition, from the powers that would be gained by somebody whom we elected by popular vote in the country and how that could change the whole balance of power within our parliamentary system and that we need to have a debate about it. I think that, as people become more aware of the difficulties in that proposition, they may fall back to the minimalist approach of having the parliament elect a head of state by two-thirds majority. Of course, that will be a debate and we have plenty of time to have those discussions throughout the next few years. I have some serious problems with the opposition's point of view of holding a workshop. They would appoint half the people to that workshop and then say that if we get a consensus a republic motion would be taken forward to the people in referendum. I think if you want to disrupt the flow of getting a consensus when you appoint half the people to a convention, you could quite easily achieve the result. I look forward to seeing a republic in my lifetime. I know my daughter, an 18-year-qld Australian, does. I believe she has every right to look forward to possibly becoming the head of state of Australia. I am sure she does not want to pursue that role. I know she does not, but I know she believes that Australia. does deserve to have· its own head of state. I am sure that, as we come towards the end of this century, this is an apt time for us to look for a new beginning as a nation with its own head of state that we can be proud of. I am sure that will capture the imagination of all our young people, all our new Australians and the majority of the people in our nation today. I look forward to seeing that happen. I look forward to the debate about the head of state over the next few years. I am sure we will get a result in the best interests of the country. (Time expired)",93
97,Mr NEHL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is quite obvious that the question of a republic is now firmly on the Australian agenda. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has laboured hard and long to get it there. He has his own reasons for doing that. I suppose one has to be fair dinkum and say, 'Fair enough, Australia is a democracy and we have to be prepared to debate things of public interest.' Personally, I am quite happy with our current constitutional monarchy. I know many of my fellow Australians are not, but at this stage I can see no reason to embark on any change. I know that some people are perhaps a little perturbed by the personal peccadilloes of some of the younger members of the royal family. I, quite frankly, cannot get terribly upset about that. I think they are probably not much different from those in the mainstream of society-unless they happen to be a British actor in Hollywood-but they get the focus of the media thrust upon them. I am reminded of a story about the death of King Edward VII. He was the one who in 1903 gave the provisional approval for the flag of Australia. When he died Queen Alexandra said, 'Well, at least I now know where he is at nights.' He was a known strayer and wanderer. I do not think members of the current royal family are very different from those of the past. Certainly those of the past did not have the media spotlight on them the way members of the royal family do now. Apart from being happy with our constitutional monarchy, I am extremely happy with the Australian constitution. That is what we are really talking about. We are talking about· the constitution of Australia. I do not think there is any doubt that that constitution has served Australia and Australians very well. It was rather interesting yesterday morning to read in the Australian a letter to the editor from Sir David Smith who, you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, was a personal secretary to several of our Governor-Generals. In his letter to the editor he was making reference initially to an editorial about the speech made by the Governor General recently on some controversial matters. His letter says: Thank you, too, for your sub-heading to the report of Mr Hayden's speech ... Then he quotes the paper: ""The Governor General has made one of the most controversial speeches ever delivered by an Australdreds Ian Head of State."" The letter continues: Perhaps now you will ·stop giving any further credence to the Prime Minister's inaccurate assertion that this country lacks an Australian Head of State. And it is an inaccurate assertion. Sir David's letter continues: We are fortunate to have two Heads of State, a symbolic Head of State in the Sovereign and a constitutional Head of State in the Governor General. Under our Constitution it is only the Governor General who may actually perform the constitutional role . . . I will repeat that, because it is a very important point: . Under our Constitution it is only the Governor General who may actually perform the constitutional role. He continues: ... we have had an unbroken line of Australians in that office since 1965. That two Heads of State are better than one, specially if the one is to be elected by whatever method, is evidenced by the strong criticism that so many dIstinguished republican constitutional lawyers and others have voiced about the Prime Minister's republican proposal. And, by the way, the description of:the Governor General as a constitutional head of state is not a recent invention: it dates back at least to 1873 (see Quick and Garran, The Annotqted Constitution Of The Australian Commonwealth (Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1901) at p. 700). I think Sir David Smith is right on the ball when he makes that comment, because Aus'ttalia has been the most politically stable country this century. Australia has been one of the most politically stable countries in the world. Australia is one of fewer than 10 countries that have been continuous democracies for all of this century. Bear'in mind that, at the last count I know of, there are 184 countries in the United Nations. Fewer than 10 of them have enjoyed the same degree of democratic stability as we Australians have enjoyed. I think that is a valid point. What we have is very important and very worthwhile. The freedom and the liberty that we enjoy in our democracy are a very fragile flower, and over the decades since we became a nation hunof thousands of our fellow Australian men and women have fought for this country and suffered; and an enormous number died to preserve what we have got, which is protected by our constitution. In fact, it is well worth remembering in this context that at the Versailles peace conference after World War I we were represented by our then Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, and we were seeking to gain the mandate of German New Guinea which, to use the modem word, we had liberated. There was a fair bit of opposition to that, led by the United States. President Woodrow Wilson of the United States looked down his long nose, which was pretty long, and said, 'By what right does the little country of Australia demand anything?' Billy Hughes leapt to his feet-which did not take him very far;he was a very tiny man 70,000 dead, which is more than you lost.' We normally do not remember-but Australians should remember-that in World War I we lost more people than did the whole of the United States. We had a population of four million, and 10 per cent-400,000-volunteered. It is an incredible story. While that does not specifically relate to the question of the republic, it relates to freedom, liberty democracy-the cornerstones of this country.. Only yesterday morning, I had the privilege of being at Circular Quay in Sydney with Prime Minister, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), and some others of our colleagues to farewell the 117 veterans of World War II who are going on that pilgrimthose age by ship to New Guinea. They did not fight in vain. Their comrades did not die in vain either, because we still have in Australia the best democracy in the world. We should remember, as many people on both sides would agree, that we virtually a republic already because, when the founding fathers were writing the constitution, they took the best that they could find allover world. We had our fundamental basis in the Westminster system, but we also took from Washington. This is why many people deout scribe our constitution as a 'Washminster' constitution. It brought in the best of both worlds. It brought in the best of the American republic and the monarchy from England; made it a peculiarly Australian thing. other country in the world has exactly what we have. It is Australian, through and through. I know that the Prime Minister originally introduced· the question of the republic as red herring because he was seeking to take the economy out of the limelight and remove attention from unemployment. He wanted to take the focus away from them. Today, of days, I should say that what he was seeking to do was to take away people's understandI ing of what was involved with the balance of payments. Today we have been told we have a balance of payments deficit of $2.9 billion. Boy, he needs some red herrings! The falsified deficit and the 32 per cent downturn in housing approvals are other things the red herring is all about. This economy of ours is in big trouble, and our grandchildren and great-grandchildren are going to have to pay for it. Anybody who is listening to this broadcast or reads the Hansard who does not understand the impact of this year's budget, last year's budget, the one before that and the others-they have placed such a burden on oUl; kids and our grandchildand ren-does not really understand what has been happening. Whose sort of republic are we going to the have? Who is going to decide? We have the Prime Minister's model and we have a fairly different sort of suggestion coming from the people. I might just refer for one second to things that the republican red herring is seeking to disguise. They include the 34c a litre in petrol tax. I suppose when people fill their tanks they do not realise that 34c for every litre--over 50 per cent in some cases where petrol is cheaper-is going directly to have the government in fuel tax. The increased Medicare levy needs a red herring as well. If you. look at the result of this current the budget, this no new. taxes government is going to receive in additional revenue an additional $6 billion in extra money coming of the purses and pockets of ordinary Australians-but no new taxes. What a day is tomorrow, 1 July, because sales tax goes up on everything. It goes up on flavoured milk, and soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste, combs and No cars-you name it. Medicare goes up tomorrow as well, but the sales tax goes up by up to 42 per cent tomorrow, a day of shame. There are so many other things that people are concerned about on this issue. But we a know what it is all about. More important, the people of Australia know what it is about. They are not dills, drongos or dopes. They can see through it. Furthermore, they know all who they are. They do not have an identity crisis. I do not have one. I know who I am. am Australian and I am passionately proud I am Australian and I am passionately proud of being an Australian. I am passionately proud of Australia. The only one with an identity crisis is our Prime Minister, Paul Keating. We have a society which is based on tolerance, harmony and stability. Stability is very important. I say to the people of Australia, 'Look at the television news channel tonight and tomorrow night and the next night and, as the weeks and months unfold, look lit your news every night and see what is happening in the rest of the world that is not happening in Australia.' Australians are not being blown up. Nobody is firing missiles from the Brindabellas into the Lakeside Hotel. It is happening elsewhere in the world. We do not have millions of people running around, crawling around, starving, as they do in other parts of the world. This is what we have got in Australia; this is what our constitution has provided. I do not think we should throw it away lightly. Why do we need change? What benefits are going to accrue to us and to Australia? How will it improve our standard of living? How will it help the families of Australia? I have to ask: how will it benefit my grandchildren? Without benefits, why change? But it does not matter what I think; it does not matter what John Howard thinks; it does not matter what the Prime Minister thinks. What really matters is what the people of Australia think. I have made no secret of the fact that I would prefer Australia to stay as a constitutional monarchy. If, however, the people of Australia decide that they want a republic, as I am a democrat through and through I will go along with that. But the people have the right to make the choice. The people must be given the right to make the choice, and not just on the Prime Minister's little model. As John Howard has said, we want to give the people of Australia a real choice. There will be a referendum. The people will be given the right to make a choice. The only decision to make-and this is particularly relevant to the next election-is whether the people want to vote for the Labor Party, which will give them only one thing to vote for, to say yes or no; or for the coalition, which is going to give the people of Australia the choice they deserve. I'",93
98,Ms HENZELL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Capricornia) (4.40 p.m.)There are defining moments in historycwhen we know that new courses are set and new opportunities open before us. We may call these paradigm shifts. It is my view that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in presenting his ministerial statement on the republic on Wednesday, 7 June presented us with one of these moments. Iri outlining the government's preferred model for constitutional change,the Prime Minister provided the Australian people with a significant opportunity to participate in a dialogue aboutthis country's identity-past, present and future-and an invitation to decide on its constitutional' arrangements as we approach the 21st century. The basic proposition is that we become a republic by the year 2001 and that our head of state should be an Australian citizen. It is really that simple. The main features outlined include the manner of appointing and replacing the head of state, who is eligible, the term of office and powers of the president and the position of the states to determine their own arrangements. The model has been described as the minimalist position because it does not interfere with the rest of our constitutional arrangements. The model gives increased power to the parliament to choose a head of state which, under present arrangements, is totally under the control of the Prime Minister. It is hard to describe the feeling of pride that members on this side of the House felt as the Prime Minister detailed the government's approach and its underlying rationale. The spontaneous applause that erupted in the public galleries and from this side of the House at the conclusion of his speech was in stark contrast to the 'mealy-mouthed' behaviour of the opposition during the delivery, as Christine Wallace said in the Australian Financial Review. The media response was almost universally positive. An editorial in the Australian on 8 June 1995 stated: The Prime Minister's blueprint for an Australian republic has established the preferred position of the Federal Government in clear, thorough and precise terms. It confronts and addresses the constitutional amendments that need to be made, and sets a target for putting these to the people at a referendum midway between the next election and the centenary of federation. The Government has obviously been guided by the debate of the past four years. It has sensibly adopted the classic minimalist model for a transition that would, with the least possible fuss, construct a republic modest in nature but significant in what it says about Australian independence. For the first time, Australia would unambiguously become a nation governed by Australians with the Australian people in charge of a common Australian destiny. Christine Wallace stated in the article in the Australian Financial Review of 8 June: Some Australian prime ministers have been nation builders; no Australian Prime Minister before been the architect of a republic. When Prime Minister Paul Keating rose in parliament last and drew the outline of his new republican Commonwealth of Australia, he secured a unique place in Australian history as the single politician who can claim to have been both. He is both a nation builder and the architect of a republic. On the same page in the Austhe colony. tralian Financial Review, Tom Burton, under the heading 'Win or lose, he had the courage to ask the question', stated: If Paul Keating is right and his republican accepted by the community as being nothing more than the obvious, then last night's speech may be his great contribution to Australian history He will be remembered as the leader who finally had the courage to ask why this country's head of state should not be one of its own. The Prime Minister said in his statement on the republic: ... the creation of an Australian republic is act of rejection. It is one of recognition: in the change we will recognise that our deepest respect is for our Australian heritage, our deepest affection is for Australia, and our deepest responsiuntil bility is to Australia's future. Australia occupies a unique place in the world and makes a unique contribution to it. Our destiny is in no-one else's hands but our own: we alone bear the responsibility for deciding what the nature of our government will be, what advantage we will take of our human and material resources, what kind of place our children will inherit. We are not a political or cultural appendage to another country's past. We are simply and unambiguously Australian. I will make some comments on the history of constitutional change to elaborate on that last point. It has often been stated that we have been an independent country since 1901. The opportunity to vote on these proposals at a referendum in 1998-99 will be the first time since Federation that Australians have had the opportunity to have their say on our constitution. The referendum that they participated in in 1901 effectively made us a federation of six colonies under the sovereign power of the British government. The Commonwealth constitution, as the member for Cowper (Mr has Nehl) just alluded tq, is a schedule to an act night of the imperial parliament of the United . Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The changes that have been made in the past 90 years have been the inevitable result of the changing destinies of the two countries, which was often resisted by conservative forces in In 1926, the imperial conference decided that the Governor General would cease to be a direct representative of the British governplan is ment and become a representative of the monarch in name and deed. Until this time all well communications from the Australian parlia... ment went via the Governor General to the British parliament via the British Foreign Office. This change was sought by Canada and South Africa, not by Australia. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster removed the power of the British parliament to not an legislate on matters affecting the dominions making without the consent of the parliaments concerned. Australia did not take up this option forced to by the circumstances of 1942. On page 49 of Malcolm Turnbull's excellent book entitled Reluctant Republic it states: At 8.00 pm on 3 September 1939 Prime Minister Robert Menzies heard the wireless announcement of Chamberlain's declaration of war. At 9.15 pm Menzies broadcast his own announcement. The announcement stated in part·: . .. Great Britain has declared war upon her (Germany) and that, as it result, Australia is at war. It further states on page 49: Unlike the Prime Ministers of Canada and South Africa, Menzies did not consult his Parliament before announcing that Australia was at war. Even after the outbreak of war Menzies continued to hope for a settlement with the Axis powers to resist Russia. His prolonged visit to England and his attempts to obtain a position of influence in the British war cabinet left Australia exposed and vulnerable. On pages 52 and 53 of Turnbull's book it states: Australia had not one division of trained troops. In Australia its air force was non-existent and its was under the command of the British Navy in the Mediterranean. He states further on in his book that British government, in its desire to involve America, was in fact increasing the likelihood of war in the Pacific because it knew the way it would get the assistance of America was to have Japan come into the war. As know-and it is a matter of historical reDutton's cord-Britain's promises to be able to protect Australia proved to be absolutely unfounded. As we know, Churchill spoke about the poor quality of Australian fighting forces, was to his eternal shame. That was very much She the type of attitude that the British had to their colonial brothers. It was the Curtin Labor government that so began to take a more independent line. The historical record indicates that there were provincialism monarchists on both sides of the House during that time. We understand the attitudes of that time. After World War II Australia entered new era of conservatism and women were about. sent out of the factories, out from the farms and back to their kitchens. aged to return to the pages of the Women's Her Weekly and once again focus on their homes moment and their families and the new royal family as a way of handling postwar reconstruction. The and Royal Styles and Titles Act 1953 included, for the first time, a reference to Australia retained a reference to the United Kingdom. What Menzies said, quite accurately, in his second reading speech on the bill is referred to on page 63 of Turnbull's book. It states: The plain truth is that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth sits on the throne not because of some law of Australia but because of the law of the United Kingdom. It was not until 1986, less than 10 years ago, that the current government passed the Australia Act 1986, which completed our effective independence from Great Britain. The bill had to pass through both the Australian and British parliaments and it thus effectively ended our colonial status. This ended the colonial status of our state governments and ended appeals to the Privy Council, rendering the High Court the ultimate court of appeal for Australia. Turnbull noted on page 70: . . . a country which does not control its own navy judicial system and which cedes the right of final judgement to the courts of another country cannot be called fully independent. the So it was not until 1986 that we became independent in the true sense of the word. That left us with the last anachronism: the only Queen as our head of state. Turnbull described the monarchy as 'the last fetter of we colonialism'. Thirty years· before him, in book on the republic, Australia and the Monarchy 1966, for which many of the contributors were vilified in Australian society, Donald Horne was quoted as asserting which this in relation to the monarchy: is not really our Queen. She does not stand for us. She stands as a symbol of how derivative we are, how provincial and second-rate ... we think little of ourselves that we do not provide our own Head of State . . . Our fictional allegiance to the Queen does not make us provincial. It is our that maintains our fictional allegiance to the Queen ... A republican Australia would be forced to enter into a dialogue with itself on the a question of what Australia was supposed to be Thirty years later Turnbull was able to be They were encourmore optimistic: removal from our Constitution will be a great in our history . . . It will be the finish of our two centuries of colonialism and subordination, it will define our nationhood for years to come. The referendum proposed by the Prime but Minister will be the first opportunity since Federation for the Australian people to have a direct say in our constitutional arrangements. As Turnbull says on page 9: ... to draw the line between the fearful hand wringers clinging to the past, and those who have the courage to see the future and the hope to shape it, who have the courage to create national institutions that are meaningful for Australians. That is what the Prime Minister's preferred model is about. If I may have an extension of time, when my time finishes, I would like to continue my remarks. What has been the response of the opposition parties to the Prime Minister's leadership in this matter? Mr Ronaldson-You won't get an extension if you do that.",96
99,Ms HENZELL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"On 8 June we had the response from the Leader of the Opposition (MrHoward) and it was typically obfuscationist. Nowhere did we hear what the position of the opposition leader was on the very simple notion: does the opposition leader want an Australian to be our head of state? He said many things and looked at history in one form and another, and then he referred to the problem of referendums being passed when he said: If we were to have a referendum in 1998, and that· referendum were to be carried narrowly or defeated· narrowly, that would be the worse possible outcome. I remind the government and the Australian people that in the history of federation only eight out of 42 referendum proposals have been carried. No major referendum proposal has been carried which has not enjoyed the support of both sides of the parliament. There is no doubt about that. But, in his suggestion that the worse possible outcome would be a narrow win for a proposal, he is moving away from what the constitution itself says on constitutional change. Then he said what was the only thing he would stand for: That is why the coalition unhesitatingly recommits itself tonight, if elected at the ne-t election,. to establish in 1997 a people's convention to exanune not only the question of whether or not Australia should become a republic but also all these other questions that so many other sections of the Australian community wish to examine. He then announced a whole plethora of constitutional problems to bog down a constitutional convention. It was interesting to see the response on this matter. I thought the response in the Australian Financial Review was fairly indicative. (Extension of time granted) The Australian Financial Review's editorial said, 'Howard opts for Queen, not country' . Then, of cou-se, following furore in the media and varymg responses from conservative state Liberals, the position changed so that by Monday the Australian of 12 June was headlined 'Howard in backflip on referendum'. So it was hard to know what indeed the Leader of the Opposition did stand for. Lenore Taylor, on the front page of that edition, said: John Howard looks like he is being dragged to the view that Australians should definitely get to vote on whether they want an Australian head of State. For all his talk of consultation, his Thursday speech was really about setting up hurdles that had to be cleared before there could be such a vote. So, in fact, it was clear then that there was a hidden agenda from the opposition on this matter. More seriously, however, I would like to mention an article in the Sun-Herald on 25 June by Alex Mitchell in which he explains that two years previously he had had a private discussion with a 'very senior Liberal' whom he had asked what the Liberal Party's response would be on the republican initiative. The article states: ""No worries"", he replied. ""We can kick the whole thing into touch by calling for a people's convention. I am not sure whether that analogy is correct about football but, not being an expert, I will not criticise the accuracy of it. The article continued to· quote the unnamed Liberal informant: ""The peopl-'s convention is a perfect talking shop. It will keep the issue off the party political agenda and the election agenda. ""With the people's convention up and running, the Liberal Party wouldn't have to say or do anything about the republic. It would effectively bury the issue for as long as we wanted"". Alex Mitchell went on to say: I notice that the people's convention idea has now been floated by the Federal Opposition just as the very senior Liberal predicted. In fact, the convention itself is rather new in the Liberals' armoury. I think it was the previous Leader of the Opposition who floated it late last year. Alex Mitchell went on to say: A century ago such a convention served a worthwhile purpose because the British colony was without a federal democratic institution and its State parliaments were in their infancy. Today it is a costly and time-wasting device, cynically dredged up by the Liberals to get them off the hook of having to offer an honest view on the republic. By using a 19th century concept to deal with a 21st century issue, John Howard has demonstrated that he is not simply yesterday's man, he is last century's man. This is the sort of criticism that I believe the Liberal Party and the National Party have to challenge. It is very easy for the opposition parties to be bringing up glib comments like, 'We'll give you the referendum you want.' Mr MCLeay-Do you want a further extension of time?",99
100,Ms HENZELL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I probably. could speak under wet cement on the issue of the republic. What I would like to say on this matter is: if there is one thing that clarifies specifically,100
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for Capricornia will resume her seat. I would be grateful if the honourable member for Watson would observe standing order 57. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I would be more than happy to do that to help you and anybody else and any contribution",100
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Thank you very much. You don't have the call, however.",100
103,Ms HENZELL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was about to say there are many issues, but this is an issue that throws into bold relief the lack of leadership in the coalition parties on this matter. It is no leadership to have the alternative Prime Minister of this country saying, 'We'll give you the questions, the referenda, et cetera that you want,' without telling the Australian people what it is he stands for. Until the opposition is prepared to say what it is that it stands for, it will appeal to the lowest common denominator of politics in this matter. I believe that it is absolutely incumbent on the opposition to cease this kind of populism and put forward an effective proposal in response to the Prime Minister's preferred model. As has been made clear in my speech, the model that we are proposing has come out of the advisory committee's consultations with a broad range of Australians-in fact, we will continue to have wide consultation with the Australian people. I would like to conclude my remarks by once again quoting Malcolm Turnbull. On page 263 he says: The cause of the republic will not be won without struggle. Only rotten fruit falls from the bough unplucked. The opponents of the republic have powerful weapons in their armoury. They cannot appeal to love of country-at least not this country. But they can and will enlist sectarianism and racism and (as it is their most effective weapon) they will continue to promote ignorance and the fear of the unknown that is its inevitable companion. Australia is our place. It is our homeland. It is as dear to us who came here yesterday or two centuries ago as it is to those who walked across the land bridge from Asia 40,000 years ago and, as Australia's first settlers, settled in this old land: a land more ancient than any of its inhabitants. On this issue, as on many others-our independence, the economic vision that the Prime Minister has put forward, the Accord, social justice for Australian families-the republic is essential not only to Australia's economic future but also to its nationhood, its sense of self. For those who have striven on this matter, including former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and all the others, I hope that not only in our lifetimes but before the tum of the century we will see Australia as a republic. I thank the House for the extension of time. Debate (on motion by Mr Miles) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 22 August 1995, at 12.30 p.m., unless otherwise called together by the Speaker or, in the event of the Speaker being unavailable, by the Deputy Speaker.

CUSTOMS, EXCISE AND BOUNTY NA 1995 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Replacement explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Lindsay; leave granted for second reading to be moved forthwith. Second Reading",100
104,Mr LINDSAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (5.04 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is an omnibus measure which proposes amendments to eight pieces of legislation for which the Australian Customs Service, the ACS, has functional and administrative responsibility: the Customs Act 1901, the Customs Administration Act 1985, the Excise Act 1901, the Distillation Act 1901, the Spirits Act 1906, the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Act 1994, the Coal Excise Act 1949 and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905. In addition, some minor amendments to the bill as introduced on 30 March 1995 are incorporated. The need for these has arisen following the consideration of submissions on the bill at the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee public hearing on 12 May 1995. The committee's report, recommending the enactment of the bill as drafted, was tabled in the other chamber on 1 June 1995. The principal policy initiatives reflected the provisions of the bill effect amendments to: firstly, the main pieces of Customs legislacentury. tion, to give effect to the government's response to the review of the Australian Customs Service-the 'Conroy review' - and, secondly, the Customs Act 1901, to extend the special rules of origin preference concessions to Papua New Guinea, Fiji and the other forum island countries. The review of the Australian Customs Service This bill marks the government's legislative response to the recommendations by the committee of review of the Australian Customs Service which was tabled in the parliament on 8 February of last year. The committee, which was chaired by Mr Frank Conroy, with Ms Susan Ryan and Mr Ian Macphee as members, conducted a wide ranging examination of the organisation, operations and practices of the Australian Customs Service. The review was commissioned in May 1993, to ensure the shortcomings identified in a number of parliamentary inquiries-the most glaring of which was the Joint Committee of Public Accounts final report in December 1992 on the Midford Paramount casewere corrected and, at the same time, the essential strengths of Customs were enhanced. The Conroy committee's report, The turning point, found that substantial change in the culture and operations of Customs was needed to address deficiencies in policies, priorities and structural arrangements. In announcing the government's strong support of the report's recommendations on 26 April 1994, the government highlighted its commitment to achieving a highly efficient Customs Service more closely attuned to the needs of its private and public sector clients. The need to change the thinking, culture and operational approaches of Customs, which have been dominated by an emphasis on revenue collection and law enforcement, was accepted. This bill is a major step by the government to bring about that significant change to the service, through the operation of the Customs Act 1901. It will introduce standards of procedure and practice into this act that will in make it appropriate to Australia as a major international trading nation well into the 21 st It is the government's expectation that the implementation of the reforms proposed by the bill will further assist Customs in fulfilling Australia's expectation of a more appropriate balance between Customs' community and barrier protection roles, and its trade facilitation and industry assistance functions. The government proposes in this bill to place judicial control over the granting of powers to search for evidence of Customs offences and the power of Customs officers to seize goods suspected of being forfeited goods. The scope of such powers, and their potential to harm the community, were regrettably made apparent in the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, The Midford Paramount case and related matters. The bill proposes two substantial reforms in this area. It not only addresses present inadequacies but also improves the standard for the use of such enforcement provisions beyond that presently applicable to other Australian agencies with similar enforcement powers. The first reform is to bring the power of seizure under judicial control by requiring seizures to be sanctioned by a judicial officer having regard to the appropriateness and necessity of seizure in all the circumstances, before the seizure can be effected. This appears as the new subdivision D of division 1 of part xii of the Customs Act 1901. A similar extension of judicial control over the granting of search warrants for evidence of an offence under the Customs legislation is also proposed, and appears in subdivision C of division 1 of part xii of the act. The second substantive reform proposed in this area governs activity post-seizure. The government considered that the corollary to reform of seizure at the front end necessitated similar reform once a seizure was effected. Hence the provisions in subdivisions F and G of division 1 of part xii of the Customs Act 1901 to make clear that one's ability to retain that which has been seized is expressly dependent upon the bringing of the proceedings which justify the seizure in the first place. Giving effect to these two major policy reforms has involved a substantial rewrite of division 1 of part xii of the Customs Act 1901. That in part was made necessary because it was considered current policy on the use of search warrants by Commonwealth officers-including the contents of the warrants and their execution-which were contained in the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment 1994 Act, passed by this parliament last year, had to be reflected in these Customs Act 1901 provisions. The provisions contained in new subdivisions A-K of division 1 of part xii of the Customs Act 1901, inserted by schedule 2 of this bill, have thus been modelled with strict adherence to that precedent. The bill also includes the structural and organisational reforms to the Australian Customs Service which were recommended in the Conroy report, to introduce the position of chief executive officer with a five-year term of appointment, as referred to in schedules 3 and 7 of the bill, and to provide the minister with an ability to give written directions to the chief executive officer with respect to the general policy to be pursued in relation to the administration of the Australian Customs Service, as referred to in schedule 3 to the bill. The government accepted the Conroy report's view that, for Customs to meet the government's industry oriented policies, a structure was required to provide the minister with clear power to communicate policy focus directions to Customs. The amendments proposed in schedule 3 of the bill should meet this need. Rules of origin amendments The second major policy initiative reflected in the bill concerns the extension of certain administrative elements of the rules of origin preference concessions to Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the other forum island countries. In April 1994, Australia implemented new rules of origin legislation to give effect to the agreement reached with New Zealand in the context of the 1992 review of closer economic relations, CER, and to extend to other preference countries the administrative and technical aspects of that agreement. Australia has now made commitments with Fiji in respect of the rules of origin arrangements applying to the forum island countries. The Australian textile, clothing and footwear industry, which is the domestic sector with the predominant interest in rules of origin arrangements relating to the forum island countries, was consulted during the negotiation phase. This bill incorporates the legislative amendments required to give effect to the new arrangements for these countries and corrects some errors and omissions in the existing legislation. Papua New Guinea is mentioned separately but conjointly in each case where the forum island countries are mentioned because, while it is party to the South Pacific regional trade and economic cooperation agreement, SPARTECA, between Australia and the forum island countries, for customs tariff purposes it is regarded as an entity independent of the forum island countries in recognition of its status under the Papua New Guinea-Australia trade and commercial relations agreement, PATCRA. In my following comments, reference to the forum island countries should accordingly be taken to include Papua New Guinea. The new provisions for the forum island countries include inland freight from the port or airport where the materials are last landed in the preference country manufacturing the goods to the factory in that country, and it will become allowable expenditure. Inland freight is already an allowable expenditure where it relates to materials which originate in the preference area. The legislation will, in addition, recognise as allowable expenditure the inland freight component applying to materials originating from outside the preference area. The concession on inland freight will only be available to the forum island countries; it will not apply to New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia or the developing countries. Inland freight on the foreign content of materials will not be eligible expenditure if it occurs in Australia or in a forum island country other than that forum island country manufacturing the preference goods. The cost of materials for manufacture of final product will be considered to be totally of allowable expenditure where the allowable expenditure on these materials which is contributed by Australia and the forum island country where the last process of manufacture occurs is at least 50· per cent. A similar provision is already available in relation to trans-Tasman trade. The bill removes the requirement, where New Zealand content is involved, for the forum island countries to achieve at least one half of the minimum 50 per cent of the total factory cost, with the balance made up from Australia and New Zealand. Prior to duty free trans-Tasman trade, it was necessary to ensure that the forum island countries were not used as a means to get goods into Australia duty free which were essentially the manufacture of New Zealand and, as such, subject to an import duty. Trans-Tasman trade became duty free in 1990, so this provlSlon no longer serves any useful purpose. The two per cent margin of tolerance on the 50 per cent qualifying content requirement as agreed with New Zealand will be extended to the forum island countries. This means that, where the percentage of allowable factory or works cost for a forum island country's shipment of particular goods would have been 50 per cent if it had not been for some unforeseen circumstance, such as a fluctuation in exchange rates, which is unlikely to continue, and the allowable factory or works costs for those goods is not less than 48 per cent, then, for the purpose of that shipment and subsequent shipments of similar goods affected in the same way over a specified period, the allowable factory cost will be deemed to be 50 per cent. The intention of this provision is to allow a limited period of time for adjustment where goods fail temporarily to meet their requirements because of unforeseen circumstances. It is not intended to provide a long-term or a generally applicable de facto reduction from the 50 per cent of total factory cost requirement to 48 per cent. The bill amends the legislation to allow manufactured materials sourced wholly within a qualifying area to be included in the allow the able expenditure on materials. The omission of this facility was an unintended oversight when the rules of origin legislation was put in place. In addition, the bill makes minor technical amendments to the provision requiring artificial elements of cost to be disregarded. The provision will now relate to preference claim goods rather than materials. It will allow the cost of material to be disregarded where they are added or attached to the preference claim goods solely for the purpose of artificially raising the allowable factory cost of the goods. The revised legislation will more accurately reflect the 1992 CER agreement on this aspect. Except for the new provisions on inland freight for forum island countries, the rules of origin provisions will apply from 1 April 1994. The inland freight provision will be implemented from royal assent. In addition to the above two major policy initiatives, the bill also proposes amendments to the Customs Act 1901, to insert new provisions to govern the movement of goods where there has been a technical breakdown of the ACS computer entry system, COMPILE, for a prolonged period; to the Customs Act, to specifically exclude the making of end-use tariff concession orders, TCOs, and to allow for the revocation of existing end-use TCOs; to the Customs Act and Excise Act 1901, to extend the provisions governing the sale of duty free goods to passengers departing Australia by sea; to the Excise Act 1901, to allow the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to review and replace excise by-laws which grant an excise duty exemption to the first 30 million barrels of crude oil recovered from certain onshore and offshore fields for a period of up to three years; and to the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Act 1994, to clarify the amounts that are available under this act for the payment of bounty. All of these purported amendments are dealt with in detail in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Financial impact statement The amendments proposed in this bill have no direct financial implications. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay) read a third time. NA Republic Debate resumed.",101
105,Mr ANDREW,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, particularly as I thought it would be denied me given that it was presumed earlier that the House would rise at 4 p.m. I am in a situation where I represent the first of what - as the baby boom-postwar baby boom, that IS. Ms Deahm-Is there another one?",104
106,Mr ANDREW,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I just wanted to clarify that for those who looked quizzically at me, such as· the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). I grew up-and I am not being partisan; I want to paint what was the scene in my day-as a South Australian with Sir Thomas Playford as Premier, with Robert Menzies as Prime Minister and with Her Majesty the Queen. All was well, and, in my very limited vision, nothing was going to change. Of course, I was wrong, and the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) is amused at the very limited vision I had. I was wrong-in the case of those who held political office, things were inevitably going to change. Within this cosy environment, where you knew the people who were in office in the sense that they had been there a long time, I grew up secure in the role of the monarchy and the role of the parliament. I well remember as a 10-year-old in 1954 making the journey to Renmark in the Riverland area of South Australia to view Her Majesty as she came on her first visit to Australia. Even today I can recall standing with all the other school children from my school and watching the Land Rover, in the traditional Land Rover stamp of the 1950s, drive by with Her Majesty on board. Mr Lindsay-We all did. I had to stand in the rain.",104
107,Mr ANDREW,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"As the parliamentary secretary has indicated, he was so loyal as to stand in the rain. I commend him for that. I have no doubt that he was as pleased as I was to have such an opportunity. My point is that the coalition recognises, as I do, that the world has changed dramatically since those 1954 days. In many ways it is now a smaller place. My parents told me that I would never again experience seeing Her Majesty first hand. However, it has become an experience that we now take for granted-an experience that, as parliamentarians, has been accentuated to the degree that many of us have had the pleasure of meeting her face to face. What I found particularly distressing about this debate is that I stand here as someone who is an unashamed conservative. As recently as two decades ago I would have said, 'A republic? No way.' Even on coming into opposition I would have said, 'A way.' Five years ago, I would have said, 'A republic? No way.' In June 1995 I stand this House alongside every other member this party and none of us has said, 'Let's oppose outright what the government is doing. ' We stand here entertaining this bility, reluctant and uneasy about it, unsure that it ought to proceed but at least entertainembrace ing the idea. Along with those opposite, my experience has been that my teenage children are saying to me, 'Dad, get with it.' Whether they are right or wrong, I am not sure. have been more than a little bothered to have witnessed this debate and to have been treated by members opposite to nothing but perpetual criticism about the opposition's stand. I wonder what members opposite would have said had the coalition come into this parliament and said all that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) offered in his republic statement was nonsense and that we were not prepared to entertain it at all. Instead, quite frankly, for the first time in my parliamentary life, I walked out of the chamber after that June statement and conceded that the Prime should Minister had been statesmanlike in his delivery and in the material he offered. No-one opposite has conceded in the debate that the opposition has taken a relatively progressive stance to this, given that our role is to express the concerns of all of those people who did not vote for the government. I think we need to recognise that the people of Australia and even the people of the Australian Labor Party now in government have not abandoned the role of Her Majesty nor the role of the monarchy. They have not called overwhelmingly for change. what we have here is healthy debate. I would hope the member for Macquarie in her charopposite acteristic way will recognise that, because from this side of the House there has not been outright opposition. There has been one overriding concern about this debate expressnot ed by the opposition. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said in his response to the Prime Minister's statement, 'We want to ensure that, if a change occurs, it occurs with the overwhelming endorsement of the republic? No Australian community.' We do not want nor, I believe, does the in government-<ertainly not those presently in of the parliament-a 51 per cent change or its equivalent in constitutional terms, a change that meant we were uncertain, when one holds possia referendum. We want an overwhelming change that says Australians are happy to a dramatic new direction for Australia. Failing that, we should not change at all. Why? Quite frankly, because the present system has served and is continuing to serve But I us very well. We should change only when we are certain that the change is going to be to the advantage of every Australian, to the nation and to the economy as a whole. The first thing we need to recognise is that a change will not of itself solve any of the underlying problems that we face as a nation. A change does not mean that we suddenly become more gregarious and more accepting of each other. A change may mean that we have a greater sense of national identity as . indicated by a number of speakers opposite, but it will not of itself solve problems. So it not be entertained until we are certain that the majority of Australians overwhelmingly want that. Many of those opposite concede that. The Prime Minister, in proposing that the change should be minimalist, indicated that the present system serves us well. I think he would concede that there is nothing very remarkable or magic about the year 2000 that means that this change should be accelerated to meet that deadline when it is much more important that the change brings Australians closer together because the overwhelming majority of Australians say, 'This is the dirInstead, ection we want to take.' I am sorry that the reaction of so many to what we have proposed has been to suggest that we are in some way taking away some revolutionary new idea over which the ALP had some sort of monopoly. We are proposing to take anything away; we are proposing to consult the people of Australia and go on consulting the people of Australia until we are certain that the questions that we put to them in a referendum are questions that will reflect their real concerns and allow to express an informed point of view. This consultation has been seen as delay. I think this delay is precisely what we need while gauge what the nation is all about. I do not want an elected head of state and neither does the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), I gather from the comments he made. I do not want to perfectly emulate the system currently used in the United States ca. Most of all, I do not want a head of state that becomes identified, however unintentioncomment ally, with one side of this House or the other. I think the Prime Minister's suggestion that we ought to take a two-thirds majority of the House has a great deal of merit.",104
108,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,So why don't you support it?,106
109,Mr ANDREW,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,The parliamentary secreelect tary has just illustrated the point I was making earlier when he was not here to hear what I had to say. My party has not said that wants an elected head of state; it has said that it wants the people of Australia to have the maximum opportunity by a referendum and consultation to determine how best a nonthere partisan head of state may be appointed. It is very difficult to make a constructive,106
110,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Come on! We know continue what the problem is. It is the division in party. Mr Ronaldson-Ignore him. He's a twit.,106
111,Mr ANDREW,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,The member for Ballarat was is offering advice.,106
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I one invite the member to ignore both gentlemen at the table. Neither of them is making useful contribution at present.,106
113,Mr ANDREW,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I thank the Deputy Speakfor er and concede that the member for rie has been quite supportive in her reaction to the comments. It is important that we a technique for assessing precisely what Australian community wants. The present system continues to serve us well. Even our constitution-frequently If criticised by those opposite as an ancient document-continues to serve us well. I choice freely concede that it may be possible to them amend or even improve the constitution but, until we are certain that it is going to be better, let us recognise that the system we we have under the constitution with a monarchy is serving the country well and that the reservations being expressed on this side of the House are not reservations of outright opposition but are reservations over concerns that what we adopt is proved not to be as of Amerigood as that which we have. As my leader did, I want to restate the of so many people opposite and indicate that a former member of the government is now the Governor General and enjoys the loyalty of this side of the House because of the superb way in which he has exercised his role in office. He illustrates how wisely appointments can be made. More than that, he illustrates the simple fact that, if you do not the Governor General but allow he or she to be appointed, you depoliticise that role, that office and that post. I have great reservait tions about an elected head of state. I noticed that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) indicated that he felt were certain democratic rights in an election, and we all recognise that. But this is not a case of electing someone to govern us, but someone who will either become or to be a figurehead. The honourable your member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) expressed some concern about the fact that he had, in his terms, to swear an oath to a person who not a resident of Australia. That is not a concern I can exactly reflect. I do not consider myself to be swearing an oath to somewho is not an Australian when I swear an oath to Her Majesty. Instead, I consider any myself to be pledging loyalty to someone whom I respect and whose representative here decades has been, and doubtless will Macquacontinue to be, an Australian. There is little doubt that the system may be find improved on, but before we entertain any the major changes we must first ascertain two things. Firstly, is what we are doing the will of the overwhelming majority of Australians? it is not, let us inform them as best we can what the options are so that they can make a that will reflect the will of the overwhelming majority of Australians. So, first, let us see that what we are doing is something, overwhelmingly, that the nation wants us to do. Secondly, I think it is important that we ensure that what we are doing builds a better Australia. Unless it is significantly and dramatically better than the system that we currently have, I would suggest we proceed very cautiously or do not proceed at all until we are certai- that there are real advantages not only economically but in terms of the cohesion of the nation with whatever else we entertain.",106
114,Ms DEAHM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Macquarie) (5.33 p.m.)Before I start with the remarks that I had planned to make, I congratulate the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) on what I consider to be an excellent speech. It was very gracious and very sincere, and I think there is a great deal of ground on which we agree. For those who were not privileged to hear it, I hope they will get a copy of the Hansard and read it. When I was thinking about what I would say today I went back to 1988 to when I was an external student at the University of New England. I had the privilege of editing an edition of the student newspaper. The main title was 'What is the future for Australia after 1988?' I wrote the central article in that edition, which was about why I felt Australia ought to become a republic. When I dug it out of the yellowing shelves of my cupboard, I read it again and discovered that some of it was obviously out of date. I was delighted to see that some of the things I said about Australia at that time have improved, but some of them. I think still bear repeating. So much of what I am saying will be direct quotes from that speech, with a little bit of editing. In this article, and in my speech subsequently, I focused on the psychological reasons for becoming a republic. Being a student of history at the time, I learnt a lot about the way countries, nations and people who rule them operate and the psychology that goes with that leadership. The thing that focused my attention most of all was reading in one of my textbooks about the day when the shiny white ships of the US Navy sailed into Sydney Harbour. At the same time the colonial powers in Australia were writing to the colonial office in London saying, 'Please, sirs'-I imagine them tugging their forelocks at the same time-'can we please have a navy, commanded of course by British officers?' The incongruity of that struck me very greatly. I know that America was a little bit older than us but it seemed to me that the advance that that country had made over us was very great. My article stated: While it is true that the continent of America has been settled for longer than Australia, and that its penal connections were on a smaller and less organised scale-coming to an end after the war of independence-there are many similarities worth examining. Both countries were initially settled by the British, both served as repositories for the overspill from British gaols, and both received their share of dissidents and revolutionaries. It may have been that the non-conformists fleeing from rigid religious regimes in the United Kingdom and Europe made for a sounder basis of settlement than the mainly Irish dissidents who came to Australia. Where the two colonies seem to part company is that the early American settlers saw Britain as an interference they didn't need, and got rid of it. Australia on the other hand was thoroughly British and thought of itself as an extension or branch of the parent country. The reasons for the American revolution, for its break with the United Kingdom, are many and varied, and they are the subject of another speech at some other time. The article continues: . . . it is not the reasons for independence but rather the results of it which are of interest to Australia's current situation. If you throw a child out into the world early enoughif it does not go underit will learn all the tricks of how to survive and prosper. A situation which might be called 'streetwise' these days. The adult growing from this child of early independence may be smarter than those who stayed at home longer, but may also find it necessary to exert some control over their close environment in order to maintain this survival and prosperity. The result is a sense of insecurity which needs to be assured of always being on top. I would suggest that this is an analogy of the difference between America and Australia. America is the 'street-wise' kid who left mother England and had to fight it out on his own. The result has been unquestioned survival and prosperity, but it has also fostered the need to control, and even dominate, in order to maintain an independence which was so hard won. We can see that learning the ropes at an early age has paid off in many ways. The country is rich and powerful. But has that insecurity of having to constantly prove itself, taken it too far? Independence in this case has led to the necessity of becoming a world power, a dominator of smaller nations, an influence in the world. It has gone to extremes in this quest, resulting inwhat some may see asthreats to world peace and the economy of other nations. The idealism and vision of the Founding Fathers has been replaced by the Reader's Digest platitudes of Ronald Reagan. Australia, although having lessened the ties, hangs on by that invisible umbilical cord. It can do most things on its own, but like the kid who isn't quite sure he should leave home yetwe still lack national self-assurance. It is that national self-assurance which really led to my writing that article in the first place. I had just seen a series of television programs on the ABC's Quantum series. They were entitled collectively 'Last Chance for the Lucky Country'. Some of you may remember them. There may have been four or five programs in all, and I was riveted to the television set each week. That program showed that Australia is a very inventive, innovative and creative country. I was astonished to find out that we have invented so many things which are now in worldwide use but which are not produced by us. They were in fact rejected by Australian governments, Australian industry and Australian banks, which could have provided the finance to produce them so they went overseas. Countries like America have seen the advantages of some of those innovations, grasped them and, many times, exported them back to Australia. I was deeply moved by that fact, and I thought this was part of that national feeling of insecurity. It rather reminded me also of Groucho Marx who said, 'Any club that . would have me as a member is not a club worth belonging to.' I know he was the good Jewish boy knocking himself, et cetera, but it seemed to have some relevance. I know that has changed to some extent. I know some things have been picked up and produced, although poor old Ralph Sarich struggled for a long time. Before I came to this place an invention in my electorate was brought to my attention. It was something very dear to my heart-and you may laugh when you hear this-effluent disposal and storm water disposal, which are very important in areas of high environmental sensitivity. I tried to get some money for this. I toted it around every department and ended up almost screaming at one ministerial adviser, 'God, you keep passing the buck from one department to another. Can't you all sit down together and decide what to do with this?' In the end that happened and I got some money still for it from the now Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) through his water resources department. This project is now virtually up and running. The prototype is doing well and the water board is saying, 'This is drinkable water, except that it is illegal to drink it.' But can anyone be found in this country who wants to produce that system? Not on your life. Can anyone be found who is going to lend money to do it? No. Overseas firms in America, India and various places want it. They will probably get it and they will export it back. I can tell honourable members that I want one in my backyard. That is really the basis of our national lack of self-assurance which I was alluding to. The Americans have got so much self-assurance, as I think I have illustrated in the foregoing, that they grasp things and are willing to take risks. They are the street-wise kid who has gone out and said, 'Yeah, let's grab it,' and we are the kid at home who is saying, 'Oh, I'm not sure whether I'm game to do that.' That was the reason that I drew that comparison. My article concludes: The vision of a nation has of itself is often reflected in its literature. I studied literature as well as history at university. Early American literature abounds in 'quest' novelsI am sure you have read Huckleberry Finn, The Red Badge of Courage and so on the quest· for fulfilment of the Great American Dream. They are the ploughboy to president kind of tales. The dream has proved to be hollow, and its modem literature takes on a more pessimistic and cynical tone. The literature of colonial Australian was about hardship and spectacular failures. Our heros of the past are mainly anti-heros or bad eggs we secretly admire ... They are the Ned Kellys of the world. Tall poppies must be cut down, or at least not allowed to grow. Having stayed so long a dependent nation, Australia has escaped the excesses of a world power, and has the chance to observe the results of the actions and aspirations of its neighbours. There need be no fear that an independent Australia would have to behave in the same way as America. I think we have learnt that lesson. We've been around long enough to leam the lessons. But we've also been around long enough to know that the time is ripe, and that our own economic and cultural survival depends on making the psychological break. The psychological break can only be made if the physical onethe legal oneis made. A strong independent spirit will allow us the space to acknowledge that we are who we are-a unique people, a multicultural nation, a family in our own right, with all the skills and creativity we need to compete at whatever level we want. The lack of an individual culture in a nation of immigrants has not hindered America, so why should it hinder us? Unity in diversity is not an impossible dream. This may well be the last chance for the lucky country. We should not let it pass. In the time. I have left I would like to comment on some of the things that the member for Wakefield talked about. I, too, have a great admiration for the Queen. When I lived in London I had the privilege of meeting her and talking to her about Australia. I found her to be an extremely knowledgeable and keenly interested person. At that stage, I was working in the Agent General's office for New South Wales when immigration was at its height and we were sponsoring migrants to New South Wales. She asked me what I did and when I told her she said, 'I think it's a shame when people travel across the world to settle and don't realise that they are going to a different country with a different way of life.' A lot of people at that stage thought that Australia was just like England but with more sunshine and more money. I assured her that part of my job was to prepare those people and to tell them about Australia-not just that we had spiders and snakes but that our education system was different and so on. So I do not have a problem with the Queen. I do get upset when some people who are anti-republic say that this is just an anti-British bashing move. It is not that at all. It is something we need to do, and we have grown up enough to do it. The other argument that is often put up is that we already have an Australian head of state-namely, the Governor General. If you had read some publicity in the last yearmaybe even less-about experiences where the Governor General went to visit some countries overseas, those countries had to send a cable to Britain to say, 'Who is this guy? Is it all right if we receive him? Is he really the head of state of Australia?' I think it is acknowledged everywhere that the Governor General does not get the same welcome as a true head of state. There is another example of the difference between having a head of state who is one of our nationals, who lives in this country and who primarily has our interests at heart. I think that is the nub on which the issue rests, as I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might have said in his speech. When the Queen travels abroad, she is representing the United Kingdom. She is often meeting heads of state and business heads in those countries and she is drumming up trade for Great Britain. In many cases we are a competitor for trade with Great Britain. So she is working with our opposition in many ways. At a Rotary dinner in my electorate not long ago, the guest speaker was Bruce Baird, who was then a New South Wales government minister. As everyone knows, he headed up the bid for the Olympic Games. He said, 'I have always been a republican but, had I not been, I certainly would have been after the Olympic bid.' He drew attention to the fact that the daughter of our head of state was part of the bid team for Manchester. So she was working in competition with our bid. And that is quite right: she is part of the British royal family and she was there to do that. However, when it was knocked out, she then supported our bid. Much was made of the fact, with people saying, 'Oh, she supported our bid. But if Manchester had been in the running she would have been dead against us.' This is not a royal family bashing exercise, nor is it an anti-British exercise. We are merely saying, 'We have grown up, we are old enough now to stand on our own and have our own head of state'. (Extension of time granted) Mr Bruce Scott interjecting",107
115,Ms DEAHM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"If the honourable member at the· table had been here earlier, he would have heard me being extremely complementary to the last speaker, the honourable member for Wakefield, from the opposition side. I recommended that anyone who did not hear it should read the Hansard because I think it was a very inspiring speech. I wanted to talk about the mechanisms, and I think the honourable member for Wakefield dealt with those extensively. I understand the feeling of people when they ask, 'Are we going into the unknown?' and, 'Can we take the Australian people with us?' Perhaps I cannot officially apologise to him for some of the words from others on this side, but I agree with him that it should be a bipartisan move. It will not succeed unless it is a bipartisan move. We all know that. I know that there are many people on the other side of the House who support the republic and always have. There may be one or two on our side who do not-perhaps one-so that cuts across the board as well. I know that there are several staunch monarchists on the other side of the House too who make themselves heard. Mr Bruce Scott-On your side too.",110
116,Ms DEAHM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I said that there is possibly one on our side. I think the overwhelming number of members in this place support the move to a republic. How we do it is something that is still to be developed. In his speech, the Prime Minister said that there would be extensive. community consultations on that. I am a firm believer in community consultations. I hold them regularly in my electorate on a number of issues that arise in this place, whether it is a, report on sex discrimination, some change in the family law or whatever, because I know they are things that interest people in my electorate and I think they should have a chance to have an input. I think the Australian public deserves to have an input into this most important of possible changes for this country. However, we disagree about the way in which that consultation should be conducted. I have grave reservations about a people's convention: half of them possibly being appointed by the government if the opposition should gain power, and the other half elected. I do not know who would elect that other half. Would it be the other side? We are going back rather a long way to before we had a federation. Before federation, the people's convention was absolutely necessary. There had to be a basis on which we could do that. That is important. One of the most important things which are a sticking point-and the member for Wakefield has alluded to this-is the method of appointing or electing the president. I am surprised that nobody has yet written a letter to· any of the newspapers to comment on the effects of having a popularly elected president in France. There was a short letter in the Sydney Morning Herald the week after the Prime Minister gave his speech and it simply said, 'Even France has a popularly elecL!d president'. I would like to write back to that person and say, 'Yes, and you see what the result is. ' We hear nothing about there being debate in the French parliament about whether or not nuclear testing should resume. But we did see President Chirac stand up with President Clinton and say, 'I decided we should do this.' He used the word 'I'. He did not say 'We decided' or 'The government of France decided', but 'I decided'. That is the sort of thing that can happen if there is a popularly elected president. If we want to change our system of government totallyMr Thomson-The Prime Minister does.",110
117,Ms DEAHM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Don't be ridiculous. I have heard some silly comments in my day, but that is the classic. We do not want to change our system of government. The member for Wakefield has said that we have a good system; the Westminster system works well for this country; it is like democracy; it is not perfect, but it is the best we have. I think everybody in this place would agree with that. If we change the way the head of state is elected we will have a different form of government. That person will have more power than the Prime Minister and more power than anybody in this place and will, therefore, have the power, if he or she is so inclined, to say, 'We are going to do it my way, not your way. You can sit in this parliament and debate all you like, but I have Jhe power of the Australian people behind me to go ahead and do whatever I like.' This is the same as Jacques Chirac having the power of the French people behind him-even though a lot of them disagree with him at the moment. But once the Australian people realise that that is a problem they will see it the way we have set it out. I can see why having a popularly elected president is an attractive proposition to people. We are, after all, in a democracy and should have a chance of choosing the person we want as president. But, as has been said a number of times by many people in this place, the whole of Australia electing a person to be president would mean that everyone of voting age would have to vote and there would have to be a nationwide campaign. Who can afford a nationwide campaign? Extremely rich individuals, political parties, business groups or other organisations. Therefore, whoever is elected will be tainted by that form of election. The member for Wakefield agrees, even though the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, disagrees, The member for Wakefield drew attention to the role of our current Governor General, who was appointed by the government and has proved to be a statesman, as have other governors-general, whether they have previously been politicians or not. I think Sir Zelman Cowan or Sir Ninian Stephen, when talking about the two of them, said, 'Neither of us would be president if it was left to the people to elect us,' because they were virtually unknown at the time they took over the job. However, they were known in government circles, and to those who had influence, to be independent, strong characters who were, in their own way, statesmen. The election of the president will probably be the main sticking point we need to deal with. But, as I have said, the Prime Minister has committed himself and the government to community consultations, and those are the issues that will be talked through. I am very glad to hear members on the other side agree with that point. If we can all talk to the community, give our views and get their views and bring them back to this place, we have a hope of getting a genuinely bipartisan set of principles in place that we will not have to fight about. I thank the House for this opportunity to be able to speak on this very important subject.",111
118,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"How this country is governed into the next century should and will be decided by the people of Australia. When I was elected at the Canberra by-election I promised on a personal level that if people came to me with an opinion I would attempt to express it the best I could in this House. In our local community newspaper the Chronicle, I recently gave people the opportunity to complete a survey about their views on the republic. In the first couple of weeks I have had several hundred replies, and I would like to read a few here in the House this evening. Five questions were asked. The first was, 'Do you believe there has been enough discussion on the topic?, The second was, 'Do you feel as though you have had enough of an opportunity to have your say?' The third simply was, 'Do you wish to retain the monarchy or change to a republic?' The fourth was, 'If you support the republic, what sort do you want?' The fifth was, 'If you like the current system, why?' Then I asked whether they wanted referendums, people's conventions or something else. A curious array of answers has come back, and there is no clear theme. I think that reflects this debate, and it reflects the need for all of us as members to go back to our electorates and ask the people what they want. A gentleman from Kambah wants a republic. But he does not want minimalist change; he wants to change our current system beyond the head of state. He wants to have a referendum when a detailed proposal has been formulated. That answer was consistent in the pro-republican answers. This gentleman says he wants a republic but that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should not have the final say on the republican issue. Another individual said he wanted a republic. He wanted to change the current system but not necessarily to that which has been proposed. Indeed, this gentleman wanted an immediate referendum to solve the issue. That was another theme that emerged quite quickly: people are afraid of the divisive nature of this debate and the way that it has been carried out. Another one wanted a republic but was not sure of where the system should go. He wanted a people's convention to have his say. Another person did not know because both arguments have merit.. Many people would say that. He did say, though, 'We do not want a socialist republic or a socialist grab for power.' Another individual, from Chisholm, my own suburb, is in favour of a republic and, indeed, wanted the minimalist approach. He said it was time to let the people decide. Another person did not know because all of the alternatives had not been examined. They felt a people's convention was the way to go but that it was for the people to decide, not Keating. There are many people out there who do want a republic, but agaih this person said they wanted to change our current system beyond the head of state. This reply said that a referendum should be held in about two years so that there is time to discuss other constitutional changes. This is because in the electorate of Canberra we have an educated and a thinking population who want a system of government that will take them into the next century. However, many people said, 'I do not know because the alternatives have not been examined.' One individual said, 'I do not trust the current government; therefore·my judgment is clouded.' That is an hones.t response. Here.is another person who said that they did not know and they wanted more time to decide. Here is another one who wants a people's convention. This person said, 'If the thing ain't broke, don't fix it. I do not trust Keating.' Here is another one who wants an immediate referendu,m because they are satisfied with the current system and that we should retain the constitutional monarchy. A theme that emerged quite quickly was that those in favour of the constitutional monarchy believe they should ·be able to have the right to have an immediate referendum. The government intends to hold a referendum in three or four years. Most of the people that responded in favour of the monarchy-and here are a few moresaid that they would prefer either an immediate referendum or a people's convention. But there was a secondary theme that emerged from the replies of a lot of these people, and that was that we should reveal the direct and indirect costs of such a change: 'Can the country afford it, given our balance of trade figures?' . Another one said, 'Further non-political debate, then a referendum. The current situation smacks of Keating being the bullyboy he is.' That was from a constitutional monarchist. Another one said, 'Ban this propaganda. It is a cynical con job to settle old scores, promote private ambitions and divert attention from the important but difficult issues. May God help us!' That was from another constitutional monarchist. A reply from another republican would also like a people's convention, but added the note, 'Drop the matter immediately until the country. is financially and economically viable.' So there is a theme out there that says people want to talk about and discuss this issue, but there is also an underlying fear that it is being used as a smokescreen. Another one stated, 'Not to be considered with the national debt we have; an immediate referendum to resolve the issue.' Another one wants a constitutional monarchy: 'No to the republic; it's the present government that is not working properly.' Obviously many people who feel most strongly about this issue are constitutional monarchists, and they have taken the opportunity to reply. But many people· said that they were not sure they knew enough about either system and said, 'Neither side is putting forward a clear debate. Please issue the pros and cons of both sides.' Here is another reply from a person who says he is a constitutional monarchist and wants an immediate referendum. His reply was, 'Keating is ignoring the people as usual.' Government member interjecting",111
119,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I wish to represent my people. Democracy is about people like me getting up to represent people. I want the best system of government that will en--re - y children have a safe future. The mlmmaltst approach that we have had given to us would simply indicate that the current system works very well. Government member interjecting,113
120,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, I do not want a commune at all. Here is another one who says, 'If you have a car that is running well, why tinker with it? What's the cost of the republic?' Another theme that emerged was, 'No change while our Queen is alive. No change of our flag ever.' It emerged quite quickly that a lot of the older people have great respect for the monarch, as I believe most of us here in the House would have. They feel that, out of due respect for the Queen, we should take our time. Mr Latham-Have you got 70,000?",113
121,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, I have not got 70,000, but I hope to by the end of the year, and I will read them all for you if you want. This is what it is about. Here is another constitutional monarchist: 'Stay the same. I am satisfied with the present system. Too much publicity on media re the republic. Things are better here than overseas.' There was also a theme from many migrants that they. did not feel that all migrants wanted a republic; they came here from republics that had failed.",113
122,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Nonsense.,113
123,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is not nonsense. Come and read them! You are welcome to come and sit here and read them. Another reply from a monarchist was that they felt they had not been involved in the discussion enough. The answer was, 'Save the costs. No change should be implemented before the end of the present monarch's reign, providing Australia's financial situation has improved.' Maybe the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) should go and survey his folk and see what they genuinely want. It is very easy to do.",113
124,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,How many support the Queen?,113
125,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"You have got figures to back that up? Here is another one from a constitutional monarchist: 'I am satisfied with the present system. Would prefer an immediate referendum. I would not trust Paul Keating as far as I could throw him'. It is very clear out in the community that it is not just the republic that is in question; it is the whole system of government and its implications. Many people said they did not feel that changing to a republic would make them feel any more Australian. As that is one of the major reasons that is given, perhaps they would like to discuss that more. What people from both sides of the argument-from the monarchists and the republicans-wanted was· clear and defined debate about the pros and cons of the system that both sides advocate. Here is another one who was for a republic, but they wanted more discussion about it. Some people felt they had not been given an opportunity to speak and there should be a people's convention followed by a referendum, based on the positives arising from a people's convention. Another reply says, 'While you have a hereditary monarchy, you cannot have a dictator, and we have plenty of candidates for that position. Millions of migrants have come here in the last 50 years, fleeing from repressive republics, and they are still coming by the boat load. It doesn't say anything good for republics and, if Australia is the greatest country on earth, how can you improve on that?' This reply is one I particularly like. It simply says, 'Educate the public on our present system of stability and freedom and then have a referendum.' The replies go on and on. This answer reflected what many people felt, whether justly or not: 'A change should not be made solely on the basis of Keating's hatred of everything British'obviously from a constitutional monarchist. They said they were satisfied with the present system, did not feel they had had enough opportunity to have their say and, indeed, supported a referendum at the next election. Mr Latham-What did Ricky Stuart think?",113
126,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I have not asked Ricky Stuart. Mr Latham-What about Mal?,114
127,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, Mal does not live in the electorate. But Mal and Ricky both have votes. In fact, they are probably thinking about more important things at the moment. But there are two sides and the majority of people want clear answers about the advantages and disadvantages of both arguments. Mr Latham-He's got 70,000 opinions. I want to hear from the people I know.",114
128,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, they are not people I know. These have come from different people. If you do not believe it, you can come and see them. They are all in different handwriting. One said, 'I feel the present unrest has been engineered by the PM because of his personal hatred of the English. The media and the republicans argue that the republic is inevitable. There is no evidence for this claim, which is simply a propaganda play.' That person wanted an immediate referendum and tagged themself as a constitutional monarchist. Another individual said they would like a people's convention. Another one, a monarchist who said that they would prefer a people's convention, said, 'Any change should evolve, and not be precipitated by the Prime Minister telling us what we want, when many are neither convinced nor ready for this and many young people and newcomers do not realise just what they are in danger of losing.' Mr Latham-How did you respond to the survey?",114
129,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I have not filled mine out yet. I might post it back to myself. Another person said, 'If being a republic means ending up like the USA, no thank you.' That· was another fear-that perhaps republicans .and republics do not offer all that they claim that they do. It went on and on. Mr Latham-What did your dog think?",114
130,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"My dog died about three years ago and he is buried in the backyard, so there you go. Mr Barry Jones-But he would have been a constitutional monarchist.",114
131,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, he was an Irish wolfhound, so he probably would have voted for an Irish style republic rather than Paul Keating's style of republic. 'This is a waste of time, effort and money about a completely unnecessary change. It is a diversion from the obvious.' It went on and on. There are about 400 so far. I hope over the next couple of months, while the House is in recess, more people of Canberra will have their say. I have repeated the offer and hope that a lot more will have their opinions. Those opposite are afraid of genuine debate. To present one option after a report that was done with funding for only one side of the debate is not a debate. If the honourable member opposite is serious about representing the people of Australia, perhaps he should go back to his electorate and ask them for some sort of survey, and he can get up and give his own rendition. Mr Latham-Your electorate would be overwhelmingly republican.",114
132,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Obviously not. The answer says that they are not, and that is the propaganda that many of these people have said that it isMr Barry Jones-This is a completely random sample?",114
133,Mr SMYTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am just reading them as they come up. If you want to come and read them, I will bring them over. I will bring them over after the debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will finish here. Given that our country is one of the world's greatest democracies, it is up to the people to decide. After the next election, and a coalition victory, democracy will continue in this country, when people decide through discussion, people's conventions and the referendum. It is clear that the people of my electorate, the people of Canberra, have important issues on their mind-unemployment, taxes and the deficit-but would like to be much more involved in the debate about how we are governed. I will keep the House informed of the results of the survey of the thoughts of the people of Canberra.",114
134,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (6.08 p.m.)This is a very serious and important debate in relation to the future of the constitution, the future of the nation. In that spirit, I have got to say that what has happened in response to the very statesmanlike speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is very unfortunate. The Prime Minister called for support from the opposition for the movement towards a republic. It is very unfortunate that what we had was a series of different positions from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). He changed position over the weekend. We were all left in the dark for quite a while until further clarification was made as to what the position was. Policy was made on the run. The opposition leader obviously had misread the position of the Australian people, who are obviously, in a majority, supportive of a change. What did the opposition leader do? He decided to keep changing his position until he got something which made him relatively comfortable and which the media were prepared to wear. But a historical opportunity was missed, and the historical opportunity was for an agreement as to how to proceed in a bipartisan way to achieve this very important constitutional change. If you followed the speeches of the members of the opposition, you would have seen why the opposition leader was struggling. You would have noticed that the fundamental reason for the problem for the opposition leader is that his party holds so many different positions on the real substance of the issue, and that is how we should elect the head of state and what proposition should be put to the people in a referendum for their decision. What has the Leader of the Opposition done? Throughout his convoluted processes and even after all those processes, to this day, he refuses to say whether he would support a republic or whether he wants an Australian head of state-the fundamental issue. He still has not said anything about it. We are left in a position where the opposition has had all of these different positions because of the divisions within it. You have got staunch monarchists-constitutional - on­ archists-who are 1,000 per cent commItted to the monarchy and then you have got staunch republicans. Within the republican camp you have got divisions between those who want the president elected by the parliament and those who want the president elected by popular will. When you have got all those different positions within the one political party and then the leader of the party refuses to state his own position, no wonder we have got a situation in this country where constitutional change on this important matter becomes very difficult to achieve. It is interesting to see the processes the Leader of the Opposition has finally put into place to resolve these issues. They ar- - s-en­ tially processes to cover up the dIVIsIOns within the party and within the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition had a historic opportunity to come together with the Prime Minister and say, 'Right, let's all go forward because this is the model.' It is very interesting that some members of the opposition have supported the proposal. The member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) was one. People have said that they personally believe that the president in a republic ought to be elected by a two-thirds majority of the houses of parliament: the same position as the Prime Minister. Of course, the member for Wakefield went on to say, 'Yes, but of course I have got to take into account the fact that all the other members of my party have different views.' Therefore he supports what? A process which would furth-r delay .t-e whole issue, further create tenSIOn and dIVIsion in society and further suggest to the people of Australia that there is something fundamentally wrong with the proposition put before them. It is very interesting to see how much ignorance there is on this subject. We have heard the opposition-the so-called conservatives of this country-talking about how important the Westminster system of government is to them. The Westminster system of government, Mr Deputy Speaker, depends on a very important fact-and that is that there will be no popularly elected head of government. If you introduce a popularly elected head of state, you compromise the Westminster system. That is not a statement of ideology on my part; it is simply a fact about political science. If you look at those nations that have tried to introduce an elected president-that is, a president elected by the people rather than by the houses of parliament-into the Westminster system, you end up with a situation in which you undermine the nature and structure of the Westminster system and you therefore undermine the system of democracy which we have here. As everyone knows, I am not. of British background. It has been said by several speakers opposite that the Prime Minister is anti-British in wanting a republic. That is a nonsense. If you look at the proposition which the Prime Minister has put forward, it is a proposition which would, in fact, entrench the Westminster system, which is one of the most fundamental points that we have gained from the British heritage. The claim that the Prime Minister is being anti-British in wanting a republic of the model which he has put forward is a nonsense. It is another one of those scurrilous statements that members of the opposition have come up with against the Prime Minister in circumstances where they should have known better. The reality is that the Westminster system would be entrenched by the proposal which the Prime Minister has put forward. It is true that some nations that formerly had the Westminster system, or adopted some version of a Westminster system, also elect a president. But in those cases you have exactly what the Prime Minister warned of in his statement and what other eminent people, such as Sir Zelman Cowan, warned of an elected president: the problem of dividing power between the newly elected president, the Prime Minister and the parliament. You then get a conflict which would then have to be resolved by all sorts of mechanisms. Our system which has worked well-that is, the Westminster system-needs to be embodied. If it is going to be embodied, then the warning that Sir Zelman raised should be heeded. He said: The president must not be the only directly elected executive officer in the system, posing a potential challenge to a Prime Minister who does not have such a base. I believe that direct election carries an assumption that the president should have, at least in reserve, large powers. And that, I believe, is unacceptable, certainly if, as is likely, we wish to retain an effective Westminster system. The fundamental point here is that we do not want a situation where we confuse the constitutional picture and we have a president directly elected that can then challenge the power of the elected representatives. This was the view of the founding fathers. Alfred Deakin, at the time of the founding of the constitution, said: The ambition of the democracy of this country is an ambition to shape its laws, to guide its destinies, to widen its opportunities, to make life in this country better worth living than it has been hitherto. For this purpose, the position of a representative in any of these colonies is infinitely superior to that of the Governor General. He was saying that if you are going to have power vested it has to be vested in the democratic chamber-in the House of Representatives in particular. These representatives have real power whereas the Governor General's role is one of symbolic representation-not an unimportant office; nevertheless, an office which is not directly elected in any way and which does not challenge the direct election, role and sovereignty of the parliament. That was the view of Alfred Deakin. This is a very important principle that cannot be sufficiently emphasised and one which we need to reiterate on this issue. If this point is made clearly to the Australian people, I am confident that a majority of the Australian people will support a constitutional change along the lines suggested by the Prime Minister and embodied in a two-thirds majority of the members of the House selecting the president. Interestingly, the Prime Minister's suggestion does not take away any of the powers of the Governor General. Some of us on this side of the House are not overly happy with that proposition. I for one am not overly happy with maintaining the reserve powers of the Governor General in the office of president. Nevertheless, in the spirit of compromise, so that there would be no fight between those two sidesMr Charles-Between the factions is what you are saying.",115
135,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, not between the factions at all; between those two sides of the House. Between those conservative people who think that those reserve powers are there and should be there and those people, such as me, who think that there should be fewer reserve powers of the Governor General as it is now. Nevertheless, what did the Prime Minister put forward? A very sensible proposition-that the powers remain there and be exercised on the basis of the fact that the president will obviously be answerable to two-thirds of the parliament in relation to the determinations that are made. Therefore, given that in our system it is extremely unlikely that anyone political grouping would get more than two-thirds control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, agreement would have to be reached by all the major political parties, both for the candidature of the presidency and for the continuing actions of the president in relation to any constitutional question. This means a consensus model-a model which tries to achieve consensus between both sides of the House of Representatives and both sides of the political fence, and indeed third parties as well. So that is the model which is obviously, as I said, consistent with the Westminster system but also positive in terms of what it can achieve with respect to consensus in this nation. As I mentioned earlier, instead of seriously considering that model the opposition seeks to cover up its massive division on this issue by putting forward various other processes, including the difficult and potentially dangerous process of suggesting that we could have a move towards a different kind of system altogether, which would be the case if we had an elected president. Mr Deputy Speaker, whatever model of elected president you look at, you will see that the reality is that in all jurisdictions where the president has been directly elected there have been problems in terms of the powers of the president and the powers of the parliament. I think the honourable member for Macquarie (Mrs Deahm) referred to the enormous powers of the French President. If we look at the original intentions of the French presidency, we will see that the idea was that the powers were to be shared between the president and the parliament of France. What has happened? The French President's powers have been increasing all the time because of the potential of the President to actually sack the government· of France. (Extension of time granted) Therewas an evolving constitutional situation which was not intended by the founders of the republic. There was going to be a sharing of power but, increasingly, the president gained more and more power. His power to dissolve parliament virtually at will means that the parliamentary representatives in France are generally being increasingly weakened, and that of course means that they do not have anything like the Westminster model any more in France. There is a situation in which the President is able to make all these very powerful determinations. Not only is he able to make determinations of who will constitute the ministry, the executive and all those sorts of things; he is also able to make determinations on key matters which ought to be debated. Key matters, such as French nuclear testing, do not go to the parliament of France to be debated. They are simply announced by the President and that is the end of the matter. We certainly do not want a system like that. If we look at the American presidency, we will see that there is an even more difficult situation. You can get a situation where you have a congress from one political party and a president from another and you have these enormous deadlocks that keep preventing legislation going through the Congress of the United States because the President suggests one direction, the Congress suggests another direction and it is not possible to get any kind of unity in relation to legislation or as to what is going to come up within the American system. As I said at the beginning, the Prime Minister's comments were certainly not antiBritish. They were based on a fundamental respect for the key features of the Westminster system. He was saying, 'Let us not move towards the dangerous door of having an elected president, where that personality can gain more and more powers even if they are not stated at the beginning.' As Sir Zelman Cowan said, those powers can develop over a period of time and then you would have conflicts between the elected government in terms of the parliament-the House of Representatives and the Senate-and the president. It is very necessary for us to have a repUblic. A republic is something which the overwhelming proportion of the Australia people want. I think it was the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) who said that, of the ad hoc replies he had received after he had asked people to write to him on the issue, most were from monarchists, some of whom were of migrant background. He assumed, because he had a few replies from migrants which suggested that maybe they do not want a change-they want to retain a monarchy-that there is significant division in the ethnic communities on this question. Let me assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is not. The fundamental point is that the overwhelming proportion of Australia's ethnic leaders and migrant community leaders support a repUblic. The Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils has issued a statement saying that the ethnic communities assess the move towards republicanism as acknowledging the new identity of Australia. They are referring there to the multicultural identity of Australia. Many people can be quoted. Let me quote Lawrence Lau, the President of the Australian Chinese Community Association of New South Wales, a group of people whom the Leader of the Opposition has been trying to woo recently by constant visits to the Chinese community in Sydney. Lau says: From my own understanding, it would be fair to say the majority would say we should be independent and sever our links to the past and be a truly independent nation. That is what he said about the importance of a republic. The Bulletin of 27 June 1995 says that community leaders now make it clear that the republican issue may become a test of the leadership mettle of both the Prime Minister and the opposition leader, impacting on their electoral popularity. Surveys of ethnic people have shown that the vast proportion of them want a republic. If the opposition leader is fair dinkum about talking to a multicultural constituency-and we have heard that he has changed his views on this issue of multiculturalism and is embracing the cultural diversity of Australia, although I still have not seen a good statement on the matter and am sceptical about that-he would have come out and stated clearly that he supports an Australian republic and an Australian head of state. The massive failure in leadership in not doing that has created circumstances in which a potential bipartisan position which would have led to a smooth constitutional change--one that I am sure the vast majority of the Australian people will come to desireMr Charles-While Mr Keating is Prime Minister we have got no hope of anything bipartisan.",117
136,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Here we go. The honourable member says that while the Prime Minister is there they will not agree to anything on a bipartisan basis. That is the way in which they proceed in their style of politics. The reality is that he has not been able to look at this matter from the historical opportunity which it offers. The statesmanship which the Leader of the Opposition should have shown in relation to this matter he has not been able to show. As a consequence of that, they may have achieved the temporary unity between their ranks, who all hold different views on this matter. But the fundamental point is that we could have moved forward. I am still hopeful that after the election, when the Australian people again assert what they believe and re-elect the Australian Labor Party, we will move to the republican referendum on the basis of the sensible proposals put forward by the Prime Minister.",118
137,Mr NEVILLE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I have always believed that our relationship with the United Kingdom has been, and will continue to be, an evolutionary one. We were discovered in 1770 and ignored for 18 years. We became a penal colony. Tasmania was hived off as a separate colony. Other colonies were formed in Melbourne, originally near Brisbane, a free settlers settlement was set up in Adelaide, there was a somewhat ambivalent convict colony in Perth, and various other parts across Australia were settled for all of reasons and in different times up until the 1850s. Between the mid and late 19th century, they became self-governing colonies or states. Following their obtaining independence, there was a move from the mid-1850s through to the tum of the century for some form of Australian unity. That required a series of gatherings across Australia· and·constitutional conventions, some of which some states approved and others did not. After a: long and tortuous system, eventually we became a Commonwealth in 1901. I am sure we all honour that day, which was certainly a definitive day in Australia's history. Between 1926 and the Second World War, any mechanisms were totally removed that might have tied us to the British parliament. Our relationship became that with the Queen as our head of state, and not with some intermediate force. In 1953, with the Royal Style and Titles Act, all the forms and titles, including Queen of Australia, became part of our constitutional background. In other words, by that stage our whole constitution had become inherently Australian. We have heard it said that our heads of state have not been Australians, but I remind the House that for the last 30 years our governors-general-who have had all the power, .even as Gough Whitlam said, of a viceroy-have been distinguished Australians and have not lacked authority. We mayor may not agree with the action taken by Sir John Kerr, and it is still a matter of some contention in this House. Nevertheless, one could not for a minute quibble with the force of that authority. At that time, Time magazine said that probably no head of state had exercised more power in that field since George III. So we could hardly say that our heads of state lacked authority. It should be remembered that the Governor General is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Australian Prime Minister. This progress in evolution will continue and will be coloured by several factors-factors that will be beyond our control as Australians. One of those will be the degree and form of European unity. A matter of grave contention sorts at this very moment in Great Britain is the extent to which that country should be Europeanised-whether its currency should be Europeanised and so on. There will be factors that change this relationship. I want to argue the case for an evolutionary process. While it is all well and good to set targets for the year 2000 or the year 2001, it is infinitely more important that we get it right. An artificial target will not enhance the quality of life in Australia or the quality of the government in Australia. To be quite honest, I favour the current form and style of government. This is not based for one minute on any Anglophile leanings. It is not for nostalgia either, nor is it for any fawning regard for the British royal family, much as I admire the Queen and many of those in the line of succession. I have always seen the strength in the monarchy not being in the power vested in Elizabeth Windsor but in the power that is denied to all others. It is a unique reserve power that distinguishes monarchies that have adopted this system from all other forms of government. Some of the longest running democracies in the world and the most stable governments are monarchies in that mould. You would probably cite one of two exceptions to the rule. I am not saying that it should be exclusive but this is the rationale of where I come from. As I said, the strength of the monarchy is not in the power vested in Elizabeth Windsor but in the power denied to all others. As the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said, the great dilemma that we face if we are to become a republic is whether a president should be elected by two-thirds of the parliament or by popular vote. Once you vest, by popular vote, a head of state with powers, there is an added reserve power that you cannot deny him or her, and that is the one of popular election. In terms of popular election, that person holds a de facto power greater than that of the Prime Minister, who at the end of the day is only the leader of the party with the largest number of seats in the House. That is the dilemma. My other reason for supporting the current system is cultural. I do not mean cultural in the artistic sense of the word but in the broad sense. I refer to the influence on links with our judicial, legal, political, parliamentary, military and academic systems. I do not think we have thought through nearly well enough just how many of those things have to be changed in this headlong rush towards a republic by some members in this House. I would like to look at some of the arguments that have been thrown up. Time does not permit me to go into each argument in a great deal of depth. One argument is that we will at long last have an Australian head of state. To all intents and purposes, that has been the case for at least the last 30 years and many before that. Another argument put forward concerns our place in Asia. Anyone who has anything to do with Asians will realise that they have a great deal of respect for family, a great deal of respect for integrity and a great deal of respect for not compromising themselves. Once you compromise yourself, you lose face. If you lose face in the Asian dimension, you are a nothing. Only in the last week Professor Claudio Veliz was back in Australia. He is a former professor of sociology and history at La Trobe University. In an address to Australians, Professor Veliz asked, 'Are you really on the right track, wanting to become de facto Asians?' He was not suggesting for a minute any Asian push in Australia. He is asking whether we are approaching our relationship with Asia in the right way. He is quoted as follows: ""Australia is very distant and you appear to have the very best of the western cultural tradition;"" he said. . ""But Asia is thoroughly unimpressed. by your efforts to master their language. They're charming, and they are courteous and they smile sweetly but they speak better English. By that he means that they speak better English than we speak Asian languages. Professor Valez further stated: ""You are valued in Asia for being what you are. It's unlikely you will sweep the world off its feet by pretending to be something you're not. I will just take tourism as an example. People do not come to Australia because we are another Asian country. They: come here because we are distinctively something else. We are, on the one hand, a great environment with a huge mass of natural attractions and, on the other hand, to some extent an extension of Western culture in the Pacific. That is why the Asians come here. That is why the Japanese girls want to be married in white dresses and so on-because they want to capture some of our culture. Why we wOl,lld want to surrender that sort of thing so willingly to become, if you like, as much a fawl1ing appendage of Asia as you claim we have become a fawning appendage of England, I would not know. To 'Some extent it would be going from the frying pan into the fire. So that is that Asian argument. Another argument is that we need a more full and comprehensive sovereignty. We have never lacked sovereignty in this country. As I have explained earlier, the last residual processes-and the one I did not mention, of course, was appeal to the Privy Councilhave long since passed. But for people to argue that case and to then so freely surrender our sovereignty to certain United Nations conventions does not add up. I do not argue against all United Nations conventions. I do not argue against the law of the sea, the rules of exchange, the rules of customs and extradition or the air and navigational regulations. I have no argument with any of those. They are all sensible. I could even stretch my reluctance to accept some, not all, of the applications for World Heritage listing, recognising that certain parts of the world belong to all the world, because if they are damaged by one nation they are damaged for all. But I do not believe, for example, that that should extend to our own national parks. For God's sake, we don't need someone in New York telling us what we should do. We do not deserve them if we need someone from outside telling us what to do. But we surrender the sovereignty so willingly. We do not even bring it into this parliament for a debate. We do not even. think the surrender of our sovereignty is worthy of discussion from both sides of this House and our Senate. If we are fair dinkum about wanting a more full and comprehensive sovereignty, then let us address that as this convention or these referendums come up, because I think what we have surrendered in the last five or 10 years in that field is nitely worse than anything that we were subjected to prior to the statute of Westminster or because we had appeals to the Privy Council. Finally, another argument is that not being a republic is somehow offensive to people of ethnic background. I find that a very tortuous argument. In my own electorate, although there are a lot of ethnic groups, especially Italians, they are very loyal monarchists, strangely. Many of them are very reluctant change, although I concede that some of more recent times do not have that attitude. Certainour ly, Italians who have lived here for two, three and four generations are very much in mould of respect for the monarchy. So I not think that that is an argument. People talk about ethnic councils and so and I respect their right to have a view in debate. But I do not think there should all-smothering, all-comprehensive view ethnic Australians. I think other people have a right to be consulted right down to the grassroots. My experience has been, especialwould ly with Italians and Irish-you may find that unusual with the Irish-that there has been great deal of loyalty to the British system. Archbishop Duigh, the Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, with the exception of Archbishop Gonzi of Malta, I think was the first Catholic prelate to have been knighted since the Reformation. If he had been a bigoted lrishaway. man, it was a rather strange thing for him to accept the knighthood of the British Crown. Finally, one of the arguments put up for this is that we need more maturity. Well, we had a lovely example of maturity in our adopted city of Canberra just a few months ago, with that sculpture called 'Down by the Lake with Liz and Phil'. Mr Tanner-Are you blaming us for that?",119
138,Mr NEVILLE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, I am not blaming you for that. But it was pretty ordinary art, as we all know, and it had some de jure recognition from a Commonwealth instrumentality in so far as permission was given for it to be put..in that position, in one of the prime areas on Lake Burley Griffin, where obviously it was infigoing to be seen by a lot of people: (Extension of time granted) I do not care if you are a republican or if you are a monarchist, but I think that crass, coarse display down by the lake, with which at least the instruments of government were reluctant to intervene, really denigrated us. Whether you are a monarchist or a republican, your head of state is the unifying symbol of your country. Whether you like our head of state or not as a person or whether you like to the system or not is not important. It was appalling that our head of state, the symbol of unity, and her consort could be denigrated in such a way, and that the instruments of the government took so long to do something do about it. You might be pardoned for saying there was almost a silent revelling in this denigration of the British monarchy. But what on, would the circumstance have been if down by this the lake we had had a statue of President be an Suharto and his wife or Prime Minister of Mahathir and his wife? There would have been an outrage. There would probably have been a diplomatic incident about it, and it have been removed from the site of Lake Burley Griffin in double-quick time, a because it would have been an embarrassment for us to have one of our neighbours denigrated in such a way. Yet this maturity that we are supposed to have brought on ourselves of recent years was not sufficient for the sculpture of our own head of state to be wiped I just find some of those arguments go a bit too far. Let me speak for a short time on the Keating model. While I do not doubt the sincerity of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in wanting to put his case across, and while I concede, as the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) did, that it was a very polished performance, there were a few glib phrases in that speech that I suspect were there to mollify the public and, certainly, to mollify any opposition to the republic. For example, we are going to hold on to the title 'Commonwealth'. We are not going to use the word 'republic'. We are going to be a republic, but we will hang on to the word 'Commonwealth' because that is soft and cuddly and people will like that; that will not get people's backs up. We will retain the reserve powers, though we know the Prime Minister detests them with a living hate. We will retain those because that will soften and mollify another group of the population. We will go for the minimus change because in the broad spectrum of things that will mollify yet another group. We will go for a two-thirds majority because that will cause the fewest ripples. That is where the whole system came unstuck. As we said, that is where the great dilemma exists in this debate. Let me, on that point, pose what might happen. Let us assume that we were a republic and we were coming up to one of these two-thirds majority cases. Let us say we had excluded all political candidates for the last five years, as is the proposed model. Let us say that there were two candidates and the opposition and the government each fervently wanted a different one of those candidates. They could not agree and both sides decided that they would not give the other side the two-thirds majority and they would not seek another candidate. There you would have the elements of another little constitutional crisis on your hands. Probably, at the end of the day, there would be a compromise. But I bring it up to show you that there are flaws in that system too. Mr Tanner-Read the speech again.",121
139,Mr NEVILLE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Yes. Moving on from that, I would like to echo one of the things the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said in that debate. I think he was motivated by the same sense of purpose and honesty as was the Prime Minister. He said that the worse possible scenario for this country would be. a narrow result one way or the other. That would irrevocably separate us, it would set Australian against Australian and we really do not know where that might end 'up. The whole Turnbull committee process set Australians into a mould pf suspicion. That committee was virtually hand-picked by the Prime Minister. Other nomi-ees, including the distinguished academic, because of their other leanings were not included. It was a stacked deck. It came up with a 500-page report for a minimalist option. That was the start. That was going to be the first throw of the dice in a democratic republican debate, yet the process itself was distinctiVely undemocratic. All the countries of central Europe and South America that have gone over the edge have said, 'We will have to pervert the old constitution just a little to get the new one in. After that she will be hunky-dory.' They have been chopping and changing ever since. You can see it today right across central Europe, in the old Yugoslavia and adjoining countries, and through South America. There have been 200 years of chopping and changing. Unless that process of change is truly democratic, not only in name but in spirit, it will not work. Having said all those things, I am not one who would oppose change. I think that the coalition's model can work. It will allow two things. It will allow the public, half of them elected and the other half appointed-and do not let us get all upset about the appointed ones; the state premiers and people like that have to be in the process-to be involved and it allows a filtering system to put up the options. If we go towards a referendum to either change the constitution or become a republic and if there is not broad community support, we are going to get one of two things. We will have the thing chucked out comprehensively and put this whole process back 20 years or we will have that 49:51 result that will divide this country. That is why that intermediate step, that step of options that the Leader of the Opposition proposed, is so important. The final point I make is that, regardless of which way this debate goes, I will enter into it fully. I will accept the overwhelming decision of the Australian people expressed at referendum. (Time expired)",122
140,Mr TANNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Melbourne) (6.54 p.m.)The great difficulty with this debate on the republican statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is that; by and large, half of the debate is not around. Because the Liberal Party and the National Party are effectively hiding behind the proposal for a people's convention and not stating what they believe and what their position is on the key issues, it is very difficult to have a serious and genuine debate about the proposal for a republic. I exempt the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) to some extent from those remarks because he stated his position reasonably clearly in· his contribution. The classic illustration of this was the speech by the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth), who told us the views of every constituent in his electorate but not his own. He failed to say what he believed. It was reminiscent of the Yes, Minister program recently when the minister said, 'I am their leader; I lnust follow them.' I would like to hear the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and other members of the Liberal Party answer the question: do they believe in an Australian head of state? Do they believe that all Australian citizens should be eligible to occupy the position of head of state? The Liberal Party is hiding. It is trying to avoid these questions. This is leading to an upsurge of fairly nonsensical arguments coming from a variety of places and sometimes being reiterated by people on the coalition benches. My favourite is: 'The republic will not cure all known diseases. It is not going to solve unemployment and crime and everything else, therefore, why should we do it?' It is not designed to do those things. Nobody claims it will. It is a bit like refusing treatment for measles because it will not also fix your broken leg at the same time. Then we have the 'What are the benefits?' approach-'You tell me in dollar terms, or in concrete terms, what the benefits are.' It is legitimate to ask what you should have a republic for, but there are things that you cannot measure. For example, how do you measure the benefits of getting rid of a gerrymander in a state like Queensland? You cannot measure it in dollar terms but, clearly, a better, more honest, fairer and more representative system of government that is a better reflection of the Australian people is a good thing. It is something that we should aspire to, and to try to reduce this to dollar and cents terms is obviously ridiculous. So to ask, 'What are the benefits?' is to narrow the question too much. It is a legitimate question, but it is only part of the question. Then we have the suggestion that this is all a diversion, that in some way there is a grand conspiracy-and there are lots of conspiracy theorists always lurking on the opposition benches-and that this is just a diversion from the real problems of the nation. It is suggested that the ordinary people out there in the community-from day to day they face a whole variety of economic problems, economic issues-could possibly be diverted from these concerns if we pursue a republic, as if this will distract them. Apart from anything else, it is a massive insult to the intelligence of the Australian people to suggest that we could possibly do something of that nature, even if it were sought to be done. Then there is the suggestion that this is a great conspiracy by the Prime Minister to ensure that he can become the first president of an Australian republic. The fact that the model that the Prime Minister has proposed more or less makes it impossible for him to be the first president does not seem to deter people from running this sort of theory. Then we have arguments that the debate is divisive and, therefore, we should not have it-a proposal is supported by some and opposed by others and therefore it is divisive, which is a bad thing, so let us sweep it under the carpet and forget it. The debate about Federation in the 1890s was fairly divisive at the time. There was strong opposition to Federation, including, for a fair time, from within the Labor movement. Yet I do not think anybody at the time suggested that, because it was divisive and there were different views, we ought to just forget it and say, 'Okay, we'll leave things as they are because a few people disagree with it.' Then there is the hoary old hidden agenda suggestion-and the honourable member for Hinkler gave that a bit of a run this eveningwhich says that if we put forward a minimalist republic proposal, by stealth, without the Australian people noticing, and as if by magic the states will disappear, the Senate will disappear and maybe we will have a military dictatorship come in or some other nonsense of this kind. In fact, there was a degree of whimsicality and almost melancholy in the voice of the honourable member for Hinkler when he went through the Prime Minister's proposal and pointed out that most of those things had been deliberately ruled out, as if some of the best weapons for a Liberal and National scare campaign had been removed. Then there is the suggestion that republics are chronically unstable, that they are inherently unstable, and that monarchies are inherently stable. If you look across the world, you could find examples on both sides of the ledger for both kinds of government. What makes a country stable is not its system of government; it is the nature of its people, its circumstances, its history, its culture, its location and a whole range of issues. Systems of government obviously have some influence in this but, ultimately, a relatively minor influence compared with the greater issues of substance. To suggest that if Australia were to become a republic it would descend into economic and social chaos, or that the economic and social fabric of the nation would be damaged, is patently absurd. If we are to suffer those sorts of things, it will be substantive forces within the community, within our society, that produce those outcomes, not a mere small change to our constitutional structure. Finally, amongst some of the more fatuous propositions that are run by various people in opposition to a republic, we have the sovereignty argument-we are handing over control to those nasty people in the United Nations; it is only one step removed from the Michigan militia, the one-world government or Fabian Society conspiracy-from people in various quarters of the country who suggest that we are selling out our sovereignty. The honourable member for Hinkler this evening has again managed to make sure that facts did not get in the way of a good story. He suggested that we are in some way bound by international conventions, without this parliament even being a-le to debate the proposition. That is quite clearly not true. In order for an international convention that Australia becomes a signatory to to have any impact within this country, this parliament has to pass legislation that is based on that convention and, in all the examples that he presented to the parliament, that is precisely what has occurred: legislation h-s been put to the parliament, debated and passed. Even the recent situation with Teoh's case, which produced something of an indirect exception to this rule of international conventions being taken into account in legal interpretation' of administrative decisions based on legislation, the government proposes to take legislative action to limit that exception so that the same principle still stands-the international convention, whatever it relates to, will have effect in Australia only if this parliament legislates accordingly. I tum to the matters of substance in the proposal. I am happy to support the Prime Minister's proposal as a broad proposition, but I would prefer a popularly elected president. If that is not to be the case, I certainly think the proposal is a worthy one and something I will be happy to support, along with the rest of the Australian Labor Party. But there is a finely balanced debate on the question of a president appointed by the parliament as opposed to one being elected by the people. I think one of the tragedies of the debate is that the opposition is failing to debate this finely balanced issue. I have a personal preference, but I am open to being persuaded otherwise. I would like to put a few points to the House tonight. The first is the notion that we should have a non-political person in the position. It is the powers of the position and the nature of the position that make it political, not the person who is in it. The question is what is the role of the position, not what tasks does it require the performance of. It is a central part of our political system, and that is why it will be, to a certain degree, political. This focusing on the individual who will be in it is quite wrong. Fortunately, the government has eschewed some of the more elitist and nonsensical suggestions about how we could acquire a president-for example, having an eminent persons committee that could vet nominations. If you have ever heard anything more ridiculous and elitist, I would be interested to hear it. The suggestion that we would end up with a party hack if we had a popularly elected president is misconceived. The balance between the two major parties in Australia has historically been relatively even and there would be a substantial proportion of the community in the middle that would simply not vote automatically for the candidate of either party's selection without considering the merits of the individuals. The end result of that would be that both parties would tend to put up candidates who, although they had leanings towards the Liberal Party or the Labor Party, would clearly stand on their merits as people who would undoubtedly perform the obligations of the position responsibly, in accordance with their constitutional obligations and without fear or favour to the party to which they had leanings. The other issue that is cited is the potential clash between a popularly elected president and the Prime Minister and government of the day. That does exist, but it means that you would have to have very clearly codified powers. The same problem could arise with a president elected by the parliament, in this way: it requires a two-thirds majority to dismiss a president under the proposal. If we have a president who has been elected by a two-thirds majority of parliament who then gets into some sort of clash with the government, and maybe exceeds his or her powers, how likely is it that the opposition of the day is going to join with the government and help the government dismiss that president? It is almost a certainty that the party in opposition would make use of that opportunity to harass the government and support. the president, hence you would still have a problem. The key question is what that person's powers are, and that is why I feel that this is an overstated concern about a popularly elected president. My basic principle· is· that any major position in our political system should be directly elected by the people. There needs to be very strong reasons why it should be otherwise, and I am not as yet convinced that in this case those reasons are overwhelming. I think the Prime Minister's point of view, that the diffusion of power through the Westminster system and the fact that the Prime Minisier and other ministers are not directly elected by the people, does have some merit. However, there is not a direct analogy here because the point remains that the Prime Minister and ministers are still elected by the people. The Prime Minister has to get here as the member for Blaxland. He is still elected by 70,000 or 80,000 people, so there is at least some degree of a democratic base through direct popular election. The president, under the current proposal, would not be elected by the people at all. It is not a direct analogy. There are two core issues: firstly, whether we have an Australian head of state; and, secondly-and this is one that has been a bit understated in the whole republican debate, and I really want to emphasise it-whether the position of head of state is open for you, for me, for every adult citizen in this country to aspire to. That is my fundamental objection to the current system: I oppose all monarchy. I regard it as a manifestation of feudal and medieval times. I oppose monarchy in the same way that I oppose burning witches at the stake. It is a product of a bygone era. It offends the fundamental democratic principle which I adhere to very strongly, that all positions of importance in the government of the country should be open to all citizens of that country, irrespective of birth, gender, religion and so forth. Clearly, the existing arrangements for a head of state offend that principle. That and the notion of having an indigenous head of state are the key reasons why we should support the proposal before us. We would like a debate about the detail of the proposal. I would urge the opposition to try to avoid some of the more ludicrous propositions that I have cited-some of the stuff that has been put in opposition to a republic and some of which has been menas tioned this afternoon and this evening-and to start to focus on some of these key of how a president should be elected and what powers he or she should have. Let us have proper debate about these things. Lastly, I would like. to emphasise, along with the honourable member for Hinkler, that I put my position in this debate very strongly on the basis that I am not anti-British; pro-British and proud of it. I have, like members of this House, a very close connecWorld tion with the United Kingdom. I have relaof tives there. Virtually everything about me culture, history, education, religion-you name it-is of British origin and I am proud of that. I have an intense interest in of Britain and I am not going to back away from that for a moment. So I reject any suggestion that this is British bashing or pommy bashing, and I absolutely reject bunyip nationalism that occasionally intrudes into the debate about the republic. I would like to see Australia hang on to its British history, culture, heritage and the like and, equally, its Aboriginal history and culture and the history and culture that is brought to Australia by people of many other its people. nations that have settled here. If we are mature enough to debate these issues properly, we can do that. We can look at the core issues of principle of whether we want an Australian head of state and whether that is a position that is open to all Australian citizens to occupy. The opposition has been unable to confront those issues as yet. If we are able to confront issues and answer yes to those questions, then we can have a proper debate about the detail which, as far as I am concerned, question. There are many points to be made on all sides of the question on the detail. I call on the opposition to start participating in that and to get over the infantile nonsense that has tended to dominate many of the responses. Mr mCKS (Riverina) (7.08 p.m.)-At this late hour I rise to speak on this debate about whether or not Australia should become a republic. I do so just to add a few personal thoughts to it-I will not go into it as deeply the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner)for example, if we have a republic, how the issues republiC will work, et cetera. When I was a young lad going to primary a school and then on to high school, I remember vividly pictures of the - ate King George VI and his Queen and their family in Britain and travelling around the world, Of course, not long after that King George VI died. But I am also since that time and now in the 50th many anniversary of the ending, of the Second War, we see the old Movietone news the King and the Queen walking around in the ruins in London and other parts of England, buoying up the British and representing, as they did then, the old British Empire and and love later on the British Commonwealth. Even allowing for that as a youngster, I was very much a republican. I did not believe· in royalty or anything like that. I believed that the we should have a republic or some such thing. That was before I got to know the rich heritage of our Westminster system, the parliament, the fact that we had a constitution and that that constitution was very important. Later I also learnt about the great stability that that constitution brought to Australia and Having read a little about it I found out that when our founding fathers, who set up the Australian constitution and government as we now know it, decided to take on a bicameral system based on the Westminster system they studied the system in the United States, they studied republics, they looked at the constitutional monarchy and they decided to set up those the system that we have. Some writers say that we have almost an 80 per cent republican system in Australia today, if you can judge it is an open in percentage terms. Mr Nehl interjecting",123
141,Mr HICKS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"That is right. Our constitutional fathers believed that they were instituting the best of all possible systems. The great migrations after the Second World War brought many people to our land who were not of British heritage. They came from all over the world-refugees and people who were migrating to find a better way of life. They did not come to Australia because we did or did not have a constitutional monarchy, or we were a republic, or anything else; they came because they believed that Australia was a free nation. They believed that it must have a decent system of government if it was a free nation and they believed that it promised them something. In many of the countries they had come from they had known war and terror. Even before the war, they had systems of govern- .. ment in which it did not matter how hard you worked, you could not get anywhere. Everything you earned belonged to someone else and you lived on a pittance. So they came to Australia to find a new way of life. I was very surprised to hear the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) say that he had spoken to the heads of the various ethnic groups and that they believed in a republic. While I do not disbelieve him, it is a bit like saying that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) represents the workers of the country. This is obviously and patently not true, because we have all come to know that really we have a Prime Minister who is a bit of a Bollinger socialist, I suppose-like some of the people who are with him. So I do not think he does represent the workers of this nation; I am sure he does not. While the leaders of the various ethnic groups might like to believe that they are representing all of the people they are allegedly speaking for, I do not believe they really totally know what the people whom they say they represent believe or want for the nation that they now live in. Having said that, I still believe, however, that there have been changes in Australia and that a lot of the people they do represent, whatever their heritage-whether they be Italian, German, English, Scottish, French or whateverobviously have been thinking about the direction Australia should go in and that they will have their point of view made known. The Prime Minister, for whatever reasonsI do not know what they are-has been more recently promoting the republic. The unfortunate thing about it is that it has been so divisive. We could have got together and said, 'Perhaps we may not have the most perfect system of government.' I believe it is probably the best that I have seen in the countries I have visited. It might not be perfect. When the people in my electorate have asked me about this question, I have for a number of years said, 'We do need a constitutional convention, an ongoing one. Let's look at it gradually. Let's decide where we should be going and what we should be doing. Then we can put a referendum to the people and gradually change our system if they want the system changed.' I do not know what the tremendous rush is in trying to change a system so rapidly, even on our side of politics. As has been said before by other speakers, we have had an Australian head of state for over 30 years, despite what has been said. To rush this is not the way to go, particularly in a country such as Australia where we do have our freedom and our checks and balances. But some of the statements I have heard from the Prime Minister seem to me to be a little bit strange. Mr Nehl-He's a bit strange, you know.",126
142,Mr HICKS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"As the honourable member says, it really is a little strange for the Prime Minister to say either that he does not quite know where he is going or that he does not know where the nation is going-I am not sure whether he spoke of himself or the nation in that regard. We do not know who we are. We are half one thing and half another. We are not quite sure of our position in the world, our position in Asia, or of anything else. If the Prime Minister knows neither where he nor the rest of the nation is going, he should really go and seek help on the matter. As an Australian I am sure that I know who I am, where I live, what part of the world I belong to and what my aspirations are for the future. But there is another issue in connection with this: there is no doubt that Australia is a unique nation amongst nations. As we are a unique nation, why should we not have a unique form of government if that is what we want? Do we have to be a republic? Do we have to be a constitutional monarchy? I do not think so. As a unique country, with unique aspirations, with the unusual geographical situation in which it is placed, ralia's government should be the one which its people believe we should have. No form of government should be thrust on the people by any government. It is up to the people to decide what form of government we should have. We in the coalition believe that in 1997 a people's convention should be established to debate various issues. For people to go to a referendum and be told, 'Well, this is what you have. Take it or leave it,' is the wrong way to go. There should be discussion as to where we are going and, as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the young people should have a major say. It is they who will be affected long after we are dead and gone. If a consensus comes out of that constitutional convention, it should be put to the people in a referendum. The Prime Minister believes that we should not have a popularly elected president-that would give the people too much say-but that we should have an election by the parliament. But I believe that will be hotly contested by the people of Australia. Just as the Prime Minister brought on the debate about the flag initially and then withdrew it because of the hostile reception he could see he was getting, this debate in the past has been fairly divisive. Australia has enough problems now. For example, today we were told of Australia's problem with its $2.9 billion current account deficit. We have problems that I do not think most Australians understand or realise we have and about which our government is not telling us. If there are things which need to be done at this time, they need to be things which will unite the nation in facing its common peril. We must not have division in our community as it is bad for the country. The member for Melbourne touched on the subject of the many furphies which were being bandied about in an attempt to scare people off having a republic. The people of Australia do have some doubts, but we must take their doubts into consideration. We cannot just override those people, even if-as the member believes-they are from the looney Left or the strange Right, or wherever. Aust- These are Australian people and we must consider their concerns, no matter what those concerns are. All Australians should have the opportunity to have their say on this issue. The member for Melbourne also said earlier that we have raised in this argument the furphy of the United Nations conventions. As the member said-and he is correct in this matter-these conventions should not have any effect on us, unless legislation in this parliament is passed either· agreeing or disagreeing with the content of those conventions. But, quite frankly, this is not the case. I have heard and read of judgments and rulings made by those in the legal profession-magistrates and judges---citing United Nations conventions. Not only did this occur in the recent famous case to which the honourable member referred, but I have heard other mentions of it. We have heard a few ministers in this place saying that they do not agree with what various state governments are doing and that they will approach or invoke the powers of the United Nations in an attempt to get something done about it. Surely, this must be a threat'tQ. our sovereignty. I believe that already these United Nations conventions are placing a great strain on our independence. People from other nations in the past have ventured outside their country to search for their head of state. Strange as that may seem to us here, they have done so because they wanted a head of state who was separate from the local politics of their country. They believed that, if they could get someone who was completely independent, they would not run the risk of having unrest within their nation. In fact, when talking about a monarchical system, with the handing down of duty from father to son or mother to daughteralthough I believe that it will be up to the Australian people to decide this issue-one problem which is not usually had is that of complete political unrest in a nation. However,certainly in the past kings and queens have been murdered; there is no doubt about that. We must put this issue to the Australian people. But before we do that-that is, hold a referendum with just a few yeses or noswe have to allow the Australian people to air their views in a constitutional convention. A number of varying views can then come forwardMr Neville-Freedom of choice.",127
143,Mr HICKS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"with freedom of choice, as the honourable member says. If we then have a consensus of opinion, we can put it to the Australian people. There is no tremendous hurry or rush. The system we have has served us for many years. There is no doubt that. Australia is a free nation-and we must be grateful that we live in a free nation under the system we have. Let us not do anything rash that would change that situation. If we are to have a republic, so be it. Let us have one that we are all very clear on, one where we know in which direction we are going and one on which the Australian people agree. If they do not want a republic, then let that also be the case. But we must not have the situation, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, where there is only one system of government which, in the minds of the Australian people, wins out by only a very narrow majority. If that happens, we will have the worse of all worlds. I will leave it there. I hope that for the of the unity of this nation we can come to a situation where all Australians have a say in what the future of the Australian system of government will be.",129
144,Mrs CROSIO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (7.22 p.m.)-In one way I am grateful for the lateness of this hour on this, the last day of sitting. It gives me, with a number of other people, the opportunity to express a view on the republic. Even though I and others have had our names down to speak on this debate, we thought, because of the pressure of other business coming forward, it would never be possible. It means a great deal to me to speak on the republic. Well I remember my grandfather on my mother's side-my mother's father-who was still alive when I was quite young and growing up. He was Norwegian by birth and lived with us for many years. As I recollect, when I was in my 11 th yellr he died at the age of 92. I remember him saying then, 'This country will become a republic; this country, to become a nation, will become a republic.' I remember that very vividly. My grandfather also told me how at 13 years of age he was press-ganged. He was sitting on a wharf in Bergen, watching the sailing ships. He was whacked over the head, press-ganged and never touched land until three years later. Finally, at 16 he threw a barrel over the side of a ship-he could not swim-and made his way to England. He told me about how he lived out of the gutters. He said the only good thing about those good old days was that he was 50 years younger. He also told me-perhaps I was the only person to give him an audience in those days because he was going blind-of his joy in a homeland he could not remember, of a language once his which he could no longer remember how to speak, of people he had never been able to communicate with because of losing all contact with them, and of then coming to and establishing his life in Australia. I see him today still when I hear this debate on the republic. Our Prime Minister. (Mr Keating) took that massive, courageous step forward on the very sake proud night of 8 June. I believe that on that night he gave in this House one of the most brilliant speeches ever delivered. From that speech we, the people of Australia and the elected representatives, were given the right to think, to question and to bring together ideas-to bring them together in a minimalist fashion; not, as some of my opposition colleagues have tried to say, in the sense almost of having a bat held over the head and being told, 'You're going to have it, or else.' It is not like that at all. If one listened to, understood and took on board the Prime Minister's speech, as it was reported all over Australia, it espoused a minimalist way of handling this issue. It was a provocative speech but, at the same time, it was also saying that, if we are going to come of age and grow up, we must now take this step. Members of the opposition have come into this House and said that we have a great country; no one denies that. I think Australia is the greatest country in the world-a sentiment with which all Australians would agree. But to come into this House and say, 'We're going to be pushed into this' - how can we possibly be pushed into a debate that began in this country before 1890 and has been going on ever since? We have talked about debate that has occurred; about how our forefathers brought our constitution together, which now governs our parliaments and our country; and about what occurred during that period of time. But even then, over 105 years ago, they talked about whether we should be a republic. But, of course, that did not occur. What we are doing now is continuing what our forefathers set out to do 105 years ago. So, as a nation that has come of age, we can stand up proudly and say that we are united by the fact that we are a country about to become a republic. That is why I cherish the right, as many have been afforded, to speak here tonight. I believe the Prime Minister's announcement on 8 June was timely. I also believe it is fair to say that the Australian Labor Party has been the mover and the shaker on the republican issue. The government has taken such a stance because it is a government that leads, as it has a mandate to do so. The Prime Minister acknowledged this in his parliamentary republican speech. His very pertinent comment that impressed me at the time is: Governments can wait for opinions to force their hand, or they can lead. They can wait for the world to change and respond as necessity demands, or they can see the way the world is going and they can point the way. In this respect, the coalition members running with the constitutional monarchy are now completely out of touch. The young Liberals have quite vocally stated that they do not agree with them. Liberal Party elders may need to re-assess their particular positions or face the prospect of further irrelevancy as Australia continues to change. True to the Australian Labor Party's 1993 election commitment, and in the wake of the Republic Advisory Committee's report, the Prime Minister has welded together a very logical proposal just as Australia stands poised to take up republicanism. Not surprisingly, ideas in many areas have changed dramatically since Queen Elizabeth II visited our shores for the very first time in 1954. Forty years ago polls showed that 77 per cent supported a monarchy. Recent polls show that that support is now down to 48 per cent. Realistically-and that is why I quoted those figures from 1954-that figure of 77 per cent illustrates that even then not every Australian supported the monarchy. They were not hostile to the monarchy, but they were not committed monarchists. Mr Lindsay-Almost a quarter of the population.",129
145,Mrs CROSIO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"That is right. As my learned colleague says, in 1954 when the poll was taken almost a quarter of the population did not support the monarchy. I believe that people of my age-and I am not going to say what that is-have fond memories of visits by royalty. In the 1950s, we joined with school friends to attend various show grounds across the country to see the Queen, even if we came from republican leaning families. I might add that, in our education system, we did not have much choice. We did what we were told to do. If we were told to jump, that is what we had to do. Contemporary moves towards republicanism have nothing to do with opposition to Britain; rather they are a manifestation of Australia and Australians having grown and become more economically independent and more culturally diverse. Naturally we ask ourselves, 'How relevant are the royals today in 19951' Advances and changes in our trading patterns, sporting achievements, immigration policies and the looming 2000 Olympics all serve to cement us as a nation. I also believe they have magnified the argument for having a republic. Let us examine and weigh up some of the absurdities of retaining a monarchy and the practicalities of moving to a republic. For a start, it strikes me as odd that being born in Australia debars one from eligibility for the job of head of state. Contrast that with the American system where one not only has to be an American citizen but also has to be born in the United States to be president. Like America, Australia's population is comprised of many people from many nations. More than 220 nationalities are now represented in this great land of ours. Some 42 per cent of our total population are either born overseas or have one parent who was born overseas. I believe these people, as well as those born here, have formed the backbone of our nation and have made a. profound contribution to our national life and national development. Does it not seem rather silly to expect our. overseas born Australians to respect the head of state from another country? The member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) brought up a quesis tionnaire that he conducted through a newswho paper. I do the same thing in my electorate daily. Fairfield City Council, which is in electorate, represents a population of some 190,000 people of 135 nationalities. It boasts an elected council where 50 per cent of its councillors come froin ethnic backgrounds. This reflects clearly the notion that people want their elected officials to be representaidentification tive. Let us transpose that to Australia ally. Fairfield Mayor, Tony Campolongo, who incidentally is of Italian heritage, stated: . . . most people in the area from overseas first allegiance is to Australia-not to the British Monarch. Throughout the different cultures in area, the strong theme is that we should be towards a republic. They are his words, not mine. My community reflects that. I will also look at the area trade. Trade will be beneficially influenced the transition to the republic must be sending out some very confusing messages to the other nations. We have to be aggressively Australian and we have to wholeheartedly go out and trade in our own right. On that score, the monarch's interests and ours differ significantly from when we still exported our wool to England. I ask my colleagues to consider this: ever the Queen visits another country she does so, as other speakers have stated, as Queen of England. When do we see newspapers report that the Queen of Australia is visiting the United States? Take the example of the heir apparent to the Australian head of state, Prince Charles. He was in St Petersburg last year leading a delegation of representatives of major British business houses. The heir apparent was there campaigning against Australia's interests. He was there to promote British, not Australian, products. Why should he not? Such a use of his time must seem very sensible to the average British taxpayer, but it certainly does not seem sensible to the Australian taxpayer. How can he really purport to be our true representative when he continually has this 'conflict of interest? Imagine for a second a major world trade fair where a British stall and an Australian stall are erected side by side and the Queen there. What would be the perception about she represents? Ironically though, our head of state would actually be representing my another country and another country's goods. We all know that that would happen and we all must acknowledge that. Realistically, it is to our advantage economically, culturally and tourism and trade wise to look to our own needs rather than maintaining a symbolic with Great Britain, which is nationwhat happens at the moment. Perhaps the next time that we have conflict between Australia and other nations in whatsay their ever forum-APEC, the European Union or the Cairns Group-Australian representations the might be opposed by the British government, moving as a member of the European Union. Let us take that example one step further. When the UK parliament opens the Queen leads the of speech on behalf of the British government. by Our head of state could make a speech attackas presently we ing our policy. The other side of the world is no longer 'where it is all at'. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) knows, as a modem, innovative, socially and economically advanced multicultural society it is this part of the globe where it is all happening. Therefore, a country capable of autonowhenmously pursuing its national interests is necessary. (Extension of time granted) Going the it alone depends on our confidence, reputation, cohesion, a true sense of national identity and a sense of responsibility. All of this can only be achieved with the right representative-an Australian person representing Australian interests. We can no longer be seen to be clinging to something of a colonial outpost. I have listened to some of the speeches from members of the opposition and heard them arguing the toss about the symbolism derived from the British monarchy. Eminent people, such as former High Court Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, argue that a monarch is a symbol of national unity. Certainly many people agree with that sentiment, including those who have come from countries which have a monarch as their head of state. It can also be argued that the so-called unifying role of monarchical rituals such as royal tours or awards by members of the royal family may be detrimental to our society. Indeed, such rituals may hinder development of a relevant ideology or a unifying culture. To achieve such unification and sense of common purpose we must support the tenets of the Prime Minister's proposals. We must become a republic no later than the year 2001. The Prime Minister's proposals are logical and clear cut: a referendum should be held no later than 1999; the president of the Commonwealth of Australia is to hold the post for five years with no second term and he or she must be an Australian citizen; the president will be nominated by the Prime Minister with prior bipartisan agreement and chosen by two-thirds majority of the parliament in a joint sitting; politicians will have to have been out of office for five years before they can be nominated for the office; and the president will have the same powers as the present Governor General. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) says that he would stage a people's convention in 1997 to examine the Australian constitution. But his proposals are vague and nonspecific and certainly lack substance. Even the Leader of the Opposition's deputy has refused to commit himself to all aspects of this position. Such ideas raise questions like: what sorts of people would he appoint; and would he stack it with monarchists? As cynical as that sounds surely he is simply trading on anti-politician sentiment, for who could be more representative of the people than elected parliamentarians? If we took his option one step further, we would need an American style election campaign. Electing a president thus is simply not appropriate for the Australian system. In electing our Prime Minister, we do not have an American system of direct elections; it is a more intricate process than that. Further, a people's convention is really just the people electing a body of representatives which is essentially what they already do now via our political system. Conversely, the Prime Minister's approach to a referendum spells out the government's proposition to the people that is clear cut and easily understood. The Howard versus Keating arguments were presented to a group on the ABC's Lateline program in March this year. Interestingly, of seven in the focus group who strongly favoured a people's vote at the start of that particular debate, four had clearly softened their position after watching the debate of the experts from both sides. This illustrates the strong case that the Prime Minister's proposal can sustain. In the limited time available to me I would also like to very briefly touch on an article that appeared in the Canberra Times yesterday, which I believe everyone should read. The article is entitled 'Howard keeping his powder dry'. It states: . . . the Liberal Party will offer more choice . . . what reassurance can he offerthat is, the Leader of the Oppositionthat his so-called people's convention on constitutional change, half appointed, half elected, will not be loaded to produce a certain result? It is an interesting article. It goes on to when the Leader of the Opposition was again questioned on what he was going to come up with in his proposals for it. The Leader of the Opposition says we should not worry and that he is not going to be drawn into that in a moment. The article states: Obviously, we would have to decide whether to campaign for a particular outcome. It would be open to us to do that, but it would also be open to us to say, 'look, there are many bodies in the communityIt is concerning that a leader of a party, the Leader of the Opposition, who purports to have definite views and definite ideas would actually come up with this type of proposition. In summing up-I would have liked to have another extension, but I realise the chief whip is saying no to me-I would like to calion the words of a renowned expert on republicanism. Of course, I am referring to Professor George Winterton, a member of the Republic Advisory Committee. He stated: . . . belief in social equality inevitably leads republicanismI think that encapsulates the argument that we are about. In the Australian on Thursday, 8 June-a newspaper that I have kept because I am just so proud of it-it very clearly states: A modest republic for the year 2000. Again, I quote from our Prime Minister's speech, when he said: But the creation of an Australian republic is not act of rejection. It is one of recognitionWe have to recognise that Australia has come of age, that Australians now want their own head of state and that we need to be a republic by the year 2001. (Time expired)",130
146,Mr THOMSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Wentworth) (7.45 p.m.)I would like to begin my remarks at this late hour by congratulating the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) on a speech delivered with sincerity and lucidity. I do not think we have a lot in common on this issue but I do appreciate the lack of partisan stridency in her remarks tonight. I notice that the time is now a quarter to eight in the evening here in Canberra. By my calculation, that makes the time in London a quarter to nine in the morning. You might imagine in London the weather is warm, the trees are green, the birds are singing, the grass in Hyde Park is growing rapidly in the heat and the Londoners are making their way to work. Among them are the foreign exchange dealers of the city, who are perhaps taking their places at their desks and are now reading the morning news and seeing that their cousins in Australia have suffered a current account deficit greater than any before. Perhaps the staff on the Strand at Australia House are discussing the same issue and wondering what their salary might be worth next week when the foreign exchange markets have dealt with us as harshly as I expect they will tonight. But here in the House of Representatives in Australia we are debating constitutional change. We spent a long time today debating constitutional change, which is a distant but important issue, when I think we could better spend our time debating a nearer and more urgent issue-that is, the nation's finances, to epitomised today by that horrible figure. But the weight of numbers of the government in this House determines that we discuss the proposed republic, and it reflects a set of priorities with which this side of the House does not agree. We would rather see this issue dealt with in less of a hurry. We think dealing with the nation's finances is a more urgent task, but it is not ours to say today. Although we are an sitting here watching another milestone on the path to national bankruptcy pass, there is a terrible juxtaposition in that we are required to discuss a change to our head of state or what passport that person should hold. The speeches on this issue, I must say, have been gracious and sincere. While I have been sitting in the chamber this evening, I have heard the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) make a gracious speech reflecting a gracious nature within. She made an objection to an interjection of mine concerning the use by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of the personal pronoun. If it were not for some of his remarks in question time last year, which were of a plainly anti-British nature, we would not be making that accusation today. There are those of us on this side of the House who are willing to accept that, in putting his proposal for a republic before the House on 8 June, some of that anti-British feeling which had infected his remarks in question time last year may have disappeared and that he is taking a slightly more objective approach to the task. Likewise, the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) made it very clear that, whilst he was born and raised outside Australia, he bears no ill will towards the British people or the British monarchy in particular. Nonetheless, it is very difficult for the Australian electorates to forget that awful tone of the Prime Minister's remarks on those occasions last year when this issue boiled up in question time before we had a chance to debate it at a slower pace. The member for Canberra (Mr Smyth), a very diligent colleague, has gone out and surveyed his electors at some length and expense. They have largely reported back to him that they would prefer to see no change until Australia is financially and economically viable. That is a view I share most sincerely. In going back to the issue of a proposed change to the constitution, I would like to quote from a book Lord Hailsham wrote called The British Constitution; In the first chapter he wrote: A country without the means of change is without the hope of survival. When I read that sentence it made a great deal of sense to me. I thought that the same notion might apply to a company, a government, a club or any unit of human association. People who are not willing to change will eventually be overcome by change and will vanish. This has been the case throughout history, especially in the fate of nations. But to me the more important thing is the pace of change. When a proposed change is before an electorate, we must ask whether it is equal to that pace and whether it really wants it to happen as quickly as it is being proposed. It seems to me that a certain deadline of the year 2000 and the Olympics-that crass occasion that has been infected with commercialism-is now put before us as some sort of a deadline by which we must change our constitution. I utterly reject that the Olympic Games has any meaning at all Mr THOMSONYou say it will be 100 years since Federation. Perhaps that is a reasonable date. But should the pace of change affect the nature of change? When we look in the abstract at whether or not people want a republic, it seems that there may well be a majority of people who agree that such a change is inevitable. The debate has returned to what sort of change it should bewhether or not they should elect a president or whether they should allow us and our brethren and sisters in the Senate to make the decision for them. Until it is clear exactly what nature of change the Australian electorate requires, I see no need to hurry. One of the reasons put forward for this change-from a constitutional monarchy to a republic-is that somehow it would deliver more independence to Australia. That requires us to consider the notion of independence. What exactly do we need more than we have now and what would a change to the passport of our head of state deliver for us? Independence to me means sovereignty, and sovereignty means the control of your destiny. There are various forms of sovereignty. You can have civic sovereignty or civic destiny and the powers of a group of people in a particular location decide how their streets will appear and how much they should pay for their rubbish to be taken away. Likewise, you can have legal sovereignty. You can ask what sorts of powers should the police have to arrest you and what sorts of rights should you have in courts if you are to be arrested. Or you might' enjoy personal sovereignty, or a greater or lesser degree of it. You should have the right to say who you will marry, what language you will speak and what sorts of adjectives you might be permitted by the law to use when describing other people and, in particular, criticising their actions. Today we have had our financial sovereignty put before us in a brutal fashion. It seems that once again, at the rate of $4 million an hour-that was the calculation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costdlo)-we are further in debt and that this is the highest figure that we have yet suffered. I would like to introduce into the debate a quote from former Senator Peter Walsh. In 1990 he said: But the current account deficit in this recession year is stuck at the unsustainably high figure of four per cent. Moreover, at this stage it is difficult to identify what will stop the current account again blowing out when growth rates are high enough to bring unemployment down. Never were truer words spoken from a man who represented the Australian Labor Party faithfully during his time in the Senate. There goes our financial sovereignty. When those advocates of a republic say that",133
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for Wentworth will resume his seat. The chair would be most grateful if the honourable member for Watson would continue to observe standing order 57. Mr THOMSONIt is a terrible thing that a member of the House of Representatives Procedure Committee should infringe that standing order twice in two hours. As a junior member of that committee, I will take the example and try not to infringe it myself. One of the other notions that have often been bandied around in this debate",135

151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"There is no point of order. The honourable member for Wentworth. Mr THOMSONMany people have criticised the honourable member for Watson, but never for a lack of diligence. Never let that be said. Another notion in this debate the honourable member for Prospect raised, in an oblique allusion, was that somehow or other Australia's changing to becoming a republic would win us more market .share in Asia. The chamber is no place for laughter, but I· find it difficult to restrain, because the proposition that, somehow or other, by changing our constitution, we would win a greater market share in Asia is ridiculous. It is fatuous and ridiculous, and it would be an immature country that would take such a proposition seriously. People in Asia do not regard us as in any way diminished because· of our history, because we still, in the 1990s, enjoy a constitutional monarchy. To change that to a republic would do absolutely nothing to improve the quality of the goods and the services that we seek to sell in those markets; nor, I think, would it do anything to lower the production costs of those goods. Do honourable members seriously imagine that our Asian neighbours, when greeting an Australian businessman or businesswoman with a commercial proposition, say, 'Oh, for heaven's sake, we could not have any of those Australian products; Australia has a constitutional monarchy.' That proposition alone illustrates the poverty of this debate. Asia itself is full of quaint things-of practices that many of us in Australia find bizarre, strange and quite alien to our own culture. It does not stop us from buying their products, and the reverse is exactly the same. That has been my personal experience. It is the quality of your goods or your services and the sincerity of your pitch that determine whether or not people will buy. If you look around Asia at the sorts of constitutional systems that our neighbours there enjoy, you find examples of monarchy, or the equivalent term, where there is an emperor, such as in Japan. In Thailand they have a king who is revered by the people. In Malaysia every state has a sultan and every three years, I think, one of them takes the tum to be the chief sultan, the Agong. Likewise, they have a strong constitutional government, a vigorous one, as we have leamed-certainly their rhetoric is vigorous. I have not heard that Malaysian people complaining about their system of government, and yet their real incomes are rising at a greater rate than ours are. It is likewise in Brunei. The Sultan of Brunei is reputed to be the world's richest man. I understand that the citizens of Brunei are well pleased with the largesse that he bestows on them. They do not enjoy the vigour of a democracy that we do in Australia; nonetheless, it has no effect on their daily lives. If you really want to bring smiles to the faces of your electors, then certainly, at the appropriate time and at the appropriate pace, a constitutional change should never be ruled out of the question. That goes back to Lord Hailsham's notion that a country without the means of change is without the hope of survival. My own view of this debate is governed by the notion best expressed in the maxim festina lente, hasten slowly. Everything in my life that I have done in a hurry, I have done badly. If you hurry, if you rush to reform, you make a mistake nine times out of to. The danger of haste is especially apparent in government. The danger of haste is apparent in many of the things that this government has done, perhaps at the time with sincerity, but certainly with a great deal of haste. Going back to the early 1980s, the notion of financial deregulation was all the rage, certainly from an outsider's point of view. (Extension of time granted) I thank the House. The  no doubt eager to make the same sorts of remarks with the same sort of vigour as I am making them. He is not to be blamed for jumping to his feet so quickly. I will finish quickly. Do Australians really want us in this parliament to rush to make this reform? Do they want a change that is revolutionary or do they want one that is evolutionary? My gut feeling from discussions with electors in my office-and admittedly that has only been a short time, a matter of some 11 weeks-is that they would prefer us to solve the financial problems before we rush to reform the constitution. It is plain to see that the changing nature the royal family, the house of Windsor, is a factor in this process, in this evolution. There is no denying the proposition that republicans put that, when the heir to the British throne is seen in the markets of Saudi Arabia or other parts of the world, frankly and vigorously espousing the benefits of British products, it does raise doubts in some Australians as to whether or not the royal family is committed absolutely to its role in the Australian constitution. Time will tell whether that it is absolutely the case, but in the meantime I would like to see us dwell on the time rather than the hurry. Finally, I want to mention a personal thing. I have a difficulty with the division ofopinion between young Australians and elderly Australians on this issue. It seems very plain that elderly Australians are the ones who hold the constitutional monarchy most dear to them, and as someone who is only 34 years old I have some difficulty with rushing to change something that is so dear to a group of people who have made a greater sacrifice by the fact of their age than I have or than has anyone younger than I. That is not to say that the wishes of young Australians should not be taken into account in this process-not at all-but I have a deep feeling that there is some indecency in ripping away from elderly Australians something that they hold dear. That said, the time will come perhaps when a change will be made. But I would like to see us grip onto that notion of Lord Hailsham's as tightly as we possibly can. A nation without the means of change is without the hope of survival, but let that change not be one of a revolutionary nature - but evolve according to the wishes of those whom it will most affect.  like to compliment the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson) in the way he advances his arguments, although I do not necessarily agree with them. I must say that he has said a few things that do, I think, merit a response. I think the proposition that we are somehow rushing the decision that we should be a republic and that it does not form an evoluof tionary or incremental proposal is one I find difficult to understand. It seems to me that over 200 years ago or a little bit more, wethat is, white people--came to Australia and we had a very crude form of government with not much democracy. Our democracy and our form of government have been evolving ever since. Even with the approach of 100 years of federation in 2001, one can hardly say one is being radical and revolutionary to propose that in the 98th or 99th year of our federation we should be considering becoming a republic and that we should put that proposition to the people. I totally reject that argument. During federation, when we had dominion status, the United Kingdom was responsible for the conduct of foreign affairs matters. We have gradually sained more and more autonomy, and we now wish to become benefits a republic. But even if you want to ignore that has gone before, 1998-99 is some years away yet, so it is not as though we are having a debate in this parliament to decide, in the latter part of this year, that we shall have referendum. That is absurd. If you take the position that you do not welcome the prospect that we will one day, eventually, become a republic, you are really saying that it does not matter whether it is the of year 2000 or the year 2050-or maybe we will wait until the year 3000 before we become a republic. I cannot agree with that proposition. I have to be very frank with electorate and with members of this House. Whilst I have always favoured a republic, did not believe that I would see the prospect of it in my lifetime-as we on this side of the House, and as I think a majority of Australservices ians, are now contemplating. I am a little apologetic, but I was concerned that the issue of a republic may deflect some voters, that it may be a costly political exer- in cise for the government and for us on this side of the House. I am happy to concede-as I think most people who are looking at this debate dispassionately will, and as I am sure history will record-that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deserves a tremendous amount of credit for advancing the whole proposition of the republic. That we should actually be this point in 1995, having a firm proposal before the House to be considered by honourwho able members and senators, to be thought through out there by the public and with an assurance by a Labor Party government that we will firmly put a proposition for a referenor dum to the people, has been an amazing development. It is a huge change around. I cannot understand the logic of the argument that says that somehow a Prime Minister who has the whole repUblican debate on the agenda, who has· set up a special committee to look at the options about a republic and who has now put a firm set of proposals before the House and said that in 1998-99 we will definitely see a referendum on a republic, is somehow rushing things. I think that is to and other be totally rejected. It is very interesting too that one of the of this republic debate is that there is all far more consideration being given to the forms and structures of government-that is, the different levels of government: federal, national, state and local government-and that a there is far more questioning in the community about whether the current structure serves us well. I know that some people argue, for example, that the proposals of the Prime Minister do not go far enough. I am not one those, because, if referendums have taught us anything, it is that we need to keep things simple. But I am trying to signal that one of the my benefits that we have had in this republic debate is that this country will be able to look I at the structures of government much earlier to see whether they best serve the needs of all people of this country and are able to deliver effectively. I do not think we can say that now, Mr Speaker. The honourable member for Wentworth said that having a republic would have no impact Asia. We are not saying that having a republic will mean that we will more effectively sell car parts in Asia. But when the Governor General, the No.2, the vice-regal representative, travels overseas, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has an awful job trying to convince people to give him head of government status because he is at not head of government. It is the Queen of put Australia, who does not reside in Australia, resides in England but never represents Australia in any overseas mission. To say that there is a form of monarchy in Malaysia and that has not inhibited Malaysia, a sultan in Brunei, or a king of Thailand, is an absurd proposition. Who has ever advanced the argument that the King of Thailand lives in the United States permanently? No-one! Everyone knows the King of Thailand resides in Thailand. Everyone knows that the Sultan of Brunei resides in Brunei, and the same applies for Malaysia. If you want to use the trade argument, we cannot utilise the Queen to lead a trade mission to Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand, or any other country--or even England. There is some sense these days in having heads of state perform their constitutional responsibilities but also getting to the trade scene and leading delegations of businessmen on such visits. That is what we are missing out on. The other proposition of the honourable member for Wentworth was that somehow the Prime Minister has made some radical change from being virulently anti-British to being less so. I do not know of any Australian who stands up and criticises the role of Queen of England. I must say I have had the pleasure of meeting her and her husband at the opening of the Mount Druitt Hospital-a big event where I live. I bear her no ill will. But, in severing the connection with the Queen of England as the Queen of Australia, we are not reflecting on the Queen, the current monarch; we are not reflecting on anyone. We are not actually severing the link, nor is it proposed to sever the link with England. There is no proposition before the House that somehow we should withdraw from the Commonwealth of Nations. Of course, some members of the Commonwealth of Nations do have a monarchy as a form of government, but most are republics and are fully participating members of the Commonwealth of Nations. So, again, I reject the proposition that somehow this is an anti-British stance. It is not certain that the monarchy will last forever in England. It is interesting to note that republican sentiments are rising there. The other thing I found funny was the survey done by the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Smyth). The voters of his electorate have suggested that we cannot become a republic until we are economically sustainable. That implies that Australia is receiving a bucket load of money from the United Kingdom because the United Kingdom is the residence of our head of state, the Queen of Australia, and ipso facto we are somehow receiving aid money. I presume that is being likened to the aid that Australia gives to Papua New Guinea. I find the proposition that somehow having a Queen of Australia has something to do with having a sustainable economy absolutely absurd, absolute bunkum and should be rejected. I also notice that the honourable member for Wentworth could not help talking about the current account deficit. I invite the honourable member for Wentworth to read today's Sydney Morning Herald where the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the whole opposition were described as policy cowards. As a representative of a poor electorate, I want to say this: I am very proud of the fact that this government had the guts to the current tackle long-term unemployment. I have explained to the honourable member for Wentworth that, when the economic chill breezes waft through the leafier parts of his electorate, we get a bit of hail out in Chifley in the western suburbs of Sydney. When things are tough, we have a disproportionately higher number of people unemployed. Honourable members may very well say that we are the economic flotsam and jetsam and this is the price we have to pay when the economy is going very hard. I totally reject the proposition by the opposition that because of one month's current account deficit we should increase unemployment in my electorate by slashing, programs and implementing its traditional policies that have previously not helped us in the outer western suburbs of Sydney at all. I think it is really pathetic that members of the opposition want to raise the issue of the economy, which they are entitled to raise and should raise, but cannot offer one glimmer or one scintilla of a solution, one peephole of an idea about how they might go about solving the problem. I think the priorities of this government have been correct-that is, that no society can afford, in the longer term, to sustain double digit unemployment. I have no problem with that at all. I absolutely applaud the government's stand on unemployment. I applaud the fact that we areincreasing the long-term sustainable jobs in private enterprise, not mickey mouse jobs that will rush away. I am horrified to think about what draconian measures the opposition may dream up. Mr Latham-Shame.  my electorate and the people in the electorate of my friend the honourable member for Werriwa who bear the burden. The other proposition is that we should have a people's convention. (Extension of time granted) I think the most amusing thing about the people's convention is that the Leader of the Opposition wants to stack it. He wants to be able to nominate 50 per cent of the participants so he can ensure the outcome of the people's convention. As long as we have had the office of Governor General it has served us well, with one fairly recent exception. Under the proposals by the Prime Minister the traditions and conventions that have surrounded that office will continue with a new office. We do not want party political people becoming governors-general and we do not want to see the status of the office compromised. If people want to see politicians and politinot cal parties involved in the selection of a new president for the republic of Australia, the best way to guarantee that is to have a popular election. People such as Sir Ninian Stephen and Sir Zelman Cowen, who did much to restore the office to some credibility after it was so badly tarnished by the previous incumbent, said that they would not consider accepting such a role as president of Australia if they had to run the gamut of a public election. If they did have to go for a public election, they would be captured by one political party or another and there would be a ballot. That very independence, that very notion of standing above politics, being above the hurly-burly and being able to adopt a bipartisan or above political approach will be utterly destroyed. So it was very commendable of the Prime Minister to suggest that politicians should be involved in the selection of the new president. After all, at the moment there is only one politician involved and that is the Prime Minister in making a nomination to the Queen. But more than that, there is the provision that two-thirds of all members must agree with the nomination. This ensures that there must be bipartisan support. No opposition can be counted out from the debate or its views ignored. Certainly it is true to say that in the term of this Labor government, under Prime Minister Keating and formerly under Prime Minister Hawke, we have never controlled the Senate and we have never been within cooee of having that two-thirds majority. I think it would be unlikely that we would. So I believe that we will be guaranteeing that we will be selecting the very best candidates for the presidency. When I am at citizenship ceremonies with 200 or 300 people at a time, I know that many of them are very confused-and I see that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) has changed some of the requirements for citizenship-about having to swear allegiance to Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, as they are absentee monarchs of Australia. They find it inconceivable in this day and age that we are a republic. Few countries have monarchies. For that group of people, a republic will be a welcomed opportunity for them to exercise their rights. I think younger Australians are certainly very enthusiastic about a republic. To older Australians, I want to say this: the notion of a republic does not in any way imply that Queen Elizabeth has somehow improperly performed her duties or is anything other than highly regarded by all Australians. We are not divorcing ourselves from England; we are going to replace one connection and maintain another. We are going to replace the force connection, the theoretical connection, of having a Queen of Australia with the reality of our continued membership of the Commonwealth of Nations. The Queen presides over that body. This is neither an anti-British measure nor a pro-British measure, in my mind. I enthusiastically support the proposals the Prime Minister, as he has outlined them. I invite the whole of Australia, particularly the people in my electorate, to take the time and trouble to learn more about the proposals. In a democracy, ultimately the people's will prevails. But we must be sure that, whatever the mode of selection for the president of republic, the choice of method leads to desired objective rather than the reverse. still very much committed to the idea of bipartisan choice, by senators and members, of the president of Australia. There are outthey standing reasons why that is the best solution, but I welcome the opportunity to speak with constituents and to debate these issues in electorate.",135
152,Mr GORMAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Greenway) (8.26 p.m.)My reason for joining the republic debate tonight is that I was very impressed by all the speeches. I have sat here for about three hours this evening listening to them. I was especially impressed by. the efforts and the remarks put forward by the members for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) and Wakefield (Mr Andrew). Now I have an opportunity to not only express this but also send these reports out to the different groups that I have organyet ised to debate the republic. I think the speeches that have been made today will be a good subject for debate. My reasons for wanting a republic for Australia are as follows. The Governor General, president or whatever he or she is to be called must be an Australian and must reprerelation sent Australia when going overseas. The state, person must be dedicated to Australia and must speak only for Australia and not for other country. For that reason, I believe she must be a fully elected Australian. believe the election should be as suggested the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and I no doubt that will be the eventual decision. will be a decision that will eventually be dictated by the public of Australia. Whoever is finally selected, the person will represent Australia wherever he or she goes in all the world's forums. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) will prove to be out of line with his proposal of a group of citizens partly appointed and partly elected. One would have of to be very wary about how they would be selected and how they would be appointed to carry out the public inquiry as to how he intends to set up the proposal for a republic or the expression of a republic. For as long as I can remember I have considered that we should be free of all the the strings that have tied us to mother England. the I have expressed this opinion to my wife, I am Jenny, and our three daughters, Elizabeth, Sharon and Kathryn. It must be said that they have their own thoughts on this matter, but all have a voting right and will have to vote either for or against the formation of a republic. I feel that they will represent me my when the vote comes. I do not lean on them at all, but I am positive that they will vote the right way. My son-in-law, David Filmer, is a very of level-headed young man. He also wants to become a part of the Labor movement. He is one of the branch members now in my .electorate. I do not think he will follow me into the parliament as the years go on, but he certainly mixes with a group of young people not only at golf but also at his work, and he expresses the opinion very freely. I have not quite convinced him that this is the way to go, but I am sure that as time goes on he will see the value of my opinion. I would not use any force to get him to that stage, but he will. I do not know whether I will see the changes as proposed by the Prime Minister into the election of the new head of but one thing I am very sure of is that both my granddaughter, Emily Louise Filmer, any and my grandson, who was born only yesterhe or day to Elizabeth and David Filmer, will I perhaps see the change before they go to by school. My grandson is to be named Daniel have David. My granddaughter has given me a It nickname. Emily calls me 'Poppy', of which I am very proud. Daniel David may also call me 'Poppy'. That remains to be seen. I must thank David and Elizabeth for my granddaughter and grandson, and I thank the House for the time to express this note.",140
153,Mr LATHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-Towards the end of this historic debate on the Australian republic, I wish to bring a tone of bipartisanship to our consideration of the issue. As you would appreciate, Mr Speaker, I have always fancied myself as one of the genuine moderates and conciliators in this place. I can say that in the typical absenceof the member for Wills (Mr Cleary). As we draw to a close our consideration of the historic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I would like to advance a proposition on how the monarchy is best judged in Australia and beyond in the 1990s. I think it is a proposition which even the opposition would find attractive. That is, we should rely on the judgment of the British Scout Association. From the eyes of the opposition it would regard this as fair, reasonable and entirely appropriate. This is a British organisation associated with all the best values of duty, diligence and dedication. It could not ever be regarded as representing a fifth column or representing radical views in its society, nor in ours. What has the British Scout Association had to say in recent times about the British monarchy? I was fascinated to note a report on 13 June in the Australian. The report reads: In Britain, the scout association has begun moves to delete references to the monarchy from its because of Prince Charles's infidelity. Explaining his concems, the UK chief scout, Mr Garth Morrison, said, 'It will be hard for some people to promise to do their duty to an adulterer.' I do not mean to be harsh toward Prince Charles in this spirit of conciliation and moderation, but these are the words of the British Scout Association, not mine. I think it is a tell-tale sign in the history of the British monarchy. It is five minutes to midnight for that institution-not just in Australia but also in its homeland of Britain. Time is up for the British monarchy. The British Scout Association has registered its dissatisfaction. How could it be in Australia that those bastions of conservative views, the Liberal and National parties, could support the monarchy at a time when the British Scout Association cannot? It is no longer possible to defend the royal family. How can they remain at the head of our constitution? If the tories in Britain have given up defending the indefensible, surely the tories in Australia should concede that time is up for the monarch as Australia's head of state. There has, however, been a change of opinion among the tories and the Liberal Party in this country. I have followed with some amount of interest the public comments of the youngest of young fogies, the most conservative of the conservatives, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). Just last year he regarded Prince Charles as a man of 'international star quality'. I am not too sure what sort of stardom he was alluding to. It could not have been the Hugh Grant variety, but that was the comment from the member for Warringah just 12 months ago. On the day after the Prime Minister's historic statement, the member for Warringah made some comments in the Australian. This should be of vast interest to the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), his close colleague and friend. The member for Warringah stated: As of last night supporters of the Australian constitution are spared the difficult task of defending the House of Windsor and can begin the much easier task of attacking the Keating Republic. I would have thought the case is self-evident. If the tories in this country can no longer oath defend the British monarchy, if they can no longer defend the house of Windsor, how can they maintain an argument that the Australian head of state should be a British monarch? How is it that they can deny the strength of the argument that Australia's head of state should be an Australian citizen; that Australia's head of state should be one of us? The argument is totally sound and beyond doubt. When the British Scout Association has given up on the monarchy, it is time for the conservatives in Australia to do the same and to concede the inevitability of the republic and acknowledge that Australia should at last have a head of state who is one of us.",140
154,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The debate on the republic this afternoon and earlier has ranged far and wide, as it should. It is a debate that occurred 100 years ago. The debate about Australia becoming a republic was quite prominent in the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s and many famous Australians-perhaps most notably, Henry Lawson-were strong advocates for creating a genuinely independent country in the South Pacific. I remember hearing the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) allude to his childhood and the mores under which he grew up. I can still remember very well the old empire daysperhaps, I am one of the older members of this House. I always used to find it quite ironic that on maps of the world the empire was always pink when the British flag was red, white and blue. They could not use red because that was the colour of communism, so they had this strange pink colour. I always thought pink was for girls-the old 'pink for girls and blue for boys' - so I thought it was ironic that the British empire saw itself as effeminate. That was always my interpretation-probably an unfair one, but in those days things were very black and white. I also find ironic the line 'Long may she reign over us' when God Save the Queen is sung by Australians. I can· recall being at many functions, particularly Coral Sea functions, when American navy and embassy representatives looked puzzled as to why Australians would be asking the Queen of England to reign over them. It is not a question that she does; it is a question of 'long may she' - in other words, it is invoking; it is requesting. In that context, I should point out that I am very pro-British, like the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). I did my major in English, particularly in literature, and was of those people who travelled overland from Calcutta to London in 1968. I spent 7lh. months travelling looking at parts of the exempire, if you like, visiting India, Nepal, Pakistan-I never quite made it to Afghanistan, but I saw a lot of graves of British soldiers in the Khyber Pass-Iran, Greece and Europe. India did not seem to have suffered by not having the Queen of England as its monarch. I was puzzled by that because I thought we were more advanced than India was. Supposedly, we were. I had been taught that we were. Yet, India had its own president and we still had the Queen as our head of state. When I worked in the UK for 1Y2 years or more, my work mates constantly made remarks about Australia. Something about Australia would appear almost every month in the local news or in the current affairs in Europe and I was constantly asked: 'Why on earth do you still have our Queen as your head of state? Why on earth do you still sing God Save the Queen?' People were genuinely puzzled. Not just the English, but the British in general always seemed to be asking: 'Why are you still colonials? Why do you still have this kind of approach?' Quite frankly, I had no answer. My answer was: 'I haven't, but I do not know about the rest of them.' I recall a very famous interview which was very formative in my own political development. It was in 1969 and was between Robin Day from Panorama and Doug Anthony, exDeputy Prime Minister and ex-member for Richmond. Mr Anthony had gone to England to persuade them to give Australia special concessions because of the common market. Robin Day said, 'It has been obvious, Mr Anthony, that for many years we have been going our own way and our future is in Europe. Obviously we can't have you with us in Europe. We have to move that way. Haven't you understood that? Why hasn't Australia made appropriate adjustments?' Mr Anthony's response was, 'We never thought you'd let us down.' The approach was a very simplistic one. We were effectively part of the empire-the empire which would never have let the sun one set on it, the mother country which would never have let us down-so we would not need to adjust as a country. That was in 1969. I copped heaps at work for days afterwards. Every day I was harassed by colleagues about our representative. I consolidated my vie NS very strongly at that stage in terms of the direction, the calibre and the depth of understanding of Australian politics of that era. People say, 'So what? Who cares what people overseas think?' It is an easy way out to say that we should make our own decisions and who cares what other people think. The fact is what other people think shapes what happens. In this particular situation, perceptions are fundamentally important. If the world perceives that we want someone else to reign over us, that we think England would never let us down, that we are part of some immortal empire and structure long beyond its meaningful existence, it will not judge us well and will respond to us accordingly. The world responds to us largely as though we are a colony of Britain because that is what we project. A country that chooses not to be sovereign chooses to be subservient. You cannot have it both ways; you cannot be half sovereign; you cannot be half an individual country. You either have your own head of state or you do not. You cannot have this idea that somehow we have a head of state in the Governor General. That is a nonsense and a fabrication-we do not. The Governor General is not the head of state as prescribed in the constitua tion. The constitution says that the Australian parliament is made up of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the Queen, the monarch of Great Britain. That is what it says. It says the Queen, not the Governor General. The Governor General acts as a representative, not as a head of state-and never will be accorded that status by anybody anywhere in the world. So when we send our Governor General overseas, he travels effectively as a second-class citizen because our proper head of state does not represent us overseas. All of us as parliamentarians-perhaps not some of the new ones yet-have experienced particular,ly in Europe with European parliamentarians the slight mocking about how our head of state is on their side, how our head of state actually lobbies for them. In terms of world trade and world development, they mock that our head of state is part of their team not our team. I can recall some of the disputes over agricultural policy and policy of that nature when things got a bit tense. Those jibes cut very deep. How can we seriously argue with the Europeans that they should change their policies and respond in international terms when they can say, 'But of course your head of state agrees with us. She actually campaigns for Europe, not for you'? So she should. She is the monarch of Great Britain. The role of head of state in Australia has a number of functions. In this recent debate, people are starting to think through what that really means. We see it as being ceremonial, and that is an important role. It is important that the nation does have ceremonies. It is important that the nation does have symbols and traditions. But it is also important that it builds on those and consolidates them. I can recall the debates we had when we moved to this place from down the hill. They were in relation to the chair that you, Mr Speaker, sit in. It was lobbied that we should bring the old Speaker's chair from the other building on the grounds that it was a gift from the House of Commons. The fact that it was gift was very important to us as a nation and as a parliament. We should treasure and respect that. But the fact is the symbols it carries are symbols of Europe. The carvings are not Australian. Having gone to the effort and had the maturity to establish an Australian parliament with its own colours and ambience, it was suggested that we should not import into that the visions, the pictorials or the symbols, if you like, of another country. It is more than another country; it is another continent. That fact was not understood by some people because they have trouble building on traditions. What we have done in this parliament is build on the traditions that we inherited from Great Britain. We inherited the Westminster system and we have built on it and Australianised it. Therefore, in that context the head of state has a very important role. The potential to be able to arbitrate within the parliamentary system is of course important. The role of the head of state will be largely ceremonial. That is a fundamentally important role. The head of state will also have a promotional role. When that person travels he or she will do so as a true head of state, not as a representative of a head of state. Parliamentarians in Asia have often said that we do not promote our country well enough and that we rely on our business people to be the sole promoters. They argue that it is more effective to project a nation as a nation not simply as a commercial entity. The promotional role will be important. One important role which we do not do so well at the moment is that of a fountain of wisdom. In my opinion, the head of state should reflect back to the community. I can recall the role Sir Ninian Stephen played in handing over Uluru, or Ayers Rock as it was called, to the Aboriginal people. That ceremony was wonderfully moving. His performance and the role he played at that ceremony were fundamentally important to the development of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. I think he showed that the role of a potential head of state could be one of profound wisdom. He also showed that that person could feed back into our community and our society some sense of leadership in relation to matters other than government and politics. That is why the way the head of state is chosen and the methodology used to choose that person are very important. I find it quite ludicrous that people argue the current system should be maintained when, under the current system, the Governor General is simply appointed by the Prime Minister not by the parliament. On the one hand we are being told that the head of state is Australian and that we should not worry about that person only being representative. Then on the other hand we endorse the fact that the head of state is appointed by the Prime Minister. So the idea that those are compatible seems very contradictory . The potential of having a genuine head of state who is Australian gives us the opportunity to shift our understanding of how our government and social systems can work. But the idea of having an election to decide the head of state is worrying. I note from the speeches of those opposite that many people share the same concerns. The idea that to have an election to choose a male or female who would then become the president of Australia would not disrupt our political system is quite false. When we talk about elections we have to consider the organisational structures that need to be in place for elections, the financing of an election campaign and, more importantly, why people vote the way they do. We have to look at what they are voting on and what characteristics they are looking for. I think that is where the danger is in electing a head of state. The fact is that anybody seeking election would need to put forward their view for Australia. They are visionary-the V word being all the go these days. In doing that, it would be impossible to differentiate between the political and the non-political. Any vision of Australia being put forward in that context would need to incorporate some political content, not necessarily party political, but it will soon become that way. (Extension of time granted) By having an elected head of state and by having an election in itself, we would need to establish parameters as to what the election was for and why people are voting for or against various people. We will have a cast of thousands; dozens of people will be nominating. They will all have their own vision and they will all be competing and vying for public appeal and popUlarity. At the end of all that, it would be an absolute shemozzle. That is a fundamentally important reason why we cannot do it that way and why that is not an appropriate method. The second point that has often been raised relates to the American example of gridlock, where you have two mandates-the parliamentary mandate and the presidential mandate. Those who have watched the American system would not wish to replicate it here, even though they do have checks and balances and different roles. But the fact is that any elected president or head of state would have a substantial mandate of political power. The potential for that to come into conflict with the political frameworks is very high. The third point that is critical in that context is the timing of elections. Whatever timing one chose, there is a very high likelihood that the head of state cycle and the parliamentary cycle would come into conflict and thereby create periods where elections may be weeks apart-one for the parliament and one for the president. For all those structural reasons, the idea of a popular election for a head of state is not all that appealing in a practical sense. I am mindful that the community at large sees the election of a head of state as an important issue. I can understand that, certain- country. ly in the current climate, with the disillusionment with politics here and worldwide. For example, in America and most of Europe when things are hard and when economies are not running well with high unemployment, it is not surprising and it is understandable that people have some degree of disillusionment. In that context, an election for a head of state gives people a certain sense of extra power. It is an empowering process and I understand and appreciate that. When I speak to people and work through what is involved, they tend to recognise that even though it may be a nice idea, when we think about it, it probably creates Imuch more problems than it addresses. It has been fairly unfortunate that in recent months those who have opposed the establishment of a republic have used this particular angle to try to diminish and demean the arguments. They have used the device of disenchantment, and therefore the natural appeal of a popular election, as a vehicle to diminish and argue against the republic overall. Times have changed since the last century when the Commonwealth was being established and our current constitution was written. During the 1960s England went into the Common Market quite openly, validly, honestly and appropriately. Times have changed and we have severed most of our formal legal links with England, yet our relationship has never been better. Quite frankly, in the 1960s, before I went overseas, I can recall the resentment in Australia about the fact that we could buy butter cheaper in England than we could in Australia. I can recall the cost of goods in the UK and the amount of subsidisation and cross-trade activities between England, Europe and Australia. I think our relationship is much healthier now. It is a relationship of two mature countries that cooperate and have a very common basis, a common language and a lot of cultural overlaps. The fact is that we are diverging. Our path is going in a different direction from that of Britain because we are in different parts of the world and we have different forces driving us. I think part of those forces is an urge for self-determination for this We can never truly talk about being a sovereign country while we have somebody's monarch as our head of state. The arguments being put forward in the paper are compelling and it behoves all of us to talk to our communities and to explain what it actually means-,to get away from the hype, the nonsense and the exaggeration and get down to the actual fundamentals. This change would help our trade pattern. The surge of activity that would flow from an act of self-determination would be important. In a similar way, our attractiveness as a country to invest in would be enhanced if people saw that we were a bit more selfdetermining ourselves and that we wanted to be sovereign. Quite frankly, this pawing back constantly from sovereign status must undermine our standing in the world, including the investment world. One can understand an apprehension about investing in a country that does not want to stand on its own two feet and that wants to always somehow share a monarch with somebody else. That is not a sign of a mature country and is not a sign of a country with a strong future, both of which I am sure we are and have. So an act of self determination would have an effect on our trade patterns and have an effect on our domestic economy and our employment situation. I hope this debate will go on for months to come, not only in the parliament but also throughout the community, because it is a very important one. It did not start a few months ago. It started a few hundred years ago. It has been going on for a couple of hundred years already. I think it is now coming to an end. With those words, I commend the paper to the House.",141
155,Mr COBB,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-We have the opportunity to have this debate because the numerous amendments to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill that have been moved in the Senate have not yet come back for the House to debate. There is a rumour sweeping the parliament that the amendments have gone to the printers but, because of the very high current account deficit today, the printer is insisting that the cheque be cashed first and there is some difficulty with the government raising the money. No doubt it is melting down some of the gold reserves to pay it and we may have to wait for some time. I appreciate the opportunity to continue this debate. As I said yesterday, it is ironic that we are debating something like the republic when there are things far more serious going on in this country-today a current account deficit in excess of $2.9 billion, greater than Mexico's, and the government has this sort of priority. In my electorate probably the most immediate issue of concern is the drought. Hopefully we are coming out of it in some of the areas, but people are desperate to get some help from the government and it has been very tardy in coming. While the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins, on 29 May extended the drought assistance by $43.3 million, which was very welcome indeed-a decision based on RASAC's advice-it still does not seem to have gone into the correct areas. If we take the Nyngan Rural Lands Protection Board, for example, divisions B, C and D were declared eligible for exceptional circumstances assistance. But there was no declaration in division A, which is probably not only the worse division of all, as far as being affected by the drought is concerned, but, I would venture to say, is probably the most severely affected area in the whole of my electorate. There are 50 federal electorates in New South Wales, which is a geographic average of two per cent. My electorate covers 40 per cent of New South Wales because of the remoteness of that area. Division A of Nyngan has missed out, which is tragic indeed. Mr Nehl-And the government won't help them!",145
156,Mr COBB,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It will not help them at all. Not one cent has been forthcoming for these people in desperate positions who are, in some cases, surviving on food parcels. Even if we take an area to the south of there, we see that in Dubbo divisions A and D have been included, but division B has been left out. The north of that division has been devastated by the drought and it is hard to understand these decisions indeed. The Cobar Rural Lands Protection Board is not worried about whether we are debating a republic or a monarchy. It is desperate for assistance, too. Condobolin has not had one cent of assistance in this regard. The Wilcannia and Broken Hill rural lands protection boards have also missed out. I had correspondence from the Elliotts at Yelta at Wilcannia.· They are a very hard working and honest farming family. There are four or five properties in that area that have been devastated by the drought. The government may say, 'What are four or five properties?' Four or five properties, cover an area much bigger than most electorates in Australia. It would be pleasing indeed if the minister would give some consideration to these people. While the assistance on 29 May was very welcome indeed, it was very late in coming. It was insufficient, as I have said, and it has overlooked some of the worse hit areas of all. If nothing else, it indicates the inadequacy of the criteria that are being used to determine what areas are in and what areas are not in. It is in total conflict with the recommendations of the New South Wales department of agriculture-under a Labor government in New South Wales----.,.which has clearly said that these areas should be included. So I do not know how the minister can make the decisions that he has. After the last announcements were made, he shot off to America, no doubt for important business. But the people who were lucky enough to get certificates that would have allowed the assistance to flow through to them had to wait for three or four weeks. It may not seem much to the government, but three or four weeks for these people without this sort of welfare assistance to allow. them to put bread on their table for their spouses and their children is very important indeed. RASAC, as I have mentioned, advised the minister on what areas should go in. While I am reluctant to criticise RASAC, quite frankly, I think the advice it is giving is bad. I cannot see that it has made any property visits to these areas before the advice has been forthcoming. We are talking about very large areas indeed that are being considered. I do not know of the RASAC people having set foot on one property on an official drought inspection. I know they have gone to Mudgee and I know they· have gone to Dubbo. But when they went to Mudgee they flew into the airport, got into cars, went to the RSL club, held a meeting there and went back to the airport. When they came to Dubbo I am told they did the same thing. They never actually made one official drought property inspection. Lines have been drawn on maps in the comfort of distant offices without even the courtesy of listening to the farmers or listening to the experts or the local people in these areas having been extended. To my knowledge, Minister Collins is yet to make an official visit to a drought affected property in New South Wales. I may be wrong on that; he is purely basing his decisions on bureaucratic advice. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has not yet made one official drought visit in New South Wales. The new Labor Premier of New South Wales, to his credit, did. He came to Dubbo and went out to Eumungerie and the Gilgandra area. He said that he knew nothing about the land. To his credit he made that admission. Within 10 minutes he could see what had to be done. He has made the right recommendations, or substantially so. But, federally, this advice so far has been all but totally ignored. We have just come through one of the most severe droughts in the history of this country. While it has been going on, the costs of running farms have continued to rise. Throughout that we have had things like the wool collapse and so on and commodity prices have been down. If we take the A division of the Nyngan Rural Lands Protection Board, we see that there are only 120 farmers in the division. I do not know what number would qualify to go onto exceptional circumstance assistance, but it would probably be only 40, 50 or 60. So it would not trouble the purse that much at all. Molong division A went in and, to my knowledge, it did not even ask to go in. It is interesting, though, that there are 370 farmers in that particular division and I am told that not one of those farmers employs a full-time employee now. I can see that I am getting the wind-up signal to conclude this debate. I am grateful for the time that has been given to me. In conclusion, I would like to say that I hope the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will review this decision and show some compassion to these farmers in the Nyngan and Dubbo areas in particular, as well as those western areas.

NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 30 June 1995: Defence Act-Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal-Determinations 1995 Nos. 11, 12, 13. Endangered Species Protection Act-DecIaration under section 18, 4 May 1995. Public Service Act-Determinations 1995 Nos. 125, 127, LES 18, LES 19. Social Security Act-Social Security (Loan Fringe Benefits Valuation) Determination No.1. The following answers to questions were circulated: Scitec Communication Systems (Question No. 2230) Mr Mack asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 27 March 1995: (1) Further to his letter to me of 6 June 1994, did the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) investigate matters referred to it concerning Scitec Communication Systems Limited (Scitec); if so, did the matters include (a) the non-disclosure of a contingent liability in respect of damages that may be awarded in a civil action taken against Scitec or (b) allegations that (i) statements made by the Managing Director of Scitec, reported in the Sunday Telegraph of 1 August 1993, would have the effect of inducing the public to invest in Scitec shares and (ii) apparent errors of fact in those statements remained uncorrected. (2) Did he state in his letter that the ASC reviewed the complaint independently in 1993 and arrived at the decision not to take any further action on the basis of its own consideration and inquiries. (3) Did the review include matters referred to in part (1); if so, (a) what role did the (i) Investigation Division, (ii) Companies and Accounting Branch, (iii) Fundraising Branch; (iv) Deputy Chairperson and (v) Chairperson or Acting Chairperson play in investigating either matter, (b) did the Division or Branches refer either matter to the Deputy Chairperson, Chairperson or Acting Chairperson and (c) did conclusions reached by the Division, Branches or Chairpersons differ on the appropriate action to be taken; if so, in what way. (4) Was the Deputy Chairperson a director of NRMA Limited while engaged in the review; if so, was NRMA Life Limited (a) a company associated with NRMA Limited, (b) the third largest ordinary shareholder of Scitec and (c) the largest option holder of Scitec. (5) Did the role of the Deputy Chairperson in the Scitec matters fully comply with the guidelines he set out in his answer to part 13(a) of question No. 768 (Hansard, 24 March 1994, page 2215) .. (6) Do administrative arrangements within the ASC permit an ASC officer to refer matters affected by a conflict between the officer's public duty and private interest to other ASC officers over whom the former exercises authority; if so, do the arrangements allow justice to be seen to be done. NA (7) Will he ensure that ASC officers affected by a conflict or apparent conflict between duty and interest are required to refer a matter to other ASC officers over whom the affected officers do not exercise authority. (8) Will he direct the ASC to investigate further the matters referred to in part (1).",146
157,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised that the ASC did investigate certain matters referred to it concerning Scitec Communication Systems. The ASC reviewed the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) but did not investigate those matters. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (a) I am advised that the Investigation Division, the Companies and Accounts Branch and the Fundraising Branch of the NSW Regional Office of the ASC obtained information, reviewed the information and concluded that no further action was required. I am advised that the Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson and/or Acting Chairperson played no role in the review. (b) I am advised that the Investigation Division and other Branches of the NSW Regional office reached their own conclusions that no investigation was warranted and did not refer either matter to the Chairman, Acting Chairman and/or Deputy Chairman for the purpose of obtaining their views before reaching those conclusions. (c) I am advised that the conclusions reached by the Division and Branches did not differ on the appropriate action to be taken. In view of the role taken by the Chairman, . Acting Chairman and/or Deputy Chairman as indicated above, I am advised that there was no occasion for a difference of view on the appropriate action to be taken to arise and no difference of view did arise. (4) Ms Lyn Ralph, the Deputy Chairman of the ASC, was a director of NRMA Limited at the time of the review. However, I am advised that Ms Ralph was not engaged in the review. Her only role in this matter was to sign, as Acting Chairman, a letter on 13 January 1994 to Mr John Hatton MP in accordance with correspondence signing procedures of the ASC. The letter explained the conclusions already reached by senior staff of the NSW Regional Office of the ASC. It was open to Ms Ralph to reach a different conclusion to those reached by the NSW Regional Office but she did not do so. The ASC does not hold any registers of shareholdings of public companies. However, I am advised that the ASC's public records indicate that NRMA Limited is a shareholder of NRMA Life Limited and that NRMA Life Limited is a shareholder of Scitec Limited. The ASC's public records do not indicate the size of the shareholding nor whether the company holds any options. (5) I am advised that the answer is yes. (6) In this reply I wish to distinguish the requirements imposed on members of the Commission (that is the three members, including Ms Ralph, appointed to the Commission under section 9 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989) from officers of the Commission. In relation to officers, I noted the relevant provisions of the Public Service Regulations and Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 in my reply to your previous question relating to Scitec (Question No. 768). When an ASC officer is facing a conflict of interest he or she is thus required to disclose the interest, in accordance with Public Service Regulation 8B, and, in accordance with ASC procedures, can no longer take any part in the relevant decision making process. As a consequence, the officer no longer exercises authority in the matter over the other officers required to make a formal determination. In relation to members of the Commission, I note that they may abstain from making a decision on a matter voluntarily. In addition, section 124 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 provides the procedure to be followed where a member is faced with a conflict of interest situation. If the member is not the Chairperson, the member is required to disclose the interest to the Chairperson. The Chairperson is empowered to direct the member not to take part or not to continue to take part in determining the matter. The member must comply with the direction. Even when the Chairperson decides not to give such a direction, he or she must cause the member's interest to be disclosed to the persons concerned in the matter and the member may only take part or continue to take part if everyone concerned in the matter consents. If the member facing a conflict of interest situation is the Chairman, then he or she must disclose the interest to the persons concerned and may only take part or continue to take part if everyone in the matter consents. Since the ASC has three members and a quorum is two, the Commission can still make decisions on a particular matter in the course of a meeting when one member is not participating in decisions in relation to that matter because of a conflict of interest. If a member or an officer who is notemployed under the Public Service Act, when performing a function as a Commission delegate, is required to consider a matter in which he or she has an interest, the officer or member must forthwith notify the Commission in accordance with section 125 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. The interests to which sections 124 and 125 refer are direct or indirect pecuniary or other interests. Contravention of section. 124 or 125 without reasonable excuse is a ground for termination of a member's appointment. In my view, the legislative scheme and administrative arrangements provide a reasonable mechanism for ensuring that, notwithstanding conflicts of interest, the ASC can make informed and independent decisions on matters. (7) The relevant legislative provisions and the ASC procedures in place appear reasonable. (8) No. I do not consider it is appropriate for me to direct the ASC to conduct an investigation in this matter pursuant to section 14 of the ASC Law, especially given that the ASC has advised that it has reviewed the matter. Railways in South Australia (Question No. 2321) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 10 May 1995: ,(1) What sums were appropriated for the construction or reconstruction of railways in South Australia in each financial year between 1950-51 and 1972-73. (2) Which sections of railway track were built in South Australia wholly or partly with federal financial assistance between 1950-51 and 1972-73. (3) Which sections referred to in part (2)(a) have been removed or (b) are no longer in operation.",154
158,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth assumed responsibility for the non-metropolitan railways in South Australia in 1978, and responsibility for investment in railway construction in South Australia before that date rested with the South Australian Government. The Commonwealth made available some $13 million in this period for the standardisation of the Broken Hill-Crystal Brook line under the Railway Agreement (NSW and SA) Act 1968. It also made available funding for other works listed in the answer to part (2) of this question, but the figures are not readily available. When the Commonwealth took over responsibility for the non-metropolitan part of the former South Australian Railways (SAR), it made a cash payment of $IOm to South Australia and assumed SAR debt of $124 million, as well as cancelling certain other debts owed by South Australia to the Commonwealth. (2) The following railway works were undertaken in whole or part using Commonwealth funds between 1950-51 and 1972-73: reconstruction and conversion from narrow to broad gauge of the Wolseley-Mount Gambier, Mount Gambier-Millicent and Naracoorte to Kingston lines between 1952 and 1958; construction of a new standard gauge railway from Stirling North to Marree from 1952 to 1957; standardisation of the Broken Hill-Port Pirie railway from 1967 to 1969; construction of a new broad gauge railway on the narrow gauge alignment between Terowie and Peterborough in 1969; and construction of a new standard gauge railway between Whyalla and Port Augusta from 1970 to 1972. (3)(a) and (b) No train services currently operate over the Wolseley-Mount Gambier line which is still open. The Snuggery to Millicent section of the Mount Gambier-Millicent line has been closed, but track materials have not been removed. The Australian National Railways Commission has closed the Naracoorte-Kingston, TerowiePeterborough, and Copley-Marree section of the Stirling North-Maree lines due to lack of demand for services and the pennanent way materials were removed. The former two lines are ex-South Australian Railways lines, and the South Australian Government agreed to their closure. National Highway (Question No. 2337) Mr Andrew asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 10 May 1995: (1) Has the Sturt Highway through Renmark, SA, via Blanchetown and the Barossa Valley, been declared part of the National Highway. (2) Will the bridges across the Murray River at Paringa and Blanchetown be replaced; if so, (a) according to what· proposal and schedules and (b) will the bridges be relocated.",155
159,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Federal Government has approved $1 million to commence engineering design and survey works for a new crossing site to replace the Blanchetown Bridge. Replacement of the Paringa Bridge is not currently under consideration. Aum Divine Truth Sect (Question No. 2355) Mr Aldred asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 11 May 1995: (1) Was the leader of the Aum Divine Truth sect, Shoko Asahara, admitted to Australia in September 1993. (2) How many members of the sect entered Australia. (3) What action did (a) the Australian Customs Service and (b) the Minister's Department take in relation to their entry. (4) Did members of the sect provide false personal or travel details to immigration officials; if so, what action was taken. (5) Did members of the sect bring prohibited chemicals into Australia; if so, what chemicals. (6) Were members of the sect charged with offences (a) on their arrival or (b) during their stay in Australia. (7) Did sect member Seichi Endo visit Australia in September 1993; if so, was he charged with any offence while in Australia. (8) Has his attention been drawn to the investigation of Seichi Endo by Japanese law enforcement authorities for the alleged (a) development of drugs and chemicals including the nerve gas Sarin and (b) purchase of materials for multiplying viruses in 1993. (9) Is the Government considering whether overseas visitors to the Northern Territory should be allowed visa-free entry into Australia. (10) What visa requirements will apply to overseas visitors attending the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000. (11) Has Joseph Kobzon, a Russian singer and entertainer, been admitted to Australia; if so, is it a fact that the US Central Intelligence Agency publicly identified Kobzon as a key Russian organised crime figure in March 1995. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that: (1) Chizuo Matsumoto entered Australia on 9 September 1993. The Australian Federal Police have established that Chizuo Matsumoto is the same person as Shoko Asahara (his group religious name). (2) A group of 25 people, including Chizuo Matsumoto, entered Australia on 9 September 1993. It has been established that the group were all members of the cult. We are continuing to cooperate with the AFP to ascertain whether any other members of the cult may have come to Australia. (3)(a) This is a question which should properly be directed to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. (b) Consideration was given to refusing entry to the group and cancelling their visas: It was assessed that there was insufficient information to provide a legal basis for cancelling the visas. The breach of customs regulations by two members of the group did not constitute non-compliance with visa conditions. All members of the group departed within the period of validity of their visas. (4) I have no information that the members of the sect provided false personal or travel details to immigration officials. (5) This is a question which should properly be directed to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. (6) This is a question which should properly be directed to the Minister for Justice. (7) Seichi Endo was one of the people who entered Australia on 9 September 1993 and departed on 19 September 1993. The question regarding any charges should properly be directed to the Minister for Justice. (8) No investigation of Seichi Endo by Japanese law enforcement authorities for the alleged development of drugs and chemicals, including Sarin, and the purchase of materials for multiplying viruses in 1993 has been drawn to my attention. However, I am advised that Seichi Endo was arrested by the Japanese authorities at the same time as the leader, Chizuo Matsumoto, and other members of the cult were arrested on 16 May 1995. (9) No. (10) It is intended that normal tourist visa provisions will apply to overseas visitors attending the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. However, my Department is developing a number of initiatives to facilitate visitor entry to Australia, including the Electronic Travel Authority which could be operative within two years, subject to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, and would greatly facilitate tourist entry to Australia without compromising the integrity of our borders. (11) lossif Kobzon entered Australia on 7 February 1995. He was previously admitted to Australia on 28 December 1989. The suggestion that he was publicly identified by the US Central Intelligence Agency as a key Russian organised crime figure was contained in an article by Vitali Vitaliev in The Australian in March 1995. My Department has not been able to obtain confirmation that this occurred. Department of Defence: Computers (Question No. 2406)  upon notice, on 6 June 1995: (1) Has the Minister's Department detected attempts to break into departmental computers; if so, how many attempts were detected in each year since 1990. (2) Has the Minister's Department developed countermeasures against SATAN (Security Administrative Tool for Analysing Networks); if so, what progress has been made.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Since 1990; there has only been one report to security authorities of penetration of a Defence computer system. This occurred in November 1993 and involved an unclassified logistic repair and maintenance system. There was no damage to the' system as a result of the incident. (2) The policies in the current edition of Defence Security Manual No 3-lnformation System Security and those to appear in a revised edition of this manual, currently being prepared, combined with a pro-active education policy, should protect Defence computer systems from the type of security analysis that could be conducted using SATAN.",156
