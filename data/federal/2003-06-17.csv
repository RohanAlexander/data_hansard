The aircraft many crashes-three or four this year, with Antonov AN124, which has an appalling safety on a charter flight crashed on take-off with about very good reliable aircraft using Perth airport ceptable that we have the need for that.

In speaking on Appropriation make of the government's broad approach on government seems to be prone to periodically on issues that go to important matters of safety and I think many Australians, see as inappropriate ment handles these sorts of crucial issues. In relation to the first point about playing to an issue that is very close to my electorate, Melbourne Airmail Transit Centre.

It is always interwith some measure that is going to fail or that it in with a name that sounds reasonable. So here as you know that the government has put somehad better watch out because you know they are they are going to rip you off. points I have made. The bringing of all currently systems from 1 July 2008 is, in my opinion, which does nothing for the environment, nor does Treasurer has yet again shown his contempt for budget. This Liberal government seems to be, of Western Australia, particularly those into WA, and of that funding none of it goes to the also the increased financial burden on university on all Australians. I can see nothing to commend Labor policy on Medicare puts the policy of the it to be unfair and unworkable. Yet again, we out of touch with ordinary Australians, whereas in our address in reply are far better for all all members of this parliament fundamentally important role of a government Australia and the Australian people. That role of that arise from whatever source in whatever Bill (No. 1) 2003-2004, the criticism I would many of those issues is twofold. Firstly, the wanting to play ideological or political games and security. Secondly, I am critical of what I, priorities in the way in which the governpolitical games, I illustrate that point by referring a facility close to Melbourne airport called the jointly operated by Australia Post, AQIS and checking and clearing of very large volumes of states as well. It is a facility that, after we for example, where anthrax was detected in of threats to Australia and Australians. Yet the Melbourne presents appalling working conditions. NA It is crowded, it is cramped, it is inefficient the conflicts that arise between people moving and the like. It is supposed to be only a temporary facility. live explosive material detected in it, including white powders have been discovered-fortunately terest to quarantine: things like snakes, spiders facility and the safety of not just the whole very important. Ironically, the government has made a commitment build a purpose-built better facility for this airport. But the process has not developed. thousands of Australians continues to not be obsession by the Minister for Employment allow the purpose-built facility at Melbourne operates, as virtually all building firms operate protections for wages and conditions of building will be used for this project only if everyone movement, building firms and the like-goes relations that will involve a significant deterioration tions of the building workers I think this is a fine example-a terrible an environment where many people are particularly rity. Checking inbound mail from overseas, and important to that role. Yet the government is about building unions, to put this important work ceptable. It is an example of the political goes on with from time to time. I want to illustrate the question of inappropriate the approach that the Minister for Defence, in the Australian Defence Force and Australian tor Hill argued that the old way of organising ‘concentric circles' of the sea air gap was fundamental change to the notion that our security own region. He went on to talk about a more seas more often. In other words, he talked about the need great and powerful friend, and to organise and cusing-as it ought to, in terms of any realistic on ensuring that our own immediate regional view of eminent authority on defence Paul Dibb, Studies Centre, any suggestion that these sorts onciled is unrealistic and unaffordable. So continuing to be committed to a US strategic and it is from time to time dangerous because of around the building and vehicle movements It is a facility that over recent years has had live grenades periodically. It is a place where fake anthrax. It is a place of particular inand the like come through.

Rather, the minister says that funds in the Victorian community-the trade union along with his particular approach on industrial in the occupational safety and the condiwho will construct this facility. example-of this government's behaviour. This is conscious of the need for adequate secuparcels, packages and the like, is critically prepared, because of its ideological obsessions on hold. Frankly, as I said, this is just unacand ideological game playing that the government priorities by making some remarks about particular, has been taking to the way in which security generally are organised.
