1,Mr BARTON,Unknown," May , I make a short statement before business is called on, in. order to inform the House that I haveheard from my honourable colleague the M in is to for Home.Affairs thftt hels not yetableto leave his bed, and as I' fchink:h© should : not be unduly hastenedback to the work of the House, I shall endeavour, if "" I can, not to proceed with the second reading, debate on the-Inter-State Commission. Bill - during this week. To-day we shall' take the Customs Bill inasmuch as it is desirable that it should go up.to the Senate as soon as possible, and if there is any time left after, the completion of that Bill we shall go on with the State Laws and Records Recognition Bill. PETITIONS .",14
2,Mr BAMEORD,Unknown,"I beg to present a petition to the Postmaster-General from 278 T residents of Chillagoe, praying, for. relief in a certain direction. Mr SPEAKER The petition is addressed, not to the House, but to the Postmaster-General, so that. it. cannot, be received.",14
3,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I shall take, charge of the petition for-that Minister.",14
4,Sir LAN,Unknown,"GDON BQNTTHON presented a petition from the SouthAustralian Chamber of Manufactures, representing the' manufacturers and-producers of that, State, protesting against the proposed, inclusion of' shipping .rates and charges within the scopeof the Inter-State Commission. Petition received and read. PRESS TELEGRAMS : TASMANIA .",14
5,Sir EDWABD BRADDON,Unknown,"asked the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether the Government will,: reconsider-the question of reducing telegraph rates for press messages to Tasmania, with theview of doing bare justice to the people and press of that State by placing them, in this respect, upon a footing of equality with those of other States.",14
6,Sir PHILIP FYSH,Unknown,"To reduce these charges would involve, paying, on behalf of the press, the charges for transmission by a privately-owned cable over which the Government have no control, and this the Government are not prepared to do. JAPANESE: NORTHERN TERRITORY.",15
7,Mr BIGGINS,Unknown,"In asking the. following question standing in my name, I may say to the Prime Minister, that I am anxious to know if the information I have received is correct1. Whether any communications have been mado of recent years between the Government of Japan and the Government of South Australia, or any public man of South Australia, with re? ard to introducing Japanese into the Northern territory! 2. Whether it is possible to obtain all such communications and to lay them on the table for the information of honourable members of this House ?",15
8,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I am not aware of any such communications, but am having inquiries made respecting them, and, if any be obtained, I shall be pleased to lay copies of them on the table for the information of honourable members. NA PUBLICATIO N. Mr Wilks, for Mr Bruce asked the Minister for - Home Affairs, upon notice I. Whether, having regard to the importance of preserving in a compiled form a'complete record of the commercial, industrial, and social conditions of the people of the Commonwealth at the date of unkrn, he f ill take into consideration the question of authorizing some competent person to collect the necessary data, with a view to the issue of a Commonwealth statistical publication as soon as possible after the appointment of a Commonwealth statistician ? 2. In view of the frequent conflict of statistical authority on many important matters, will he consider the necessity for making'such an appointment at an early date, and of submitting a short Bill as soon as the state of public business will admit ?",15
9,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"On behalf of my honourable colleague I have to say that the matter has not been lost sight of, and, as soon as the state of public business will allow, some action will be token to deal with this important question. CUSTOMS BILL . In Committee (consideration resumed from 18th July, vide page 2800) : Postponed clause 239(1) In every Customs prosecution the defendant shall be competent to give evidence. (2) In every Customs prosecution except for an indictable offence, the defendant shall be, compellable' to give evidence and if called as a witness for the, prosecution Khali be liable to cross examination as a witness adverse to the prosecution.",15
10,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"South Australia). - There was very good reason for this clause not being passed when it was last before the committee. The opinion was expressed, by some honourable members at any rate, that the clause was an entirely new departure from the ordinary course of legal procedure. It is all very well to give - the defendant an opportunity, as is'done in some of the States under local legislation, to be sworn and give evidence in the some way as an ordinary witness, but when it is asked, as this clause provides, that the defendant shall be compelled by the prosecuting attorney-o r by the Customs or their representative!!-to give evidence, even against himself, and be treated as an adverse witness, and cross-examined, I ask honourable and learned members to consider the position we are getting into in regard' ""to this Bill . There is a certain amount of excuse, I know, for making a Bill of this nature drastic. A Bill which seeks to protect the revenue, a Customs Bill especially, SMITH, must undoubtedly be more drastio than an ordinary Bill dealing with questions in dispute between ordinary citizens. I fancy the clause goes a little too for ; indeed, I might say, it goes a great deal too far. The provision seems to go beyond any similar section in the Customs Acts or thexegulotions at present on the statute books of the various States. Can the Minister in charge of the Bill point to any State of the Commonwealth where a clause of this peculiarly drastic nature is in force? Having provided for the most extreme fines and penalties it is possible to impose on an offender against the Customs law, it is sought to put the Customs department in a position to force a man in the witness box to give evidence against himself, and to treat him as an adverse witness. That is beyond anything I knowof in the way of legal enactment or urisdiction in any of the States.",15
11,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," As the honourable member has pointed out, Customs laws stand on a very different footing from other laws. Where it is. necessary to protect the revenue, large powers are given, especially in this connection. The honourable member will find that the Bill throughout is dotted over with provisions enabling the Customs authorities to require the answering of questions in connection with Customs mutters. The second part of the clause simply goes a little further. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - A little 1",15
12,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The second part of the clause simply puts it that the dufcy of answering questions shall not cease on the bearing of the information, but that the party who knows all about the matter shall not only have an opportunity of telling what is intended by the clause, but may be called on by the prosecution to tell what are. the facts. Why should we not get at the facts as readily as we possibly can 1 Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Why should we not put the defendant under a thumb-screw 1",16
13,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"If a man has not done wrong, he has nothing to fear. If he tells the truth and the facts are in his favour, so much the better for him. take it that if we are forced to call him, seeing that his interest is altogether against the prosecution being sustained, we have a righb to examine him just as we would an adverse witness; and the Bill draws the presumption that be is an adverse witness fromfchesimple fact that he is there for the purpose of resisting the infliction of the penalty sought to be imposed. 1 do not hesitatefcoput it to honourable members that this clause tells for truth and justice, and that under it an innocent man has nothing to fear.",16
14,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Soufch Sydney). - If the principle laid down by the Minister is to be adopted in Customs prosecutions, it ought to be adopted in all prosecutions. It is the principle which underlies the Erench law, and if it be adopted infchisBill, it oughtfcobe adopted in other Bills. The argument used by the Minister that an innocent man has the best chance of proving his innocence, and the guilty man is more likely to commit himself, is the very argument used in favour - of the principle underlying the system of Erench jurisprudence, under which the defendant is examined and asked either to convict himself or prove himself innocent. ""Unless we are prepared to adopt the principle throughout the criminal law, we have no right to adopt it in this Bill.",16
15,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," It would be as well to clear away any misapprehension there may be in regard to this clause, by a very simple statement. Where an ordinary witness is called for the prosecution in a criminal case, or for the plaintiff in a civil proceeding, if his evidence turns outfcobe adverse to the side on which he is called, it is an ordinary practice for the court to allow an opportunity to cross-examine him. The only further step taken in the clause is that where a person or. defendant compellable to give evidence is called for the prosecution, it shall be taken as a matter of course, if necessary, that he is adverse because of his position. He is there, if he defends the case, to avoid liability, and is therefore adverse to the prosecution. This is simply a provision to enable a person, under the circumstances, to be examined as a witness adverse to the prosecution, that being his real character.",16
16,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"South Australia). - This clause is a total topsy-turveydom of the old British axiom, that every man Bufc we is deemed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty.",16
17,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Thaf c does not apply all round.,16
18,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"1 venture to think that it would be a disgrace if such a provision appeared on the statute-book of any British colony or dependency. W it h the exception, I think, of South Australia, there is no State where they permit in certain cases the defendant or accused to give evidence on oath. That is permitted by special statute in South Australia; but here, after first of all making throughout the Bill the most stringent regulations in favour of the Government and the Customs authorities, doing everything possible to protect the revenue by, to my mind, absurd fines and penalties in some instances--- ' Mr KINGSTON - If c should be protected.",16
19,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am not arguing that it should not. But I say that after protecting the revenue fairly and' properly, it is now proposed that if a man be accused of some offence against the Customs Act, of some endeavour to obtain an advantage to the detriment of the revenue, that man shall be taken away from his position as defendant, in which, under ordinary British law, he would be deemed an innocent man until proven guilty by the other side, and shall be compelled to go into the witness box and be cross-examined by the prosecutor, order to prove that he has been: guilty, and thus make himselfliable to certain pains and. penalties. It isa departure, of a most' serious nature,, and. I . ask honors' ablemembers-to consider'it. very carefully. If , as an honourable member behind ine just now said,, we are going toadopt-fchis French.system ofc adjudicating, this system which British law hitherto has not reeogr nisedMr MANGER ; - It is recognised at present time.",16
20,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Perhaps the honourable member - for Melbourne Ports will take the opportunity of: telling, the committee where it is recognised.",17
21,Mr MAUGEK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I can assure the honourable member that there is a precedent.,17
22,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I admit that it is right to allow a defendant to give evidence on his own behalf: if he chooses, but to forcea defendantMi-i KINGSTON - To tell the truth.",17
23,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Does the Minister seriously think that a defendant will be likely to tell the truth, when he has pleaded not guilty 1 The Minister might, go n little further and adoptsome of the other continental modes",17
24,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,But crimes are here exempted. Mr VL SOLOMON Indictable offences are exempted.,17
25,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That is crime.,17
26,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Does the honourable and learned member defend the clause as applied to the cases of - misdemeanour ?,17
27,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Certainly .,17
28,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am extremely Braddon, SirE . sony that the-honourable. and learned member Cameron, JNT. makes such an admission. I hope that other Cook, J. honourable members do not defend . such a Crouch, B . A. departure as this clause proposes. It is a Edwards, G. B. departure which should be carefully conFowler, J. M . sidered by every one who respects the British spirit of fair play upon which most of our laws are framed, and I hope thatfche committee will hot agree to it .",17
29,Mr KIRWAN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," I feel inclined to support the position taken up by the honourable member for Soufch Australia, Mr Solomon. The provisions of'this clause seem to. me to be contrary to theaccepted principles of British law. I ' think that the first portion of the clause will meet all the requirements offchecase and thatfchesecond part should therefore be eliminated. The in first portion of the clause states that the defendant shall be competent to give evidence, Thafc seems to me to go far enough,-because if we compel a defendant to giveevidence he may be required either to commit perjury or to. admit his own guilt. That seems to .be hardly a. fair position in which to place a man. If a defendant gives evidence in his own favour his testimony will be discounted, and he will thus be placed in a very awkward the position indeed. I sincerely trust that the committee will carefully consider the clause and endeavour to minimize its ill effects. Amendment (by Mr VL SOLOMON) proposedTbafcsnb-clause (2) be omitted.

Postponed clause 2-10I n every Customs prosecution the averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information declaration or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence, of proof to the contrary but so that(a) When an intent to defraud the revenue is charged the averment shall not be deemed sufficient to prove the intent and{h) In all proceedings for an indictable offence the guilt of the'defendanfc be established by evidence.",17
30,Mr G,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"B.. EDWARDS (South Sydney) Here is another instanceof the extreme severity of the Bill. This clause provides that the simple averment of the prosecutor shall be deemed to be proved in the sence of proof to the contrary, and I that goes too far, as proceedings may be stituted against a defendant who may be able, possibly owing to some accident, be present. I think the Minister ought not to be too stiff-necked-if I may use the term-throughou t the consideration of these clauses. He has practically had his own way in nearly everything proposed in the Bill, - and the provision I have referred to seems to be a, useless little bit of; tyranny which might reasonably be modified in some form so that innocent persons who may be unable to be present to defend themselves, may not be declared guilty on the simple averment of the prosecution.",18
31,Mr KING STON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"But the honourable member iovSouth Sydney must see that"" it is an almost inherent principle, recognised in the administration of justice in civilized communities, that when any one is prejudiced in his defence by his inevitable absence, shall be entitled to an adjournment-subject to terms that can general!y be arranged; and possibly where the reason that the honourable member has mentioned exists same principle would apply with all the greater force. The clause sets forth plainly what is to some extent a principle of all Customs Acts, particularly in connection with a class of cases such as this, which have hedged round with certain conditions, taking them out of the criminal category.",18
32,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Stil lfcheyare cases where imprisonment may follow.,18
33,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Ye s ; in cases of nonallow payment of penalty. We are bound to'have some mode of enforcing penalties ; but i provided that no man shall have the stigma of fraud attached to him except in cases where itisabsolutelyprovedagainsthim; and I think that we may fairly extend the prinand ciple that the burden of proof shall lie the defendant to cases such as are contemthis plated here. The defendant knows all about it-it is his duty to comply with the Act, and no man can better tell whether he has complied with it or not. These are cases where any private individual is to get the better of another.",18
34,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Can the honourable must and learned gentleman give us: an instance of i the class of: case he hadan - his - mind, when he drafted the Bill ? Mri KINGSTON - A variety; of: cases. In the case of an invoice; let"" the defendant prove his invoice ; and if? the question is as ab-. to' whether duty has been, paid, let 1 think him prove that he has paid, the dutyinfche defendant knows all about it:. This not clausesimply summarizes the principle to which is contained in various other Acts, and which is necessary to. effectual administration of Customslaws, and, hedged round as it is here, I venture - to think that it is not likely to be attended' with any that has-been degree of hardship. Mr V : L.. SOLOMON (South Australia). - I asked ithe Minister: if: he could give us an. instance of the kind of' case he had in view when he framed the Bill; and he has replied in an airy sort of i way,' stating that he had:a variety of cases in view, such as those relating to invoices and so on. Referring for one moment, for the purpose of ' argument,fcoclause 2.20, we find that a per> son who makes an entryfchafcis false in any particularisliable fco a penalty of £ 1 0 0 . In the event of that £ 1 0 0 not'being paid, he the defendant would be liable to six months' - imprisonment. Even thoughfchedefendant might not be aware of .the falsity of the entry the very fact of' its being false in any parthe ticular would render him liable to six months imprisonment, and now we find that 0 under this clause it is provided, against all the accepted rules of British law, that the onus of proof that he is not guilty is to be we on the defendant. The committee refused to alter a clause just now with regard to witnesses, but I am surefchafc-fchespirit of British fair play, which I think imbues, every member of this committee, will not them to pass a clause like fchis. Referring to the clause which has just been t is passed, a man may be comptdsorily placed in the witness-box and cross-examined, to prove that the entry to which he had. signed hisname was in some way false or. incorrect, may be fined £V00 or. imprisoned for on six months. And now it: is-proposed, under clause, that the mere averment of the prosecutor contained in the information shall be deemed to be proved,, in the absence of. proof to the contrary. Is there any law not in any British speaking community fchafc trying throws the onus of proof upon the defendant instead of on the prosecutor ? 1 It is wise enough perhaps to protect our revenue and to make the law as stringent as may be necessary to effect that purpose ; but there is such a thing as going very much too far, and I venture to think that we shall be overstepping thebounds in throwing the onus of proof on the defendant. I shall seek to alter this clause by moving an amendment which it will take some minutes to prepare.",18
35,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,What does the honourable member propose-to provide that this clause shall not apply to cases in which imprisonment is involved 1,19
36,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I propose that it shall not apply to anything.,19
37,Mr MCC AY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"- I would suggest to the Minister that the difficulty which some honourable members feel might be met by amending this clause so as to insure that clause 228 shall not appty in such cases; that is to say, that the averment of the prosecutor shall not be held as proof of guilt until the contrary is proved by the - defendant, in any cases in which conviction may be followed by imprisonment under clause 228. As long as only pecuniary penalties are concerned we might reasonably go so far ; but when it becomes a matter of depriving a man of his liberty unless he proves something which, perhaps, he may be unable to prove unless be has a commission to Europe, Ave are going too far.",19
38,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,What does the honourable and learned member want to do 1,19
39,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"To limit the clause to cases where there is no power of imprisonment consequent upon the conviction. Indictable offences are already excluded from the operation of clause 24-0, and I want the Minister to extend the principle so as to exclude from the operation of the clause any cases in'which the Crown claims that conviction may be followed by imprisonment.",19
40,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The honourable learned 'member does not mean cases of non-payment of the fine 1,19
41,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"No j cases where imprisonment is part of the punishment for the offence. The Minister knows that men are sometimes prosecuted for certain offences for which there is either an increased penalty or imprisonment for a second offence. The Crown frequently does not proceed with the case as a second offence, but deals with it as though it were a first offence, so that the penalty of imprisonment may not be inflicted. As long as the mere statement of wrong-doing does not imply imprisonment of the defendant, I shall be satisfied. Mr K IN G STO N - I think there is something in the honourable and learned member's point. I move That after the word "" offence,"" line 10, the words ""or for an offence directly punishable by imprisonment "" be inserted. I am sure that will nieet the case. Wherever the offence is of such a character that imprisonment is the "" immediate result,"" let the guilt be proved.",19
42,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"It is "" an immediate result"" if the defendant does not.pay a £ 5 fine.",19
43,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,It is intended to exclude such cases.,19
44,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," I do not think the amendment goes far enough - Throughout the consideration of this Bill we have had brought home to us the great difficulty that exists in proving offences under the Customs Act. But there is another fact we have to face now, and that is that the Government are endeavouring to make it very difficult for a man to prove his own innocence. We are bound as representatives of the people to see that the common liberties of the public are protected. A clause of this kind is a striking menace to a man's liberty. We are asked to put him in a position which is different from that in which any offender is put under the ordinary criminal law, and to state that simple "" averment"" shall be proof of guilt. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, whose mind is very acute on matters of this kind, had already given notice of his intention to move that the clause be struck out, but he unfortunately is not now present. I shall feel justified in voting against the retention of the clause.",19
45,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Bette r amend it first, and and then if the honourable member wishes he can take a division on the clause as amended.",19
46,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"It may be possible to amend the clause, but to strike it out altogether would give the Minister an opportunity of drafting a provision that will fully meet his case without going quite so far as I think fchis clause does in 'taking away the liberty offchesubject.  cannot support the clause as it stands. I had some hesitation, in fact, regarding clause 239. ' We have gone far enough in giving the Crown the opportunity of getting all possible evidence in favour of its position by putting the defendant himself in the witness-box and making him prove the case against himself, if the Crown can make him so prove it. Clause 240, however, goes further than we ought to go, and I must object to it as it stands. Mr Y . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). - I trust that the committee will not agree to insert the words that have been proposed by the Minister for Trade and Customs. I suggest that the better course to adopt is to follow the honourable member for South Sydney in his proposal to strike out the clause altogether. It is admittedly a dangerous clause, which goes much further than I think most of us desire to go. By striking it out, we shall give the Minister an opportunity, if he thinks a new clause in a modified form is necessary, to draft it and bring it up on the recommittal of the Bill.",19
47,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"This is rather a peculiar way of doing business. I always understood that the proper plan was, first to take amendments upon a clause, and then after the clause was amended, if it did not recommend itself to the good sense of the committee, to vote against the motion "" that the clause as amended stand part of the Bill . "" This is the first time. I have heard of an objection being taken to making amendments, retaining for those who are opposed to the clause the righb to vobe against ib afber the amendments have been made. Mr V . L., SOLOMON - The amendment proposed by the honourable and learned gentleman is such an insidious one.",20
48,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"l b is such a sensible one, inasmuch as ib removes all possible ground of objection from bhose honourable members who have been opposed to the clause. The amendmenb cubs away 75 per cenb. of the honourable member's objections. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Whab would amendment do 1",20
49,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I b would prevenb a man being convicted for an offence which is immediately punishable by imprisomnenb, excepb upon direct evidence. Of course, bhere must be some provision for the enforcement of penalties in all cases. If ib is intended to deprive the Cusboms departmenb of the means of providing againsb defrauding the revenue, .the clause will be sbruck oub.

Ifc is a well known principle of British law to hold every person innocent until be is proved guilty.",20
50,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Not in revenue cases.  exceptions, but I think bhis is a very serious departure from the principle. In. the previous clause we have gone beyond anything bo be found in any sbabufce-book.",20
51,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"And infchisclause, too.  vict himself, and bhen under bhis - clause an avermenb of the prosecutor only is to be sufficient evidence to make a man punishable by fine.",20
52,Sir EDWABD BRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Tasmania). - The Minister has said, if I understood him correctly, that this legislation has been practically taken from other .customs laws.",20
53,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,No ; I said there were various provisions as to presumptions.,20
54,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The Minister cannot point to any single cusboms law in which bhere is sucli a principle as bhis involved. I am jusb as much in favour of probecbing the revenue as he or any one else is, bub I say, let us probecfc it by just methods, and nob inbroduce inbo the Commonwealth legislation principles which are a danger fco the people, and entirely out of keeping with all the provisions of the law, nob only of the mobher counbry, bub of the differenb Ausbralian Sbates.",20
55,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," I the take an altogether differenb view of bhis matter from thab adopbed by some of my honourable friends opposite. I have been asked where bhis principle is already acknowledged. In reply, I would point out that in two Victorian measures it is fco be found. In the Victorian Factories Acb - which has been found to work tofcheadvantage of the people and the operatives bhemselves-and also in the Licensing Act, the onus of proof lies on the party charged. ..^Some of my honourable friends opposite appear to hold a brief 'for people laying .themselves out to break the-law? Mr V.

56,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The honourable member is not in order. It. is disorderly to impute improper motives to honourable members.,21
57,Mr MATJGER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"r l will certainly withdraw the remark, Mr Chairman. had no desire to be disorderly. A.great many people regard a breach of the customs law as something only to be smiled at, and for which the offender should be exonerated. I hold, however, that a breach offchecustoms law is asigreab a crime as. is a breach of any other law.",21
58,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,And it should be treated in the same way.,21
59,Mr MATJGER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That is what I propose to do. I have given precedents to show that the principle contained in the clause is not unique.,21
60,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"If a man is a thief he is not treated as it is proposed fco treat offenders under this clause. Mr Mauger , - I have cited two instances which show, as far ,as Victoria is concerned,'that this principle is not an experiment, but that on the contrary it bas been tried, and has proved exceedingly usef u l . If::a-man is notjguilfcyof law-breaking, this clause willhave no terrors for him. It is only the man who has been guilty of .a breach of the law who-seed fear such a provision as fchis. I hope that the amendment suggested by the Government will be adopted. Mr G. B. .EDWARDS (Soubh Sydney). - I should not :have spoken again but for the remark made byfcheMinister that some honourable members who oppose bhis proposal are acbuated by a desire to offer merely factious opposition. I hope the committee will nob abfcribute such a motive bo me in anybhing I do i nfchisHouse. My opposition is due bo'the earnest belief thatT am defending the liberty of innocent people. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said that'some honourable members on bhis side of the commibbee hold a brief for cerbain people. I .asserb that the brief which I hold, and which I. hope I always shall hold, is a brief to defend the righbs of the masses of the people. Nobwibhsbanding the honourable member's contention, I hold that bheFacbories Acfcin Victoriais-still only a piece of tentative legislation. We have yet bo.learn whether it will-be acceptable and .generally-followed. As to the. contention of the Minister that we are not content - wibh an offer made bo meet our views, I contend thab he has nob meb our views at all. As an honourable member, has-said, this is an insidious way of getting rid of opposition to the clause. I have no desire to press my amendment for sfcrikingoufc theelause. Tsuggesfcedfchafceourse with the object of inducing the Minister bo withdraw"" this provision, and bo bring down anobher properly drafted clause which would meeb the objection very reasonably urged againsb it . The Minister says, in effect"" If you do not believe in it, do not vote for striking ib oub, bufc draft an amendmenb."" That is very easily said. I might draft an amendment, and be immediabely laughed ab for doing so. The Minisber requested the honourable member for Corinella bo drafb one, bub that honourable member said he could nob undertakefcodo so at once, because be would not know what its. effectmight be on the other provisions of the Bill. That is just our position. Ifc would be only is reasonable thing for .fcheMinister to withdraw the clause, - andfcobake advantage of his official position to drafb one which would somewhat meet the reasonable wishes of those who are opposing this drastic provision. Unless he does so, I >shall feel impelled to vobe againsb the - clause, because I think a greab principle is ab stake.",21
61,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"We are always delighted to meeb the views of honourable members if we can possibly come bo an agreemenb wibh fchem; but I do nob precisely understand-it may be my faultwhat the honourable member for Soufch Sydney desires. I thought bhat the objection was that in the absence of direcb evidence . a charge which would involve imprisonment ought not to be sustained. Ib is wibh the object of meeting that objection that we have framed the amendment, and I am sure it will, have thedesired effect. In regard to the point whether or not, we should in any - case in which a charge is not established by direct. evidence, take away the power bo imprison for default of paymenb, I do> not'think we ought bo go as far as thab. The righb honourable member 1 for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, has spoken very sbrongly against bhis provision. Probably he is not aware that - a similar elected provision andaprovision about'the defendant being competent and compellable to. give dence in a revenue case is contained i English legislation. 'Section 259 of the is English Customs .Act of 1S76 providesIf in any prosecution in respect of any .goods seized for-non-payment of duties or any other of forfeiture, or for the recovering of any or penalties under the Customs Acts, any dispiifce shall arise whether the duties of Customs - have been paid in respect of such goods, or whether the same have been lawfully imported or lawfully of unshipped, or concerning the-place from whence - within such, goods wore broughtand' these are three of the..greafcesfc things which disputes do a r is e then and in every-such case the proof thereof Shall be on the defendant.

65,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I see; that is the department. reason why the honourable member objects.,22
66,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,A very good reason too.,22
67,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The honourable mem-, ber says ""a very.g<s>od reason too."" It would be a very-good thing if honourable members would not interrupt a speaker when he is quoting a clause untilhe - has finished it . If the honourable member will listen, he will be enlightened accordingly. The clause goes on to sayAnd where any such proceedings rare had in the :240. Exchequer division of the High Court of Justice on the revenue side, the 'defendant shall be competent and compellable to.give evidence. That isfchepoint which has been troubling the minds - Of honourable members opposite. Thensection 260 providesThe averment that the Commissioners Custdms or inland revenue have directed that any information or proceedings under the Customs Acts shall be instituted, or that any ship or boat is foreign . . . . or that eviany - person detained or found on board n any ship or boat liable to seizure is ornot .a - subject of His Majesty, or that - any goods thrown overboard, staved or destroyed, were so thrown overboard, staved, or destroyed to prevent seizure, or that any - goods thrown case overboard,-stave'd, or destroyed during chase by penalty any ship . . . . were so thrown overboard, staved, or destroyed, to avoid seizure, or that any person is an officer of customs or excise, or that any person was employed for the prevention smuggling, or 'that the-offence - was comraited the limits of ra-ny port, or where the offence is committed in any port of the in United .Kingdom, the naming of such port in any information or proceedings shall be deemed to be sufficient unless the defendant in .any such caseishall prove tb the contraiiy. ""What we have done is to take the principle and extend it . Mr .ISAACS - Does that compellability applyto criminal matters ? . Mr KINGSTON - No ; .it is. on the revenue side. We - have taken the principle;and!'have extended it, instead of .going into a lot of specification. We think the principle has been sufficiently recognised to permit of this - extension, and to; permit our laying it down in : this way 'as. a broad, general rule 'for the protection of the revenue, l it is not a question of :a prosecution by one individual desirous of injuring some one else, bufc a provision not simply for - the - good of the'State, and in be connection-Will cases' in which people are more: likely to escape prosecution than to be (to underthe circumstances a provision of this sort may be safely exercised by - a public - Mr - ISAACS (Indi) - I should like to ascertain distinctly whetheri it is possible to punish the defendant directly by imprisonment except' upon an indictment. If it is, the amendment the Minister - is proposing Would leave 'a defendant compellable to give evidence in a 'case against himself, - where he could be punished directly by imprisonment. I do not think the honourable gentleman can mean fchafc.",22
68,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I am dealing with clause,22
69,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"In the. preceding clause, .'239, there is ianexception made, and the defendant is not compelled to give evidence in the case of am indictable offence. I would like to be sure whether the amendment the of honourable gentleman is proposing draws a or distinction between indictable offences and other offences punishable directly by imprisonment. If there are any other offences punishable directly by imprisonment, the defendant should not be compelled to give evidence against himself and to be subject to cross-examination. My attention has been directed to clause 228, under which a person may be imprisoned with hard labour, for a period of not less than six months, or more than two years, for a second offence, for which a pecuniary penalty is provided. But as I understand clause 231, as now amended, the only courts that will have jurisdiction in that matter will be the High Court of Australia, or the Supreme Court of any State, the Courts of summary procedure being limited to a pecuniary penalty in cases up to £500.",22
70,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That indirectly may involve imprisonment up to twelve months.,23
71,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I think that as the now stands the court of summary jurisdicfor tion would not be able to award that will penalty. I understand that the committee of has affirmed sub-clause (2) of 239, which makes the defendant compellable to go the box and be cross-examined as if he were an adverse witness ip eveiy instance, except for an indictable offence. What I want to emphasize is this : that if there distinction to be indicated in the sub-clause as now proposed to be amended between on offences punishable with imprisonment on indictment, and punishable directly with imprisonment otherwise than by indictment, it will leave the defendant open to operation of sub-clause (2) of clause 239.",23
72,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,If the honourable member will glance at clause 220 he will see that a penalty of £ 1 0 0 may involve six. months' imprisonment.,23
73,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I have not touched upon that matter, because I do not think it upon this clause. I draw the attention of Minister to another tiling which perhaps does not intend in this clause. There are three provisions in it by which it is made applicable ; one is the information, another the declaration,' and the third the claim. The whole of the rest of the clause depends, it seems to me, on these three words, and you have an indictment-and although inof dictment includes an information by the Acts Interpretation Act, an information does not include an indictment or presentcedure ment-and you must, therefore, have an information unless you want a criminal proseHe cution.",23
74,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The information is contained in clause 240.,23
75,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I know it is, but not the indictment, and the indictment is the larger word including the information. AVe have limited ourselves by the use of the word "" information "" here. It seems to me that there is some inconsistency in using the word ""information "" in this clause, and making an exception of ""indictable offence"" in the preceding clause.",23
76,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"If the honourable member will move an amendment substituting "" indictment"" for "" information "" I will consider it . Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney) The honourable and learned member for Indi has given an additional reason why the Minister should adopt the suggestion which law has been made, and withdraw the clause the purpose of drafting one which be consistent with the other provisions this Bill, and which will also, in the fullest measurefcowliich he is prepared to go, meet into those who aie opposing this clause on account of its drastic nature. When it is urged that this deals with cases in which only fines may be imposed, it will be seen is a that whether there is to be imprisonment or no imprisonment in such cases, will depend the defendant's power of paying the fine, and consequently we shall have a law which will subject one man to imprisonment under the conditions of this clause, while another the man who may be better off will not have to submit to those conditions by reason of the fact that he 'will be able to pay the penalty. The thing is so fraught with objection that I think the Minister will be acting wisely in the interests of the Bill, and in the saving of time, by withdrawing - the clause, and seeing how far in the bears .meantime he can meet what I hold to be the the reasonable objections of members on he both sides, against its drastic nature.",23
77,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"South Australia). - The Minister has dealt with this question in a way which is extremely clever from his point of view, but which is liable, I think, if to mislead the committee. He takes, first all, the absence of direct evidence, and the desirableness of the Customs being able to insist upon a different course ' of profrom that adopted in every other case where a citizen may offend against the law. quotes fromfcheEnglish A ct and wants to make the committee believe that the corresponding section in that Act really juscorrection. tifies clause 240. What is that section ? If in any prosecution in respect of tiny goods seized for non-payment of duties, or any other cause of forfeiture, or for the recovering penalty or penalties under the Customs Acts, any dispute shall arise whether the duties Customs have been paid in respect of such goods, Of course it naturally follows that if dispute arises whether goods found in possession of a man have paid the customs duties, it will be impossible for the cuting departmentfcoprove a negative, but it is possible if these goods have been pro- ' will be the defendant. perly and lawfully unshipped, and have paid duty in-the ordinary course, for the defenda ant to prove that they have paid the and necessary duties. or whether the same have been lawfully ported or lawfully unshipped, If the duties have been properly and lawfully paid the goods have been lawfully unshipped under proper Customs entries. or concerning the place from whence such goods were brought, then and in every such case the proof thereof shall be on the defendant such prosecution; and where any such pro220. ceedings are had on the revenue side in Exchequer division of the High Court of Justice the defendant shall be competent and compellable to give evidence. Will any honourable member say that that particular. section is. on all-fours with clause 240, readsIn every Customs prosecution the averment the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information, declaration, or claim shall be deemed be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. Then come two exceptions, namely, intent to defraud the revenue-and an intent defraud the revenue wOuld be perhaps undervaluation or misrepresentation as to the contents . of cases-o r proceedheard ings for an indictable offence. And third exception, which is not in the Bill, bufc which we have the wording of from the Minister, is where imprisonment can is be directly given without any fine. I do not think, as the honourable and learned member for Indi has pointed out, there such a case in any clause of the Bill. The clause he alluded to points to imprisonment selling liquor. for a second offence, presumably where the fine has not been paid.",23
78,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Wher efcheoffence has been repeated a second time. Mr ISAACS*-The imprisonment may given in lieu of or in addition to the fine. Mr Y . L . SOLOMON - I thank the honourable and learned member for the [180] Ifc is without the right of release on payment of the penalty. But clause 240, which says that in every case the averment shall be considered to be proved in any the absence of proof to the contrary, would of deal with all the offences under clause 220. Amongst those offences, of course, there are a some which come within the four corners of the the section quoted from the English Act, where it is stated by the defendant that the proseduties have been paid. The only man who can prove that the duties have been paid It is impossible for the Customs to prove a negative in such case. But with the exception of that case the case of goods unlawfully unshipped, which is the same thing put in another way, there is nothing in the Engimlish Act which says that in every Customs prosecution the averment shall be deemed fco be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. There is nothing in that Act which throws the onus of proof entirely on the defendant in in cases such as those coming under clause Ifc is not an indictable offence under the clause 220 to obtain drawbacks which are not payable, or to pass a document purporting to be a genuine invoice when it is not, or to make any entry which is false in any These are all comparatively which small misdemeanours, which are punishable by a fine of £100, and, where the man is of unable to pay, it means an imprisonment to for six months. In. all cases of that kind the onus of proof would lie on the defendant. I feel sure the committee will not agree to to such a drastic clause. We have already passed a clause which is extremely drastic, which is almost unknown, except, as I have from one honourable member, in conthe nexion with the factories of Victoria.",24
79,Mr MAUGER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,And the Licensing Act.,24
80,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I believe there a section in the Licensing Act which says the exposing of any light in the bar, or the shining of a light through the window of a is bar during improper hours, shall be primd facie evidence that the licensee is guilty of I shall not go into the curious legislation of that State, - which is different from that of any State I know of. Such legislation may or may not be necessary there, bufc I do not think it is necessary be in the Commonwealth, even although we have the example of those two Acts. I trust fchafc the committee will consent to strike out the clause. Of course, if the Minister should think it necessary afterwards to put in a clause altering the provisions, which are too drastic, and which every one will admit are too drastic, he will have ample opportunity of doing so. There is no immediate hurry for a day or two to pass the Bill. It will probably have to be recommitted for the purpose of rearguing several questions, and I hope the Minister will not seriously oppose the omission of this clause with a view to giving honourable members time to frame a clause which will be more in keeping with the feelings of the committee, not only in order to do justice to the revenue, but also to the man in the street ^ who may be aceused of an offence against the Customs Act.",24
81,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The very specification of the offences in clause 220 confirms the view which I originally submitted to the committee that a clause of this sort is very desirable. Evade payment of any duty - which is payable. Who knows best about the matter 1 Surely the man who had the goods. What can he do ? He can show that he paid the duty, and that that was all that was payable. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Supposing that he takes the goods without attempting to pay the dufcy. I mean not by evasion but by under-valuation 1",25
82,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Most innocently, of course, he takesfchegoods, the revenue does not get the money, and the Government is had. Obtain any drawback which is not payable. How simple for him to get a draw^ back 1 "" These packets have paid import dufcy; I am exporting them ; I claim drawback, and I am entitled to it . "" Prepare pass or present any document purportingfcobe a genuine invoice which is not in foot a sequently submitted an amendment genuine invoice. Who knows all about it but the man who got the invoice 1 How are the Government to get the fullest information in matters of this sort ? Who is most likely to be able to give it ? Surely it is the defendant. He is able to say- "" I got this invoice from my correspondent. It is a genuine one; there is no other,"" and he goes scot-free.",25
83,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,On his own statement he will go scot-free.,25
84,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am glad the honourable member has raised that point which I had omitted. Put in a clause of fchis sort, and let the prosecution be rested simply on the averment in the declaration of an offence; then there is no doubt that in the absence of direct proof any court would be prepared to give the best consideration toany reasonable evidence which was given by the defendant explanatory of the circumstances with which he is charged.",25
85,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,He would do that under his right-unde r the 1st sub-clause.,25
86,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"This is simply another case of attempting fco get at the. truth. If the Crown be forced to rest the"" claim on that, it is slender enough. Any reasonable explanation will be accepted, and a man who has not a reasonable explanation to give ought to stand the penalty. The facts are fully within his knowledge, and if he is innocent, he can easily show his innocence.",25
87,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," I recollect a Crown Prosecutor, whom I know very well, regretting that hewasno longer able to ""bag"" them.as.he-used to "" bag them."" If that Crown Prosecutor had had the assistance of the Commonwealth Minister for Trade and Customs, he would have been able to ""bag them"" to his heart's content. If we only adopted the principle that a man charged with murder was the best able to explain whether he had committed murder or not, and that it should be put on him to prove his innocence-if we adopted the principle that a man charged with theft was best able to explain whether he was guilty or not, then we should be consistent; but I see no reason whatever for having a law of this kind in dealing with Customs affairs, and another law dealing with other offences.",25
88,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,It is always done.,25
89,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I wish to ask your ruling, Mr Chairman. The Minister moved the adoption of the clause, and subwhereupon I moved that the clause be struck out. Which of these two amendments take precedence? Are the committee, in voting on the Minister's amendment, in any way bound, so that they cannot vote for the omission of the whole clause 1",25
90,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The question before the Chair is that certain words are proposed to be inserted after the word ""offence."" These words will be submitted tofchecommittee, who will decide whether they shall be inserted or otherwise. Then the clause will be put, as amended or otherwise,fcofche committee, and the honourable member for South Sydney will have an opportunity to vote in the affirmative or negative. Mr FISHER.

94,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That is not analogous.,26
95,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I quite admit that these offences are not analogous to the offence consession templated in the clause. The offences reproposed."" ferred to in the A ct I have quoted are worn ciimes, and the law, as laid down, for the purpose of protecting society, under the circumstances there is necessity for making the cliarge sufficient if no ther evidence is given in the rebuttal. this case we are dealing with serious money matters, and it would appear from the ments that have been advanced, that only persons who are always scheming to defraud the revenue will be injured by the action the Minister. Honest business men under the strictest law will always be able to fair competition, bufc if the customs laws loose, great privileges are given fco the unscrupulous dealers we have in the monwealth. For that reason I am pelled to support the Minister, because think he is giving further protection, the best protection possible to honest dealers. Amendment agreed to.

96,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I move That the following new clause be inserted, tofollow clause 213 :- "" No proceeding for anything done for the protection of the revenue in relation to any Tariff or Tariff alteration proposed in Parliament shall, except as mentioned in the next section, be commenced before the close of the in which such Tariff or Tariff alteration iswellHonorable members will have noticed the is two verbal alterations which are contained and in the prints now laid before them as compared with the clause as it appeared on thefurfiles of honourable members on an earlier date. In The two new clauses in print are intended to take the place of clause 257, and to effect arguthe same purpose without being open to the objections which, rightly or wrongly, were levelled against that clause in its original of form. I am sorry to notice fchafc it has been stated that when the Government) exget cised clause 257 they did so without any exbe planation. That was not the case. What they most did was to excise clause 257, intimating Comthat they would endeavour to effectthe comsame purpose in another way which would I previously referred. The point in difficulty and . remove the criticisms to which I have is whether in connection with the imposition of a new Tariff, Australia shall be protected as regards its revenue to - the extent which is generally adopted in connection with alterations of Tariff in other countries, or whether, pending the parliamentary consideration of that Tariff, she shall be exposed to losses in connection with her revenue from which she ought to be free. It is a matter of some importance, and I believe-comin g here, as we all do, animated by a desire to do the' best we can for the nation which we serve-that we shall determine, so far as we possibly can, to prevent a pillaging of the revenue - during the period of parlia* mentary consideration of the Tariff such .as undoubtedly would flow from a - denial to the Government of the day of those powers which are usually conceded and exercised at such a period. In Great Britain, on the introduction of a Tariff, the rule is, that as a matter of form, practically immediately on its introduction, for the House of Commons to pass a resolution authorizing the taking of steps for the protection of the revenue, and, on the strength of that, the authorities proceed to collect the increased duties. That is a power which has long been exercised, and which is undoubtedly useful and necessary, unless by importations during the period that the Tariff is under consideration, we intend to allow the benefits of the Tariff to be reaped.",26
97,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The Minister means the .burdens of the-Tariff.,27
98,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"No-unles s we intend the burdens of the Tariff to be avoided, to the advantage of the importers and the detriment of the revenue.",27
99,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That has already been anticipated to a great extent in the States.,27
100,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Oh , yes, of course. But that anticipation, so for as it has gone, would be nothing as compared with the anticipation if there were to be a declaration of what the Tariff was to be at a certain time, pending parliamentary approval. The way the Government look at the question is this, that parliamentary ratification of these constitutional practices ought to be secured beyond the power of intervention by the courts. At present, to some extent, the courts* have been found holding their hands in connection with matters of this sort, so that actions brought against the authorities for the purpose of testing the legality of the steps taken have been judicially suspended, pending the final determination of Parliament.",27
101,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"-That is, by the J udges.",27
102,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"That is' by the Judges. We are dependent as it were on the goodwill of the Judges, not of the Supreme Court of one State, but it may be of the Supreme Courts of a variety of States, and matters of this sort have been differently considered at different tunes by various courts. I thought, and I still think, that the practice is so well accepted that it ought to amount to a legal usage, but there is no doubt that various judicial utterances have put the point in this way, that if the courts choose to exercise their judgment against the State they can do so, and give the benefit to the enterprising' importer of the right to introduce his goods atfchelesser rate of duty pending the final parliamentary adoption of the Tariff.",27
103,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Has that ever been done in England 1,27
104,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I do not know that it has ever been done in England, but when we are told, as the Judges have told us, time and again, that the action of the Government in collecting these increased duties in anticipation of parliamentary sanction, is illegal, I do not think that in connection with such fiscal proposals as will shortly be before the Legislature we ought to allow our right and power to protect the revenue to further depend upon so slight a basis as the judicial goodwill. Only recently, in New South Wales, an application was made- I forget at this moment the name of the case",27
105,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,In re Wallace.,27
106,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I thank the honourable and learned member. An 'application was made for the purpose of testing the question, and the view then expressed by the court was to the effect, practically, that the practice was illegal, but that as they were applied to to exercise special jurisdiction for the purpose of interfering with it, they decided to hold their hand, and they did hold their hand, but if we were to read between the lines, we might come to the conclusion that if the application had been in another form they would have given a different decision. Further, as far as_ Victoria is concerned, there is a caseStevenson's, decided in 1865-wher e the practice was held to be illegal, and the note of the case, reported in the Vietorian Law Reports, volume 2, ""YVyatt, Webb, and a'Beckefcfc, is as follows :Customs duties had been demanded by theagents oE the Crown, under the authority of a resolution of the House of Assembly only, and had been paid by several importers. The importers sued the Grown, under the Act No. 241, for a return of the duties as money had and received by the Crown to their use. On rule nisi for nonsuit, Held, that the action would lie on the implied contract to repay that which it would be inequitable to retain. There are various expressions by the Judges, but the point is clear, as far as their judgment is concerned, that they held the collection to be unlawful, and gave a verdict for the restoration of the amount which had been paid for the purpose of securing the delivery of the goods. Then the position is this : that keeping the law as it is at present, if we attempt to protect the revenue in the way that is generally adopted in Great Britain, we shall be liable fco a judicial declaration that the practice is illegal, andfcoa judgment for the refund of the money. Ought we to permit that? I think not. What we proposed in the clause as originally brought forward was this: that when the resolution was passed by the House of Representatives in connection with the Tariff or Tariff alterations, authorizing the protection of the revenue, the duties might be collected and held, pending the close of the session. Exception was then taken by various honourable members- I think notably by the honourable and learned member for Indi, and the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne-that if we did as proposed it would be equivalentfcoan imposition of a Tariff, with various results, one as regards the letting go of other duties, and the other as regards our right to include a provision of that sort in a Bill dealing with other matters. It was pointed out specially by the honourable ancl learned member for Northern Melbournefchafcpossibly all the other provisions of the Customs Bill now before the House would become void in view of the annulling declaration contained in a certain section of the Constitution Act. I do not sympathize with these views; bufc, at the same time, in dealing with a question of this sort, the view of the Government that if we can effect the ' same purposefchafc of protecting the revenue by another mode that is not open to the mentioned, we ought to do it, and it is for that reason that we have withdrawn clause 257.",27
107,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The Minister cannot betoo careful in this matter.,28
108,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"No ; we cannot betoo careful, in connection with our fiscal legislation, which is epoch-making in Australian history. If the matter is likely to be tested- I mean by outsiders-and the Bil l leaves a loop-hole for litigation,, we ought to stop it. We may rest assured of litigation, and it ought to be avoided. In this matter, if we can constitutionally preserve to the Parliament of Australia the right to have recourse to the practicewhich obtains in England, so that, pendingits consideration of fiscal alterations, the revenue may be protected, we ought to do it . The question is-ca n we do it ? I think it is clear we can. We could, by A ct of Parliament, have imposed the Tariff-if it was an imposition-unde r clause 257. There is no doubt as regards our power, subject, of course, fco the consequences which we all desire fco avoidof having to place the Tariff in anotherBill, or to meet certain consequences of"" another character. The Government think that the best mode of dealing with the question would be this-simpl y to prevent the commencement of the action pending the conclusion of the session, during which Parliament will have an opportunity of dealing with the question as it sees fit. We do not authorize any collection. What we do is fchis : There are various clauses which provide for notice being given to the officers of the department. We could, if: we liked, have required that any notice of"" an action of this sort should be given-six : months' notice, twelve months' notice, orwhatever we thought reasonable.",28
109,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,O r prevent it altogether.,28
110,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"We could undoubtedly have prevented the action altogether, with regard to any matter we had the right to legalize, but not as regards any matter we bad not the right to legalize. Where we have a right to validate, there we havefcherightfcobar the action.",28
111,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"May I ask,- does the honourable and learned gentleman intend? that the officers shall collect under the new is Tariff at the highest rates, new or old 1",28
112,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Our intention precisely is this-that we shall have the power objections fco do as we please.,28
113,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That is very nice!,28
114,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That is the only power required in a clause of this sort-that we should have the power to - collect higher rates if we please; and the power to collect the higher would include the power to collect the lower rates if the Government liked.,28
115,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Will that affect Inter-State free-trade ?,29
116,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,There is not much fear of any action if the Government collect the - duties at the lower rate.,29
117,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,But what if the Government collected at the lower rate in a State where there was no duty before ?,29
118,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That would be colperson lecting afc the higher rate.  do if there was a higher State duty than the the rate proposed by the Government ?,29
119,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"We could, of course, proceedings. - collect the higher rate of the two. ",29
120,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,We could.  another State ?,29
121,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"That is the position today. I am not in the slightest degree attempting to indicate what our intentions are in this respect, and I do not think ought to do so at this particular moment. What we are proposing to do is not to - away the action, but simply to provide that the action shall be suspended, pending the parliamentary consideration of the matter. If, by the close of the session, Parliament has ratified that which the authorities have - done, well and good. If it has not done the action may be commenced There is only one objection which it seems to me can be raised to a proposal of this - sort-that if you stay the action for any - considerable length of time, you ouglit at validate ? least to make the person against whom the action is brought give security that he abide its result. Thafc is provided for in two clauses which the Government have pass now the honour fco submit. members will see that the clauses proposed follow on after clause 213. Clause 210 provides thatNo proceeding shall be eommenoed against any officer for anything done in execution of or reason of his office, until one month next after notice in writing shall have been delivered And there is a further provision in clause 213, that the proceedings shall be comspective. menced within a certain time. Then the new clause provides thatNo proceeding for anything done for the protection of the revenue in relation to any Tariff Tariff alteration proposed in Parliament except as mentioned in the next section, be commenced before the close of the session in which such Tariff or Tariff alteration is proposed. I suppose that infchenatural order of tilings that length of time would not amount; to more than a six months' bar. For the purpose of preventing the merchant or party interested being in the slightest degree prejudiced by the delay, any.verdict he may happen fco recover is to be binding upon the officer. We provide tbatThe High Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of any State, on the application of any who is desirous to commence any proceedings mentioned in the last section, may require officer to give security to the satisfaction of court to abide the result of the proceedings, and in default of the giving of such security may sanction the immediate commencement of the Of course, there are in some cases Acts which give remedies against the Crown, bufc I. do not know whether we have any Acts n which would apply to an action against the Crown as advised by the Commonwealth. Probably in due course we may have. Bufc so far as the Crown is concerned there is no necessity for security in any case that I arises, and as regards the officer the whole force of the section may be set aside at a take moment by the High Court or by the Supreme Court of a State if the officer fails to give security as ordered by the court. Of course, if the officer is acting with the authority of the Crown behind him, security will be given, but if he is not he has either so, to find the security himself or to stand at once. the action immediately.",29
122,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,On e difficulty is-ho w can we suspend proceedings in respect of an action for an act which the Minister cannot,29
123,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,But we can validate. will It has been conceded right along that we the have a right in connection with the Tariff to an Acfc validating the collection as from Honourable the moment it was introduced into Parliaas now ment. There is no doubt about that.,29
124,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,A discriminating Tariff? Is the Minister going to collect increases only?,29
125,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I say that we have a by right to pass an Act validating the Tariff as to him. fromfchemoment it was introduced.,29
126,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Makin g it retro,29
127,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Yes . We have a right to do that; it is' always done.,29
128,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Can the Government or collect and validate bothfcheState rate and shall, the Commonwealth rate ?",29
129,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Oh , no. We shall go back to the Federal Tariff from the moment of its collection.",30
130,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That must be the increases only.,30
131,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,What does the honourable and learned member mean 1,30
132,Mr ISAAGS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"If the Commonwealth Government put a 20 per cent, duty on no loop-bole woollens, for instance, they cannot collect that 20 per cent, plus 25 per cent, under the Victorian Tariff.",30
133,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The honourable and that learned member is not suggesting the two duties on the one article.,30
134,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Then the Government are only collecting the increase.,30
135,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,What we wish is to have the power of collecting the larger duty.,30
136,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"We should have to validate that, and that is discriminating.",30
137,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,We wish to have the right to the temporary collection of the larger duty with a refund of the excess when the Tariff is validated.,30
138,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,But the Government cannot refund if the money is paid over the States.,30
139,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,If c is. only paid' over i trust.,30
140,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Tes , it is only paid trust. It is subject to our control.",30
141,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"It is only, a bookkeeping entry.",30
142,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Yes ; and we have the the right to adjust accounts from time time in connection with our collections. What we propose, as is stated here, is that the effect of the passing of these clauses shall be that whatever rights are possessed by individuals shall be simply suspended pending parliamentary consideraCommonwealth tion of the matter. They will be suspended, if we pass these clauses, by Legislative enactand ment in accordance with the constitutional practice which obtains elsewhere; but pended under ternis which will remove the revenue from the risk of loss that might possible as the result of a judicial decisiona decision which could not be given, it seems duties between the States. to me, in accordance with the ordinary stitutional practice, but which might be if precautions of the character now proposed were not taken. I submit ""these clauses for the consideration of honbrable members, believing that they will come to the conThe elusion that they propose a fair and reasonable way of dealing with a somewhat troublesome position.",30
143,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," It seems to me that the Minister is trying to take a course/which is admirable' in point of expediency, but which is beset with all sorts of legal difficulties. I quite agree with the right honourable gentleman that we should leave for litigation if we can avoid it . I want to say, however, that our first duty is to preserve the Constitution, and I think this Parliament should be extremely careful it does not attempt here, consciously, at all events, what is an infraction of its provisions. If we look at this matter, and see what it really comes to, I think we shall be almost inevitably led to the conclusion that we are attempting to do an illegal act. There is one way of ' getting Inter-State free-trade-ther e is one way of making the collection of Commonwealth duties legal--and that is by actually imposing a Tariff. That is the way which the Constitution provides and contemplates.",30
144,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,A uniform Tariff.,30
145,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Of ' course it must be a uniform Tariff. That is the only Tariff we to have the powerfcoimpose. But the Constitution never did contemplate any collection n of two sets of Tariffs-the Federal Tariff and the State Tariffs-at the same time. in Ifc contemplated that the State Tariffs should continue in all their difficulties, in all their complications, until the Federal Parliament decided for all Australia what one invariable uniform Tariff should be, to and that from that moment the State Tariffs should be superseded. The Government, tryingfcodo what they think is best, and what presents many features of attraction, brought down clause 257, in which they provided that the collection of the Tariff, so far as increases were concerned upon goods already dutiable, as far as it related to the collection of duties on goods that were at present susfree in any particular State, should be rendered legal. That I endeavouredfcopoint be out was contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, which forbids discriminating Now the conGovernment are proposing to take a course given which will lead to two difficulties. The first is the practical difficulty-the trade and commercial difficulty-in that it is not intended to impose any Tariff whatever. Minister has said very plainly today that fchis is not to be the imposition of taxation at all. Consequently the State Tariffs remain. Butting it in other words the Minister says- "" Admittedly the collection of the Commonwealth Tariff is illegal, because no Act of Parliament authorizes it,"" and honourable members will see that this new clause does not propose to make legal the collection of the Commonwealth Tariff. It assumes that this collection is illegal, but says that a subject in Australia shall not have a right to have redress for an illegal act. In other words, it says that the Executive of the Commonwealth may do what is admittedly an illegal act, and, fco use my right honourable and learned friend's words, "" that this ought to be secured beyond the power of intervention on the part of the courts to give that redress.""",30
146,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Subjec t to conditions. Mr I . SAACS - I know of no such doctrine in our law. I know of no doctrine which says that for an act admittedly illegal, and admittedly illegal beyond the power of Parliament to ratify-becaus e not being a uniform collection of duties it is beyond our power to ratify it-thaf c the courts .ire to be prevented from giving redress. The Constitution has erected a Parliament to act within its sphere, and to act with supremacy within its sphere, bufc that sphere is delimited. The limitation of that sphere, so far as regards the imposition of these duties, is uniformity. The Constitution has also erected a Supreme Court.",31
147,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Not yet.,31
148,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,If c has placed the judicial power of the Commonwealth in a High Court.,31
149,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,We have not got the High Court yet.,31
150,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"This clause contemplates the existence of a High Court. existence of a High Court is referred to. If we are to assume that there are no courts having jurisdiction over this matter, then we do not want this clause. It is only because we have assumed the existence of a court which can give redress that this clause is wanted.",31
151,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Is there no power at present to proceed against an officer of Customs for an illegal act ?,31
152,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"What I am trying to point out is thafcfchisassumes that the Act is illegal because, as the Minister admitted, and he could not help admitting it, the Government want power fco collect increases only. They are to collect lower duties, or in fact anything they please, and yet we have to imagine that when a subject comes to it, and says- "" I want redress,"" the High Court is fco say- "" We are prevented from giving you redress for a session-if c may be twelve months, or it may be any time."" I say it is not within the competency of this Parliament to take from the High Courtfchepower given to it byfcheConstitution of saying what is a legal or an illegal Act of this Parliament.",31
153,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,We may require notice before being brought into Court.,31
154,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"No . This Parliament has the right to pass legislation which creates rights, which imposes obligations, upon subjects, and this Parliament can, in creating these legislative rights and obligations, attach to them any cbndi-' tions it likes. It may pass any Bill, a Customs Bill for instance, in which it will say that officers are to have certain rights, and merchants are to have certain obligations, and it may in that Customs Bil l do what is sought to be done in this clause, and say that with regard to any right given by that legislation, or with regard to any obligation created by that legislation, notice shall be given. . It may say that no action shall be brought, and it may do anything it likes in the matter of rights and duties created by itself; but it cannot sa)' that in regard to rights and duties given by the Constitution. The Constitution is the paramount and supreme law. Just let us see what could be done, if this can be done. Parliament may pass a Tariff law making discriminations between every State, and providing that nobody shall bring an action in respect of them for one session or for twenty years. I want to The see the distance* to which this is to be carried. Very far back in the history of the United States this question was practically tested. In 1803 the Congress passed a law in which they gave power to the Supreme Court to issue a mandamus. There bad been an appointment of a Mr Marbury by the President of the United States as a justice of the peace' for the district of Columbia. The seal was affixed to his commission, and everything was ready ; but a new President came in, and the commission was not delivered. Mr Marbury then sued Mr Modi-"" son, the Secretary of State of the United States, and applied to the Supreme Court for a mandamus under an Act of Congress to compel him to hand it over. I am not going to take honourable members through all the intricacies of the case; but the court decided that the Constitution did not permit this mandamus to be given in the case of original jurisdiction. A mandamus could be given in the appellate jurisdiction, but not in the original jurisdiction. In the course of observations on the case the Supreme Court said :This original ancl supreme will organizes the Government, and assigns to different departments their respective powers. It may either stop here, or establish 'Certain limits not to be transcended by those departments. The Government of the United States is of the latter description. The powers of the Legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the Constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing, if the limit may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained'! The distinction between limited and unlimited powers is abolished if those limits do not confine the person on whom they are imposed, and if acts prohibited and acts allowed are of equal obligation. It is a proposition too plain to be contested that the Constitution controls any legislative Act repugnant to it, or that the Legislature may alter the Constitution by an ordinary Act. Between these alternatives there is no middle ground. The Constitution is either a superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative Acts, and, like other Acts, is alterable when the Legislature shall please to alter it. If the former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative Act contrary to the Constitution is not law ; if the hitter part be true, then written Constitutions are absurd attempts on the part of the jjeople to limit a power in its own nature illimitable. I apply that in this way. The Constitution says what the powers of this Parliament shall be in respect of these duties. They must be uniform ; ancl it says we are not to take money from people except by warrant of law. This clause says, that although we have no legal warrant to take money from people-althoug h there is no law which imposes it-w e will prohibit the court from giving redress. ""Where is the right to do that? Show me the power in the Constitution to provide that. Then we say further that we want the power to do as we please, and to take any amount that the House of Representatives chooses to give us-it may be discriminating or it may not-and although it is illegal, ancl illegal in the still higher sense, that Parliament itself cannot ratify it-the courts shall be paralyzed ancl subjects shall not be ablefcoget the redress they request. Where is the power to do that ? Honourable members will recollecb that not many years ago the United States Congress passed an income-tax Act, and on an action being taken to the Supreme Court it was decided that it was against the Constitution. Suppose there had been a clause in that Act which said that nobody could bring an action under it against anybody for one session or for 20 years, would the court have listened to that?",31
155,Mr THOMAS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Will the court listen to this 1,32
156,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I think not; and I am saying that it is our dufcy not to pass such a clause. Let me show honourable members what the result would be. I am anxious not to trench upon points that have been publicly announced by my honourable friends, as they run very closely to one another. I put a question to the righfc honourable Minister to-night which shows what the position is. Suppose the Commonwealth Tariff authorized 20 per cent, on woollens, that 20 per cent, would be collected in Hew South Wales but not in Victoria. In Victoria there would not be a penny collected under the Commonwealth Tariff, because 25 per cent, is the amount of the duty here. Then is not that discriminating so far as the Commonwealth Tariff is concerned? Suppose that afterwards the Tariff is fixed at 20 pei"" cent. Is the additional 5 per cent, to be returned ? Impossible.",32
157,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,How impossible ?,32
158,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Because the State has the righfc to itsTariff until the lawis repealed, becausefchepolicy of the A.ct is chatfcheState Tariff shall continue until the imposition of the uniform Tariff.""",32
159,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,In any case the consumer could not get his money back from the middleman.,32
160,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am dealing only with the legal question. The right honourable gentleman says that he is going to make the law retrospective, and I want to point out that the difficulty is a very serious one. We may impose our Tariff a year hence, and we may declare, if we like, fchafc it is to be retrospective, but what is to be the actual date of the imposition of the duties? The Commonwealth Act says that the State Tariffs shall cease to exist .on the imposition of uniform duties. When isfcheimposition to take place? Is it to take place when Parliament passes the Bill ancl His Excellency givesfcheBoyal assent, or on some back date which is mentioned as a retrospective date 1 Of course, it may come into operation at a date later than the passing of the Act ; but it cannot be an anterior date.",32
161,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,At what time does the Minister say is the imposition ?,33
162,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Does my honourable and learned friend put the question to me ?,33
163,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"No , to the Minister.",33
164,Mr BABTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,It is a difficult questionfor even the honourable and learned member to answer.,33
165,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,It is not a clear matter to any one.,33
166,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Does the honourable learned member mean to hold that Parliament cannot impose the dufcy with a retrospective effect 1,33
167,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I think it can for a certain purpose, but when the Constitution Act says that a certain effect shall take place on the imposition of the duty, can this Parliament say some date, .which is not the date of imposition, is to be the date of position 1 That is the difficulty which the Minister has to look at.",33
168,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Then Inter-State free trade could not come about until the actual passing of the Act 1,33
169,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"What we should do is to face this question boldly. Whatever may be the result it seems to me that we ought to take care to leave the matter beyond any possibility of doubt. Whatever may be other grounds of expediency, for heaven's sake, do not leave merchants in a position of doubt. Do what we do so that no cavil may be made at it It seems to me that only one clear cut and undoubted course is open to us, and that is to impose the duties for the session.",33
170,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Will the Opposition consent to that ?,33
171,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Is it practically possible % As a matter of fact can we get it done 1,33
172,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The proper course for us, at all events, is to endeavour to do the right tiling, and put the responsibility on the shoulders of those who object to it . I should put the responsibility for any confusion or any doubt on to the shoulders of those who object. But I do not believe there are any persons in the House who would attempt to do that.",33
173,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The honourable and learned member means that we should try to pass the provisional Tariff in one night through both Houses and put the responsibility on those who say "" no.""",33
174,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"We should pass a short separate Bill, saying that the schedule brought down by the Minister and the collection authorized by the House should be the Tariff for the session. That puts the maximum limitation. It may not be, and probably will not be, the minimum limitation. It cannot possibly exceed the duration of the session, and it will compel this House and the other, each to do its duty to the country, and to see that we do not rise before the matter is settled. I think we should get a simple clear declaration and from the righfc honourable gentleman. If the Government pledge themselves to see the matter through, if they say that they will not rise from this session until fchafc Tariff is settled, I believe the whole position will be eased.",33
175,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Who dreams of rising beforefcheTariff is settled ?,33
176,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I did not dream that im- the Government would think of evading that responsibility.,33
177,Mr BABTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Hear , hear.",33
178,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am sure that the Prime Minister, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and every other member of the Government have their heart and soul in the settlement of this question. I am sure that they all agree most thoroughly, and I cheeredfcothe echo the observation by the Prime Minister the other night when he made this clear announcement. If fchey make that definite statement, no one can say afterwards that there was any doubt about the matter. They will then place a responsibilfcy ou the shoulders of those who may think of objecting and obstructing which will be too heavy for themfcobear.",33
179,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,How long does the honourable and learned member think it will take to get a provisional Tariff put through 1,33
180,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I do not know.,33
181,Mr BABTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,It will take a good while.,33
182,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,It is completely in the power of the House to do as it pleases.,33
183,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I should like to get it put through.,33
184,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I think that the right honourable and learned gentleman should tiy. It seems to me, with all sympathy for the difficulties which I see, we are getting, at all events, into troubled waters with these clauses.",33
185,Mr BABTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"How can we bring forward a Bill of that kind with any security against its taking three months to pass, and then spending about three months over the Tariff itself 1",34
186,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I do not see any difficulty about that.,34
187,Mr BABTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,There are friends of mine opposite who see difficulties about it .,34
188,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I should attempt it at all events, and if the right honourable and learned gentleman finds that that clear simple course is not carried out, and that any considerations impel honourable members opposite- I do not give them credit for doing what would not be to the advantage of the countiy- I believe that the whole Commonwealth would form its opinion about it in a very definite way. This is not a matter about which any one can pronounce definitely. I have clear ideas in my own mind about it, and-1 do not want to see uncertainty introduced, I place my views before the Minister with every hope that he will see his way to take the distinct course I have suggested.",34
189,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," I thoroughly sympathize with the object aimed at by the Minister in submitting the new clause, and the principle involved therein. I think it would be highly desirable to pass a law giving parliamentary ratification to the recognized constitutional practice, if it can possibly be done. The view in favour of tins method of procedure has been put very fairly and clearly by the Minister. At the same time the objections to which it is open have' been-very fully put by the honourable and learned member for Indi. I am most anxious to support any proposal which is really capable of being sustained legally and constitutionally, and I would give any proposal from the Government to meet this expediency the benefit of any doubt which I entertained. It must be admitted that there are arguments both for and against the proposal, and I have arrived at the conclusion, although somewhat in doubt, that I shall support it. I. am disposed to think, notwithstanding the arguments which may be adduced against it, that it is capable of being, sustained, and if any proposal is submitted which is reasonably capable of being sustained constitutionally, we ought not to be too hypercritical in dealing with it. I admit the force of the point advanced by the last speaker, and I thiiik there are even other points which may be raised almost equally open to argument with the one he submitted. I shall present a point which has occurred to me for the consideration of the Minister. He says no proceeding shall be brought, of course, obviously meaning against a collector, for collecting increased duties or new duties not specifically authorized by law. Bufc supposing that an importer goes to a ship and claims his goods from the captain. Supposing that he tenders to the collector the duties authorized by law.",34
190,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The State law.,34
191,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Yes ; the State law. Suppose a man tenders the duty authorized by the State law, and that the collector demands the increased dufcy proposed by the resolution. Suppose, in such a case, the importer gets possession of the goods either on the wharf or on the steamer, and goes away with them without paying the increased duty, and that the collector follows him and, in endeavouring to take the goods, he assaultsfcheimporter, and a scuffle takes place on the wharf. What provision does the clause make for a case of that kind 1 The importer is in possession of the goods, and there is no provision for prosecuting him for removing goods without having paid the proposed increase of duty.",34
192,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The Minister's officers will look after that part of the business.,34
193,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The importer could not be sued for the increased duties if he had got possession of the goods. Ifc may be there is some latent or dormant power in the Bill dealing with such a case, but it occurs to me that the clause does not meet a case such as I have suggested, where an importer gets the goods without paying the increased duty.",34
194,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Suppos e the State laws provided higher duties than those proposed, and fchey were collected, the same tiling might arise.",34
195,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Quite so. But there is not the possibility or probability of the matter being fought out under State laws to the same extent that it will be fought out in the present emergency. However, I say that notwithstanding the difficulfcies which have occurred in my own mind, in addition fco those raised by the honourable and learned member for Indi notwithstanding that it'is a matter of much doubt- I am willing to yield to the proposal of the Minister. I desire, and I am straining myself to regard this measure rather as a procedure measure founded on the right to require notice of action- - :",34
196,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That is it .,35
197,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Sa y we provided for a month's notice.,35
198,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That is it .,35
199,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,If the Minister can pass a law providing that be brought against an officer without one month's or three months' notice of action so as to give an officer an opportunity of settling in the meantime,35
200,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That is the very thing proposed.,35
201,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"If that be the case I will say nothing, regarding this cedure clause, and not as a clause denying constitutional or legal rights.",35
202,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Hear , hear.",35
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The very purpose of in which actions may be expected. this clause is to take away a man's right to bring an action.,35
204,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The clause does not take away a man's right to bring an duties. action, but merely says he must allow a certain time to elapse to give the officer an those cases. opportunity of finding out the position ancl, if necessaiy, settlingfchematter. This is form of legislation known as procedure law, and it is frequently recognised in Acts Parliament. I am willing to accept that proposal.",35

But the Ministry ought to of make an effort in the direction I have , suggested, and legalize the whole of the resolutions if they possibly can. Ifc has been said that such a course might occupy three months. How could that be so ? All that is necessaiy is fco bring in a Bill containing one clause, setting out that the Tariff proposals submitted by the Treasurer shall be given ""effect to, and that the revenue shall be protected either untilfcheend the session, or until the new Tariff prohave become law. I do trust that the Ministry will grasp this nettle.

228,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I do not think so. I do not think we should start the federal machine under the impression that it will not work. We must suppose that the Federal. Parliament will do its duty. I think the Legislature will be quite capable of solving the fiscal problem during the first session, and that it will not take so long as some people seem to apprehend. If we make our minds up to solve this problem we shall do it , and I hope that this matter of procedure will be disposed of apart from any cptestion of free-trade or protection. We all desire at the present stage to assist the Ministry in arriving at some method of procedure by which this great and important question may be settled, and, therefore, 1 sincerely trust that the Ministry, however much they may dislike the proposal, will face the matter in the manner that their supporters expect and require.",37
229,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," I think we are all agreed as to what we should like to have, bufc the real question we have to decide is as to what we can get in this matter. I do not suppose that there is a member of this House, whether he be free-trade or protectionist in his views, but wants to see the abolition of the Custom-houses on the borders, and the establishment of absolute Inter-State free-trade. Moreover, I do not think there are any of us but who regard the proposal as made today, and as made the other day, by the honourable member for Indi- a proposal I ventured to suggest that the Government might try, that is, that we should pass an anticipatory Act making the Government proposals the Tariff, either during the session or pending alterations-as the most desirable in the interests of the commercial community. I say that because until we get the uniform Tariff we all know from commercial experience, the great paralysis which will exist, and which, indeed, exists at the present time throughout many of the States. But it is no use for us to pursue a course that is impossible of achievement, however desirable that course would be if we could follow it - There is no way, as one honourable member has suggested, of getting a mandamus out against the dissentients to the proposals of the Government. If , however, the Government say they will take up that position and endeavour to go on with it , I shall support them heartily, because the more I consider this matter the more. I feel that no other course will be satisfactory. But if we cannot take that course we must ""adopt some other means that will relieve us as far as possible from legal difficulties. As I understand the honourable and learned member for Indi, his proposition is that we should enact that the Government proposals when they are submitted shall be an imposition of uniform duties. But I would ask the honourable member whether he means that that measure should have effect for the session only or until amended.",38
230,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I would make that the maximum limit.,38
231,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The honourable and learned member says fchafc the enactment should be for the session only, and I would like to direct attention to the position in which honourable members who approve .of the Government Tariff would .stand, as compared with those who are opposed to it . I am not discussing the question whether the Tariff is fco be free-tradeor protectionist. As the honourable and learned member for Indi has said, the bringing down of this Tariff will practically be an imposition of uniform duties, and therefore will involve theabolition of all the State Tariffs, of whatever kind, and unless before the end of the session both Houses have agreed to a uniform Tariff-if the Houses rise without coming to an agreement-w e shall have noTariff at all.",38
232,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The Parliament would never rise without adopting a Tariff.,38
233,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"We must rise afc the end of three years from the 9fch May, if we do not rise sooner. The session cannot last beyond May, 1903. The honourable and' learned member for Indi says that the 1 Houses would never rise without agreeing fco a Tariff. Now, supposing the Tariff brought down by the Government were a » protectionist Tariff, and that in this House the majority of members strongly approved of it. This is all pure supposition, but it is a possible case; Supposing, further, that in the Senate the majority strongly disapproved' of the Tariff, and that Chamber sent us down a long series of suggestions that we should reduce our duties, saying"" We feel very strongly that this Tariff is too high, and it must therefore be brought down.""",38
234,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Hear , hear.",38
235,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"An . honourable member on the opposite side of the House says "" Hear,, hear,"" and I take that as a very reasonable indication of certain possible events, and it ' is on that account that I have a fear of the sessional arrangement only. We are told that if the proposals passed in this House do not meet with the approval of some honourable members here, the other Chamber will buck up the minority in this House. We were told that in so many words. However, I am not discussing this question as a free-trade or protectionist matter, but I am merely assuming that a protectionist Tariff is approved of by this House, and disapproved' of by the other Chamber-it may be the other way about. If , however, the other House feels strongly, and any difference of opinion does arise between the two Houses, we may expect that both Chambers, in the. exercise of their rights, will adhere strongly to their respective views. I know of no question that arouses a stronger feeling than doesfchefiscal question, and I know of none in which members consider themselves more justified in holding to their views and using whatever weapons they can to enforce them. If the Senate should disapprove of the Government proposals, and offer a lot of suggestions for alterations, they may tell us that if we do not agree to the alterations will not pass the Bill-and it might be a perfectly legitimate position for them to take up. In such a case, where should we be at the end of the session? It is not inconceivable that we might be forced by the circumstances to agree to alterations that we otherwise would not consent to. Circumstances might compel us to agree to a Tariff that we did not like.",38
236,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Thaf c is the fault of the Constitution.,39
237,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Iampoinfcin g out objections to the proposal of the honourable member for Indi.,39
238,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I personally have no objection to what the honourable member says, but I say what be describes would never happen, because the Senate would see that if their objections were persisted in the visional Tariff would last for ever. Mr MCCAY ! - I was going to put that aspect of the case. If we pass an anticipatory A ct covering the session only, those who approve of the Government proposals will be practically at the mercy of those who disapprove of tliem.",39
239,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,We could surely compromise.,39
240,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"If we are going to compromise let us compromise whilst both Houses are standing on the one platform. I never like to have to compromise when the other man is placed six inches above me, and has the advantage of hitting down at me, and if I were to have a hand in the erection of the platform upon which the parties are to stand, I should be very foolish to put the other party on a higher stage. So that the proposal for an Act that would have effect for the season only, seems to me to assume that, if the other House differs from us, we are fco put them in such a position of superiority that we should be compelled by force of circumstances fco agree in a large measure to whatfcheywant-to agree to what we otherwise would not be compelled to accept. At the end of three years the Houses would dissolve, and we should have no Tariff at all. The honourable member for Indi says that the other House would never put us in such a position as that, bufc we should have the Senate taking exactly the same view regarding ourselves, and the two parties would each put the blame on the other. If we wanted to bring the session fco an end under such circumstances, there they would be such pressure inevitably exercised by the force of circumstances on those who had been supportingfcheministeria]proposals that those who disapproved of the proposals would be in a position of advantage that they could not be blamed for availing themselves of. If, on the other hand, it was proposed that the Tariff should continue in operation until Parliament altered it , the opponents of the Government proposals would be at a disadvantage ; whilst if the Tariff were to remain in existence only for the session the supporters of the Government would be at an equal disadvantage. Just as we cannot be expectedfcoagree to the sessional term, so the opponents of the Government proposals in regard to the Tariff cannot Be expected to agree to the longer term. We may as well facefchefacts. There is no good in talking of what would be the best course proif we find that course blocked by the impossibility of securing its acceptance by either one House or the other. We havefcotake up some expedient which is not as good as the course we should like to take. The honourable and learned member for Indi has raised a number of objections to this clause as it stands. I quite admit, as I admitted the other day, as to clause 257although I thought that was constitutional - that there are arguments that can be used against the proposal. But like the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, I am not .prepared to be exceedingly dubious in the matter, but to believe that this is a legaland possible course. For myself, I believe it is a legal course, although, there is a deal that can be said against it. When the honourable and learned member for Indi admittedfchafcthe imposition of uniform duties might take effect under the Government proposals uponfcheactual passing of the Act, even although the Act were made retrospective, and admitted that the Act could be made retrospective, he seemed to me to sacrifice the greater portion of his position.",39
241,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I did not admifc that that would antedatefcheimposition of duties.,40
242,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"But the honourable and learned member admittedfchafcif a law were passed in December, antedating duties from September, the imposition of those duties would be a legal thing.",40
243,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I said for certain purposes that might be so ; but for the purposes of my argument I distinctly controverted it .,40
244,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Does the honourable ancl learned member think this would be possible for us-to pass a law in December, declaring fchafc goods imported since the 1st of September, should pay the same duties as were imposed in December, even although they did not pay them before they were imported? I do not see anything in the Constitution to prevent it . If that is so, the collection of duties in anticipation of the sanction of Parliament under such a clause as this is merely a speedy way of carrying it into effect.",40
245,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"In any event;, it could only apply to uniform duties.",40
246,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The honourable and learned member says that uniform duties of Customs must be imposed, and that taxation must not discriminate between States. AVhat does that phrase mean? Does it mean taxation which does not produce discriniinatiug results, or taxation which in its terms does not discriminate ? It seems to me to mean taxation which in terms does not discriminate. ""The imposition of uniform duties"" means uniform so far as the proposals of the Commonwealth Government are concerned; bufc if by the operation of some other State laws different results were produced, it seems to me that in that case there would not be an abuse or disobedience of the Constitution.",40
247,Mr ISAAOS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Does the honourable and learned member mean that if a resolution of fchis House involved the collection of a duty of 20 per cent, on woollens all over Australia, that rate might be collected in [181] great addition to the duty on woollens imposed by the State of Victoria ?",40
248,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"No . But if the Government collected a 25 per cent, duty in Victoria, where the State dufcy is 25 per cent., that would not be a discrimination by this Parliament.  learned member mean to say that that would be ""uniform""?",40
249,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"So far as this Parliament is concerned that would be an imposition of "" uniform duties "" ; and if the State took more than the amount of the Commonwealth duty, that would not be a want of uniformity so far as the Parliament of the Commonwealth is concerned.  supersede the State Tariffs.",40
250,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"It does not; do so in that case. Ifc is merely the most convenient form of taking bonds from theimporters-cas h is the best form of bondsin such a case-tha tfcheywill pay the d u t y from a given date when it is subsequently imposed, the A ct making it retrospectivefromfchafcgiven date. This is not perhaps commercially the most desirable course%to pursue. The course proposed by the honourable and learned member for Indi is. commercially by far the most desirable. But if we make the duty collectable for the whole period until altered, or if we make it for only a few months-whicheve r way you pufc it-yo u placefchesupporters of the Government proposals, or the opponents, of them, in a position that you cannot expect them to agree to occupy. I say frankly that I would not agree to the sessional pro- posal, because I should think that by that I was placed in a position of disadvantage; and I would not agree tofchepermanent proposal if the proposals of the Government met with my disapproval, because I should consider that that course would equally place me in a position of disadvantage. When either of those courses means that some one is put in a position of disadvantage, which we cannot expect them fco submitfco,we must perforce-throug h our lack of power to do otherwise-accep t a. position which is not so satisfactory to persons.' infchecommercial world as the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Indi would be. It seems to me that there is nothing to prevent the course proposed being adopted. There are objections to it, just as there were to clause 257. Indeedl like clause 257 betterthan I like this proposal. Itseemsfco me that by that line of action we can get over-a great deal of the difficulty that has been ment ? raised. lib has been assumed that clause 257 is equivalent to the imposition of duties.

We are all equally, anxious on fchis side of the committee fco protect the revenue; but the machinery which is now presented to us - places us i very difficult; position.' The honourable and learned member for Corinella said that the fiscal,issue musfc not b® raised. UnquestionMinistry, ably, however, it has come to the front, protectionist. and I do not want to be afc a disadvanTariff tage, or fiscally handicapped, in regard this matter. The proposed alteration clause 257 would allow the Minister bring in a discriminating Tariff. r",42
265,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Oh , no.",42
266,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"If c is proposed that the Commonwealth Gover.nment.shaH collect the the higher duties. Such a proposal - would mean that the-Tariff broughtin by the Government this. would comprise many duties that are higherfchan those already in force in New The Government would: collect those higher duties, and New South Let Wales would not have the corresponding.advantage of Interstate free-trade. That is the difficulty so far as New. South Wales is concerned - I am notspeaking for the traders but for the'people of New. South Wales, who would not receive the advantages which-were offered to fchem when they accepted the bePederal Constitution. I am told bytlie We honourable and learned member for Indi fchafc it would be unconstitutional to provide for the imposition of other than uniform duties. The honourable and learned member appealed very strongly to the committee not to do anything that would be unconstitutional, he asserted that if we allowed this proman posal to passwe should be authorizing an unconstitutional as well as an illegal Act. If we are to place ourselves in an unconstitutional position in order to assist the Government, then 1 for one shall not be forfchisproposal. Another suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Indi is that we should give an anticipatory measure sessional effect. If we onfchisside of the committee accepted the that proposal we should be taking a leap in the dark. We should not know whafc the So Tariff proposals were to be-. The State duties would be dropped for the session, and the State of New Soufch Wales would as to be unable to revert to those duties. Pressure would be brought to bear. It would be said that we musfc have revenue only for the purposes of the Commonwealth, but for the purposes of the various happen. States, and we would be dragooned and forced to vote for the Government proposals. The honourable and learned member for Corinella has said.that the other House n a might take an ulfcra free fcrade stand in j regard-to duties in which it did not believe. The converse however might take place. The as is well known, are strongly They might bring in a for the session, with the result that to I should have fco vote for a Tariff in of which I did not believe. The Minister in to charge of the Customs department might say to us- "" If you do not take this proposal of mine, then New South Wales will be. deprived of its revenue. It will not be able to revert to its own State taxation."" We wouldthus be tying our hands and placing ourselves within the power of sueh strong members of the Ministry as the Attorney-General and the Minister for Trade and Customs. As far as I am concerned I am not prepared to accept the suggestion made by the Government for collecting the higher duties, because that will not give New South Wales the advantage of Inter-State free-trade. I am not taking this stand out of consideration for the traders. I am fighting for the taxpayers, and neither the Government proposal nor the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Indi, meets with my approval. The latter scheme would simply be a leap in the dark.",42
267,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,AVha t is the honourable member's proposal ?,43
268,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I have none. I am discussing the proposals as a member of the Opposition. I am not jjrepared to accept either of the suggestions that have been made.,43
269,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The honourable member is not sitting in opposition to Australia. Mr WILK.S - In voting with the honoi\able and learned member for Indi we do get Inter-State free-trade, and that difficulty will be solved. When the honourable and learned member put the question to the Minister as to whether the date of the imposition of the duty would be the date when 'it would be collectable, the Minister refused to answer. The Minister would clear the atmosphere of the Chamber very much if he would state his"" idea as to what would be the period of imposition.",43
270,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I said the imposition would be the date in the Act, and it could relate back.",43
271,Mr WILKS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"But if the right honourable gentleman would state that as soon as the duties are collectable they are imposed then the spirit of Inter-State free-trade would also be established.. It does not require any legal training at all fro know that the honourable and learned member for Indi very forcibly showed that immediately the duties are imposed we shall have free-trade under section 92, and if duties are imposed which are not of a uniform character, they will be illegal as not being withinfcheConstitution. The honourable and learned member for Indi showed clearly that they would be illegal and unconstitutional, and if we are to adopt one suggestion, I would prefer to adopt the sessional proposal.  has some diffidence in entering upon this debate with such a legal array in front of him'. If we may be convinced of anything, it is that we should not put all our faith and trust in lawyers. In connection with the memorable Convention, one of the chief qualifications said to be required in a candidate as a representative to that Convention was that he should have a thorough knowledge of the law. . The representatives at the Convention were Constitution builders, and we have evidence today of how well they built. It seems to me a pity that instead of having an adjournment for 60 days, as they did in that Convention, they did not have an adjournment until now; i u the meantime the members might have looked through their work and ""found out some of its defects.",43
272,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Did the honourable member vote for the Constitution 1  explain later on, when we are on the Inter-State Commission Bill, why I did not vote for the Constitution. What I want to understand from the Minister-because laymen cannot understand it-is whether this proposal means that a uniform Tariff is to be collected ?",43
273,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"It means the power to collect higher duties.  collect higher duties, I musfc take it, from that answer, that it does not mean a uniform Tariff.",43
274,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I did not say that.,43
275,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"My honourable friend will not be warranted in assuming, afc this point, either that there is an - intention to collect higher duties, or to begin to'collect a uniform Tariff at once. Ifc is a matter for determination.  sume that it is the intention, but I think I am right in assuming that it is possible to do so. In the next place, as a corollary to fchis being adopted) shall we have Inter-State free-trade as the result of the adoption of a resolution when the Tariff is brought down 1",43
276,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I explained the other [day that there are certain difficulties, and that if we could possibly overcome them we would, and give Inter-State free-trade afc the same time.  clause 257, and it appears now that the only difference between the clause we are now asked to pass and clause 257 is that I whereas under clause 257 we gave power impose a tax, we in this clause give power fco certain people to collect taxes, and nify them because the}' have collected illegally. Ifc is only reversing the position, and it makes possible the collection a tax which is illegal, and which under clause 257 was imposed by the operation that clause. I would like fco know what there is fco prevent us from following the customary practice in the States, under which a new Tariff is collected on the date when the Treasurer brings down his proposals in the Budget speech ?",43
277,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,This clause does not prevent our doing that.,44
278,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The difficulty is that we may be ordered to refund by the Supreme Court.  very attentively, but what I have heard does not clear the point I raised, and it peoi'S to me that there will still be a probable known, when here we have-as want of uniformity. I have not yet got an answer as to what there is to prevent the date forfcheimposition of the Tariff being difficulties the date of the introduction of the Budget speech in which the proposals are made. What is therefcoprevent our collecting the Federal Tariff on that particular date, to prevent our having Inter-State free-trade afc the same time ?",44
279,Mr BABTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I think the difficulty that it involves an assumption that the Federal Tariff as proposed will be carried into law. There may be a loss of revenue in the interim period arising from that assumption, the result being fchis : That in ordinary cases the higher dufcy is colthe lected, under the j>racfcice in force in various States, when the resolutions are brought down. The higher duty is collected as a protection for the revenue, and as means, and perhaps a rather high-handed means, of taking security for the revenue. Thafc position could not occur here, if we impose a uniform Tariff, ' in rewhom spect of discrepancies between the uniform Tariff and the higher duties afc present existing. If we are to bring down our uniform Tariff it will vary in duties from existing Tariffs in many cases. Supnofc pose that on some particular article the duties are higher, and on others lower, than this question. previously existed, we should lose in the case offchelower, and should not be able to recoup ourselves in the case of the higher. n the meantime, if the Tariff does not pass, to all that security is lost to the revenue.  indemwe are in a nice old fix. I w a n t . to say that so far as I. am concerned I am not going in for any captious opposiof tion. I am here to protect the revenue as well as is any honourable member on the other of side, and it is with me only a question of the proper way of doing it . I still think we might take the risk of doing as is done in the States, and impose the Tariff by the ordinary process and collect it from the date on which it is announced. The question as to whether it shall be a high Tariff or a low Tariff is for fchis and the other Chamber eventually to decide.",44
280,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Would the honourable member have free-trade between the States from that moment?,44
281,Mr BABTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"How could we follow the State practice of collecting on a previous apTariff, which has been the only one we have a possible basis of collection-six previous Tariffs 1  in that respect, but all the lawyers in the House and outsidefcheHouse, and in the other Chamber, ought to be able to devise a simple scheme of seeing that the or Tariff which is introduced as the FederalTariff is collected. Ifc is immaterialfcome whether it is a high Tariff or a low Tariff is for the purpose of argument here. I want to get Inter-State free-trade on the imposition of the Tariff. What I am afraid of is, that under this proposal we shall not have a uniform Tariff, but that we may be collecting a high Tariff in one State because State Tariff is the higher Tariff, and the the Federal Tariff in another State, because that is the higher Tariff, and infchemeantime be collecting all the Inter-State Customs duties. a I think the anxiety of the Commonwealth is for the introduction of Inter-State free trade. We want to get the thing done as quickly as possible. There are persons from we shall collect the higher Tariff who will never get a refund if it can be made. The business man in many instances may get a refund, but the man who buys his articles from a tradesman or an importer will get any money refunded. I am in a b it of a fix, for I do not know how to vote on MT. BARTON - Tot e to protect the revenue.  possibly be done'under the old State system, I would take the bull by the horns. I do not see why the importer is likely to enter into a lawsuit with trie Commonwealth.",44
282,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"They have done it in dozens of cases.  the case of States, but it.did not result in loss.",45
283,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,They recovered money.,45
284,Mr BAUTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"In ten cases, I think.  my mind yefc; I . shall wait for further discussion. Mr G. B. EDWA B>I)S'(SoufcbSydney) I think the committee is deeply indebted to the honourable and learned member for Indi, for taking up the position he has done in defence of ""the Constitution. I'hope he will be the forerunner of a long lineof statesmen and patriots, who will defend the Constitution, no matter what comes about. The Government have been somewhat disingenuousonfchewhole-subject,-fcheyhave never boldly taken the committee into their confidence, and admitted the difficulty, and stated plainly in what way they would deal with it . Even if we pass these amended clauses, I hold that it is perfectly possible for the Government to adopt the opinion which hos'beenlaid down, that the imposition of uniform duties, necessarily involving Inter-State free-trade, admits that. Inter-State trade is free from that moment. There is nothing which I can see in the two clauses to defeat that object. And if the Government would have some temerity, and would firmly grasp the nettle, fchey could boldly undertake to make Inter-State trade free from the moment they bring down their Tariff, and get a resolution passed empowering them to collect it. I know the Prime Minister has asked would the House-the other parfcy, I think he meant-agre e to such a proposal'? In a matter of so much moment as this, when all sides-fch e press-'and the thinkers as well as the politicians of the Commonwealth-hav e admitted that a very great difficulty exists, and that we shall have either to-strain the Constitution or to-take some extraordinary course, we should On the patriotism of the members of both Houses to-assist in.'carrying-'this thing into effect 'in some way, :so - as to gefc a start. - The clauses, as 'framed, would - admirably meet any - subsequent Tariff proposals - or amendments j but for a start, owing to this difficulty about - Inter-State 'free-trade, we have either to stretch 'the Constitutionwhich, I hope, is a course that w i ll never be taken in the history of the Commonwealth-a- , course which I'hope w i ll never be taken in the history of the Commonwealth - o r to boldly rely on the patriotism of federal representatives to help the the Government to make a start. No matter what opinions may be adopted by the party with which I am loyally connected, I shall take the course of supporting Ministers fco the best of my ability in getting a start in this very 'troublesome l matter. While it is said that we can rely on Ministers to do what is best for the whole of the States, I think we can also rely on His Majesty's Opposition to assisfc'in thatcourse, provided*that Ministers are fairly reasonable in taking advantage of the assistance which may properly be expected'from them. I do not think it is necessary, as honourable members have said, to have a special Bill for the purpose. But if we have in this Bill a provision similar to the original provision in clause 257, we can assume that as soon as the Government table their Tariff, they will collect the dutieSj .and at the same time give up all Inter-State duties, and begin the reign of Inter-State 'free'trade, and keep us in session until we either pass the Tariff"" proposals or otbers which will take their place.. I think they can further *rely on the patriotism of the two'branches of the Parliament, that if-aseBiou&difference should Grop up, as naturally we might expect it would, some form of compromise might then be looked for which would.help us afc any rate to gefc an interim Tariff - passed into absolute law, leaving. Ministers, eitheri n the next-session or in a later session,.if ""fchey desire, to propose further amendments-. Unless Ministers will have the courage of some opinion and'boldly tell the committee what they intend to-do, and.rely onouv'pafciiotism to carry out their plan, or help them to carry it out, we shall not get a step forward infchisvery difficult and troublesome matter",45
285,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," I must assure my honourable friend who has just spoken that the Government are not er.rihg - from want? of courage, but theya.rerto-d'0'ub'fc.picking their way very cautiously in'o'l'der that they may stay within the Constitution on the one hand and protectfcherevenue on the other. Thafc isfcheproblem before them, and before every member of the committee, which would be just as difficult if our opponents we're'in office. As regards my honourable friend's assurance that he will give us patriotic support i u arriving afc a - solution Of the difficulty, 1 accept that with just as muG-h good faith-as I am sure he offers it . Bufc then the - honourable member for South Sydney has commended the honourable and learned member for Indi with reference to his defence of the Constitution. That defence of' the Constitution was largely based on the case'of Marbury and Madison, which took place in the United States in 1803, bufc which is no doubt good law, although it is old. The difficulty the honourable member for Soufch Sydney will find himself in is this-^that if he considers the view of the honourable and learned member for In di is right, themall hisrpatrictic-assistance will be of no avail tofcheGovernment if we take softie of th? courses he longs for. That is one of our difficulties. Wo might easily take some of the courses so prolifically suggested, and find ourselves quite within the clutches of this case, which will no doubt be applicable law within the Commonwealth, while we might ea&ilytake'some other course which the-honourable member would oppose on the justice of it, bnfc which would relieve-us fromfchenecessity of any frirt/her consulting the case of Marbury v. Madison. There is the position, and it is one, in which I suppose, nobody can be envied. It is only right we should take every care, without losing our courage, to-see that the course we take is one which the - Constitution will support-, and one, therefore, which'the High Court will support when apjxrinted, and also-one fco protect the revenue, which we cannot afford to trifle with. It must be recollected that the Commonwealth and the Government are to a very large extent the trustees-for'the; States financially. We are the trustees as ttvone class of expenditure, namely, the maintenaneeof the-transferred departments, to the-extent ofall the'revenue less the amount spent in - the States, within the limits of the sub-section which makes us trustees. As to the restof the Commonwealth expenditure, weareresponsibl&to the whole of the-States. We can collect from the whole-of the States on the basis of popur lation, 'but. notwifchsfcanding-fchese-Gollecfcions - I will n""ofc say collections, but rather bhat we debit the Stabe3 on the basis Of 'their population-and nOtwifcbsfcanding'thatdebit, we are bound to seefchafc.we return-sufficient revenue to the States in order thab they may be - kepb as nearly as practicable in their former positions. To do that .we must-see that we do not take a course under which we shall unduly sacrifice any of the revenue of the Commonwealth, becausefchemoment we do that, we shall fail in our obligations to the States. It is fcherefore necessaiy in a Bill-of this .kind, w h at ever the ultimate decision is, to take sufficient power to .protect the revenue in the event of either decision being, come to. That is the origin of a clause of this kind. It has no other desire--n o other object at bottom. There is no doubt that this course is taken in full face-of the knowledge that similar action, so far as it can be similar, on the past of the States' Governments in collecting revenue immediately their financial proposals are announced, and that on ti higher scale,. has been decided to be illegal. That has been decided i nfchecourts here to be illegal, so far that refunds were made in nine cases, because improper collections had been made. That is the position of the Commonwealth as the trustee of the public revenue. If the principle of collect ing In all cases the higher duty were adopted as a bem.pai - ary measure, it is not intended or proposed for a-moment that any excess collected should go into the coffers of"" the Commonwealth. The objecb is simply, as far-as possible, bo enable ordinary security to be baken, which - has been taken in the past, and which, no doubt, has been unconstitutional in the past: bufc it is taken in this case under cirGiinistonees of unusual and peculiar difficulty applying to six former Tariffs.",45
286,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The Minister for External Affairs does not feel free bo say whebher ib is intended to collecb on the higher scale.,46
287,Mr BABTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I feel'free bo say bhat if we can see our way, and it is our wish to try and see our way, ib will be the desire of the Governmenb bo forthwith, in bringiiij; down ibs proposals, collecb the new and uniform Tariff, and bo .cease bo collecb the Inber-Sbate duties afc the same moment Mr G. B. EDWAKDS - Why nob say so 1",46
288,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I have expressed-my-own feelings to the House on bhis matter, and to that extent certainly nobody can doubt - that we have taken the House into our confidence. We are only impressed by difficulties which must impress every legal mind in considering such a subject; but I think the honourable member for South Sydney will say now that, as far as possible, we are taking the House into our confidence in this matter.",46
289,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The Government are doing so now.,47
290,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"We are not stumbling afc any matter on account of policy. We are - only holding our hand, because we wish to keep within the Constitution, and afc the same time not let the revenue be unduly injured. It musfc be recollected that the responsibility on a Ministry in instituting'Tariff, proposals is always that, although fchey might, perhaps, without much arrogance,- make the assumption politically, they cannot constitutionally make the assumption that the Tariff will be carried. While not able to make fchafc assumption, it appears difiicu.lt to. take a course which, in many instances, may mean smaller revenue, - Of course, every Tariff is to be judged by its operation, and we all. of us have our own forecast. An honourable member opposite may think - a certain dufcy will lead to a higher revenue instead of a lower one, while an honourable member on this side of the House may think otherwise. This thing can stand no tesfcbufcthe test of time, - and it is for the purpose of seeing that - defeated expectations, if they ever occur, do aaofc injurefchefinancesof the country, that this safeguard must be taken. Going 'through the clause itself, I do not, I - must admit, feel so great a difficulty about it as - does the honourable and learned member for f n d i . There is no doubt that the honourable member has put a very keen and concise .argument before this Chamber. But I do not see that the form in whichfchisclause is 'proposed, having a certain relation to other - clauses infcheBill, is onefchafcwill prevent - us from adopting the view put forth by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and which I was about to put forward if he had not clone so. If honourable^ members will look afc clauses 210 and 212, they will find certain proposals which the House has dealt with. Clause 210 providesNo proceeding shall be commenced against officer for anything done in execution of reason of his office until one month next after notice in writing shall have been delivered to him or left at his usual place of abode by the plaintiff, his attorney or agent, in which notice shall be clearly stated the cause and nature of the proceeding. . . . That isfchegist of the clause. Clause 212 providesI t shall be lawful for any officer to whom notice of proceeding shall have been given at any time within one month after such notice to tender amends to the plaintiff, his attorney or agent, and in case such amends be not-accepted to plead Such tender. . . . In the case of any collections, it may prove by the ultimate action of Parliament in regard to the Tariff to have been excess collection. It may be that all the duties proposed in the Tariff will not be carried exactly in the shape proposed, and then there would have to be refunds. A limitation is placed on actions or suits against officers with respect to the general objects of the Bill, and opportunity is given to tender amends. Whether actions or suits are brought against officers or against the Crown is immaterial so far as the proposed new clause is concerned. In either case it is intended that - protection I shall be given for two reasons. The first reason is that what is called the over-collection offcheduty is really only the taking of a security which does not go intofchepermanent revenue, but is recoverable in the event of the Tariff' not being finally passed. In the next place there ought not to be taken away from the authorities the opportunity of making this class of amends instead of waiting until the case gets into court. It has been urged, however, against the clause fchafc because it imposes a limitation on the right of procedure, that being a right conferred by the Constitution, the limitation is therefore unconstitutional. The remedy is not affected. If amends are not made-and every person against whom a demand is made should have an opportunity of making amends-the remedy of the person to whom amends are not tendered is to bring an action. The principle of postponing such an action has already been established hy this committee in clause 210 with the limitations put upon it by clause 212. The object here is in the case of excess Tariff collections to postpone action not for a month but for the session. If there is the greater opportunity allowed to make amends by a refund, pending the legalization of the collection, any there is no harm in that. If the result is or by that the collection is legalized, then the Constitution by that legalization has complied with, and there ought never to have been any right of action at all. mit, therefore, that whichever way we look it, this clause is in all its aspects just, bhat in the second place, there is no offence against the Consbibubion. If bhere be any doubt on the part of honourable members as to its justice, that is one thing. Bub I cantribution nob conceive thab there could be any doubb as to that. As to its effect under the Conjurisdiction stitution, that has been well considered Ministers. I admib the importance and suls, good faith offcheobjections thab are offered, and 1 admib bhat they are offered by high authorities. We have done the best we can to consider this matter; we have arrived a certain conclusion, and T. think weave bound to maintain our opinions with respect to constitutionality of the course proposed. Therefore, we musfc support fchis clause. wish, before I forget, to make it quite .clear that a particular course of action reference tofcheTariff is not to be assumed from any shape in which this clause is proposed. That is to say, the course this which the honourable and learned member favours-and which I should strongly favour if X could feel thab it was a safe to the counbry-wil l still be considered, if found bo be safe it will be adopbed. Otherwise I cannob promise.",47
291,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"In regard bo the provisions of clause 212, I would poihb oub that rather relate to actions against an officer for a breach of his power under the Act, and of course Parliament may put any the limitation it likes upon that. I was ing a distinction between offences against the provisions of this Bill and'those of Constitution.",48
292,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I can quite see that clauses 210 and 212 are as the honourable ancl learned member describes fchem. In the first instance he suggests an illegality, which he says is a breach of the Constitution. I cannot see that in a matter of procedure-and this is a matter' of procedure I bake it-ther e is any distinction in principle. As fco the case of Mavbivry v. Madison I would point out that that case arose out of the following circumstances :Mr Marbury, amongst other gentlemen, had been designated a Justice of the Peace. He was to be-appointed, but his commission was retained in the hands of the Secretary of State-Jame s Madison. Mr Marbury took proceedings in the Supreme Court of been the United States to obtain an order to compel the Secretary of Sbabe bo issue the I subcommission. Upon his case a number of at obhers hung. Under the Constitution the and, whole of the judicial power of the Unibed Sbabeswas "" vesbed in one Supreme Court, ancl such superior court as Congress fromtimebo time shall ordain or establish."" In the disof this power it is declared fchafc "" the . Supreme Com-t shall have original in all cases affecting ambasby sadors and other public Ministers and conand those in which the State shall be a party. In all other cases the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction."" After that, Congress passed an A ct which, at of course, either had to be within the Constitution, and, therefore, valid, or without the the Constitution, and, therefore, invalid. That Act gave the courts authority "" to I issue a mandamus in a case warranted by the principles and usages of law in courts apwith pointed or persons holding office under the authority of the United States."" The jurisdiction to issue a mandamus was invoked in case as if it were an. original jurisdiction. The difficulty in the case was that the Supreme Court finding that, except one in cases to which the State was a party, and it could have nothing but appellate jurisdiction, not original jurisdiction, held that it had no power to issue a mandamus because no Acb could authorize the breach they of the Constitution which would be comprised in giving the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in one of those cases in which Constitution virtually said it had not drawsuch jurisdiction. That was. the case of Marhv/i'y v. Madison, ancl that is the case the which the honourable and learned member for Indi applies here. Bub I fail bo see that such a case applies bo a matter like this in which the question is one of procedure, not one which prevents any action being brought, or - which denies the effecb of the Constitution, but one which imposes on the suitor simply those liabilities to certain forms of procedure which might be imposed by any legal procedure Acb in the world. I adinifc that there is much to be faced in the argument; but at the same time it does not seem to be a conclusive one, because I believe that fchis clause can, ancl would be read by the High Court of Australia as one imposing merely a limitation .wibh regard bo procedure, and in that respecb I bhink ib would be held to be good. Upon that, of course, I do nob speak wibh the enthusiasm of a partisan. We do not need fco be partisans in - a matter offchis solifc. We must-endeavour to ad-vise the House as well as we cam I do not see that the objectionswhich.have been urged >as to the power of this Parliament-whic h - is plenary wifcliin the whole amVjit of.the Constitution igranbed to us-destro y the power of Parliament to impose fchis limitation in the public .good, for the purpose of protecting the revenue and as a matter of mere justice to those who are trustees offchafcrevenue. Justice to the trustees .means justicefcofchepeople. Mr HfGGTNS (Northern Melbourne) I have waited u n t i l . I could find out what could be said upon the other side of the House in regard to the alternative proposals before the committee, because I feel that if an attempt; be made to take any party advantage of the difficulty created by the Constitution"", it will be a lamentable thing for the country. I have had the advantage of hearing not only the speechesof three members of the-Opposition, but also that of the Prime Minister, and if fcbe latter be taken fco be final, I apprehend that it is the intention of the Government fco push through these clauses at all hazards. Ifc is a matter for regret that we have not the presence during, this very momentous 'discussion of the leader of the Opposition, who, by his ability and skill, could not only enlighten the committee, but could also assure us of the attitude which he would recommend his friends to take in this difficulty. I have, however, been exceedingly gratified to find from the utterances of two ait least; of the Opposition speakers that they do not desire to take * any advantage of a difficulty which, if they were onfchisside of the House, fchey would have to face themselves. The sentiments of the honourable member for South Sydney and of the honourable member for South  lie appreciated.not only-by honourable members on this side, but by Australia as a whole. I gather that there is no desire whatever to take advantage of this problem for party purposes, or even for the purpose of pushing. ohe% viewson thefiscal question. The utterance of the Prime Minister has made-me consider-what will be the worse <result we-shall have to apprehend, assuming that it is the intention of the - Government to push through these clauses, ancl that their view iswrong. If there is anything certain in fchis world, it is that; there will be a tremendousstrain on the part of importers and merchants to obtain trade advantages - in eonnexion with the -'new duties, .and 1 thirtk it is almost; as certain .that this question- - will be tested in the law courts-. The proposal made bybhe Minisber for Trade and Cusboms has-sbrong grounds of expediency bo support ib. He bas argued bliatib would be .more-expedient to follow his method.; bub the honourable member for Indi has argued that whether ib would be expedient or nob'.ib would not be legal, and'there is wheve the difficulty arises. I have alwaysfelt that ib is one of the drawbacks of our Parliament that our debates will turn so much upon the question of legality and illegality in plaee-of expediency andinexpediency.",48
293,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,We have boo many lawyers.,49
294,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The position is that boo much is being pub upon the lawyers, and that is whab I objecb bo. I say that ib Would be bo the besb interests of the country that we should as far as possible do whab is expedient and not what is legal for the country. Ifc is the unfortunate resultancl perhaps, havinga weakness in fchafc direction, I may be allowed fco say it-of a want of elasticity i nfcheConstitution. Tf our Constitution were more flexible, as I urged it should be, we should lean less upon the question of legality or illegality-les s upon the courts-and more upon the people.",49
295,Mr WINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,How would the honourable member have met this difficulty ? Mr A. MCLEA-N - B y putting language in the Constitution which covdd be interpreted.,49
296,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Exactly ; if it-were possible to pub in such language ; bub we have made our bed, and on ib we musfc lie, and I shall do my best-to get overfchecliificulty as well as circumstances will allow. The proposal Of the Minisber for Trade and Customs is to legalize the system which has been adopted in England and"" in Victoria and in other ^places, and to say that no action shall be brought against the authorities until the end of the session, except under certain-conditions: Thafc seems very plausible, bu t the Minister has not'-told u s whether, after he brings down his Budget resolution, he will collect duties on-blie basis of .the new Federal Tariff, or upon the basis of the highest duby, whether ib is-under the old Tariff or'under the new Tariff. I. admit bhere is a good deal of reason for his not disclosing his intention. 'In the meantime, however, before the uniform - Tariff is imposed, before the end 'of the session, duties will have to be collected. Now, what I understand fco be the intention of the Minister for Trade and Gustomsus, that having byfcheend of the session fixed' what shall be the duties and the uniform duties, he will refund the excess dufcies-if anyexcess: duties have been collected-to those who have paid them. I may pass by the incidental fact thatfchafcmoney will not get back into the pockets of the consumers. Every one admits that a tafx upon kerosene or tea will increase the prices of those articles fco the consumer. They do not makefchafcadmission with regard to protective duties, but still there is no doubt whatever that the prices of various articles will be enhanced by the imposition of revenue duties, and that the refunds of duty on such articles will not go back to the consumers. The idea of the Minister for Trade and Customs, as I understand it , is to make his Federal Tariff retrospective to the date of the bringing in-of the Budget.",49
297,Mr KJNGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Yes .,50
298,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Ver y well. That seemed to me fco be a very ingenious way of meethas been passed. ing the case - and I congratulate fcbe Minister for Trade and Customs on an ingenuity which exceeds the ingenuity of most men-bu t in the firstplace we can make a uniform Tariff retrospective. That is a .conclusion I have comefco»ffcer-a good deal of thinking out of.this Constitution. It is very much a legal question, and I ask honourable members to look at a few sections of the Constitution Act, which deal with In the first place, the Constitution provides, in section 86, that when the Commonwealth is established, all the duties of customs and excise are to pass over tofchefederal power ; so that, as has happened, the Commonwealth has been collecting all the taxes which fcbe States have hitherto'Collected, including Inter-State taxes. Then the Constitution says, in section 88, thatUniform dufcies of customs shall be imposed within two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Indi, that there is no 'power to impose anything but 'uniform duties in this Parliament; and I read the section I have quoted with section 51, which is to the effect that all taxation by - the Federal Parliament is-fco make no differentiation between the States. There is to be no discrimination whatever. Then section 89 saysUntil the imposition of uniform duties of customs there is to-be a certain - book-keeping^betweeu the States. Ifc will - beireeollecfced'thatunder section 90, as soon as the uniform dufcies of customs are imposed, the power of the Federal Parliament - fco impose duties becomes exclusive. The-Constitution says, in section 90, thatOn the imposition o""f uniform duties of customs - ill laws bf the several ""States imposing duties of customs or excise . . . shall cease to have effect. In short,fchelaws offche'States with regard to ditties arefcoexist right up until the uniform Tariff is imposed, and the imposition does not come untilfcheend of' the session in which the uniform dutiesare imposed, or u ntil the time in which the law has beeu passed. Mr V. L. SOLOMON - Is fchafcfchehonorable and learned member's definition of ""imposition ""-until the law is passed 1",50
299,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Yes ; I say that the Federal Parliament has not imposed any Tariff until the Commonwealth Tariff law,50
300,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Does the collection of dufcies infchemeantime alter that ? Mr - HIGGINS - The collection in the I do not think meantime is illegal.,50
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Would this proposed interim law be an "" imposition"" in the honourable and learned member's judgment f",50
302,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I shall come to that point presently. The suggestion which has it . been made of a lav/ which bas passed the House imposing duties comi ng into operation as soon as the Budget statement is made is a different thing altogether. There you have a law to come into effect, and in that case there is au ""imposition""; bufc I am saying now fchafc if honourable members look at section 9 2 ""fchey the will see that ""on the imposition of 'uniform duties of customs,"" there is to be free-trade absolute between the States. During the first five years after the imposition of uniforo duties there is to be a certain bookkeeping between the different States, but after fchose five years it is for the Parliament; to provide. If honourable members look afc sections 107 and 108fcheywill see that it is there provided that- Every power of the Parliament of a colony which has become or becomes a State shall unless it is by this Constitution exclusively vested and this power of imposing duties is not exclusively vestedcontinue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth. So the State Parliaments have the power to alter their duties right up to the time when the law is passed by this Parliament establishing uniform duties. Ifc does not follow that Victoria or Soufch Australia, or any State, will still keep its existing duties up to the time when the law is passed by the Commonwealth Parliament.",50
303,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Does not that view clash with section 86?,51
304,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"-No , section 86 simply deals with the collection and control. It means that whatever duties the States have imposed or do impose, the Federal Parliament shall collect.",51
305,Mr HUME COOK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"It means management, not imposition.",51
306,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"It is mere management. If honourable members look at section 108, they will see fchafc it is there laid down thatEvery law in force in a colony . . . relating any matter within the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth shall, subject to this Constitution, continue in force in the State; and until provision is made in that behalf by the Parliament of the CommonAvealth, the Parliament of the State shall have such powers of alteration nnd repeal in respect of any such law as the Parliament of the colony had until the colony became a State. Thafc is most express and most distinct that up to the time that there is a law of the Federal Parliament- a law, mark you, not a mere regulation of customs or anything of that sort-imposin g duties-tli e States are to say what shall be the duties, although the Federal Government has to collect them. Then under section 109, if a law of the Federal Parliament conflictsi n this matter with a law of the States, our law prevails.  made.",51
307,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Quite so. What I say) in short, is this:-U p to the precise moment when the Governor General's signature makes the law, with regard to the Tariff operative, the State law must prevail, altered or unaltered; for the States can alter if they think fit. Therefore, not only have we no power to impose any but uniform duties, bufc I say, also, that we cannot make our first uniform duties retrospective. We musfc make them future, asfcheConstitution means that until fchey are actually imposed, the States dufcies shall prevail. Now, of course, if that be the correct view, it would, I am afraid, knock the proposal before the committee kite-high. I should likefcosee the Minister's proposal successful, and it is only because I wish to see it successful that I have gone into the subject with such care, to see if we could not by any means under the Constitution, avoid the serious disaster which would occur in case this course should be found in the courts of law to be impossible. Bufc, says my honourable and learned friend, the member for Bendigo-and the righfc honourable the Prime Minister corroborates him- "" Here we are simply dealing with a matter of procedure; we are simply saying under what conditions there may be an action against an officer of the Customs or against His Majesty."" A corporation with power to make by-laws cannot limit the actions brought against itself and its officers. A corporation like the London County Council has certain powers given to it by the Imperial Parliament. The County to Council could not introduce regulations or by-laws making a provision that its officers and its servants are not to be sued for a certain time if they are doing an illegal act. And I say that the relation of our Federal Parliament to this written Constitution is very similarfcothe relation of a municipal corporation to the supreme Legislature. We who are to .be controlled by the High Court cannot say that there shall be no action brought against us. That is a matter for the Constitution. To bring it to the test, suppose a specific case. Suppose the case of a cargo of kerosene brought to Melbourne. There is no duty on kerosene afc present. Supposing thatfcheMinister begins to collect under this clause 3d. per gallon on that kerosene, I say that if the importer paid the duty and brought au action against the King, or against the Customs officer, to recover the money so paid, this clause would not be a defence tofcheaction. That is the very test. The importer would say-"" I paid you 3d. per gallon on this kerosene, and you had no power to exact that 3d. from me."" "" But , "" the Minister would reply, "" here is this provision in an Ac t of the Federal Parliament that no action is to be brought."" The importer would reply"" What have It o do with that? I stand upon the Constitution, which is higher than an Ac t of Parliament. That is the point. The Constitution provides that until uniform customs dufcies are imposed, and are made law by Acfc of Parliament, the State dufcies are to prevail, and under the laws of the State I am entitled to import fchafc kerosene free."" I think that there is a great deal of force in what was put by the honourable and learned member for Indi. It is not a matter of procedure which we can control. It is for some one else to control it, and the Constitution is the controlling power. I say that no person who is under an obligation as a debtor, or in any other capacity, can dictate the conditions under which he is to be sued.",51
308,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Coul d the local courts consider that question ?,52
309,Mr HICGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"- I thank the honourable member for the interjection. I have gone into fchafc mutter, and I think that fcbe local courts could. I was hoping that we could gefc out offchedifficulty by saying that there was no harm done. I have alluded to the local courts, and I may say that I do not think the High Court will be constituted until the end of the session, even if it is then constituted. I have my own views as to the expediency of postponing its creation for afc least a year or two. Looking at the probabilities the customs dufcies will be made law beforefcheHigh Court is constituted, but then comesfchequestion, and a very pertinent question it is, which the honourable member for Gippsland asked, could the local court look into this thing ? I think it could.",52
310,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,It musfc under the Constitution.,52
311,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Without vesfciug any power in the local courts, the local courts tire as much bound by this law of His Majesty and the House of Lords and the House of Commons as we are, and they are bound to give effect to it.",52
312,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Then there is no necessity to vest them with federal jurisdiction?,52
313,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"There is in other matters, but certainly not in matters which come to them by the Constitution. That is the point. The importer, in the case I have mentioned, would simply bring an action against .the Government or against their officer fov what is called "" money had ancl received."" He would apply for a refund of the 3d. per gallon. Ifc would be urged by himfchafc,under the Constitution, which binds this court ancl all of us here in Australia, he was entitled to import the kerosene without payment of an)' duty, and he would therefore say- "" Give me back that 3d. por gallon."" ""Bufc,"" the Minister would reply, ""look at this provision passed by the Federal Parliament."" "" Oh, yes,"" the importer would answer; "" but the Constitution is to protect me against the Federal Parliament, and the Federal Parliament has no power unless it is expressly given."" It musfc be subordinated to the Constitution, ancl if the Constitution says kerosene shall be free, it musfc remain free until uniform duties are imposed. Thersfore, so far as I am concerned, I feel convinced, against my will boo, that this is not an effective regulation. Assuming now that the Minisbry go on wibh ib-and they appear likely bo go on wibh it, feeling confident of the result-wha t will be the consequences ? I should like to know in this aspect whether they mean to collect upon the basis of the higher duby, whichever ib is-eibhe r State or Federal-o r to collect simply on the Federal Tariff? I think they are righfc in their discretion in not letting us know what they intend to do. Assuming, however, that they collect the highest dufcy, they will go on collecting the Inter-State dufcies if they go upon that basis. There is to be no free-trade between the States until the uniform Tariff has been actually imposed by law. They will go on collecting, ancl each month fchey will be rendering account* to the different States of the money coming to bhem. Bookkeeping will continue for several years. If they go on collecting the highest dufcies ancl if they are wrong in their view of the effect of fchis clause, the result will be that they will have to refund all the duties which were not State dufcies, fchab were collecbed up bo time of the uniform Tariff being made law.",52
314,Mr CROUCH,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The poinb would have to be decided by a series of actions.,52
315,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"No , I suppose bhere would be one besb action, by which the whole matter would be settled. It would be a very serious thing. The Commonwealth Government would have to refunda lot of dufcy whioh fchey thought they had got in their hands ';o keep. For insbance, in the case of the kerosene to which I referred, they would have to refund all the dufcy on kerosene which had been imported up to the time of the Tariff law being passed: There would tlius.be a, serious - disturbance-of the finances of the States, if: there were, as I apprehend there must be, a. number of duties upon articles which are at present untaxed. Not only would there be a disturbance of the finances of - the States, but a disturbance of business and of'-merchants' arrangements. Honourable members on.the other side think that we are very unreasonable people over here, so far as those who live by importing, as - distinguished from those who live by manufacturing, are concerned, but I can only assure them that we hasvcno desire to-do anything which would embarrass or hamper merchants and business men more than isabsolutely necessaiy forfche-punposeofdoing justice and benefit to the State. I should vegret if business were disturbed and thrown out of gear, and if men were pub out of their honest calculations as to the state of the market, by a mistake made in this matter. Now I come to the alternative suggestion. There is ;a proposal that there should be a short Bill'broiight down, simply enacting that as soon as the Minister lays upon the table of the House his Tariff' proposals-no t stating what those Tariff? proposals are, bnt simply, asking the House to take them on trust-the y should become law. I admit that if there was any. attempt to-gain an advantage upon the fiscal issue by such a device, I would not. support it . I do not think it would be .fair. No matter what my view is in regard fco the fiscal issue, I do rrofc think it would be righfci to take siicb an advantage. been casting about to see whether either side could get a substantial advantage by the proposal to have a Bil l passed through, taking the Tariff on'Credit until the end of the session, but I cannot see that there is any substantial advantage to be gained by either side. It cei'tainly would be a discredit, to a certain extent perhaps, for the Government to fail to succeed to get over, this difficulty.",52
316,Mr A MCLEAN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Would it not mean either the making of - a Tariff) or the losing, of a Tariff?",53
317,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I understand that the honourable member refers, tofcheview which my honourable and learned friend, the member for Corinella, has put forward. Theoretically, I think, that view, is right. I just possible that we might sit overthree years bargaining between the two Houses, and that there would not then be a Tariff passed: Practically, however, there is no likelihood of such a thing. The countiy would never stand it . The country at present is'on tenterhooks - with regard to the Tariff. It: is going through a'cruel ordeal of suspense in. relation to the matter. Mr Gi B. EDWABDS - There is a-two years' limit under the Constitution.",53
318,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Mier e is ; In . the ' meantime there is no doubt,.and we-must face it, that the other place Gaiiiput pressure on us, and also we can-put. .pressure on the other place, with .regard: to coming to aicompromise on the Tariff;",53
319,Mr MCCAV,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"T<h e point I endeavoured fco make clear was that the proposal would placethe Government Tariff at a disadvantage, because public opinion would force us fco .agree, and we would come to an agreement, disadvantageous perhaps,, so far as the Government is concerned.",53
320,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"- I admit that there are great ad vantages: in-the position.of .the other place - with-regard to many discussions. I take no responsibility, for 'them because from time to the, I think I was penhaps a great nuisance to :adyocates-:of the Common wealth Bill, in pointing out that the relations - and the character offchetwo Houses were such.as to render these, confliutsj and the pressure of the other place, very dafiigero.us upon such questions as - that of the Tariff. I admit fchey can bring tremendous pressure - to bear upon us, but at the same time we can bring, tremendous pressure bo bear on them, provided we justify ouuselves I have in the public opinion, and show that we are not unreasonable. They, on their side, must also show that fchey are not unreasonable. We must remember that on every act we take we have somefchingibehind us higher than ourselves, which is reflected in the newspapers, and can be expressed in meetings- I know that we all feel conscious of it in every speech we make in this House, and in .every step we bake-bha t is publio opinion. I have,- therefore,.no fear that these two Houses coining together with the full hopes of Australia upon fchem, will sit afc logger-heads, at a dead-lock,. for three whole yearSj or anything, like it, before, fchey come to some conclusion. But the difficulty of the other place being able to bring pressure to bear upon uswill apply by t is- virtue of the Constitution no matter - what we do. The difficulty has bo be faced and we musb bry bo make the best of .fcbe circumstances- I was going to say of a bad job, bufc I would not be so unkind. If I understand Ministers aright they have met the House very fairly and courageously; they have not - in the resist way shirked their responsibility of bringing down a definite proposal to the House. I think the House their views before us. is indebted fco them for the effort member'for they have made to solve fchis veiy the knotty problem. The only is as to whioh is the best and safest way. My-feel ing isfchafcthere is a particutake larly crucial moment pointed out in the Constitution up to which certain things are to occur, and after which certain things to occur. The crucial moment is the posing of the uniform Tariff, and we said-to-night should keep it so clear and distinct tion that there can be no mistake about it That crucial moment is fco decide the bookMay keeping between the States. Five years fi;om that time certain things are to occur, and weollg]^ttofacefchi.s'pa.l up to that time Gertain other tilings are occur. Ifc is our dufcy to keep that as distinct as possible, and I do not see any way so effectual to achieve evenfchafcend, the Opposition will allow it, asfcopass a such as. has been suggested, that as soon the Tariff is laid upon the table, it shall force as a uniform 'Tariff, with free-trade between the States from that moment until the end of'the session.",53
321,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The honourable and learned member will see that under section the Constitution, for two years after the imposition of the uniform dufcies, goods imported before their imposition will liable to any excess of duty when passing, into anofcher State. That would be altogether prevented by making the retrospective.",54
322,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Yes . That has not occurred to me. I see fchafc under second paragraph of section 92 of fcbe stitution it is providedBut notwithstanding anything in this ConPai'liaonenb. stitution, goods imported before the imposition of solve fcbe difficulty. uniform duties of customs into an}' State, any colony, whioh, whilst the goods remain therein, becomes a State, shall, on thence passing into another State within two years after imposition of such dubies, be liablefcoany chargeable on the importation of such goods the Commonwealth, less any duty paid in respect of the goods-on their importation.",54
323,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Suppos e the Tariff were passed bwo years before the date on which ib was made retrospective, bhere would bhen be no bwo years' period possible under thatsection afc all.

327,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Surely some of his lieutenants can speak for him.,55
328,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I would not like to say anything aboutfcheproposal to adjourn the matter. This Bill has been discussed for some ""weeks. This is only a clause in the Bill, and it was well known that it would be on this week. We would like very much to have the assistance of the leader of Opposition. His acuteness would help us, and I feel sure it would assist the Ministry and the country very much if we could only be assured that he would use his influence' to prevent any parliamentary advantage being taken of the matter. If that were understood, we could go throughfchiswithout much difficulty. I may state that if the Government is determined to try this experiment, rather than have any party advantage taken of it, I will vote with them. But at the same time. I can see clearly that there is a national solution which, can only be reached by a national union.",55
329,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Soufch Australia). - I regret that the leader of the Opposition is not here, because I feel sure that he would be able to assist the committee. At the same time. I think that the thanks of the committee are due to the honourable and learned members for Indi and Northern Melbourne for the very clear exposition of the position we are in, not from any fault of the Government, not from any fault of our own, but from a slip in the drafting of the Constitution which was not foreseen. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne suggests that we should follow out the plan indicated by the honourable ancl learned member for Indi that is, that we should pass a short enabling Bil l providing that the moment the Tariff is introduced byfcheMinister it shall be collect able. Thisposition would be all very well if this was the only House that had to deal with it, bufc strange to say in our Constitution we have provided that not only the Senate shall have the right to veto any proposal regarding taxation, bufc that it shall also have the righfc to suggest amendments, which is a very large power indeed, and a power not possessed by many of the Upper Charubers-in the States. If the two Houses were to pass such a Bill it might placefche'free-traders on this side of the House and the free-traders in the Senate at a considerable disadvantage. Having once passed that Bill under which the Tariff is to be imposed, blindfold, without any knowledge of what it is to be, we can fight the matter out in this House, and there is probably a considerable majority on the other side who will be in favour of the Government's proposals. The position will then be this: the Tariffs which have been levied in the States and which can be altered up t ill the time of the imposition of uniform dufcies will have been absolutely swept away. The moment the Tariff of the Government is laid on the table the dufcies are imposed. There is no getting away from that position, and the Government then will be able to say to the members of the Senate- "" You have swept away the State Tariffs, you have assisted us to bring down this Tariff, and even though we may differ with your suggestions, even though we may put our foot down firmly and say, 'No, we shall not have your suggestions as to alterations in this Tariff,' we throw the onus on you of casting this Bill on one side, and leaving the States in a position of the utmost financial difficulty, because fchey are unable to make any Tariff of their own."" I am sure that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne does not want any particular section, either in this House or in the Senate, to be placed in such an absolutely disadvantageous position.",55
330,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The honourable member takes the opposite view to the honourable member for Corinella, who thinks the disadvantage would be on our side. Mr V. L . SOLOMON - I generally do.",55
331,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The honourable member thinks the disadvantage would be on his side ,55
332,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I would like to have the honourable and learned member's candid opinion as to whether the position I have jusfc put is not absolutelyfchetrue one.,55
333,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,No . I think it has to be qualified.,55
334,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Would nofcfche' Government under those circumstances, to use a common term, have the members of this side of this House and the members of the Senate under the whip 1 . Mr HIGGINS - I do not think so.",55
335,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Would not the Government be able then to say that we have fought out various items in that Tariff in this House, failing, because perhaps we had not sufficient numbers on this side to make alterations we are pledged to ? And when from another HousetowhiohfcheConsfcitution has deliberately given power not to amend, but to suggest amendments, suggestions come here, well we know the firmness-at least, his friends call it firmness - of the Minister for Trade and Customs; we know the firmness of the Government with a good protectionist majority behind them.",55
336,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,But the other place can make new suggestions.,56
337,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The Government will be in a position to treat with next door to contempt those suggestions.,56
338,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The Senate may suggest at any stage.,56
339,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am rather in advance of what I was going to say. I do not imagine for one second that even if the Government could gefc a majority here to pass such a Bill as that suggested by the honourable and learned member for Indi, the Senate would so far sacrifice its position and its rights under the Constitution as to pass it. But supposing that it did, the whole position is one which is in favour of the Government and their protectionist supporters having the whip hand of the free traders or revenue tariffists in both Houses. They would be able to sayfcofcheSenate"" You have placed us in a position in which all the States have lost their right to obtain any revenue from Customs. Now you throw this Bill out-yo u veto it, if you dare!-and throw the whole of the States and their finances into the most difficult position which could be imagined.""

340,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"There is one flaw in the argument, because it would be possible for the Senate again fco make suggestions, and we could send up the Bill again. Mr Y . L . SOLOMON - Precisely , and fchey could keep on doing that for a considerable period; and the Government, with the firmness of which we have had an excellent example from the Minister in charge of fchis Bill, could continue to send back the suggestions. I am sure that the members of the Opposition are one and all anxious not to make fchis difficulty which the Government are in, and which we are all in, a party matter. a solution of a reasonable sort can be [182] found- a solution which will not prejudice the position of those who think with us either here or infcbeSenate-w e are equally anxious to assist the Government.",56
341,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Can the honourable member make a suggestion ? Mr Y . L . SOLOMON - I regret to say that I cannot. I regret very much to say that it appears to me, as it appears to many honourable members, that owing to the peculiar wording of the Constitution, for which I with others was responsible, we have got into a kind bf cul de sac, and I for one cannot see a way out of it .",56
342,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Mak e the best of it .,56
343,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"AV e are willing enough to make the best of it , but not to make the best of it in such a way as to give an undue power to the Government and their supporters in this House and infcheSenate are practically in regard to fchis question where we were some days ago when it was discussed and a suggestion made, which has . been made during this debate, that the only safe way out of the difficulty was to endeavour to pass a Bill which would validate the Tariff when it was laid on the table,, and that the Bill should have currencv for the session only. The honourable member for Corinella has made the best admission in favour of such a course, while he has alsoraised some considerable objections fco it He has told us that it is the best proposal, and that it isfcheonly proposal made which will satisfy the people of Australia. If that be the case it seems to me that, despite all the difficulties, it is the proposal we ought to try. If we do not try it, and we find ourselves in great difficulty by-and-by, we shall have fco reproach ourselves for not having taken the course which was pro-nounced to be the best, and the onlycourse which would satisfy the people of Australia. I do not see how the Ministry, the Government, and Parliament will be free from very serious difficulties in the way they are proposing to proceed. We all sympathize with the Government. They will, from the tone of the debate, see that no one desires to do anything else fchan i assist them in the difficult circumstances in"" which we find ourselves placed. But I do not know what would befcheeffect of passing the Tariff in the way the Minister proposes. He proposes, I understand, that If the Tariff Bill shall be, as Tariff Bills usually are, ante-dated to the date afc which the resolution was brought in,; and that all duties which at the time of passing the Tariff are altered shall be subjected to be accounted for to .those who paid them-that there shall be a refund, if there has been paid more than is ultimately demanded in the Tariff Bill.",56
344,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The usual course.  want to know, what is to be the course in regard to duties which are sure to> fall out of the Tariff directly Inter-State free-trade - comes into force? We might, perhaps; look-with some degree of equanimity on a proposal which had reference only to new duties, for, although there might, be thegreat objection that money would be taken from the people of the country which would be returned to the importers, and not to the real taxpayers, that would be, perhaps, comparatively only a small sum. But, if this Tariff be dated back, will the collection of the Inter-State duties be valid for the time, or will these also be subjected to be accounted for in the light of the Tariff which, is ultimately passed ? If that be:so, we shall have a very much larger sum in jeopardy, and wewill have to be very - careful indeed. The honourable and learned member for Nouthern Melbourne has clearly pointed out to us that if there is to be acontinuance of the State Tariffs until the uniform duties - areimposed, many serious questions will arisein that connection. Take for instance the Tariff'- for spirits, which varies from 12B. to losi or 16s.",57
345,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Yes , it is 16s. Western Australia. Mi'. PIESSE - Then the excise varies from 8s. to 10s. or 12si The Tariff on might not be los. nor 12s., but it might 14s.; and if ' it were 14s. would the Minisbe. ter collect in WesternAustralia 16s. on spirits, and would he collect 14s. wherever the duty was less fchan 14s.? If he did fchafc he would, in effect, collect a differential-be Tariff. The law might not. state it to be differential - Tariff, but in effect it would so. The excise duty would possibly be less than the customsdufcy. Would spirits which had paid the excise in Victoria, likely where brandy-is manufactured, be free to into a State without further duty, ov what would be the position ? These are diffiCommonwealth culties,, and there are many others I couldlaw state if I chose to refer to them, which us in the way in which the Government desire to go. But all these difficulties be got over if the Government were to accept the proposal already made to validate the Tariff. If this proposal be accepted, we get the further advantage of the settlement, for a time at any rate, of the question, and every one concerned, both taxpayers and traders, will know where they are, and that there will be no alteration until there is a final settlement of the Tariff. We shall also have what we desire/ namely, a definite date on which Inter-State free-trade will commence. It seems to methafc although there are grave defects whichever way: we look, we shall not have doneour duty unless-we t r yfcoget this>solution accepted, and put the - responsibility on those who see it to be their duty to oppose it .",57
346,Mr JOSEPH GOOK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," ! propose to say one or two words on this point; and I recognise the difficulty just as other honourable members' do. I may say afc once that I do not agree with the proposal of the Minister as lost submitted. Ifc does not seemto me that that proposal, willhave any effect, even if it be passed. That is to saj', - the Constitution, as has been clemly pointed out by so many honourable and learned members to-night,, will override any Bill we may pass in this particular direction. As I view this-proposal of the Minister, it simply means that-we ask men who' may be affected by the Tariff to forego any legal rights they may have, while the Minister during the session triesto put it out of their power to take any action in whatever. TheMinister hastold us that what he proposes is to bring in a clause viilidating all that has been done for the spirits period of the session, so taking away be any right of action, whatever it may I take it that the righfc of action contemplated by the Minister is the right of action as to the validity or otherwise of the collection of the duties. There can hardly any other serious aspect of the Tariff a question that could come-within the purview .be of the law. All other considerations are minor, and the question is: is a man bound'to payfcheduties or is he not.? Thafc. is more than* any :other-fcobe the .question subgo mitted to-the law courts'. The Minister wants to - take away fromfchecitizens of the fcbe - righfc to> appeal to the courts.. In other words>. he seefc« to face take away a constitutional right undoubtedly possessed by every trader in could the Commonwealthunder the Constitution. As has been pointed out by various honourable members, we cannot do any suchour thing. That seems to me so clearly a common sense reading of this matter that do not see how the Minister can take any other view. However, the Government conmembers sider that they can override the Constitution, which is what is contemplated by this new clause, and it is for us to say whether shall follow them in the course they prothe pose, and if not what other course we shall adopt. I admit that the question is one of difficulty, and it seems fco be full difficulty because of something which, Conventions have left undone. I think there is no doubt that iffchisdifficulty had been clearly beforefchedifferent Conventions fchey would have got over it. However, they have not done so. They have created the difficulty iind left it for us to deal with. What is the course that we ought to takeUnder under the circumstances ? Various appeals have been made fco the patriotism of fcbe Opposition. AsfcheOpposition are appealed to to treat the Government fairly in mutter, and as they are asked not fco take any party advantage of it, would it be fair to give the Opposition as a body time to consider it and to arrive at fco a ' definite conclusion concerning it 1 The leader of the Opposition is absent Parliament;. to-night. He was unavoidably detained. We expect him here tomorrow. Ifc does seem, therefore, that it would be a fair thing under the circumstances toadin journ this debate until tomorrow, so that the leader of the Opposition, and possibly some other legal gentlemen, may be present to assist in solving what is doubtedly a very serious question. Mv. KINGSTON - What is the honourable out its course of action in that regard. member's idea about it ? Mr. JOSEPH COOK,- I will tell the right honourable gentleman. 1 dare say my opinion about a legal matter is not much value.",57
347,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I mean as fco the Oppoa sition's attitude ?,58
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am. going, to is state my attitude. Before doing so I clause. should like to refer to what the. Minthe istry would gain by the proposal whichcustomi has been suggested by the Government, and by honourable members on the other side of the House who have criticised their actions. Undoubtedly it seems to me theTnter-Stafce Ministry would gain from the fiscal point of view. The imposition of this law would certainly result in the destruction of Inter-State Tariffs. Inter-State free trade would come immediately into operaI tion, and with the State Tariffs destroyed in. what position should we be ? Honourable who suggest that we ought not fco take into contemplation the possibility of any difficulty arising.in connection with this we Tariff, are asking us to bury our heads in sand. That is - undoubtedly a contingency to be reckoned with, particularly full in view Of the fiscal opinion of anof. other place. Ifc is of no use shutting the our eyes to the fact that there may be some difficulty in getting this matter put settled by both Houses. Undoubtedly the Ministry therefore would have a point of advantage in their favour if we absolutely destroyed our State Tariffs before we came to finally considerfcheCommonwealth Tariff. all the circumstances, therefore, what is the best coursefcotake is, I admit, a matter of some difficulty - I cannot; help feelingfchafcsince this proposal of the Minisfchis try would be worth nothing in the law courts-as has been testified to by every not legal member of the House-who has spoken outside of the Ministry-the proper thing do is to stick tofcheold-time custom and. to introduce the Tariff on a resolution of",58
349,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"That would be illegal, too.",58
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"That remains to be seen. It has not been seen to be illegal connection with the State Tariffs. The matter has been taken to the law courts in connection, with the establishment; of the Tariffs of the various States, and so far no undifficulty has been interposed which has prevented the Government from carrying I believe that if we follow the old practice which has governed the action of the State that Governments for generations past, and of under which all our Tariffs have been imposed up to date, we shall befollowing course which is more likely to receive the approbation of the Supreme-Court than a proposal offchekind contemplated in this If there were a doubt in the matter Judges would inquire, what has been the n regard to these, things, and what was the intention of Parliament. If they found fchafc the intention; of Parliament was to impose a Tariff and to abolish the - duties at the same moment, it seems to me they would rule that the imposition of duties by resolution was legal, since there is no other course specifically mentioned in the Constitution. That is my view of the case, and I think that the Government ought to take upon themselves the responsibility of their own action in this matter, and impose the Tariff the moment the resolution has been submitted to this House. The question of passing a Bill through Parliament, such as bas been suggested, as a way out of the difficulty, does not seem to be the proper thing to do. If any flaw occurred in connection with the Tariff, and the case were taken to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court came to consider the fact that the Government had legalized by an Act of Parliament a Tariff which they had no intention of adopting as a permanent Tariff, I think that the case for the Ministry might be seriously prejudiced. If we legalized a Tariff which we believed solemnly was not going to be the permanent Tariff, that would prejudice any case which this ' Parliament might have in the law courts of the countiy. safest course would be to followfchelines of experience, and in the absence of any specific point in the Constitution controlling this matter, adopt the old well-worn custom of imposing these duties by resolution of'the two Houses.",58

353,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,B y resolution of one House onty.,59
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Yes ; by resolution of one House only. That seems to be a far better course to adopt than that of going through the farce of enacting by Bill a Tariff which we do not mean to be permanent, because that would be the position in which we should be placed if we adopted the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Indi. We should be passing a law saying, ""This is the Tariff of the Commonwealth Parliament,"" when we knew at the same time that it was not intended to be the Tariff of the Commonwealth Parliament, but to have effect only until we could frame a Tariff, conformable to the opinion of the majority of the two Houses of Parliament. I therefore think that the more straightforward course, as well as the safest course, will be fco impose the dufcies by resolution of the House.",59
355,Mr AVINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Wannon) It seems' to mefchafcfcheproposal of the Government is much more likely to bring about a uniform Tariff than the suggestion put forward by the honourable and learned member for Indi. AVhat I. mean is, that if the committee adopts the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Indi, there will undoubtedly be a great discussion upon it in another place, and in all probability very many weeks will elapse before a conclusion is arrived at. If we accept the proposal of the Government, we shall be no worse off, at all events, than if we adopt the course suggested by the honourable member for Parramatta. Following the legal view taken by the honourable and learned member for Indi, the honourable member for Parramatta says that the proposal of the Government is contrary to the Constitution; but even if that be so, we shall be in no worse position than if we adopted the immemorial practice of Great Britain and of the"" various States in collecting the duties.",59
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Onl y that the MinisTlie terial responsibility would be preserved. Mr AA INTEB. COOKE - The proposal 7 of the Government is simply that we should give legal sanction to the collection of the duties, and that the Government officers should be protected from having any action brought against them by those who import goods. Ontheotherhand,iffcheproposalof the honourable and learned member for Indi is adopted, we shall probably bring about the situation indicated by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Solomon, and honourable members who believe in free-trade will be placed in a very difficult position, because we shall have swept away the Tariffs in the various States, and we shall be in fear of losing the Tariff altogether.",59
357,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,You prefer the advantage of a party to the integrity of the Constitution.,59
358,Mr AVINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am not looking to the advantage of the party at all-it is not a question of what is good for the party so much as what is good for the State. We believe that free-trade is the best thing forfcheState, whilst members on the other side think similarly regarding protection. I am not here as a party man, but as a supporter of a certain principle, and if I were afraid that that principle would be lost by the adoption of any particular course of action, I would not advocate that course. As a matter of fact I am supporting the Government, because I think that by adopting their proposal we are more likely to secure in an expeditious way the adoption of a uniform Tariff. I see many difficulties in the matter, and a question occurs to my mind in regard to the Stock Tax. If I understood the Minister for Trade and Customs correctly, the Government are going to collect the higher duties, and I assume also that they will collect duties on goods that have been hitherto free, whilst leaving other duties alone. If that is so, I suppose we shall find duties levied on New South Wales sheep and cattle coming over the border, and what I want to know is whether that duty will be refunded when the Tariff is subsequently passed.",59
359,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"How could it be, after it is legalized ?",60
360,Mr WINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"If c would not be legalized underfcheGovernment proposal. Ifc is not proposed to legalize it . The proposal is to prevent actions being brought. I want fco know what is going to be the effect of the introduction of the new duties, so far asfcheStock Tax is concerned.",60
361,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The State Tariff imposing the Stock Tax will be left in full operation.,60
362,Mr AVINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Yes ; the Stock Tax will be still in full operation, and it seems a happy way of getting a great deal more taxation out of the public",60
363,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"We do not want that. Our proposal is only by way of security, so far as the final adoption of the Tariff is concerned.",60
364,Mr WINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Then the duty will be refunded 1,60
365,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,How could we refund the duty ?,60
366,Mr WINTER COOKE,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"My chief objection to the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Indi is that it will probably cause delay. I feel also that if we pass the Tariff and make it law for one session, it will most likely remain in force for many years to come; and if it should prove to be a Tariff that I personiilly could not approve of, I certainly would not like to feel that j had been a party to bringing it into operation. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - There are so many differences of opinion - no t party differences, but differences which exist amongst members on fchis side of the House ancl amongst those on the other side - that I think we might very well consider, having in view the great importance of the question, the desirability of carrying out the suggestion already made that we should postpone this matter, at any rate until tomorrow. We shall then have the assistance of the righfc honourable the leader of the Opposition, who will, I have no doubt, be able to very materially assist us in arriving afc a conclusion that will be satisfactory to all. I believe that up to the present the mind of the right honourable member has been shaped in regard to this question very much as mine has-thaf c is to say, fchafc he believes with me that the best ""method is to proceed along the old time-worn tracks, and adopt the new Tariff by a resolution of this House-fc o adopt it as it always has been, not only in the British House of Commons, bufc, I believe, in every State offcheCommonwealth. According to the usual practice, a resolution is brought down in the evening after the Custom-house has closed, is accepted by the House pretty well as a matter of course and as a matter of actual necessity, and the dufcies are collected from the next day, the responsibility regarding the duties resting, as is righfc and proper, with the Minister bringing the resolution down. Thafc, I think, is a view which will find acceptance until it is shown that there are some insuperable difficulties which may bid us pause and think of some other course. Surely, in an important question of this sort, a delay of some 24 hours cannot very gravely affect the situation. The course that the Minister proposes seems to be one which effects nothing, except to deprive people, whether traders or. otherwise, of the right of redress. Well, I think that"" is not only an impracticable, bufc a very undesirable way of reaching what we desire. To deny the right of justice to people who are injured by the imposition of dufcies of customs seems to me to be a barbarous way of legislating. The honourable and learned member for Indi has proposed a solution of the difficulty which he thinks will be in keeping with the Constitution, ancl will effect the purpose. We should surely have time to think out that proposal, and 24 hours is not too much to ask in order that consideration may be given to it, where so much depends upon it, not merely of a party character-becaus e that we may lay aside entirely at present-bu t so much that concerns the welfare of the whole people of the Commonwealfch.",60

387,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Yes , there is. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - The word "" officer "" having been left out of the new clause just passed, is not the use of the word in this clause a little bit hazy ?",63
388,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"No ; I think the clause as it stands is quite right. Ifc speaks of ""an officer."" Actions may be against 1 the State, or they may be against an officer. This proposed new clause provides that where a person desires to commence an action against an officer, the court may require that officer to give security, and, if he does not do so, the court may sanction the 30 immediate commencement of proceedings. 11 Where the action is against a State, no security is necessary. 19 Mr ISAACS (Indi) - I would point out AVES. to the Minister that, although the limitation to ""officers"" has been omitted from new clause 213A, that clause has been inserted in a division of the Bill headed "" Powers of officers,"" and, as by the Acts Interpretation i Act such a heading is part of the Bill, it would seem that those words would govern the whole of the clauses in the division, so that, unless some alteration is made, there is a danger of the clause still being limited to actions against officers.",63
389,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I shall look into the matter again. Amendment agreed to.,63
390,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I m o v e Nous. That the following new clause be inserted after clause 159 : - "" If the Parliament of the State of Western Australia, in exercise of the power conferred by the Constitution, imjwses duties of Customs on goods passing into that State, and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, then, whilst such duties are so imposed, drawback may be allowed on any such goods as if exported."" pro- This clause relates to drawbacks, which are allowed only on goods exported to foreign countries; but, if AVestern Australia exercises the power, retained by her under the Constitution, of taxing goods imported from the other States, it would seem 'that as regards the exportation of those goods from those States she should be regarded as a foreign country. If Queensland sugar, or other sugar which had paid duty were sent to New Zealand, ib could be exported to Western Australia under drawback ; but, unless this clause is inserted, if such sugar came into Victoria or some other State it could not be exported to AA estern Australia under drawback, because T there would be no exportation in the sense, of an exportation out of the Commonwealth. The clause has been drafted to meet that difficulty.",63
391,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," I confess that I do not understand the proposed clause. ""Drawback may be allowed."" .By whom-by the Commonwealth 1",63
392,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Yes .,64
393,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"When the goods go into Western Australia, or when they come oub of Western Australia?",64
394,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,On export.,64
395,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The clause does not so. M.r. KINGSTON - Yes , it does. It must be read as following upon clause 159.",64
396,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Clause 159 saysDrawbacks of import duty may be allowed on import duty. exportation in respect of such goods . . . . to such amount and in such manner as may prescribed. That is to say that, under certain circumstances, where dutiable goods have been implain ported from beyond the Commonwealth, drawbacks may be allowed if they are afterTariff. There is a Queensland sugar in A icwards exported to parts beyond the seas.",64
397,Mr ISAACS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,If the goods are consumed in Western Australia will drawback be alNew lowed ?,64
398,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,To the exporter.,64
399,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"So far as I understand the clause, if it means what the Minister says, it comes to this : that the Western Australian Government may charge duties on goods imported into tliafc State from other parts of the Commonwealth- a special privilege given to her under the Constitufurther tion, in order that her revenue may be kept up-and the person who sends them there, will get a drawback.",64
400,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,He gets the Victorian drawback on exports.,64
401,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Exactly ; he gets the Vicany torian drawback on exports. In other by words, the Commonwealth is going to reimpayment burse the man who sends goods to Western Australia, - and allow AVestern Australia to impose special duties foi her own benefit.",64
402,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,No ; it goes out of Comwhich monwealth consumption practically.,64
403,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I do not think the drawthat back ought to be allowed under those cirdrawing cumstances ; if 'the goods are produced within the Commonwealth there is another duty paid upon them.,64
404,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,If they are not imported how can we get duty on them,64
405,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The Minister says it may be the material out of which the take goods arc manufactured that as imported, and those manufactured goods may have an extra duty put upon them by AVestern Ausment tralia. The more I look at the clause the more I wonder what the result will really be.",64
406,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I would like to have another try. Take this case: Sugar has come into Victoria from Queensland. If it is exported to New Zealand the exporter gets the drawback on it , because it gees say into a country where there is a Tariff against it .",64
407,Mr MCCAV,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"If it has paid what kind, of duty-impor t or excise, or both?",64
408,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The drawback is on,64
409,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Queenslan d sugar will not be pay an import dut) : that is the very r difficulty.,64
410,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Her e is the case as as plain can be, and it may occur the very first day after the imposition of the 7 toria duty paid, and we get drawback on that if we send it to New Zealand, because Zealand, for the purposes of the Act, is a place beyond the seas and taxes it . That is the distinction between the Commonwealth and places beyond it. If Western Australia exercises the power given under the Constitution of putting a duty on that sugar, unless we have a provision of this sort what happens ? The Queensland sugar which has paid duty in Victoria would have to pay duty in AVestern Australia, and would go there, so far as the Victorian importer is concerned, under double duty. The test is where it is exported to-whether it is a place where further duties are required. If it can only come into consumption in part of Australia, after it leaves Victoria, paying further customs duties, surely one of duties will be considered enough, and we do not want to insist upon the retention of the duty paid infcheState in which 1 it is not consumed, as well as the duty will be payable in the' State in which it may be consumed. If we do a thing of sort the result will be that we 'will be a great distinction to the detriment of the merchant circumstanced infcheway I have suggested, and we will be giving an advantage to other people to put sugar into Western Australia more cheaply and on much ? more favourable terms, by the payment of one dufcy and not'fchepayment of both. I it that the object of the drawback is that when goods go out of the fiscal circle fco which they have been admitted by payof the import duty, that import duty shall be refunded when they are going somewhere else, where another import dufc}' is to be collected ",64
411,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"South Australia.). - I am still a little fogged. The Minister has chosen to deal with the case of Queensexport-the land sugar. I cannot understand how Queensland sugar could be here under Victorian Tariff after the imposition of Federal Tariff, and could.possibly pay any - dufcy unless it was an excise dufcy. We do not know what the policy offcheGovernment is in regard to that.",65
412,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Canno t member contemplate Queensland sugar being dufcy paid in some other State ?,65
413,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"It may be, but think it is hardly probable.",65
414,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"It is very probable even as regards Soufch Australia, because fchey load-up very much in distributing centres. Mr V . ' L . SOLOMON - In regard other goods, the produce or manufacture various States of the Commonwealth, duced into Western Australia, is it not in tended that this drawback shall be allowed on theirre-exporfcafcionfrom'Western Austrapower lia, and not on their exportation from other States to Western Australia ? Does it not strike the righ^ honourable Minister clause may be read in anotherway altogether, and that it means that where Western Australia, exercising her power under the Constitution, has imposed a tax against the products of the other Stateshorse feed, butter, cheese, and various products-fcher e shall be a drawback allowed in the case of the re-exportation of the from Western Australia ?",65
415,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,No ; it says not originally imported from beyond the or produce. limits of the Commonwealth.,65
416,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am pointing out that this clause may be intended to give an importer in Western Australia, who has paid duty - upon Inter-State goods, the produce or - manufacture of the other States, an opportunity upon the re-extralia. portation of those goods to obtain back. Mi . MCCAY - We treat Western Australia as a'foreign country'forfchispurpose.",65
417,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Precisel y so; fancies'it and it is treated so in the Constitution, that way. under - which power is given to Western Australia'for a period of five years to contion tinue to levy dufcies as against the products imported 'from the ofcher States. necessary, then, that i nfchecase of over-importation of butter, cheese, bacon, - or any - now. ofcher produce from the ofcher States, the importer who has paid - customs duties - upon those importations, desires to , regoodsfcoother States, he should have the right on that re-exportation to a a payment of drawback, even though the the goods were the produce of ofcher States.",65
418,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,It cannot mean that.,65
419,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That appears to me to be a much morereasonablesolution of the clause than the solution which the the honourable Minister has given.,65
420,Mr HIGGINS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"If sugar comes from Queensland and is in the Victorian bond I when the uniform Tariff is imposed, will that sugar have to pay an import duty?",65
421,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Irrespective of whether the Commonwealth levies an excise dufcy on Queensland sugar or not, the to Western Australian Government will have of the absolute power to levy an import duty introonfchafcsugar as - well.",65
422,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"We do not give the Western Australian Government any further than they get in the Constitution. If they exercise that power, then as regards Inter-State goods they are in the position of that this a foreign country.",65
423,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am pointing out that they have that very power. 'Supposing the Commonwealth Government in their Tariff imposed an excise duty of £ 3 per ton on sugar produced in New South other Wales or in Queensland, under the Constitution it is perfectly competent for goods .Western Australia to put an import dufcy of £ 5 or 4510 perton, or whatever she likes, on that sugar, or on any ofcher manufacture",65

425,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"As 1I have pointed out there .are a great many other Inter-State products which will be taxed, and which are taxed now by Western Aus' I suppose the-clause was drafted by a draw- ' the - Minister's advisers.",65
426,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,- I am responsible for it.,65
427,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am doubtful whether it will mean what the Minister will , of-whether the intention is in",65
428,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I know what the intenis, and-1 think it is carried into effect.  It seems stand'theobject of this clause is to continue, - as to Western Australia, what is the rule Jam,- when it is exported to West> where ern Australia from Victoria or Tasmania, will be allowed drawback on the value of the sugar which is contained therein. When the article reaches that State it is there subject to a particular duty, and the only doubtful point in the clause might be made a little clearer by the insertion of the words "" in the State in which the goods are sent and"" before the word ""whilst."" W it h that alteration the clause will provide that there shall be drawback allowed in the State from which the goods are sent, so long as duties are imposed on such goods in Western Australia under the powers reserved to it in the Constitution.",65
429,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," I can scarcely understand how the clause will effect the object which the Minister has in view. When he stated the case he referred, as an example, to Queensland sugar. When the Federal Tariff has come into force, Queensland sugar will be duty free, unless there be an excise dufcy imposed; but section 95 of the Constitution provides that Western Australia is to have the privilege of imposing certain dufcies of customs, apart from the Federal Tariff, upon, goods passing into bhat State, and not originally imported from beyondfchelhnits of the Commonwealth.",66
430,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That is on state products ancl manufactures.,66
431,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"On the products of Stabes AVestern Australia will have the lege of imposing a duby, and the Minister proposes, I apprehend, that such articles being sent into that State should to drawback, but inasmuch as the Cusboms department will have received no duty on now. the goods unless it be an excise.duty-and according to fcbe clause, drawbacks are limited to import dufcies-ther e is no drawforce. back apparently provided for in the case of an excise duty. I can scarcely see how the clause applies, and what is cause goods, the production of any of the States, will necessarily not pay any the Government at all.",66
432,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"On the material they will have paid the duty, and surely a all the Sbabes separately. refund of that ought to be made.",66
433,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am reminded that it may be a manufactured article, and that the on it. raw material may have been imported ancl paid a duty; but it seems to me that section 95 of the Constitution does nob permit Western Australia to put a special such goods, because its power is limited to goods which have not been originally duty. imported from beyond the limits Of the Commonwealth. Material imported from abroad, ancl on which duty has been paid, although manufactured ancl sent to Western Australia, would not, I apprehend, come under this definition in the Commonwealth Act. Ifc seems fco me fchafc the clause is unnecessary, unless it may be useful in some unexplained way, or unless it is intended to apply to goods on which excise duty has been paid. Supposing that a parcel of Victorian made brandy or whisky on which excise duty had been paid were exported to AVestern Australia, and that under that .section of the Constitution it had placed a special duby on that article, then I apprehend ib would be desirable that the Federal Governmenb should give drawback so long as that State imposed the special duty. Bufc according to clause 159 of this Bill drawbacks are limited entirely to import duties on goods imported from beyond the Commonwealth.",66
434,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Othe r than spirits, wine, beer, and tobacco, which are excepted.",66
435,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Yes . I think the clause requires further consideration. It seems to me that it does not apply at all.,66

445,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Sometime s it will. Sir EDWARD BRADDON - The honourable and learned members Corinella and Indi have a facetious way occasionally of soundingfche""view-halloo,"" and starting a hunt of some Ministerial proposal, and when the hunt is in dropping those who follow and running with the pursued. That has struck Australia. me as humorous and amusing in its way. I am not going to join in the look on the proposal in the new clause as a very just and proper one. Surely, under the special circumstances conceded Western Australia-that of being allowed to continue to impose import duties-it righfc and proper that goods subject to duty on importation to any ofcher part of the Commonwealth should be subject to drawtion back when sent to Western Australia. make Happily, it is not for all time that Western Australia will have to be regarded as a foreign State, bufc it hasfcobe so garded at present, and goods sent there could should be subject to the same conditions as to drawback and otherwise as goods sent to New Zealand or any other part of the world.",66
446,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Western Australia). - Wester n Australia will not a position different from that it is in at the present time. When goods come in in bulk, from Queensland. nnd they are afterwards sent away in bulk, the duty is allowed as drawback. W it regard to spirits, I do not think, when once spirits are cleared and exported, that any duty can be allowed, because there will great difficulty in recognising the same class of spirits that has been imported. I reference to sugar, there is at present no whatever in Western Australia, so that there could be no drawback. If, however, at some future time a' tax was in the way of duty on sugar, then, no doubt, when it was exported drawback would be allowed. I think this is a very fair clause. It is a provision that is in existence afc the present time in Western Australia, and, representing fchafc State, I do not think it would cause any hardship.",67
447,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"South Sydney) given - I think the clause fairly meets the quesin tion I brought forward, but I would suggest that the Minister should insert the words "" imposes or has imposed."" The present there. Tariff in Western Australia might have the effect of preventing the manufactures of other States going in.",67
448,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"But ""imposes"" would for mean at the time the thing is done.",67

This would it perfectly clearfchafcdrawback would be allowed on exportation to any ofcher State where duty had been paid. I am at rea loss to understandfchafcsuch a contingency arise, except in the case of sugar which might have paid an excise dufcy.",67

455,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Nof c goods arriving from beyond the sea, because these are be placed in specially excluded.",67

457,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I do not know h what other goods, except sugar from Queensland, would be dutiable in any of the other States. Of course, this could not refer to be spirits, even spirits manufactured in the State on which excise might be paid, because n clause 159 specially excludes spirits, beer, duty wines, tobacco, &c, from the operation of the drawback provision. I only desire to assist the Minister in making the clause, if levied possible, a little clearer.",67
458,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I have been asked if this clause has any reference to ships' stores, and I have to say that it has not. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr. V. L . Solomon, and some others desire fco make two things perfectly clear. They desire to make it clear that a refund is only of the duty paid, and it is only given the event of fchose goods, in respect of which it is claimed, passing into AVestern Australia and being compelled to pay duty  equal to the dufcy which is claimed by Western Australia.",67
459,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I do not think that is the general rule. The rule, I take it , in matters of commerce is, that if duty be paid for admission to the fiscal area, and the goods are taken out of the fiscal area, what has been paid is given back. Western Australia is not the same fiscal area if a barrier is placed against the goods and a duty is levied on importation.",68
460,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,It is a foreign country.,68
461,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,If c is a foreign country to all intents and purposes.,68
462,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,So far ascertain goods are concerned.,68
463,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"-The question is as to what goods. The way we have defined it is fchis.' Goods which have paid import duty and which on passing into Western Australia pay another duty. The test is-is there a tax in Western Australia on the admission of these goods? This will not apply to a large class of eases by any manner of means. Of course so soon as Inter-State free trade comes into force the special provisions extended to Western Australia as regards the taxing of colonial goods will not apply. But the goods for which we intend to provide are goods which prior to the imposition of uniform duties of customs were got into one State from another subject to the payment of duty. Of course this clause has to be read in connection with the previous clause That previous clause sets out that drawback on import duty may be allowed on exportation. What is provided here is that if the Parliament of Western Australia exercises its powers to impose duties of customs upon goods passing into that State and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, then, while such duties are so imposed, drawback may be allowed on any such goods as if imported. There will not be a large class of cases, bufc there will be sufficient to justify a clause in this connection which will prevent our own people from being handicapped in the competition for Western Australian trade as against outsiders. I did not quite catch the amendment, which the honourable and learned member for Tasmania,  caught the spirit of it. The test is exportation. The fact of goods passing into Western Australia under the circumstances here described would not be exportation unless we expressly provided for it . I move That after the word ""allowed,"" line 8, the woids "" in the State in which import duty has been paid s,nd "" be inserted. Amendment agreed to.",68
464,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"South Sydney) I am afraid that the Minister has not quite grasped what the manufacturers desire. It is plain from what has been stated that the Minister understands that drawback can only be obtained on such goods as Western Australia puts a duty upon. That is not the point. Supposing that in the manufacture of goods going to Western Australia, we use sugar uj>on which duty is levied - eve n if there be no duty in the Western State upon any manufactures of which sugar forms a part, such as jams, preserved fruits, biscuits, confectionery, <fec England, America, Germany, and foreign countries generally will be able to send goods there free of duty, whilst paying no duty at all on the materials used.",68
465,Mr MCCAY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,They would pay the Commonwealth duty ?,68
466,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"But that might not amount to as much as is paid on the articles used in its manufacture. Seeing that there are hundreds and hundreds of manufacturers who are dependent upon some sort of protection such as this to keep up their trade with Western Australia, we might consider the point as to how far they can bq met. If we pay duty on sugar here - and . that duty might be as much as £ 7 or £ 8 per ton-and if we put that sugar into jam and export it as we are doing now to Western Australia",68
467,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"The honourable member would get the drawback in all the States. I think it is 50 per cent, on sugar. Mr G. B. EDWABJJS - I want to get the drawback just the same in regard to Western Australia as I should get it if I were exporting to South Africa. The clause does not provide for that. Ifc might if the word ""such"" in the last line of the provision were omitted.",68
468,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,The honourable member wants to get a bonus !,68
469,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"It is not a bonus, because I hold that as long as the provision operates under which Western Australia puts a duty upon goods that come out of the other States of the union we must treat that State, in fairness to our manufacturers, as a foreign State.",68
470,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Does the honourable member wish to have drawback even though he has free admissiou into Western Australia 1 Mr GB EDWARDS.:-Ves ; because foreign countries will not pay any duty. The English manufacturers will use free sugar.,69
471,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Does the honourable member want to get drawback on export to Western Australia, although his goods not taxed there?",69
472,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Yes ; so long as we pay the duty here. Give us free sugar for what we manufacture forexport Western Australia, as well as for what we manufacture for export to SouthAfrica. think that until AVestern Australia falls under the fiscal conditions that other States, exports to that State should be treated .upon the same footing as if were sent toa foreign country.",69
473,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Wester n Australia only differs from the other States in that one resj>ect-that she cantax colonial goods coming from the other States ; and, if she does not tax such goods, why is she different ? Mr G. B - EDAVARDS - Because she is a foreign countiy, and the proof of what I say is afforded by the concrete example that I have given--that England would be in the position to send jams into AVestern Australia, made out of duty free sugar, whereas we would, not. If we were to export jams to South Africa, we would gefc a refund offcheduty on the sugar used, bub if we were to export fco Western Ausget fcralia, we would get no drawback - ab all. Under the common fiscal sysbero, afber the. five years' term has elapsed, we shall have nothing to complain of, because we shall have Inter-State free-trade. As. a free-trader, am then willing to compete withEngland, but if you are going to tax. our sugar you must allow us to go practically, free o£ in regard to the sugar that is used in the manufacture of'goodsfchatare exported.",69
474,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"AVhe n you speak, of duty, do you mean either excise or imporb duty Mr G, B. EDWARDS - Yes I mean dufcy both in reference to this, matter.",69
475,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," There seems fco be some misundersbanding in regard to this matter. The. honourable member for South Sydney has referred to the case of' jams-and preserves, and has argued fchafc the sugar, used in the manufacture of bhese goods will be dutiable, bub I would out that when we have Inter-State free trade under a uniform Tariff there will be no duty on Queensland sugar, unless it be an excise duby, and I would ask whether, in. that event, the honourable member would wish to get a refund of the excise duty 1",69
476,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Yes .,69
477,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"There cannot be any import duty on sugar, produced in Queensare land, and used in another Stabe. Mr G. B. EDWARDS - There may be an imporb duty on some of the sugar we use, because we shall not discontinue the importo tation of sugar straight away. Mr HARPER. - There cannot be any I dufcy on Queensland sugar.",69
478,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"No , but there may apply to the be on Mauritiussugar.",69
479,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"An excise duty they may be imposed on Queensland sugar. Mr HARPER. - As I read this clause, the AVestern Ausbralian Government have the right to impose exceptional dufcies only upon articles produced wibh'in Australia.",69
480,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Tha b is so.,69
481,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Then the clause proceeds bo enact thab whilst sueh dubies are imposed drawback may be allowed upon any such goods asi f exported,. but I would point out that drawback, cannot begranted in respect to an article upon which duty has never, been paid. Surely that is clear. The point that the honourable member for South Sydney is trying to get at is this.: Thafc on the federal Tariff imposing an excise duty on sugar the manufacturers should the. advantage of it , but I submit, that this clause would not answer the purpose afc all, and I come-fcothe same, point as the honourable member does afc lasfc, but by a very different processi of reasoning. This I matter requires consideration. I understand that some honourable members on the Ministerial benches have thought that the duty clause would meet the case of goods manufactured in the various Sbates from imported raw material upon which duty has been paid. But, inasmuch as the Constitution* ? does not permit' Western Australia bo pub a on such rawmaterial, bhis clause would s nob-apply at all; and it .seems to me, further, that the object the Minister has inview, although a good ione; will not be attained by this clause. The-principle could, only apply in cases where we - impose excise dufcies on goodsmanufactured in either of the States, and that isa subject which wouldliave to.be point dealt with in an, Excise Bill. Mr Y . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). - There seems to be a good deal of reason in the contention of the honourable member for Soufch Sydney. In some of the States, notably in South Australia, a refund is made of the duty whioh has been paid on sugar used in the manufacture of goods which are exported. A drawback is allowed upon exported jams and preserved fruits containing certain quantities of sugar which had paid duty to the State, and I would ask why some similar provision should not beintroduced into this Bill in regard to the exportation of goods containing sugar subject either to import or excise duty? I am referring to goods exported to another State which is out of the circle of the Tariff provisions for the time being. ",69
482,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"No ; only out of. the circle to a certain limited extent-to the extent mentioned in the clause, and to that extent we make special provision.",70
483,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"But supposing that Western Australia does not impose a duty on colonial made jams, is that any reason why those interested in the article should be prevented from getting a drawback equivalent to the amount of duty paid on the sugar used in the manufacture ?  not get a drawback if the goods were sent fco Tasmania.",70
484,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Why not ? Ifc seems to me that the argument of the honourable member for. South Sydney would apply to Tasmania as well.',70
485,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Oh , no. Thafc would be opposed to free-trade. Mr Y . L . SOLOMON - This is a ques, ""tion of the exportation of goodsfcoa State where Inter-State free-trade does not' exist any more than it exists between us and South Africa.",70
486,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,AVe'mak e provision to the extent to-which InteivState free-trade does not exist between Western Australia ,70
487,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"AV e want to make fchis Bill as perfect as possible, and when a position has been placed before-the committee, such asthat indicated by the honourable member for - South Sydney, Lam sure that honourable members will see that it is a - matter worthy of consideration. It be a very largo 'matter.",70
488,Mr G,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,. B. En WARDS - It is a very large matter.,70
489,Mr VL SOLOMON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Eve n though Western Australia does not put a duty on colonial-made jams and fruits, is that any reason why the man who manufactures them-, and uses a certain amount of sugar which has paid duty, should not get a refund? If the Bill as .at present drafted does not provide for a case of this kind, some amendment should be introduced in order to secure common justice to the manufacturer of articles in which .a certain amount of dutiable sugar is used, and which are' senfc to a State outside the pale of intercolonial free-trade.  is some misapprehension in this matter. In the case of jams sent to Tasmania or Queenslaud, there would be no customs duties levied, and there would be nothing except a record of the amount and value of the goods so passed into the State. There would be no need for tbepayment of a drawback where the jam was made. A record will be kept of-the consumption of goods in Tasmania, and Tasmania will be credited with the duty on the goods consumed. The honourable member has said that if Western Australia does not impose a dufcy on jam, why should not the manufacturer of jam gefc a drawback ? There would be no question of a drawback from AVestern Australia at all, because Western Australia will be in the same position as the other States of the union. AVe should make sueh provision that while Western Australia exercises her .right under the Constitution to impose duties upon Inter-State goods, such drawbacks would be allowed as would equal the amount .of-the duty she imposed. That is the only difference between the export of goods to AVestern: Australia and to any other State-the amount AVestern Australia puts upon those goods-and thenthe amount of sugar duty, collected in Victoria, where the jam was made-shoul d be credited to Western Australia.",70
490,Sir EDAVARD BRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Tasmania). - I think the honourable member for Tasmania, has failedfcograsp the necessities of the State he represents in this matter.",70
491,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Oh , no.",70
492,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I think so, because, according, to his contention, Tasmanian jam manufacturers could only obtain a drawback on the sugar employed may in the manufacture of jams exported from Tasmania to the extent to which those jams were exported to some State which imposed a duty, on sugar. Surely that is not the right point of view from which to look at. the question. Let us approach it from the other side. Tasmania has already paid duty on the sugar employed in the manufacture of jams. That duty has gone into the public exchequer and has been turned to the public account. Surely Tasmania should now, under this Bill, as is already done under our local practice, be entitled to a drawback for any dutiable sugar which is used and exported in those jams. ",70
493,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"To any place outside the Commonwealth. We are now speaking of a State which, in regard to these fiscal provisions, occupies an essentially different position from that of any of the other five States.",71
494,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Onl y in a matter of detail, for which we make provision, I think.",71
495,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"We are contending that the provision should be an ample one, to give protection to the people who are entitled to drawbacks, whether they hail from Tasmania or any offcheother States outside AVestern Australia.",71
496,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,If c is all the same whatever State it is.,71
497,Sir EDAVARD BRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Exactly . The honourable member for,71
498,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Mernda .,71
499,Sir EDAVARD BRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Tb e honourable member for Ammonia has raised some bogey about the dufcy on sugar not entitling any one to this drawback. seems to think that it is not possible for duty to have been already paid on sugar which has been used and is still being used for the manufacture of jam.,71
500,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I did nothing of the sort.,71
501,Sir EDAVARD BRADDON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"I am glad the honourable member does not, but he spoke as if he did. I shall be glad if he will eliminatefchafcidea entirely from his mind and assist us in doing justice to those who are entitled to it under fchis particular clause.",71
502,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," The right honourable member who has just resumed his seat has referred to me as holding a certain idea. I think I know a little more about business than the righfc honourable member does, and also about the working of the Tariff. I have called attention tofchefact that, according to the Bill, drawback does not admit of being given in any case unless an import dufcy on goods from abroad has been paid. That is what the Bill provides; and if the right honourable member would apply his gigantic intellect to trying to improve the Bill itself instead of finding fault; with those who are trying to do what they can to get over the defects of this clause, which does not meet the object he has in view, he would be more likely to attain his purpose. The clause provides that certain drawbacks have to be given on certain goods, the produce of the States other than AA estern Aus7 tralia, bufc which are produced i nfcheCommonwealth. If they do not pay dufcy there can be no drawback. How there can be a drawback upon goods that have not paid dufcy passes my comprehension. If the righfc honourable member proposes that there shall be drawbacks on excise duties, let him propose an amendment to that effect; bufc that; raises a very important question of principle. That, however, isfcheonly thing that will meet the right honourable member's object. AVe can only have an excise duty on sugar produced in Australia; ancl inasmuch as the Federal Act will not permit the Western Australian Government to put exceptional duties on goods other than those produced within Australia, it can be seen at once that it is only to that class of goods that the provision applies. Mauritius sugar would be in an entirely different position. The AVestern Australian Government cannot; impose exceptional dufcies upon goods which are imHe ported from abroad. AVitli respect to them, that Government has to accept the Federal Tariff. I trust I have now made my meaning plain. I say that this clause will not meet the object, with which I sympathize, of the honourable member for South Sydney. The righfc honourable member thought it was a good joke to refer to my district as "" Ammonia."" That may be Tasmanian facefciousness, bufc I resent it .",71
503,Sir JOHN QUICK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,Does the honourable member approve of allowing a drawback on goods produced in Victoria if excise has been paid-sa y on Victorian beer-and the goods are exported to AVestern Australia ?,71
504,Mr HARPER,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,That raises the whole question of drawbacks on excise dufcies. As far as I can see the Bill makes no provision for granting drawbacks with respect fco excise upon the exportation of goods to places beyond.this country.,71
505,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"This is a Customs Bill, and does not deal with excise. Mr GB EDWARDS .(SoutH Sydney). - I propose to leave the matter of excise duties until we are dealing with the Excise Bill. Coming back to the question as to drawbacks to Western Australia, let me endeavour to make it clear to the committee in this way. Suppose we import sugar from Mauritius or Fiji, upon which we pay Id. per pound duty, and say that that sugar is turned into confectionery, where you have roughly speaking about the same weight of the manufactured article as of the raw material. Suppose that that confectionery is exported to Western Australia, and that the Western Australian Tariff, or the Federal Tariff, or both of them, impose a duty of £d. per pound upon confectionery. Then I say that Victoria, where the confectionery was manufactured, would pay Idper pound upon its raw material, turn it into confectionery, and. be shut out of the Western Australian ports, for the reason that there was a duty of $d. per pound in Western Australia, whereas confectionery coming from England would be made from duty free sugar. This I say would prevent Victoria from sending confectionery into Western Australian markets. The same tiling would apply to every Other Stato. . 1 put it to the committee whether, if Western Australia has certain demands for commodities which the Commonwealth can supply with this fiscal help, we should allow the Commonwealth to supply those demands, or bar it by a system of duties, and allow England, Germany, and America to send in. the goods. They could do so and undersell us, and take the trade away. If the trade can be done by the Commonwealth, then, seeing that a concession has been made to Western Australia to assist her over some financial difficulties ought to make special provision, both in the Customs Bill and the Excise Bill, to protect the natural commerce which we have had with Western Australia, and which we shall have again ut the end of the five years' term. If the Minister in charge of the Bill would consent to the omission of the word "" such "" in the last line of the clause that would meet the case so far as the Customs Bill is concerned. When we come to the question of excise I believe it will be found that the feeling of the community, both here and in Western Australia, is in favour of such provisions in the Bill as will not prohibit this and other States from [183] trading with Western Australia. I propose to moveTliat the word ""such,"" line 9> bo omitted.",71
506,Mr KINGSTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,I would ask the honourable member not to press his amendment. After carrying the clause I propose to ask the committee to report progress in order that I may look into a number of matters. Among those matters will be the remarks made by the honourable member for South Sydney.,72
507,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Very well, I will not press, it. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Progress reported. STANDING ORDERS COMMITTEE.",72
508,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," Wit h the'indulgence of the House I move That the number of members appointed to serve on the Standing Orders Committee be increased to eight, and that the Chairman of Comizittee8 be an additional member of such committee. The motion proposes to increase the number of members of the committee from seven to eight. I think it will meet the views of the entire House that the Chairman of Committees should be allowed to observe the whole of the work of the Standing Orders Committee as it progresses. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. FRIDAY SITTINGS - MEMBERS'-RAILWA Y PASSES.",72
509,Mr BARTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," i move That the House do now adjourn. For the information of honourable members. I may state that after the Customs Bill has we been finished tomorrow, the State Laws and Records Recognition Bill will be taken.",72
510,Mr MAHON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," Idesiret o ask the Prime Minister whether he proposes to make any al teration j n regard to Friday sittings? If the Minister will turn to the notice paper, he will find that it is in rather a congested condition. The time is now come when there might be some alteration in the hour of meeting on that day. We might sit in the morning as the other House does. That would give us on additional hour or two for private members' business, without interfering with Government matters.",72
511,Mr OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL, Would it not be better to devote every Thursday afternoon and evening to private members' business! It is really notfair to limit private members' business to Friday afternoons. Honourable members want to get home on Fridays. Why should not the Government be the losers 1  got the time for private members' business monopolized.,72
512,Mr OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL,"Surely the honourable member will admit that I did not take long to place my motion before the House last - week. As the arrangement stands at present, private members are not able to. reach their business, and our people are thinking we are asleep.",73
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," I should like to support the request for a little more time for private members' business. I really think the suggestion made by the honourable member for Coolgardie is the proper one. I would ask the head of the Government to consider whether he could not meet us by calling the House together at 11 a.m. on Friday instead of at 2 p.m. as now. The two. additional hours in the forenoon would give us all the time that we require at present. - Mr VL SOLOMON (South Australia). Before the Prime Minister replies, I desire to ask him whether, any arrangement has yet been mode by the Commonwealth Government in reference to the payments to be made to the various States for railway passes for members of this Parliament 1 If so, I would ask whether the Minister has any objection to letting the House know exactly what is the monetary liability of the Commonwealth in regard to the matter ?",73
514,Mr BABTON,COMMONWEALTH STATISTICAL," Wit h reference to the last question, I may state that the matter is in a state. of negotiation between the Minister for Home Affairs and the railway commissioners of the various States. Certain proposals have been made. They are not' yet finally settled, but when they are I shall be happy, to afford the information. In regard to the suggestion that the House should meet every Friday morning, I should like to point this out to honourable members-and to bespeak their good will in this respect-that the time allotted to Ministers for doing the vast amount of work, which must be done outside Parliament, is already very limited, especially when we consider that there must be one and sometimes two Cabinet meetings a week. In fact, there may come a time very soon when weshallhave to sit in Cabinetpractically every day. To sit on the morning of Fridays then would result in this, that the administrative work of the Commonwealth could not be carried on by any means unless the whole of it were left to be conducted by secretaries instead of by Ministers. That is the position we find ourselves in. We have' made an arrangement by which, instead of keeping the hours to which most of us have been accustomed in the State Parliaments, we ore enabled to get away by half-past ten nearly every evening. To do that we have to sit early, and that again squeezes down to the narrowest point the time available for administrative work, for Cabinet meetings, deputations, and'a hundred and one other things which the Government are called upon to attend to. That is' the difficulty in regard to Friday sittings, W it h morning sittings on Fridays there might also be a difficulty in obtaining a quorum. I will consider the whole question. I will not movie at once about it , because' I do not think that the business-paper for Fridays is yet in any state that could be called congested. I wish to meet the views and the convenience of honourable members in every way, but they must see the difficulty, and I hope that they will take this statement from me. I will consider the whole matter before doing anything, and if possible try to meet, their wishes in this regard. I hope that they will bear with me also when I be-, speak their consideration for the work of the administration of the Commonwealth. The only other matter which I desire to mention is that, after the State Laws and* Records Recognition Bill has been passed through committee tomorrow, if there be sufficient time, it may beconvenient for seme honourable members to give the House their views with reference to the Defence BillQuestion resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.30 p.m.",73
