1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Littleton Groom) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. PBOHIBITED IMMIGRANTS .",13
2,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"I draw attention to the very grave disclosures during recent weeks of the smuggling into the Commonwealth of prohibited aliens. In view of the fact that similar cases have occurred at Port Adelaide, and that there has been an unfortunate weakening of the searching branch of the Customs Department by the transfer of Detective Burford to other duty, will the Minister for Trade  officer, or another equally experienced, is placed in charge of the searching operations atJPort Adelaide?  to admit that the control by the Customs Department has weakened. I think it was generally agreed by honourable members last week that the department continues to zealously protect the interests of the Commonwealth in this matter. However, j shall make inquiry as to the exact position. INSPECTION OF FOOD.",13
3,Dr NOTT,Unknown,"Givin g evidence recently before the Royal Commission on the Constitution of the Commonwealth, Dr Cumpston, the Commonwealth Director General of Health, said that the inspection of imported food is not a function of the Health Department, and so far as that duty was performed, it was carried out by the Customs Department. I desire to know what are the qualifications of the inspectors who are permitted to make examinations of food on behalf of the Customs Department ?",14
4,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,"I shall ascertain what are the qualifications of these officers, who carry out what we .all admit is a most important duty. NA OFFICIALS.",14
5,Mr COLEMAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Is it a fact that - owing to the failure of the central administration of the War Service Homes Commission to authorize the employment of additional staff, the employees of the New - South Wales branch are being overworked? In addition to much overtime, are the employees compelled to take work home to enable them to overtake arrears, for which they receive no remuneration? Has the Commonwealth Medical Officer for New South Wales made a report to the Chief Medical Officer of the Commonwealth on these speeding-up methods, directing attention to several breakdowns which are attributed to this cause? Will the Minister for Works and Railways ask the Public Serviee Board to conduct an inquiry into the working conditions of this department?",14
6,Mr HILL,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I do not know that the staff of the War Service Homes Department in New South Wales is overworked; I rather think that the reverse is the case. However, I shall have inquiry made, and let the honourable member have a reply to his questions. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",14
7,Mr HUGHES,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I should be glad if the Treasurer would state at the rising of the House the order of business for tomorrow ancl next week, to assist honourable members in making their arrangements.",14

9,Mr LAZZARINI,COMMONWEALTH BA NK,"Following up the question I asked yesterday, will the Treasurer ascertain whether it is a fact that the Bank of New South Wales has a special arrangement with the Commonwealth .Bank whereby it can receive accommodation up to from £300,000 to £400,000 at 3 per cent.",14
10,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BA NK,"The arrangements made between the Commonwealth Bauk and its clients, including the varimust ous private banks, are matters for the bank administration itself, and I do not see that it is possible for me to inquire into such matters.

11,Mr JACKSON,CANBERRA TO JERVIS BAY,"I direct the attention of the Minister for Home and Territories to a paragraph in yesterday's Daily Guardian, Sydney, headed "" Canberra Seaport. Bright future for Jervis Bay."" The paragraph statesOnce the railways are constructed-and probably this work will engage the attention of the Federal Parliament at on early datethe whole south-eastern hinterland of New South Wales will pour its products into' this magnificent sheltered shipping port. The item is printed, apparently, as news, but is obviously an advertisement, the name and address at the bottom being ""Henry F. Halloran and Co., 82 Pittstreet, Sydney."" I desire to know whether that is the company that was responsible for the alleged swindle in Loudon a few years ago, when what was described as the nearest land to Canberra was offered for sale, and whether the Government intends to take action in the matter ?",14
12,Mr MARE,CANBERRA TO JERVIS BAY,"I have no knowledge of the in t e n t i o n of the Government to p r o ceed' with the c o n s t r u c t i o n o far a i l w a y from Canberra to J e r v is B a y .

What materials are employed in the construction of ceilings and partitions between rooms ? 4. What would be the difference in cost if the same dwellings were constructed of brick or concrete, including concrete or brick interior walls finished in plaster? 5. What is the rent of a four-roomed wooden cottage ? 6. What would be the rent of a similar cottage constructed of brick? 7. In the event of an outbreak of fire occurring in the areas where wooden dwellings prevail, would existing fire-fighting appliances be sufficient to cope with the danger of the conflagration spreading to other buildings in the event of a high velocity wind blowing in their direction? S. Ts it the intention of the commission to continue the erection of permanent wooden dwellings in the Territory?",15

If so, will he give effect to this promise by seeing that the prices of houses in Canberra are reduced 20 per cent.? ",15
16,Mr MARR,PARLIAMENTARY,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. The intimation by the Government was that it did not desire any public servant to suffer nnancial loss caused by or due to his transfer to Canberra, that it would, therefore, arrange for the formulation of a scheme to deal with the question of the disposal of the Melbourne homes of public servants, and with the question of obtaining homes for them at Canberra, and also that it had under consideration the making of regulations to govern the transfer to Canberra of the families and effects of public servants. In all these respects, the Government made provision for the protection of public servants against loss. 3.

Is the statement correct that the Commonwealth Bankruptcy Jurisdiction, Administrative Office, will not be permitted to be located in the Federal Territory? 3. If ' so, will he state in what portion of Australia the bankruptcy jurisdiction will be administered? 4. Is it a fact that the Chief Law Officer of the Commonwealth, the Solicitor-General, will carry out his duties at the Commonwealth Offices in the Federal Capital?",16
22,Mr LATHAM,PARLIAMENTARY,"The replies to the < honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes, in the case of certain States. The question is still under discussion with other Status. 2. Xb. Bankruptcy jurisdiction in the Federal Territory belongs to the High Court of Australia. The date of the transfer of the Inspector-General's office to Canberra has not yet been determined. 3.

31,Dr EARLE PAGE,PARLIAMENTARY,"It was at one time the practice to send a supply of all Parliamentary papers to the Government Printers in each State fcr sale. was, however, an extremely limited demand for them, and, as the Government Printers pointed out, they made no profit on sales which were so seldom effected, and their shelves were being overloaded with these unsold documents, the practice was discontinued.

The indications are that the mails were pillaged before reaching Australia. C.O.R, SPIRIT .",18
37,Mr GULLETT,BRITISH AUSTRALASIA N,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that although the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited pay no duty upon the partly-refined oil from which its refined petrol is produced, the same price, 2s. a gallon, is at present being charged for C.O.R. petrol as for petrol of equal quality upon which a duty of 3d. a gallon is paid ? 2. Is the Commonwealth Oil Refinery au important factor in protecting Australian petrol-users from exploitation by private enterprise engaged in the importation of petrol?",18
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,BRITISH AUSTRALASIA N,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is a fact that the Comnioiiwealth Oil Refineries Ltd., pays no duty upon the crude oil it imports, as crude oil is not dutiable. It . is not a fact that the imported oil from which the C.O.R. petrol is.produced is partly refined. The honourable member's suggestion is probably based upon the fact that some time ago the company imported two or three cargoes of crude oil containing an admixture of once-run distillate; but this was for all commercial and manufacturing purposes a crude oil, and was so classified by the Customs. The retail price of C.O.R. petrol ha§ not been increased since the duty ou petrol was increased by 3d. per gallon, but has been maintained at the price of 2s. per gallon. The petrol imported by other companies, for the greater part of the last financial year, was sold at 2s. 2d. and 2s. 3d. per gallon, but has since been reduced to 2s. per gallon. 2. Yes. NA RAILWAY.",18
39,Mr HILL,GRAETON TO SOUTHBRISBAN E,"Yesterday the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) asked me the following question, without It has been stated in the public press of at least three of the States that the Commonwealth Government by withholding certain funds has been responsible for delay in construction of the Kyogle-South Brisbane railway. If that report is correct, will the Minister for Works and Railways endeavour . to induce the Treasurer to make the necessary funds available. I have since made inquiries, and I am advised by the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner that the work has uot been delayed by the Commonwealth Government withholding certain funds. IMPORTATION OF COAL.  ber the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) asked the following question:-1. Is it a fact that cargoes of coal are being imported into South Australia from Great Britain ? 2. Is it a fact that the price for the delivery in London of best coal ranges from 36s. to £2 per ton ? 3. If so, will he have inquiry made to ascertain whether, after allowance is made for freight, the coal is being disposed of in Australia at less than the cost in the country of origin ? I am now able to supply the honourable member with the following information :1. Yes. Two cargoes were imported into South Australia in August last. 2. Information as to the price of coal in London is not available. 3. The coal was imported for the importing concerns' own use, none being otherwise disposed of in Australia. The information obtained indicates that the cost of the cargoes delivered to an Australian port was higher than the cost of Australian coal similarly delivered, and that further importations are not likely except in abnormal circumstances. The following paper was presented:Norfolk Island Act-Ordinanc e of 1927No. 3-Coroners . NA (SAVINGS BANK ) BILL. In committee (Consideration resumed from 26th October (vide page 763) : Clause 7Section thirty-five of the principal aet is repealed and the following sections are inserted in its stead:"" 35B. A Commonwealth Savings Bank, to he called the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia, is hereby established",18
40,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Hunter) [2.55] This proposed new section describes the savings bank as the "" Commonwealth - Savings Bank of Australia,"" which is not in conformity with the title of the bill. That clearly indicates that the title of the bill should have been amended. As it stands, it is misleading, and is foreign altogether to the provisions of the bill. It will confuse the general public when the bank is established, and I again bring the matter under the notice of the Treasurer, and urge that the title should be altered, even at this late stage.",19
41,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Cowper-Trea surer) [2.56] - The honourable member raised this question previously, but there is really nothing in his contention - The title of the bill is the "" Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill . "" Any one » J O studies the measure will realise that it is a part of the Commonwealth Bank Act, and that many sections of that act are now being specifically brought into line by verbal amendments, in order that this savings bank may function in a manner similar to the Commonwealth Bank. 35D. Ihe savings bank shall, in addition any other powers conferred by this act, power (c) to receive money on deposit eitheT for a enough. tixed term or on current account; (d) to make advances by way of loan otherwise;",19
42,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"East Sydney) [2.5S] When dealing with the State savings banks, clients are permitted to operate on their accounts with cheques, which is a great convenience, particularly to friendly societies. I cannot find any. vision in this bill which establishes similar privilege, and I should like PAPER. know whether the Attorney-General proposes to incorporate such a provision in this measure.",19
43,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [ 3 . 0 ] - It is not in my experience, which is, I admit, limited to Victoria, the practice of savings banks to allow depositors to withdraw money by cheques as can. be done by depositors in ordinary banks - As a general rule the savings bank depositor must produce his pass-book and a withdrawal slip before payment is made to him and the amount of the withdrawal is entered in his pass-book. One advantage of the system is that no stamp duty is payable, and the system is generally understood as being in the interests of t h r if t , inasmuch as savings bank depositors, not having the same ready access to their money as they would nave in a general bank, do not so readily withdraw their savings. I do not think that this provision in itself authorizes the savings bank commissioners to issue cheque books and honour cheques as is done by the ordinary banks, because that it is not incidental to the general business of savings banks as understood in Australia. But the commissioners of the Commonwealth Savings Bank will have the right to draw cheques. It is quite a common practice for a person who is withdrawing money to ask for a cheque instead of cash.",19
44,Mr LAZZARINI,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Werriwa) [3.3] I should like a further explanation f r o in the Treasurer of the provisions that the savings bank should have power among other things, "" to receive money on deposit either for a fixed term or on current account,"" and "" to make advances by way of loan or otherwise."" Banking language to is usually hard to understand, but the have words "" current account"" are plain They mean money ou deposit and at call at any time, and money or which can be transmitted by depositors to their creditors by means of cheques. I should like to know if the phrase "" advances by way of loan or otherwise"" means that the savings bank will be able to do the little bit of work that this b i ll will leave to the Commonwealth Bank; prothat what we know today as the Coma monwealth Bank is to be what is called to a "" reserve bank,"" while its power to do ordinary banking* business will be transferred to the savings bank. I am not raising any objection to the use of the words "" current account,"" but my objection is to the possibility that this power to receive money on current account may diminish the power of the Commonwealth Bank to accept money on current account which can only be manipulated by cheques.",19
45,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That is not,20
46,Mr LAZZARINI,COMMONWEALTH BANK,A r e the ordinary deposits in the savings bank regarded as current account which can be drawn upon daily?,20
47,Dr EAHLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Yes .,20
48,Mr LAZZARINI,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"In the ordinary meaning of the term savings bank moneys are not deposits on current account, because there are certain restrictions as to withdrawals. The bank can refuse to pay out more than a certain fixed sum unless notice has been given of the intention to withdraw, whereas deposits to current account in ordinary banks may be withdrawn at any time without restriction. Furthermore, I am not aware that any savings bank accepts money on deposit for a fixed term.",20
49,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,It is the practice in Victoria. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [3.6]. - I should like to know if the Commonwealth Savings Bank will haA'e power to maintain branches in the post offices throughout Australia.,20
50,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Yes ; that is provided i u another part of the bill . Mr E . RILEY - Will the commissioners have the power to erect buildings wherever they like? have all the powers of savings bank commissioners to do whatever they like with the savings bank?,20
51,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Cowper-Trea surer) [3.7] - The commissioners will have all the powers referred to by the honourable member for South Sydney. There is no justification for the statement of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) that this bill will diminish the powers of the Commonwealth Bank. Section 7 of the principal act, which is not affected by this bill, gives to the Commonwealth Bank the full powers on which it now operates. The powers given by this bill to the savings bank commissioners are essential to the conduct of a savings bank business. It is the ordinary practice of savings bank depositors to place their money i u current 'account, and, although this money is usually at call, there are always regulations providing that a depositor cannot withdraw more than a certain so. sum without giving notice. Some savings banks accept money on fixed deposit for six or twelve months just as ordinary trading banks do, and on those fixed deposits they usually pay a higher rate of interest. The clause provides for both classes of deposits, ordinary current account and fixed deposits. The bill contains nothing which is contrary to the ordinary savings bank practice.",20
52,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Maribyrnong) [3.10] Paragraph d of theproposed new section 35D provides that the savings bank shall have power "" to make advances by way of loan or otherwise."" I should like to know whether it will be free to advance money to assist the establishment of a business, the purchase of a property, the erection of a far m building, or for similar purposes, or whether its operations will be confined to certain classes of advances ?",20
53,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Cowper-Trea surer) [3.12] - This provision deals with the general powers of the bank, and, consequently, it is general in its terms. Subsequently we shall deal with special powers proposed to-be conferred upon the bank and the manner in which it may invest its money. The term used here will permit advances of various kinds to In fact, will they be made. 35E (1) The assets of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in respect of its savings bank business shall be transferred to the savings bank and the savings bank shall be responsible for the liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in respect of its savings bauk business. (2) All books and records of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in respect of its savings bank business shall be transferred to the savings bank.",20
54,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Hunter) [3.13] - A vital principle is involved in this proposed new section, which provides that the control of the savings bank business of the Commonwealth Bank shall be transferred from the present board of directors to a commission. During the second reading debate this matter was discussed at length, and it was shown that the effect of this provision must be to lower the prestige of the Commonwealth Bank, and to reduce its profits. Seeing that the assets of the general bank amount to £32,000,000, as against the savings bank branch assets of £46,000,000, it is obvious that a large proportion of the Commonwealth Bank's profits are derived from the savings bank department. That fact is more evident when we reflect that the money from the savings bank depositors is obtained at 3 per cent., as against 5 per cent, paid i u respect of deposits in the general bank. The Commonwealth Bank is now recognized as one of the world's leading financial institutions; but if this proposal is agreed to, that position will no longer continue. In order to maintain the bank's prestige the Treasurer proposes to move for the insertion of a new clause to provide that the balance-sheets of the Commonwealth Bank and of the savings bank shall be combined. That will not meet the situation. Section 20 of the principal act providesThe board, at least twice in each year, shall prepare a balance-sheet in accordance with the prescribed form, and submit it to the Auditor General for report as to its correctness or otherwise, and transmit it with the report of the Auditor-General to the Treasurer, and shall also transmit a true copy of the balance-sheet and report to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of' Representatives, to be laid before the Senate and the House of Representatives respectively. The proposed amendment of which the. Treasurer has given notice provides that the Treasurer, not the board, shallat least twice in each pare a statement of the combined accounts of the bank and the savings bank in accordance with the prescribed form. (2) The Treasurer shall submit the statement to the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth for certification as to its correctness. (3) The statement shall, within fourteen days of its being so certified, be laid before both Houses of the Parliament if the Parliament is then sitting, and, if not, then within fourteen days after the next meeting of the Parliament. The combined balance-sheet will give the combined profits of the two banks; but it will not be issued by the bank.. It will be a publication issued under the author i ty of the Treasurer. A f t e r the commencement of this act a smaller profit will be shown each year in the bank's balance-sheet. We should make it our aim to maintain the present strength of the Commonwealth Bank. It should be allowed to remain in active competition with private banks. Should we have a recurrence of the conditions which prevailed from 1914 to 1918 we shall need a financial institution strong enough to meet the situation. If we weaken the Commonwealth Bank, as is proposed in this measure, it will fail us in any great emergency. The committee should consider carefully, the position in which the bank will be placed by this legislation. It is not justified in concluding that .the Government's proposals have the approval of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank. We know nothing at all i u regard to the details of any proposal submitted by the Treasurer to the bank directors when they carried the resolution recently placed before this House. There is a big principle involved in this clause; and I do not think this House should allow the clause to go through without thorough discussion. I do not think that there is any necessity for a clause of this kind at all. No evidence has been produced to this House to show that it is neeessary to divorce the savings bank from the general banking department. If they are not going to perform any but the ordinary functions of savings bank administrat i o n ; if they are only going to advance money for the purpose of allowing homes to be built by some other authority, the commissioners will have practically nothing whatever to do. We are establishing the year, precommission for one purpose only, and that, in my opinion, is to diminish the influence of the Commonwealth Bank itself. If the Treasurer had shown that there was any justification for separating the two branches of the bank, there might be some reason for accepting this proposal. But everything that has been advanced has only gone to prove more full y that the Commonwealth Bank, as at present constituted, is capable of carrying out the proposed housing scheme in its entirety. Surely those now controlling the bank could advance monev to the State autliorities. Unless the State authorities pass legislation in accordance with the conditions which we have attached to our housiug scheme they cannot obtain advances. But if they comply with those conditions they can make application to the Commonwealth Sasings Bank for an advance, and, if the application is granted, certain sums of money will be advanced to them, and the account will be adjusted by means of a book entry. Yet, though that is all that has to be done, it is proposed to separate the savings bank department from the general banking branch. No . doubt the savings bank is an extremely important branch of the bank, because it is the branch which handles the savings of the people. The Treasurer has brought in a milk-and-water proposal, to take the edge off the criticism which has been levelled against this bill. The committee will be well advised, before it allows this clause to pass, to insist upon obtaining full information from him as to his reasons for .dividing the control of the bank. I know that an injustice is being done to the Commonwealth Bank. Whether it is being done deliberately or not, I do not know; but an injustice is being clone, the effect-of which will be to reduce the status of the bank. It will not continue to be the same institution as it is at the present time. But instead of reducing the status of the bank, we should take steps to increase its business throughout Australia. No one will feel the injury that is being clone to the Commonwealth Bank mo™ than the primary producer. It is to the Commonwealth Bank that he must look when the need arises. If there should be another drought in Australia, it is this bank which will have to stand at the back of the primary producer. If the bank is divided, as proposed in this bill, it will not be as strong financially as it is at the present time. As at present constituted, the bank could, in times of stress, obtain money or credit from other parts of the world to tide the country over bad times. But if we weaken it by taking such action as is here proposed-the cutting off of an important branch-we weaken the credit of the bank both at home and overseas. We should endeavour to model this bank Mr Chariton. on lines that would increase its strength and solidity, so that it might be able to protect Australia in any financial, crisis that might arise. We do not want to get back to the occurrences of the old days, when thousands of people who had saved up, perhaps, £200*-or £300, lost every penny of it because the' banks to which they had entrusted their money had closed their doors.. That cannot happen while we have the Commonwealth Bank operating as at present. But by this bill we propose to weaken the bank, and lessen its powers to help the people. It will no longer be, as it was called during the second-reading debate, the financial Gibraltar of Australia. This bank is the creation of the Australian people, through this Parliament, and Parliament, havingthus assisted in the creation of the bank, should seek to strengthen it, rather than to reduce its effectiveness. We should endeavour to create the impression throughout the world that, just as the Bark of England speaks for England in matters financial, so this bank speaks for Australia. It should be our endeavour to make the bank loom large among the financial institutions of the world. Instead of doiug that, we are now seeking to reduce its status in the eyes of people at Home and abroad.' If the Parliament of this country has not sufficient faith in this bank to allow it to carry on as it is, what effect will this proposal produce on the minds of people in other parts of the world? People will say that Parliament has not much faith in the bank, and seems to be doing its best to cripple it. I hope that, even at this hour, the committee will come to the conclusion that this bill is inadvisable, and will see that the bank is allowed to carry on as it is now.",20
55,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Batman) [3.28] - I rise to call attention to the manner in which this clause is presented to the com.mittee, and, incidentally, to the drafting of the bill. I draw attention to the fact that clause 7 embraces about five pages of printed matter, and that it is liberally divided and subdivided first, into sections numbered 35A, 35B, 35C, and so on, which are. again split into sub-sections, and then into rjaragraphs, marked a, i , c, and right up to g. For the purposes of citation, reference, and the drafting ofamendments, this is a most awkward form in which to present a bill. I - cannot understand why the drafting has not been done in a more understandable form, in consecutive clauses, sub-divisions being made alphabetically only where they were clearly necessary. Whatever we may say is not likely to have any effect against the superior weight of numbers with which we are faced.",22
56,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The weight is in numbers only, not in ability.",23
57,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The arguments that have been advanced from this side have not been altogether unfruitful. They have at least evoked from the Treasurer a series of apologies and explanations which suggest that, although he will not admit himself to be in the wrong, he realizes that what Ave have said in regard to the disintegration and the disunion of the bank has a great deal of force. He has just submitted to the committee an amendment which Avill make it possible for the figures of the two institutions to be aggregated for the purposes of the balance-sheet. He has gone to some pains to explain that there is more than one bond connecting the savings bank, that is hereafter to be set up, and the general bank. His action is suggestive of that of a man Avho, having run amok Will an axe and inflicted grievous bodily harm upon some person, rushes round in search of bandages and lint so that he may show his Avillingness to repair, as far as pos-. sible, the injury which he has caused. That simile should appeal to the Treasurer, who has a more profound knowledge of physics than of finance. I have nothing to add to the judgment that has been passed by my Leader (Mr. Charlton) and other honourable members Avho sit on this side. I merely emphasize the protest that I uttered at an earlier stage against the proposed severance.",23
58,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.35] - I remind the committee that there is on the statute-book an act which Avas passed in 1905, and described as "" An act to incorporate amendments in amended acts."" If the amended act has been properly drawn, it is possible to have the statute reprinted Will all amendments up to date. This method of drafting has been adopted by the CommonAvealth, but not by the States. The effect is that one can obtain in a single print any CommonAvealth statute containing all amendments that haAe been made up to date. r The alternative Would be that, instead of being able to consult a single statute, one Would need to refer to perhaps half a dozen. If honourable members were obliged to refer separately to the ten' amending acts that have been made tp the CommonAvealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, it AA'ould be very difficult for them to ascertain Avhat the law Avas. Clause 7 has been drafted in this form to enable a reprint to be made of the act when amended. It is a convenient method, alike for honourable members, the public, and the legal profession.",23
59,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yarra) [3.37] - The Treasurer ought to inform honourable members at this stage of the reason for the inclusion of the proposed neAV section 35E. On the motion for the second reading, and in the various speeches that he has made during the committee stage, he has told us that only the administration of the savings bank Avas to be removed from the administration of the general bank. When an honourable member suggested that something more than the administration was involved, he accused him of having misrepresented the position. If only the administration is to be divided, because it Would be impossible for the directors of the bank, without dropping dead Will fatigue, to borrow £20,000,000, and lend it to the States to enable them to finance the housing scheme, Avhat is the necessity for this provision ? It says that "" The assets of the CommonAvealth Bank of Australia, in respect of its saA'ings bank business, shall be transferred to the savings bank."" That is to say, the assets of the savings bank are to be wrenched away from the general bank and placed under the control of an entirely neAv administratiou, and that-in the language used by the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) on the motion for the second reading of the bill-signifie s the establishment of a neAv bank. How can the Treasurer say that there is not to be an entire separation of the two institutions? The appointment to the new board of one of the members of the present hoard of directors will not maintain a connection between the assets of the two institutions. If there is to be a division of administration only, why are the assets to be divided ? ,",23
60,Dr MALONEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Melbourne) [3.39] - It is undoubted that the Commonwealth Bank is becoming more and more a bankers' bank. Up to last week the desire to lodge trust moneys with the bank had been frustrated on five separate occasions. Although, thanks to the Treasurer, the last amending act contained a provision permitting trustee business to be done, the management of the hank has shown no desire to give effect to it. I attribute that to the innovation of placing the control of the Commonwealth Bank under a board of directors. With the advance that; has been made by the Commonwealth Bank-which , however, is not as great as it should be-additiona l branches should be opened ancl opportunities thus provided for the promotion of some of the younger members of the staff. As the savings bank, which is the people's bank, brings the Commonwealth Bank more into contact with depositors than any other financial institution, I cannot understand why these two branches of Commonwealth banking business should be separated. The Victorian railways and the Melbourne municipal tramway service operate under separate control, with the result that the tramways enter into severe competition with the railways. Separate control of Commonwealth banking will also result in unnecessary competition, to the detriment of the people. During recent years many important banks have amalgamated with other financial institutions. The old Colonial Bank, with which I was associated many years ago, has, for instance, amalgamated with the National Bank, which may be an advantage sliould we be threatened with another* debacle such as that which occurred in 1S89. By fixiug rhe interest rate on overdrafts at 6 per cent, during the war period, the Commonwealth Bank assisted materially in stabilizing finance in Australia; but the Commonwealth Bank is in most instances now charging 6-J per cent. With the possibility of unsatisfactory seasons which, some have foreshadowed, the banks should not charge more than 6 per cent., particularly as that rate was considered adequate during a period of national .emergency. I trust that the Government will introduce an amendment of our Commonwealth Bank legislation so that the trustee branch of the business may be extended. The present trustee companies are practically as safe as a banking institution; but they cannot be as secure as an institution which has the whole of our resources as security. If a new board is appointed to control the savings bank branch of the business, new premises will have to be obtained ancl additional officers appointed. If effect had been given to the desires of Mr King O'Malley, the father of the Commonwealth Bank, we would not now have in Melbourne a State Savings Bank building in Elizabeth Street, another in Spencer-street, and also a huge building which was recently acquired in Swanston-street, competing with the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The acquisition of additional accommodation, and the appointment of a new staff, will increase the administrative costs, and possibly affect the rate of interest paid to depositors, and surely reduce the profits. Whilst I believe that the Treasurer has the best of intentions, I still think a mistake is being made in separating tliese two branches of the bank's business.",24
61,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Maribyrnong) [3.4S].' - An examination of the balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Bank shows that, apart from the funds of the note issue - branch, which is not associated with the ordinary business of banking, the amount ou deposit in the two sections amounts to £90,582,000. Deposits, including accrued interest, in the Savings Bank, amount to £46,479,000, and therefore those of the general banking business amount to £44,103,000. In order to mollify honourable members opposite, the Treasurer states that he is prepared to introduce a new clause for the purpose of showing the total operations of the two banks in one balance-sheet. A tyro in finance could see that that is a mere pretence.",24
62,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,He might as well add the receipts from Customs.,24
63,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Of course. The board of the general bank will have no right to one penny of the funds of the commissioners established under the bill. Therefore, the Commonwealth Bank will be not merely cut in halves, but greatly weakened in prestige. I should like the Treasurer to say in plain language whether section 7 of the principal will remain intact, despite the passage of this bill.",24
64,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That is so.,25
65,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Will the Commonthe wealth Bank have power to carry on the general business of banking, acquire and hold land, receive money on fixed deposit, issue bills and drafts, and grant letters credit, deal in exchanges, specie, bullion, gold-dust, assayed gold, and precious metals, borrow money, and do anything incidental to any of its powers? those functions be in no way interfered with ?",25
66,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Not at all.,25
67,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am glad to hear Australia that very definite statement; but why does the Government take a steam hammer to crack a nut? The comvernment missioners will merely meet for short periods and make advances to institutions that can be relied upon to repay the orable moneys. There can be no doubt that the division of the Commonwealth Bank will result in the appointment of a larger staff. I have already made reference the profits of the Commonwealth Bank, hope which, from 1917 to 1921, averaged annually £600,000. The Treasurer menterial supporters. tioned that the bank had millions to play with during the war period; but he knows that most of the money was insurer) vested in short-dated loans in London. He was shrewd enough to refrain from saying that the interest rate on advances and overdrafts had been raised by i cent, since the present board had been pointed. He will have many misdeeds account for as Treasurer, and he has now added this chief sin of splitting a splenout did institution in two. The profits of the bank since 1917 have been as folfrom low :Year. 3917 f379,000 1913 550.000 1919 846,000 1920 834.000 1921 695,000 1922 549,000 192,S 403,000 1924 250,000 1925 389,000 1920 461,000 1927 580.000 Owing to the expense incurred through having a board of directors, the bank does not show such a good record since 1924 as it did when it was under the act management of a Governor. I noticed that the Treasurer was careful to refer only to the profits made since 1924, when the board of directors was appointed, and interest rate was raised § per cent. If the first Governor of the bank were alive today, I wonder what he would say about the Government's proposal. I am not of aware that he ever suggested that a board of directors was desirable. If he were still with us I do not think that the Treasurer would have introduced this bill. I Will hope that a division will be called for on the clause, because the opposition should enter its emphatic protest against the mutiliation of one of the finest institutions possesses. It seems to me that in this matter we should leave well alone. Only five honourable members on the Goside were members of this committee when the Commonwealth Bank Act was passed. I believe that the honmember for Wakefield (Mr. Foster), whom I see in the chamber, and who was a member at that time, realizes that the Government should not interfere to with the bank as it proposes to do.

68,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Cowper-Trea [4.3] - In reply to points raised by the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members, I may explain that the clause deals with the transper fer from the Commonwealth Bank of the apassets of the savings bank. In my to second-reading speech I showed that that would be necessary. I also pointed that the savings bank accounts are at the present time kept quite separate those of the general bank, and from the note issue. Reference to Hansard, at page 21S shows that I saidThe accounts of the savings bank department are kept, separate from the other assets of the Commonwealth Bank, and this will enable all the existing assets of the savings bank department to be transferred from the Commonwealth Bank. The control of the assets is placed in the hands of a commission, so that it will be able to devote the whole of its attention to the administration provided for in the bill.

71,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Hunter) [4.13] Sub-section 2 deals with the application of agreements which have been made with two of the States. Although this matter was discussed at the second-reading stage. I do not intend to let this opportunity pass without issuing a final warning. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) has never yet been able to inform the committee whether the States that are in agreement with the Commonwealth in respect of the savings bank have accepted these proposals. The first thing that we should know is whether Queensland and Tasmania, which States have handed over their savings bank business to the Commonwealth, have agreed to the bill. If they have not done so, by passing this bill we shall be practically breaking faith with them. The Treasurer should State now whether the two States concerned are favourable to the bill; and, if they are, an objection to it would be removed. What may be the position if . the bill is passed? Two or three States may accept the conditions under which money may be borrowed from the Commonwealth Savings Bank, but if Queensland and Tasmania refuse to alter their existing legislation they will be unable to borrow from the bank, and will, therefore, be at a disadvantave. The Commonwealth is practically holding a pistol at their heads. They have to accept the conditions laid down under the bill or else receive no money at all from the Commonwealth for the furtherance of their housing schemes. Although they have supplied probably half the funds of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, their money will be used for building homes in other States. This is a serious matter, and one upon which the committee should be enlightened. The Treasurer has said that; he mentioned the proposal to officials of those two States, and that they raised no objection to it ; but he has not informed the committee whether the Governments of those States have agreed to nine- the bill. I understand, from the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) that this legislation imposes conditions that are totally different from those existing in Queensland today, and that the Queensland Government, TO conform with the bill, will need to alter the basis of its housing schemes. That State has more money in the Commonwealth Savings Bank than any other State, and if it refuses to accept this legislation its money will be used for housing schemes in other States. That is not the spirit of federation.",27
72,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,How does the honourable member suggest that the passage of this bill will adversely affect Queensland and Tasmania ?,27
73,Mr CHAELTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Unde r the bill certain conditions must be complied with, and if Queensland refuses to accept those conditions because they are unsuitable it will be debarred from receiving one penny from the Commonwealth Savings Bank.",27
74,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,So long as the depositors receive their interest payments they will not be adversely affected.,27
75,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"This is a question not altogether of the depositors receiving interest, but of developing as far as possible each State with the capital of the combined States. In private life when a _ departure is made from an agreement, the person adversely affected may have recourse to law, but in this case Queensland and Tasmania will have no redress. The Commonwealth Parliament in passing this legislation is dictating to the States the conditions under which they can borrow money for their housing, schemes. I object to that. It is necessary, in order to foster the true spirit of federation amongst the people of Australia, that there should always be a common understanding between the Commonwealth and the States. The States have every right to conduct their, own savings bank business, and they should not be deprived of those rights. Queensland and Tasmania agreed to transfer their savings banks to the Commonwealth Government, believing that step to be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. Every State is justified in its desire to keep as much capital as possible within its own borders, in order that it may develop its resources. Such development is necessary if our States are to be successful in their endeavours to prevent the excessive importation of articles which they can produce satisfactorily. I cannot countenance a complete breach of faith in connection with the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States.",27
76,Mr MACKAY,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Do you suggest that this bill is a breach of the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and certain States? ,28
77,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I suggest that, if the Queensland Government does not agree with this measure, it is placed at a considerable disadvantage. Does the Treasurer imagine that, had the Government of Queensland anticipated the introduction of this measure, which differs so entirely from the agreement into which it entered with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, it would have handed over its savings bank to the Commonwealth Government? The Treasurer should have laid his cards upon the table, and revealed to the States concerned his proposed legislation, so that, they were not agreeable to it, they could have continued with their savings bank businesses and conserved their money for the development of their own territory. This Government cannot continue the policy of interference^ which is exemplified by this bill, and in which, of recent years, it has been only too prone to indulge. The governments of Queensland and Tasmania entered into a solemn and binding agreement with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, under the conviction that it was in the interest of all concerned, and . now the money that they have passed over to the Commonwealth Government is to be allocated for the purpose of a home-building scheme quite different from those already existing in the States. The matter involves a very big principle, and unless the Government desires to cause friction between the Commonwealth and the States, and to prejudice that principle which it so freely preaches, "" One people one destiny,"" it must avoid legislation of this nature. Those concerned should be consulted, and taken into the confidence of the Commonwealth Government before being involved in legislation which is likely to be detrimental to them. I am opposed to the proposal which is embodied in this bill.",28

I repudiate ithe suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that anything in this bill can be construed as a breach of faith affecting the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of Queensland and Tasmania. Not merely ' does the bill preserve the rights of those States, but it makes additional money available to them, should they desire it. Whatever they do, they are assured that the existing agreement will be honored. Some eighteen months or two years ago, when we first contemplated the separation of the savings bank from the general braneh of the Commonwealth Bank, I approached the Premier and Treasurer of Queensland and discussed the matter with him, pointing out that it was our inteni f tion to supplement the activities of the States, and asking whether he had any objection to the scheme. The honourable gentleman assured me he had not, provided the existing agreement was preserved. Sub-section 2 of proposed section 35F provides for that. The agreement with the Queensland Government, stiuplates that 70 per cent, of the increase of deposits over withdrawals shall be available to the Government of Queensland each year, subject to certain conditions.",28

The Premier of a State has the right to make any comthey mitment on behalf of his State which within his competency, and must take responsibility for his actions. If the parties to the agreement are . satisuse fied with the conditions that are imdeposits in Queensland. posed by this bill, there is no reason why auy one here should find fault with them.

In addition to being entitled absolutely to the 70 per cent., the Queensland Government has the right to be consulted as to the disposition of the remaining 30 per cent. That 30 per cent, is always invested in Queensland, upon the advice of the advisory board, of which the Treasurer of the State is one memto ber, and the Governor of the Bank another. The advice of that board is always followed, and it was a fundaf mental principle of the agreement that the funds should be invested in Queensland, not elsewhere. ' I know that the Treasurer may say that there it is no necessity for the investment of those funds 1 under the provisions of this bill. Possibly not, but let us take the hypothetical case that Queensland may. not to come under the housing scheme. The commissioners will require whatever proportion of the savings bank funds can get in any part of Australia in is order to finance housing schemes in the States'which accept the Commonwealth's proposals, and for that purpose they may a portion of 30 per cent, of the excess",29
86,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,That can only be done in accordance with the agreement that with the Queensland Government.,29
87,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Unde r that agreement an advisory board was appointed, of the State Treasurer and the the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank; but under this bill the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank will be replaced by The the Governor - of the Commonwealth Bank That will no longer have anything to do with the the savings bank. Theoretically the Queensland advisory board advises the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank upon the investment of the excess funds after the provisions relating to the 70 per cent, advance to the State Government, are satisfied, and as to the amount of interest tp be paid to depositors, and recommends what l i m i tation should be imposed on the amount one person may deposit in the bank. Under the actual letter of the agreement it is merely an advisory board; but the spirit of the agreement, and one of the reasons why it was entered into, was that the advice tendered by the board should be acted on. The board was really more than an advisory board; but the Chief Savings Bank Commissioner, who under this bill takes the place of the place of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank in the administration of savings bank funds, may feel that he is at liberty to disregard its advice. For a couple of years after negotiating the agreement with the Commonwealth Bank I acted as a member of that board, in conjunction with Sir Denison Miller. course, if the Queensland Government has raised no objection to the present proposal, I have no reason to do so. merely call attention to the fact that the provision may act detrimentally to the State of Queensland. I cannot see that the provisions of proposed new section 35z do not come into conflict with the agreement with the Queensland Government. The proposed new section provides that the net profits of the savings bank in each half-year shall be dealt with as follows:(«.) One-half shall he placed to the credit of a fund to he called the Savings Bank Reserve Fund; and (6) One-half shall be paid into the National Debt Sinking Fund as soon as practicable after the preparation of each balance-sheet. The agreement with the Queensland Government provides that half the profits arising in Queensland from the savings bank shall be divided between the Treasurer of Queensland and the Commonwealth Bank.",29

101,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I am glad to have assurance. There will be very little work for the new commissioners to do, I can see nonecessity for the apthe pointment of advisory boards in the I have no objection to men who are performing responsible work being paid good salaries, but it cannot seriously be contended that any considerable amount of work will have to performed by these boards of advice. Should the States agree to this scheme, they will have their own local authorities which will make application be the to the commission, and should their Bank and applications be granted by the commisduties - sion, money will he advanced to them. Experience has shown that new boards or commissions soon surround themselves is with large staffs, with consequent heavy expenditure for salaries. The members anof the boards of ' advice would proexpect to receive £500 a if the year each, so that in each State fro m £1,500 to £2,000 a year would - probably be paid as salaries to them, and, in addition, large sums for their staffs. This proposed new section is unsecnecessary. Should it be found later that boards of advice are necessary, the act could be amended to provide for their commisappointment. But if we provide now that with the commission may appoint subsidiary boards to advise it, our action will be regarded by them as authority on which they should act. It would be interesting to know the cost of the boards and commissions which have been appointed during the last four years. I hope that the proposed new section will not be agreed to.",31
102,Mr DUNCAN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"HUGHES (Boothby) [5.0] - I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that boards of advice in the several States are unnecessary. The Treasurer just now claimed that the proposed section 35J was necessary because of a similar provision in the principal act. Yet a provision similar to that in the proposed new section now before the committee was struck out of a previous measure. The Treasurer is blowing hot and cold. The 1924 bill at first provided for a board of advice in each State, but Tiot in London. It passed this House in . that form, but in another place it was ^altered to provide for a board of advice in London, and none, in the States. So far as the Commonwealth Bank itself is concerned, the 1924 act does uot provide for boards of advice in the States, and I cannot see that, in connection with a measure dealing only with the savings bank branch of the bank, there is any need for them. So far as I am aware, the private banks have no boards of advice in States other than those in which their head offices are situated; their directors visit the various States from time to time. I intend to vote against the proposed new sub-section. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) £5.3] - I hope that the Treasurer will reconsider his intention to appoint boards of advice in the several States. There is no necessity for them. Honourable members who frequently refer to the heavy expenditure caused by "" go-slow"" methods, should be consistent and vote against the proposed new section.",32
103,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Maribyrnong) [5.4] The inclusion of this proposed new section in the bill justifies the contention has been made in Tasmania. of honourable members on this side that the multiplication of boards is unwarranted. There will be nothing for the boards of advice to do. The commission will have the benefit of the advice of its own officers. If we have, in addition to the three commissioners, a board of advice in every State of the Commonwealth, that is going to mean the multiplication of officers, and increased expense. I am certain that there will be a rising among the taxpayers if we keep on appointing boards and commissions. The country is under sufficient expense already. Everybody knows that whenever the Government establishes a fresh set of commissioners these men soon gather a staff about them. There are branches of the bank in practically every State. There is, I understand, a new building for the Commonwealth Bank being erected in Brisbane.",32
104,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"And a very fine building it is going to be, too.",32
105,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"If there is an agency of the bank in practically every town, surely there will be enough officers to do the business of the savings bank, even under the new housing scheme.",32
106,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What is the use of labouring the point?,32
107,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"(Cowper-Trea surer) [5.7] - The reason for incorporating the proposed new section 35K in the bill, is that proposed new section 35:F says thatSavings banks may, witli the approval of the Treasurer, enter into an arrangement with the proper authority controlling any savings bank constituted under the laws of a State, for the transfer to the savings bank, upon such terms and conditions as are agreed upon between the savings bank and the proper authority, of the whole, or any part, of the assets, liabilities and business of that savings bank. - If the business of any State savings bank is transferred to the Commonwealth Savings Bank, it would be a wise thing to do what has been done in the case of Tasmania and Queensland. In both of those States a board of advice has been constituted. In Queensland, the board consists of the State Treasurer and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, or, in future the chief commissioner of the savings bank. A similar arrangement It may remove the objections of honourable members if I tell them that those boards of advice cost nothing at all. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) can bear me out in that, as he knows that the Treasurer of Queensland receives no remuneration for heing on the board of advice.",32

112,Mr SOTJLLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The honourable gentleTreasurer man is proposing to do so.

Now the Treasurer tells us that they are to be boards of advice in the event of further agreements being entered into with the other States. that is so, something more has got done than the Treasurer has indicated. The Treasurer says that if we make the proposed new section 3 5 K subject to proposed section 3 5 F , we shall do what needed; but that will not get over difficulty.

There will be no compulsion on the commission to appoint officers of the Commonwealth Bank whose services may be no longer required by that institution.

133,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH BANK,Why penalize the new commissioners in that way?,35
134,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not wish to do that; but now that the Seat of Government has been transferred to Canberra, statutory provision should be made requiring the head office of all such undertakings to be situated here, so that the concentration of governmental activities may assist in increasing the population and encouraging the development of the Federal Capital Territory. The establishment of the head office of the savings bank in a State would cause dissatisfaction in other States. Sub-section 2 of the same proposed new section provides that the commission may establish agencies or sub-agencies at any place within the Commonwealth or any territory under the authority of the Commonwealth or with the consent of the Treasurer in any part of the King's dominions. That gives great latitude to the commission in the matter of establishing branches. Although it may be urged that the commission should have discretionary power in this matter, Parliament should, I think, direct it to utilize the post offices so far as is practicable.",35

136,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That section provides that the commission may arrange with the Minister administering any department of the Commonwealth for an officer of that department to act as agent of of the savings bank for the transaction of savings bank business. That does not go far enough. The commission should be directed by Parliament to establish to probranches, agencies, or sub-agencies .in so far postal buildings wherever practicable, in be made order to reduce expenditure. Savings of a bank business is carried on in post offices in almost every town in Australia, and as this system has been found to be not only convenient, but economical, it should be continued. The service rendered has been satisfactory. Unless statutory provision is made in this direction, the commission may commence. erecting palatial savings bank buildings in a State where there are perhaps only six branches of the general bank. As the savings bank business has been satisfactorily conducted in post offices for some years there does not appear to be any valid reason why the policy should be changed. - Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [5.45]. - I do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) in the contention that the savings bank business is being satisfactorily conducted in post offices. The mere fact that depositors have to transact their business in post offices reduces the volume of business. I know of several instances in which perhaps one postal official is doing Commonwealth savings bank business whilst in an adjacent State savings bank building five or six officers are ployed. If the Commonwealth savings bank business is to develop as it should, its operations should not be conducted in post offices to the same extent as at sent. Many postal officials do not encourage savings bank transactions, as the work interferes with their ordinary duties. I have known of cases where accounts have been transferred from a Commonwealth savings bank to a State savings bank owing to the unsatisfactory service rendered by the staff. Unless drastic alterations are made in the present system the commission should establish its own offices, particularly at busy centres.",35

When the head office of the Commonwealth Bank is at Canberra, the head office the Commonwealth Savings Bank also be transferred here, as it will be ad vantageous for the authorities controlling both institutions to be in the same place. I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) that the activities of the Commonwealth Savings Bank should be increased to the fullest possible extent, and that it is undesirable to provide by legislation that agencies and sub-agencies shall all be established at post offices. In Tasmania and in Queensland, where the Commonwealth Savings Bank is doing the whole of the savings bank business, it may be quite impracticable to carry on economically even with the assistance of postal officials. Many complaints have been made in the House concerning the difficulty of conducting savings bank business in post offices, and in this instance we are adopting the same provision as is contained in section 52 of the Commonwealth Bank Act, which readsThe Governor may arrange wit h the Minister administering any department of the Comemmonwealth for any officer of the department to act as agent of the bank for the transaction of savings bank business.

In his secondin reading speech, the Treasurer indicated that this provision was to meet the wishes of the people interested in agricultural development, representations having been made by a conference of those concerned, and conveyed to the honourable gentleman by the Premier of South Australia. I think it is a good idea if it can be legitimately met, why but it should not be put in the machinery of this bill as a kind of in struction to the commissioners of the proComposed savings bank that they shall invest portion of their funds in this way. the provision is made in this bill, or by supplementing the power already it in the Rural Credits Act, it should be wider in its application than is here proI f there is justification for widening the policy at present governing the rural credits section of the Commonwealth Bank, I consider that these credits to should be made available for purposes other than financing the harvesting of by way of advances on twelve months terms, the funds to be returned to Go the bank at the end of that period.

An y one familiar with the complex I business of co-operative agriculture knows that other facilities besides warehousing and storage are required. I suggest to the Treasurer that he should extend the preprovision to apply to co-operative societies of farmers whereby such bodies may be assisted to establish factories, cleaning drying plants, mechanical loading and grading plants, and to extend transport",40
167,Mr COOK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That is covered by g "" in any other prescribed manner.""",40
168,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I take it that g is incidental to the specific matters covered by the section, and that the commissioners would not be justified in waremaking advances for - the purposes I have the mentioned. It would be straining their authority to make such advances under actiparagraph g. A "" prescribed manner "" is one prescribed by regulation or by order council. It may be that it is within the capacity of the Treasurer to have such an order passed prescribing advances for the establishment of, say butter or cheese factories, or to cover activities such as 1I have enumerated. I question the wisdom of casting upon the savings bank commissioners the duty and responsibility of making these advances. The rural credits scheme is sound in principle, but at present is too limited. Why not extend it by amending the Commonwealth Bank Act so as to permit of it making these advances ? I assume that it is not proposed that the commissioners shall advance these sums indiscriminately to any applicant, but that they , shall be - bound to pay attention to the security offered. We have a housing measure which circumscribes the conditions under which the commissioners shall operate, and which stipulates the nature of the security required. Here far greater advances are involved, and no such limitations are provided. Mr SCUI.LIK - To whom are the vances to be made?",40
169,Mr THEODOBE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That is fied, although the legislation dealing with rural credits which was passed in 1924 stipulates that the adCharlton) vances are to be made to a specific authority, and in a very limited scribed manner.

If honourable gentleman desires to cover whole gamut of co-operative agricultural necessities, I urge him to widen the either of this measure or of the Rural - Credits Act.",41
170,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Cowper-Trea surer) [8.12] - The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) raised the tion whether it was intended to allot .a certain ratio of the funds available - under this measure to the different States. iSTo such ratio is stipulated, is quite evident that the funds available under this scheme will have to be applied where it is most profitable and wise to invest them. Neither the Commonwealth Savings Bank nor any State Savings Bank follows any special rule regarding the investment of its funds. Frequently the savings banks utilize their funds for the purchase of Commonwealth bonds, and all sorts of other purposes. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) asked whether there was to be any prescription which would insist upon the commissioners maintaining a certain proportion of liquid assets to enable them to meet ordinary current demands. There will not be any such provision. The matter will be at the discretion of the commissioners, who will, no doubt, act as do the controllers of the savings banks at present, and keep available a certain amount of spare cash to enable them to carry on the oraddinary business of the institution. At present, 12 to 13 per cent, of the actual cash of the savings bank department is not speciheld for that purpose. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. considers that it is advisable to confine the investment of savings and prebank funds, by way of fixed deposit, to the Commonwealth Bank. beThe words, "" or any prescribed bank "" in storparagraph / have been inserted to widen of as far as possible the opportunity for inor vestment by those controlling the ComThe same beprovision is to be found in the Commonwealth Bank Act. It is not anticipated that in the great majority of instances tliere will be any need to place savings silos bank money on fixed deposit in "" any the prescribed bank''; but no harm can be the done by giving the commissioners this power. With regard to the wisdom of scope giving the commissioners power to advance money for the erection of warehouses or storage facilities intended for the warehousing or storage of pri- mary products, referred to by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theoquesdore) and the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes), I wish to repeat again what I said on the second reading. This provision has been inas it cluded in the bill because of a request from various State Ministers for. Agriculture. They have drawn attention to the fact that under the rural credits scheme of the Commonwealth Bank it is not possible to get other than short-dated accommodation-that is, accommodation for not more than twslve months-and that the beneficence of the scheme would be tremendously improved if funds were also made available to enable storehouses or warehouses to be built to hold goods placed in pools. They pointed out that if this were done it would enable cooperative societies to hold produce and market it in more orderly fashion than would otherwise be possible.",41
171,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH BANK,-At present the advance is made under the rural credits scheme agaiust the goods stored in the warehouses ?,42
172,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes . The whole of the rural credits scheme submitted to Parliament over two years ago was on the basis of making the funds available to the maximum possible degree to enable the harvest for each year to be marketed in a regular and orderly fashion. To that end a great deal of elasticity was given to the funds at the command of the bank for rural credits, but they were to be made available only to the extent that they would return within a year for use for the next year's crop. Advances under the rural credits scheme are essentially short-dated loans--the y do not extend more than twelve months-and they could be of no value for the erection of a warecredits house. A warehouse is a permanent asset, and needs different treatment. It might, perhaps, take twenty years to pay off an advance for such a building. It was felt that the appropriate place for a provision to enable advances to be made on warehouses for the storage of primary products was in a section of the act ing with the investment of savings bank funds. Consequently, in submitting a bill which will enable savings bank funds to be advanced for the building of houses on terms of repayment extending over 20 or 30 years, we are also making provision for advancing savings bank funds for the erection of warehouses to hold primary products. In each case the business is similar. I think that cleaning and drying plants are covered by the term "" storage facilities."" posed section. A well-equipped maize silo could not be installed without provision for cleaning the maize and putting it into proper shape before it is actually stored. I should think that a cleaning and drying plaut would be part and parcel of the actual machinery necessary to carry on the work of warehouses, and provision is already made for this in the bill by the use of the term "" storage facilities.""",42
173,Mr FOSTEB,COMMONWEALTH BANK,To whom would the money be advanced,42
174,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The money would be advanced at the discretion of the commissioners, and, I take it, mostly to State co-operative bodies who desired to pool their products. A body such as the Atherton maize pool, or a wheat pool, would be able to get an advance from the Savings Bank Commissioners on long terms of repayment, such as are extended to a home-builder.",42
175,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,The 4 commissioners would also be able to advance to private companies ?,42
176,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Yes . A private company, quite independent of a cooperative concern, could obtain an advance for the purpose of building a warehouse for the storage of primary products but the definite purpose of this for legislation is to enable co-operative societies to take advantage of the rural scheme to house their products. This bill will make the position easier for the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank. It will enable greater seeurity for the moneys advanced to be given. ""When the Commonwealth Bank Rural Credits Bill was introduced it was felt that the dealscheme would suffer from the lack of adequate warehouse accommodation in Australia. This bill will go some way towards supplying that need. I think that transportation facilities come under quite a different category from those plants which can be regarded as part and parcel of a* warehouse or a silo, which, as I have already explained, are legitimately provided for by the term "" storage facilities."" I do not think we can deal with transportation facilities in this pro",42
177,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Dalley) [8.24] - I am sorry that the Treasurer cannot see his way to broaden the proposed section by permitting the Savings Bank Commissioners to make advances on facilities other than those which are named. If it be sound to make advances to provide warehouses and storage facilities, I cannot see why advances cannot be made for those other essential agricultural necessities which make for the orderly marketing of produce. The Treasurer evidently regards the words "" storage facilities"" as em-_ bracing silos; but if they embrace silos I think the paragraph should also be made to embrace the cleaning and drying plants which are so essential in silos.",43
178,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I take it that they are covered by the words "" storage facilia ties.""",43
179,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That is all so much to the good; but no harm can be done by naming these things, and placing beyond the possibility of doubt the power of the commissioners to make advances on these plants. Some facilities, however, do not come within the term "" storage facilities,"" and I think they ought also to be named in the bill. Surely the underlying idea is to aid co-operation in agriculture. If we are to do what we can do as a national Parliament towards the improvement of primary production in Australia, we should assist by means of finance, the co-operative movement in agriculture. I admit that ttc excess of deposits over withdrawals available to the commissioners of the savings bank will be too small to enable much to be done in that direction. If any considerable funds are available from that source they will be required for the housing scheme. The Treasurer, however, has undertaken to issue a series of loans, aggregating in all £20,000,000, to assist the savings bank commissioners to carry out the purposes of this bill and the housing bill, and a definite portion of that amount could be allocated to assist agriculture. Even if the Treasurer had to get a special authorization from Parliament to exceed the £20,000,000, he'would be well justified in doing so. An advance of £20,000,000 on reasonable terms to farmers' co-operative organizations would be a sound investment for the Commonwealth, and no one would criticize it. I do not hold, of course, that the Commonwealth sliould involve itself in heavy financial loss. Advances would have to be made on good security. Nor do I suggest that the Treasurer should advance up to 20s. in the £ on the security offering. There should be a margin to safeguard the bank or the authority making the advance. The Treasurer has asserted, and we all agree, that he can raise loans on much more favourable terms than the farmers or any one else in Australia. By placing these facilities through the commissioners of the savings bank at the disposal of agricultural organizations we shall enable the organizations themselves to get cheap money, and to very large extent they will be rendered independent of private institutions in financing their enterprizes. At present, as every one knows, they are under very painful restrictions. The banks can charge almost extortionate rates of interest and impose conditions to which the . farmers find it very difficult to conform. I moveTliat after the word "" products,"" paragraph [d), the words ""or for factories, cleaning and drying plants, mechanical loading, apparatus for grading and processing, or transportation facilities"" be added. I admit the wide nature of the words "" transportation facilities."" I do not want advances to be made to farmers to enable them to build railway lines or branch lines or anything of that sort. But motor transport is becoming almost indispensable in connection with all industries, and nowhere is it more indispensable than in agriculture. If the farmers are to organize and avail themselves of modern transport facilities they can only do so when they have money to finance their schemes.",43
180,Mr SEABROOK,COMMONWEALTH BANK,What security would there be for transportation facilities?,43
181,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"I do not expect an advance to be made without security or an advance to be'made to the extent of 20s. in the £ on the security offering. Let me quote a - case which will enable the honourable member to see what is in my mind, aud to realise the practibility of my amendment. When the Atherton Maize Pool Board was instituted ih Queensland by an act of the State Parliament, all the maize growers came into it after a ballot was taken. A pool board was formed, which had a first claim on the growers' crops. There was no difficulty infinancingthe crop, because the Commonwealth Bank advanced money against it ; but for the provision of ' facilities, silos, and drying and cleaning plant, the only security the board had was its power to levy on the growers at so much per bushel. The money was required to pay interest on the advance made by the Commonwealth Bank. The bank had the guarantee of the State Government before the farmers' pool got the money. Mr G. FRANCIS - What was the cost the growers?",43

183,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Perhaps the honourable gentleman is right.

But if they understood what the States really wanted, I am, quite satisfied that this measure would either come back to this chamber in a very mutilated condiright. tion, or that they would turn it down It would be a godsend to Australia if they did. The bill provides that the purposes of paragraph d "" p r i - j mary produce "" means wool, grain, butter, cheese, meat, fish, fresh, preserved, or fruits, hops, cotton, sugar, and such other produce as is prescribed. That is enough to justify ten or fifteen rural banking bills. I am at a loss to understand what it has to do with the housing of the people. I want to point out how dangerous such a clause is. I have reof served myself up to now, and have not the time of the House, because I expected that somebody would get up on the other side and tell us how they proposed to reconcile the housing scheme with Mr G. FRANCIS (Kennedy) [8.48] I find myself ih some difficulty in coni f nexion with this clause, because paragraph d apparently stands entirely alone. There is no provision in the Housing Bill which would regulate either the amount of the advance or the percentage maxiin regard to the matters dealt with in this paragraph. Under section 9 the only possible way of fixing the advances to to be made under paragraph d of section 35AA would be by regulation. Section 9 provides that section 63 of the principal . crossact is amended by omitting all words "" making provision for,"" and inserting certain other provisions. That is to say, that the provisions for the erection of warehouses or storage facilities inobtended for the warehousing or storage of primary products may be by the regulations. ' My and difficulty is that if paragraph d is allowed to stand in section 35A a, the only method of defining what may be done in the way of advances will be by regulation, and that will delegate legislation to an authority outside this House. Personally, I prefer regulation of these matters by statute, rather than by statutory rule. Under paragraph c, "" in advancing money in accordance with the Commonwealth Housing Act 1927, for the purchase or erection of dwelling-houses,"" it is clear that the maximum amount that can be advanced is £1,800, or 90 per cent, of the value, as that is laid down under the Housing Bill. In clause d, however, there is nothing whatever to suggest, that even 150 per cent, of the cost might not be advanced. There is no limitation stipulated, nor is the amount or the percentage which may be advanced indicated either in this bill or in the Housing Bill. Though I have a great desire to see the extension to mary producers of such facilities as are hci-e provided for, it does not seem that the position is adequately safeguarded as the paragraph now stands. Something foreign to the matter in hand is introduced in this paragraph. It is not really cognate to the housing scheme. It relates solely to rural credits, facilities which may be afforded to primary producers.",45
192,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"If the paragraph is agreed to, does the honourable member think it ought to be extended to those other facilities I mentioned? Mr G. ERANCIS - I say that they should be made the subject of a separate measure dealing with rural credits for the purpose of assisting primary producers, apart altogether from the housing scheme. If it were proposed to advance money in accordance with the rural credits scheme, the suggestion would commend itself to me. But, as it stands now, the provision appears to be entirely uncontrolled. There would be no limitation, except by regulations, of the amount to be advanced to any one person. The paragraph now states that the money is to be advanced for the erection of. warehouses, - and warehouses always suggest trading. If it had been storehouses, instead of warehouses, it would be less objectionable to me, at any rate. As regards the amendment proposed by the honourable member for . Dalley (Mr Theodore), I want to say that I am in sympathy with the primary producers. The protection afforded the secondary industries is often given at their expense. I interjected by asking him a question in regard to the maize pool of - North Queensland. He suggested that 2d. a bushel was the amount required to finance the scheme, but I think that was the estimate that was made before the pool was put into operation. My impression is that the cost has worked out at something like 30s. a ton, and that is a great deal more than 2d. a bushel.",46
193,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The cost you refer to covers interest and redemption. Mr G. FRANCIS - That is due to the fact that they have a capital outlay of something like £90,000, including drying priapparatus; nevertheless, the cost worked out at approximately30s. a ton. I to me believe, however, that if money could be made available more cheaply, it would be a good thing for the farmers. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) suggests making advances for such things as drying plants and processand to ing machinery. I would remind him that the principle has been accepted by the Parliaments of the different States that it is inadvisable to advance trust moneys against chattels of any description. Dealing with the last few words of the honourable gentleman's amendment "" or transport facilities,"" I am struck by the magnitude of his proposal. To me, it seems to include such things as trains, trams, ships, motor cars, conveyors of r every description, and vehicles of all kinds. Mr ""WATKINS.;-An automobile might be classed as a liability rather than an a S Mr G. FRANCIS - Yes , it might easily be a liability, and quite often is. The amendment resembles a suggestion to embark upon some form of State trading, of which we have already had too much. It is the function of a government to govern, not to trade.",46
194,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It would be not a government, but a co-operative, concern. Mr G. FRANCIS - I know that it would; but it would carry a trifle too much of government money for my conception of what would be safe for ' adventures of that nature. I agree that it is desirable that we should, as as possible, make these moneys available, not merely for the provision 9f homes the people, but also in the way of assistance to primary producers, who enable have a fairly difficult row to hoe. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) might feel disposed to consider the advisability having paragraph d omitted and emthat bodied in another measure, dealing prinpointed, cipally with advances to primary procase on its merits. ducers for the erection of storehouses or storage facilities intended for the housing or storage of primary products. That measure could be extended, as as saf ety permitted, so as to - embrace some of the activities suggested by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore). I am very greatly inclined to the view it is the duty of this Parliament to assist primary producers, and 1 should like, also, to go a certain way along the suggested by the honourable member. I point out, however, that if the amend to ment were accepted there would be no mum percentage. machinery to limit the amount of advance that might be made under would it to any person, company, or corthe poration. There would be nothing to prevent an advance of £500,000 ject from being made to one co-operative concern. That is the objection I have to both the amendment and paragraph d. . I hope that in the cumstances the Treasurer will consider the matter and intimate to the committee that he is prepared to have paragraph omitted with a view to bringing down measure that will make provision for not only the assistance that every honourable member desires to see granted to primary producers, but also the necessary mabuilding chinery to enable the maximum amount and percentage to be fixed, and to regulate in more definite terms the powers and capacities of the commissioners of the savings bank in that regard.",46
195,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Newcastle) [9.4] The Treasurer must see that he departed largely from the original intention, which was to deal only with housing. I have no objection to the savings bank assisting primary produchousing tion ; but in that direction the measure not sufficiently comprehensive. It merely enable the commissioners to assist certain primary producers and leave others out in the cold. If it is the intenfar tion of the Treasurer to insist upon the passage of paragraph d, why should he for decline to accept the amendment, which certainly goes much further, and would assistance to be given in directions other than those already provided for? The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. of G. Francis) must not overlook the fact three commissioners are to be apand that they will consider each Mr G. FBANCIS - We propose to reWarestrict them with regard to all other matters. A maximum percentage is fixed far in respect of advances for housing.",47
196,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Undoubtedl y they are to be restricted in respect to the that security they may accept; but if they are worthy of their positions they will examine every case upon its merits, and lines ascertain the value of the asset. Mr G. FRANCIS - True ; but there is be a maximum amount and a maxi",47
197,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Admittedly . That not be varied by the carrying of amendment. The commissioners will be the examiners in each case and, subto the approval of the Treasurer, will . have the final voice on any application whichthat may be made. I do not apprehend any danger in that direction. The cirGovernment is endeavoring to placate certain people; but in a measure of this description, it is not able to do the thing d thoroughly. Transportation has been a mentioned. That will be a question of interpretation, which may cause the commissioners some difficulty. A motor car as an asset is altogether different from a that is used for storage purposes. I can recall a famous play in which one of the characters suggested that the automobile was a liability and not an asset. If a vote is taken, I shall support the amendment, because I cannot admit the wisdom of making provision for certain has primary producers and not others. Mr E. EILEY (South Sydney) [9.9]. - I understood the object of the bill was to enable £20,000,000 to be expended on so as to relieve the shortage that is prevents certain people from obtaining will nouses. If paragraph d is allowed to remain in the bill the whole of that .sum can be spent on the erection of cool stores, granaries, &c, throughout the Commonwealth, and the housing of the people will be a matter of secondary consideration. If the total'amount is not to be spent on housing, what proportion is? I hope that the Treasurer will expound the policy of the Government.",47
198,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"Cowper-Trea surer) [9.12] - There is no question as to the amount which is available for housing. This' chamber has already passed the Housing Bill, which hypothecates certain moneys belonging to the savings bank. It specifically states that up to one-half of the increase in deposits and up to one-quarter of the repayments may be used for that purpose, and are to be supplemented by other moneys up to a total of £20,000,000.",48
199,Mr SCUXLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"It does not say that it must, but that it may, be.",48
200,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That £20,000,000 is hypothecated for the housing scheme and cannot be utilized for any other purpose. The provisions of this bill will not have a militating effect against the housing scheme. The honourable member for Kennedy has submitted that this is not the proper place in which to deal with this particular matter. With * all respect, I suggest that it is. All that is necessary to provide finance for the purposes mentioned is an alteration of the Commonwealth Bank Act in relation to the powers of investment. That is what is being done. We are indicating certain specific directions in which the funds of the savings bank may be invested, at the discretion of the commission. Mr G. FRATTCI.S - My trouble is that that discretion is unfettered.",48
201,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"That is true. But it is also quite unfettered in regard to any government securities invested in, or loans on land.",48
202,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BANK,A government security is entirely different.,48
203,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"In the case of the housing scheme it does not say that 90 per cent, of the value of the security must be advanced. What it says is that up to 90 per cent, may be advanced. It would be of no earthly use to appoint a commission to handle the funds of the savings bank if it had not sufficient wisdom and discretion to deal with them in a wise way. This bill haa been introduced for the definite purpose of liberalizing the methods under which funds are to be invested. At present funds are ""not invested in the manner here proposed, not because the security is regarded as insufficient; but because according to the information I have received from the State savings banks, the money is not available. I have already said that practically everything to which the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore) referred, with the exception of transport facilities, can be dealt with under paragraph d in its present form. The more specific it is, the more difficult it may be for the commission to avoid the limitations imposed. As the proposed section was introduced for a definite purpose, I am agreeable to extend paragraph d in order to carry out what I believe to be the desire of the majority of honourable members. I could not, however, agree to the inclusion of transport facilities, which, every one knows, embody a wasting asset, and, as some have said, cover in some instances not an asset but a liability. Some of our railway lines are at present losing propositions, and could not be regarded as very good assets for banking purposes if owned by a co-operative company. Motor cars, taxi cabs, and other such vehicles may be included in the same category. If the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dalley is either defeated or withdrawn, I shall move to include at the end of paragraph d the following words- "" including the erection of plant - for treatment to ensure their preservation and preparation for marketing."" The paragraph would then read(d) In advancing money for the erection of warehouses or storage facilities intended for the warehousing or storage of primary products, including the erection of plant for treatment to ensure their preservation and preparation for marketing. That would meet the position and give the commission discretionary power to use the funds at its disposal for granting long term advances for the purposes specified. Mr G. FRANCIS - Would the Treasurer be willing to substitute the word "" storehouses "" for "" warehouses "" ?",48
204,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BANK,"The paragraph refers to ""warehouses or storage facilities,"" which really covers both. During my visit to the TJnited States of America, at the end of 1924, and early in 1925, I was impressed with, the fact that the United States of America had provided a warehousing scheme for the handling of primary products, and that the warehouse receipts had, to some extent, hecome a recognized security for loans. The intermediate credit system in the United States of America resembles our rura l credits system. This paragraph provides that the commission shall have discretionary power to make advances for the erection of warehouses or storage facilities. In order to place the meaning of the paragraph beyond doubt, I am willin g to move an amendment in the direction indicated.

The words contained in the amendment are to place it beyond doubt that investments once made in one of the prescribed securities need not necessarily remain for all time i prescribed security, but may be changed into some other form within the limits the securities allowed by the instrument. The effect of the words proposed to added is simply that, although the allowed investments are limited to the classes for th in the section, the commission be at liberty to remove money, at any time it thinks proper, from any particular one of those investments and re-invest it ployed.
