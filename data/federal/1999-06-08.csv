Mrs DEANNE KELLY·ANNE KELLY (Dawson) (4.30 p.m.)-I to the ANTS package-A New Tax System package.

As we all know, obesity amongst school children package that there is an initiative for a national 'welcome. Overall I believe the changes to parent, very welcome. There is no doubt that ensure that the package meets the design principles the package is family friendly and common sense. Regrettably, the response of the Labor Party of the House. Chicken Man stunts and waving such a serious debate. It was sad to see the because this is a matter that goes to the is a responsible way to look at food and taxation. the package in its current form. I would now like to tum to something particularly and regional Australia, and that is the treatment the multibillion dollar breakthrough. Unfortunately, litre as a fuel excise. The National-Liberal-Democrats that fuel excise, bringing it down to 20c per or more no matter where they operate and all That includes goods that go to or from cities have liked to have seen the tonnage on the better than what we have now. In the next of the House the real advantages I would like to quote the shadow minister on the budget on 1 June 1999. She said: It is a shift away from any strategy designed to reduce both within and between regions . . . MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 June 1999 Tuesday, 8 June 1999 APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1999·2000 Second Reading would now like to tum to the changes Food for human consumption is to be food, restaurant meals, alcohol, soft drinks, associated products. Frankly, as a mother who healthy food rather than chips, Big Macs and the this is a welcome package. It is a responsible food and to focus instead .on healthy home is a major concern. I notice also in the child nutrition project. I think that is also very food are responsible ones and, for the average there are definitional issues to be finalised to of the Australian Democrats, but overall has disappointed many of those on this side bags of lettuce is really not the thing to do in light on the hill become the lettuce and the dill heart of every home-what the family consumes-and As I said, as a parent I am very pleased with relevant to those of us who represent rural of fuel and taxation. Fuel tax reform remains the Labor Party is still espousing 43c per proposal will see 23c per litre come off litre. That will apply to all vehicles of 20 tonnes vehicles greater than 4.5 tonnes in regional areas. or between regional areas. Certainly we would 4.5 lowered but, nonetheless, it is a great deal while I would like to show you and other members for rural and regional Australia. for transport and regional services in her speech regional inequality-and there is a lot of inequality, NA Tuesday, 8 June 1999 She was referring to the budget of the coalition proposing a fuel excise of 43c per litre and criticising only 20c per litre. That to me is blatant inequality. I would like to share with you some examples National Truck Association. There is a trucking business, with a turnover of $2 million a year. On the Truck Association's figures they are on parts, oil, tyres and so on they are looking business, the total sum of the savings is $207,760-about not be coming to Canberra, but will be staying transport products, to be kept in the .local this. I would now like to quote from the transcript somebody who feels aggrieved by the altered the Transport Workers Union, Mr Bill Noonan, gone mad.' Mr Noonan says: Take the situation of a large group of truck drivers them 20 kilometres to the west, does that mean that with cheaper diesel and thul' put their jobs in jeopardy? think need to be answered. But, of course, the ramifications He is quite right. The ramifications to the simple this change could well be decentralisation. I see nothing wrong with businesses moving employees the opportunity to live in a cleaner, perhaps have lower housing costs and certainly initiative that I have seen towards decentralisation, Speaker, one of those things you feel strongly towards decentralisation, encouraging people but if they choose, perhaps I would like to share with you another example This is a trucking company that operates, again, out. They transport chopped cane from the siding molasses down to the VLC plant, refined sugar diesel a year. The saving for this company, is $575,000. That is a lot of money. That money to the owner of this business and he said, 'Of to pass it on, and that is a good thing. But in the town, and that is where it should be. two businesses, we are looking at a quarter of remaining in our local economy. It is a reversal of inequality. It is tilting Australia, I think, really, for the first time measure are opposed to the bush finally getting Dickson? She really should be applauding MAIN COMMITTEE 6351 government. It is quite breathtaking to be those who are offering a fuel excise of from my own electorate undertaken by the business in Dawson, a moderately sized family Their diesel fuel bill is in the order of $400,000. going to save $132,500. On wholesale sales tax at a saving of $75,260. So for that one small $200,000. That is money that will with that business to be passed on to those who community. Regrettably, the Labor Party opposes of an interview given on 2 June, again, quoting tax package. This is the national president of who is quoted as saying, 'It is a case of politics located, say, in Laverton in Melbourne. If you relocate the road transport emp-oyer could operate the business I mean, they're the sorts of simple questions I to the simple questions are quite significant. questions are significant. A ramification of into rural and regional areas to give their quieter, more family friendly environment, to lower transport costs. It is the first real which I know is very much, Mr Deputy about.

And they will have it will remain with farmers and small businesses That is a significant amount of money. From those a million dollars, just two businesses, of money the playing field in favour of regional and rural in a very long time. Those who are opposed to this ahead. I simply say, where is the member for this. It is a very sound measure. NA 6352 I would like to mention very briefly some the wholesale sales tax. It is often said by wholesale sales tax. If only that were true. haul-out trucks attract 22 per cent wholesale are usually a couple working in a paddock through That is a great sum of money for a cane harvesting That will go with the implementation of this package. Mr Deputy Speaker, I find this package enormously time we are going to have an opportunity to attract If they want to move there: move up to Dawson! to see money staying in the community that It is going to stay in the"" local community, providing initiative. It really is the first time. I have favour of rural and regional Australia. In the time left to me I would like to speak initiatives in the budget. We are looking at impact on regions of cabinet proposals. That opinion. In so many other departments there not have a negative effect on a rural or regional impact on our more vulnerable areas in Australia. I welcome the regional Australia strategy to and to ensure access to those services. We looking at rural GPs: a retention program payments for long-serving general practitioners. a sole practice for 13Y2 years and who is absolutely 13Y2 years to get a partner. To get a locum locum, a doctor has to spend at least $3,000 devotion in the rural and regional areas. For towns and communities, I have nothing but rewarded and encouraged, and I welcome this initiative. The Minister for Health and Aged Care, with Western Australia for more rural doctors. binds them to a specific rural location for Aboriginal communities in Western Australia, towns find it hard to attract a doctor, they enough for overseas doctors, frankly, it should refer to it as civil conscription, but the reality is the right of every Australian, whether whether they live in Proserpine or Bowen, community.

I will tum to another issue which relates particular. It relates to the major proposed a component headlined 'Quality initiatives Paper No.2. It relates to cuts over the next on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in terms each figure: for example, for 1999-2000, there for 2000-2001, minus$38.9 million; for next minus $64.7 million. If you add those figures up, you work out of about $187 million. That is very significant. for government in the context of the continually million is still a pretty significant cut in the media kit fax sheet 8, page 3, which talks incentive payments to doctors which will where it is proposed that incentives be given and, in that way, decrease the cost to the pharmaceuticals. On the face of it, that is not need to be considered. One is the fact that it suggests $187 million, years, something like $78 million of proposed you look at the actual figures, which were upon questioning, there is a cut of about $259 of PBS costs and some $78 million over that the following year, and a situation where the As I understand it, it has been said elsewhere figures were provided but were not included is a disappointing thing. Accrual budgeting a practice to go forward into the future-as Fairfax when we were together, and we are Accounts and Audit. We are both very supportive commenced under the government that I was this government. But, when we look at what the concept of forward estimates, there are future. There ought to be a line item of some question of payments going to GPs. When there around the question of the expected cut to there, and that is not a good thing in terms actually contains. On from that-and why I say that this carefully-the whole issue of the question of a difficult one. We would all agree that, where people are given the medicine they require MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 June 1999 the nation, does get a fair go in government policy to the budget papers and the health budget in cut out of the budget in the health area, which is for prescribing pharmaceuticals'. It is in Budget four years of prospective expenditure expected of medicines being prescribed. It tallies over is minus $28.3 million on the forward estimates; year, minus $55.5 million and following on to that you are talking about a cut over four years There is no doubt that this is a difficult area rising costs of pharmaceuticals. But $187 estimates. I would refer people to the minister's about the fact that these savings are net of the commence in 2000 and 2001. This is a program to doctors in order to improve prescribing practice budget of and the need for prescribing of a bad idea, but there are several issues here that but that is because, in the figures for those payments to doctors are not shown there. When received from the department several days later million from the forward estimates in terms period back to doctors, with that increasing into figures that are in the budget are misleading. through estimates again that these sorts of in the budget papers at the end of the day. That is something that I support as a concept and as did my colleague the honourable member for now again, on the Joint Committee of Public of the concept of accrual budgeting, as first proud to be a member of and continued under was provided in some of the budget papers in some concerns that need to be looked at for the $78 million in the forward estimates around the is not, there ought to be a proper figure PBS costs of some nearly $260 million. It is not of clarity and certainty around what the budget is an issue which needs to be looked at very prescribing processes and behaviour of GPs is we can, we should be trying to ensure that and the medicine that will do the best for them NA Tuesday, 8 June 1999 in the context of their particular illness, but choice. The concern here-and I am not saying that happen is that, if you have an incentive scheme improve medical prescribing and at the same there is a danger around what that will mean become budget related because there are incentives AMA have about how this scheme may work, They are concerned that an incentive program, yet, could in fact lead us to a situation which practices in this country. The detail-rather, the devil in the detail-is with respect to the department is that we cannot projected figure that has been worked out through budget process, which provides them with a base the saving could be in a scheme they would any details at all about that scheme. In fact, to the opposition details of formulas, and have budget confidentiality. The fact is that, until those details are available, the nature of how such an incentive system practice. For example, how are these incentives to individual GPs? Will there be some overall Is it going to be in a situation of looking at there are cuts in the levels of prescribing doctors? How are they are going to safeguard incentive scheme where a GP can look at it the money back from the government in the context expect from GPs; I have a lot of respect for incentive scheme which is economically based, what would be the clinical outcomes.

Upon questioning, the situation really ascertain too much detail. It is a a range of formulas in the context of the on which to suggest this is what they suspect implement. However, they really cannot give us they did agree two days after the budget to provide since reneged on that proposal on the basis of there Will be a lot of questions raised about would work and what it means in terms of GP going to be paid? Are they going to be paid organisational approach, or regional approach? the previous practice of prescribing and whether from particular doctors or particular groups of a situation where it is not seen as being a cash and say, 'I will not prescribe because I can get of this.' That is certainly not what I would GPs. But the fact is that, once you have an you have real dangers around the question of the government have that concern, but I am to just trust them and wait and see when it estimates to try and get some of those answers this cut. But certainly there are issues there. the budget papers and what that shows about the process of the operation of the PBS.

(2) Have funds been allocated for future polling; if so, what is the budget. (3) Does the polling referred to in the preceding parts constitute push polling. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Office of the Employment Advocate has contracted the Wallis Consulting Group Pty Ltd to conduct surveys on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia. (b) The questions being asked relate to freedom of association. (c) The surveys will consist of two elements: - a survey of 1000 employers conducted by telephone and mail questionnaire; and NA - a survey of 1000 union members conducted by Polling telephone. The employer survey will be in the form of a self completed mail survey returned by mail or fax. Prior to the surveys being mailed out to 1000 employers, telephone interviewers will call a sample of business establishments (1500 employers) selected at random from the Yellow pages and Dun and Bradstreet's commercial1isting to establish the most appropriate person in the company to undertake the survey.

Companies employing one or two people only at a site will be excluded from the study. The union member survey will be conducted by telephone with such employees at their homes and will be run at the same time as the employer survey. The telephone survey method was selected in this instance because postal questionnaires raise issues in regards to literacy and understanding of questions which may present difficulties for some employees (eg, less educated or those for whom English is not their first language).
