8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF SURPLUS,"I do not bmrf myself to make such a statement on the Additional Estimates, but I intend to make it as soon as 1 can. The honourable member,, as an ex-Treasurer, knows that an accurate statement cannot be made when there are.several months of a year to go; but at the instance of the Premier of Tasmania I have furnished him with the information, he asked for on and will make a. statement affording similar information to the Treasurers of all the States.

13,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"for Mr Mahon) asked the Treasurer, upon noticePAPERS. 1. Does the following statement accurately the financial results to the Treasurv of(a) The excise duty on locally-grown sugar;' (i) The bounty paid to planters employing white labour exclusively ; and (r) The drawback or rebate . of. excise allowed to exporters on the sugar con- tents of beer, various kinds of confectionery,' jams and jellies, and canned and preserved fruits exported No. j - from* Australia, viz. :Per ton.

If it be not a fact that the Treasury loses £ 3 per ton on every ton of excise sugar exported from the Commonwealth, will he be good enough to state the real position? Does he consider it just , to tax Australians to provide cheap beer, confectionery, jams, jellies, and preserved fruits for foreigners' especially since our own people arc obliged to pay the full Australian market price for these plans, estimates, commodities? 4. Can he say when, where, and by whom the policy of using public funds to pay a bountv subsidy on sugar exported from Australia submitted for the decision of the Australian people ?",15
14,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. The results to the Treasury are not such as are shown in the statement of the honourable member. 2. No drawback of duty has been claimed on excise sugar, and, therefore, the loss shown in the statement, referred to has not been realized. 3. I do not consider that any such position has arisen. 4. The authority for the' payment of bounty is provided for in the Constitution Act. TELEPHONES : COUNTRY TOWNS.",16

17,Mr MCDOUGALL,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that Major-General Hoad, in his report as Inspector-General, stated it was a mistake to take the Militia Garrison Artillery away from the Western District coast of Victoria? a. If it is true, will the Minister take immediate steps to re-establish the Militia Garrison Artillery in the district named by the Inspector General ?",16
18,Mr EWING,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : t and 2. Yes. In 1904 the Militia Garrison Artillery at Warrnambool and Port, Fairy was converted into a Field Battery. was armed with four 40-pounder R.B.L. guns pending the arrival of carriages for the ,4.7-in. Q.F. guns with which it was proposed to equip the battery. These carriages are now available, and the battery will shortly be equipped with comparatively up-to-date 4.7-in. Q.F. ' guns. These guns will be available not only for service with the Field. Force, but also for garrison defence.' It - is considered that 4.7-in. Q.F. guns compare very favourably with any fixed defences which could,' at present; be provided at these places. SUPPLY (Formal). MINISTERIAL STATEMENT.

20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Is the Seat of Government Bill no longer urgent ?,16
21,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable member did his best to prove that it was not urgent the other night.,16

32,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I obey the implied direction of your look, M.r. Speaker, and I hope to introduce this motion in such a manner as' shall avoid irrelevance and direct the attention of the House to the question immediately in hand. orable member of this Parliament, and no citizen of Australia, will dispute the statement that the first task inc'umbent upon - this House after the last general election was to deal with the Tariff proposals of the Government, at all events, it would be impossible for this Government to subordinate - that question at this time, and under present circumstances, to any other, no matter how important that other issue might be. We owe it to the commercial community, to industrial Australia, ancl to our constituents, that ter what transpires in this House, there shall be no interregnum, so far as we can prevent it, between the return of the Senate's suggestions in regard to the Tariff, and their final disposition by agreement between the Houses.",16
33,Mr JOHNSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable member did not think that on Thursday night. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Neve r what he thought. ' .,17
34,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I thought that on Thursday, night-and think so still. On Thursday night, the suggestions made by the Senate in regard to the Tariff had not been placed in my colleague's hands from his officers, and have only been under his consideration since that time. The Cabinet had not seen them. Consequently at that moment - it would have been impossible to proceed with their consideration, as we now propose to proceed, at the earliest possible day. There has been no postponement. , If honourable members will look at the number-severa l hundreds-of suggestions which have been made, and recognise what their complete classification and consideration means, I.think that they will agree with me that remarkable expedition is being displayed in dealing with them, if we are prepared to take them in hand, as we propose, next Speaking for this House as a whole,' we have, 1 believe, an immediate duty in that regard, which has claims prior to any other claims that can .be urged upon us-no t that this comprises by any means the whole programme of this Parliament or of this Government, nor that it is the only obligation, for there are many, more.",17

36,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"On e of the obligations is to deal with the motion' of the honourable member for - Gwydir, which we are now considering.' But I submit-with conTariff. fidence to him as well as to the House that. No hon- having in view the present position of the Tariff proposals, our instant duty is to dispose, of the Tariff before we take the Postal or any other question in hand.",17
37,Mr JOHNSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Suspen d the execution until we have made our wills.,17
38,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"-Of course, one foresees that upon the return of the decisions.of this HoUse to another place an interval will occur. It is not proposed that it shall be lost, but to proceed as far as possible with some necessary .questions awaiting solution, no mat- among which may be mentioned the Additional Estimates. Mr Wilks.'-The Seat of Government Bill ?",17
39,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I had not even excluded that, although the conduct of honourable gentlemen opposite has given me a full opportunity of doing so if I so desired.",17
40,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,That is absolutely inacmind curate. It 'is a mean suggestion; it is beneath contempt.,17
41,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"On the' contrary,' I wish to show by contrast where the real willingness to deal .with it exists. At all > events, we made no effort to talk it out, and when trie, debate was likely to be blocked we offered to carry out the agreement to decide it on the particular day fixed.",17
42,Mr JOHNSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,And a supporter of the honourable member spoiled it. - Mr DEAKIN - We would thus have dealt with the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir next. day.,17

52,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Tw o honourable members have declared that the statement made by the Prime Minister was not true. I ask them to withdraw that expression.,18

55,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Mr Speaker, - parliamentary usage requires me to accept the withdrawal, but I have no desire to. What I have to submit to the House is that we, by meeting next week and disposing of the Tariff as soon as possible, will then place' ourselves in our proper relation to our constitutents on that question.  think that he will get a quorum next Wednesday ?",18
56,Mr WATSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Wit h what is really a motion of censure pending, is it wise to touch any other business than the Tariff?",18
57,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"F i r s t of all, I do not consider that the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir is strictly a motion of censure.",18
58,Mr WILSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable gentleman has made it one.,18
59,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Exactly . urged by its mover to regard it as a perfectly friendly motion. The action taken was not that honourable member's' fault, nor was it the fault of any other honourable member, it was simply in the discharge of what the Government believed to be its duty. But that is a matter with which I shall take an opportunity of dealing when the question comes before us again. It is only from motives of our own, and in accordance with our own policy, that we feel obliged to treat it as hostile. But that is of our own choice. There is nothing in the motion itself which necessarily conveys a reflection on this Government. The Government do not recognise that the condition of the Postal Department which calls for special treatment or-for inquiry has been brought about by any legislative or administrative action of their own or of this Parliament. But those will be dealt with in their proper Consequently, although there has been no change in the attitude of the Go- . Government in that regard, I see no constitutional obstacle to the House proceeding with business. But I shall endeavour to meet, as far as possible, the wishes of the House as to the particular business to be For instance, I take it that the Additional Estimates are not likely ' to arouse what may be strictly considered party feeling.",18
60,Mr WATSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,There will be a lot of just discussion upon them.,18
61,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,But that discussion will not be of a party character.,18
62,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Oh , yes. .",18
63,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"The honourable member is a person, and not a party. With him it may be a strong personal question, but it will not be a party question. Then the question of the Federal Capital. Site is not, in the ordinary sense of the term-^or indeed in any sense- a party one. It is one upon which there is a strong personal feeling, and in respect of which there are national obligations.",18
64,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"It ought to be, a national question.",18
65,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"It should be dealt with as such. Consequently I suggest its inclusion in the list of matters to be con' sidered. I also suggest-in regard to a measure which meets with the unanimous approbation of the House-the consideration of the Surplus Revenue Bill . Upon that measure practical - unanimity exists - But dealing with business in advance, it is We were probable-or , at.least, we may hope-that when the Senate has the Tariff returned to it, the justice and wisdom of any amendments made by this House, will be so luminously' apparent that we shall have it returned without any further requests, and thus shall not be required to occupy time in reconsidering it - At all events our object now is to deal with the Tariff and with no other question, except for the purpose of utilizing any necessary intervals of parliamentary time, for which we shall not be responsible. So far as is possible we are anxious to deal with the Tariff 'and ' with nothing but the Tariff. But we wish to put to some good use any intervals which may occur.

There are occasions when a Prime Minister and the members of a Government may have to take a course which is not a very dignified one, and which is, perhaps, not a very agreeable",19
78,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,We are ready to accept a challenge now-at this very moment.,19
79,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I think that that invitation to a challenge has all the attributes attachThe Prime Minister has made his position secure f o i the time being, and now, being sure of his numbers, he challenges me to throw down more simply the gage of battle.",19

He that step entirelv without any intimation to me, and from first to last I have the not exchanged a single word upon the subConseject either with the honourable member himself or with any other honourable member of - his party .who voted with us on that occasion. When, therefore, the Prime Minister accused me of political cajolery in influencing members of the Labour Party he gave me credit for more than I deserve. Asa matter of fact, I made no such endeavour, and I think that the reflection conveyed by his accusation is not upon me, but is upon those honourable members who are suspected, I of being likely to be influenced by any advances which I might make.. Because we stand as open and dfedared _ tagonists in politics; fortunately, in no other way--at least, I trust so. But in politics - we stand as open and declared antagonists; and those honourable members would not' be likely to expect me to ask them to deviate from any course which they thought to be right. So that the fact remains that the difficulty that arose on Thursday night was in no way created by honourable members on this side of the House.",19
81,Mr JOHNSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,It w.as unfair of Prime Minister to sav that it was.,20
82,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"But "" i should like to say that I accept the statement made by the Prime Minister-that he knew nothing of the intention of the honourable member for Gwydir ta move his resolution on grievance day.",20

88,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"No ; ' the right ""honourable member does not want to talk about that!",20
89,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I will come fo that in a moment. What I want to say now is that I understood the Prime Minister to state that when he rose to move the adjournment of the grievance-day order, he was not aware of the intention' of the' honourable member for Gwydir to move an amendment on that Order of the Day. ' Mr DEAKIN' - No :",20

Knowing that it was very probable that 'the honourable member for Gwydir would exercise the only opportunity he had during the month of securing the opinion of the House on the question of the appointment of a Royal Commission, the Prime Minister jumped up to escapefrom his proposition-; not because of the Capital Site quiestion-no t because he was anxious to see the Capital Site determined in New South a n Wales-h e has allowed that question to slide for six years. But, when he knows that the honourable member for Gwydir is going to move an amendment, which he had previously been informed would be pressed to a division, and as to which he had been previously informed that the numbers were against him 1",20

95,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I believe that. the right honourable member was aware of one or two of them.,20
96,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"That is altogether wrong. I should be delighted to hear of them.

98,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Will the honourable gentleman say what h!e means? How can I offer an explanation in'regard to a matter that is not plainly stated? Will he mention the matter to which he refers?,20

100,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,-What ? A motion of censure from the honourable member for Riverina?,20
101,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"No censure, but a motion.",20
102,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"The honourable member for Riverina asked me if I would support the appointment of a Select Committee in reference to some matter that he had - ventilated in this House, and I told him at once that I would. Surely there is no motion of censure in that?",20
103,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,No one talks of a motion of censure.,21
104,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I took the view that I have always expressed in this House. I do not care who the man is-whe n the Postmaster 1 General has to act judicially, and when a charge is levelled against a man to which he has no opportunity of replying, I will, under those circumstances, vote for the appointment of - a Select Committee at the instance of any member of this House.",21
105,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I did not tell the right honourable member I was going to move on that particular day.,21
106,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,No ; the honourable member gave me no idea as to when he was going to move.. I - concluded that he was going to take action on grievance day. But I had no idea of any move against the Government in that connection.,21
107,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Not against the Government ; it was not intended against the Government.,21
108,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"That is the trouble which we have had in this situation. It was open for the Government to take that motion and get it p - Stpon-jd, or treated as iht-y liked. But what I wish to say is this: l t the honourable member for Gwydir' wants to be secure of a chance of proceeding with his motion this session-and the' Government I understand have promised that he will have a proper opportunity of proceeding with it during this session- ",21
109,Mr WATSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Immediatel y after the Tariff is disposed of.,21
110,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Immediatel y . after the Tariff is dealt with. If that be so, I do not want to disturb that position at all. I am satisfied so long as the honourable member will have that, opportunity. But I ' must say that I think that the Prime Minister- I am sure it was not done designedly-forgo t the ordinary courtesies that were due to me in relation to this matter. When an arrangement had been made between two leaders in accordance with which the head of a Government proposed to take a certain course of action, I tliink it was. due to me that the Prime Minister should have told me what he was. g' in g to move and why We was going to move it. The honourable gentleman gave me no hint.",21
111,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"That is one of the chief reasons why I withdrew my amendment on Thursday, when the right honourable'member took exception to it.",21
112,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I think that it is far better in our relations when an arrangement has been made and anything is likely to upset it, that the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition should consult about the matter.",21
113,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I did not know that there would. be any difference of opinion. But the right honourable member objected, and I withdrew my amendment.",21
114,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"There might fairly be a difference of opinion. The honourable, member for Gwydir took advantage of the only chance he had.",21
115,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,No .,21
116,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"That is the view which I think he took, and I think most of us tcxvk the same view - ",21
117,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,It was not my view.,21
118,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"There was every desire to close the session very shortly, and the only other chance which the honourable member had would be in a month's time.",21
119,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,He could have moved next day.,21
120,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,We consulted Mr Speaker and got a decision. How could the honourable member have brought the question forward ?,21
121,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,On the Additional Estimates. M.r. REID - That is unworthv of the Prime Minister. How could the honourable member for Gwydir move for the appointment of a Royal - Commission on an item in the Additional Estimates ?,21
122,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"He oould move for the reduction of a vote for the Post and Tele-* 1 graph ' Department, by way of signifying what he desired.",21
123,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"There is a proper way of dealing with a proposition of this sort. Only trouble could arise out of an indirect method. The only method which the honourable member had of bringing forward his proposition 'in a distinct way was by f o l lowing the course which he adopted. Private business has been abandoned for the rest of this session. No private member can bring, any thing before the House .unless in the 'way which the honourable member for Gwydir adopted. I did not desire to s^e the honourable member deprived of his fair and legitimate opportunity of proposing a thing which I heartily approved of. I did not want hi into be deprived of that opportunity by what seemed to be sharp practice - becaus e the effect of it was sharp practice. The effect of the amendment of the Prime - Minister for adjourning grievance day would have been to deprive the honourable member of his opportunity for a month. Would that, have been dealing with the honourable member fairly? What I desired to do was this : An amendment was actually drafted to carry out the underhis taking of the Prime Minister. We were going to propose an amendment in place of his, the effect of which would have beei: that we should have gone on with Capital Site question, and the Government would also have given the honourable member ' for Gwydir an opportunity of view. proceeding with his motion immediately that question was disposed of. That amendment was written out at the table, but before I had an opportunity suggesting it, the Prime Minister rose, and asked leave to withdraw his amendment. rose to suggest 'the course that I had resolved upon, but Mr Speaker very pro- - other perly informed me that there could be no debate on the question of say that withdrawal. I had no opportunity, exercisingwe therefore, of endeavouring to solve the the appointment question in a manner that would have been just to the Government, - just to the Capita] Site question, and - of an honest opinion? fair to the honourable member for Gwydir. I had to accept the request of the Jfrime Minister that he have leave to withdraw his motion. But to me it will be wonderful if it turns out that honourable members knowing on Thursday that the honourable member for Gwvdir was going to take the action that he did-and I am told that was well known in the corridors during day that he intended to do so",21
124,Mr WATSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Many of the members of the Labour Party were not aware of his intention.,22
125,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The fact that my notice of motion had disappeared from the busiCaucus ness-paper was sufficient to indicate what are solid. I intended to do ,22
126,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,It is remarkable that the Government did not notice that it had removed.,22
127,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I knew that the notice of adamant motion had been dropped from the notice paper, and recognised what that might mean.",22
128,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Did the honourable member know what the honourable member for they had. Gwydir was about?,22
129,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I have said so.,22
130,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Then it is a novel action on the part of a Prime Minister-t tempt to jockey off the business-paper a motion which he regarded as one of cenresult sure,22
131,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,There was'no jockeying. lately.,22
132,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"The honourable gentleman had no right to do that and to attribute action to a desire to meet the wishes of the advocates of the early settlement ot - the Capital Site question. As a matter of fact, he was really studying the lift and the existence of his own Ministry.",22
133,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Rubbish. ' _ Mr Reid,-At all events' that is my",22
134,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,At that time. I thought that the amendment proposed to be moved by the honourable member for Gwydir would of be defeated by a large majority.,22
135,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"There seems to have been', I a sudden development since then.",22
136,Mr SALMON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Absolut e unanimity on the side.,22
137,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Does the honourable member were not within our rights in our honest opinion in regard to of a Royal Commission?,22
138,Mr MALONEY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,But was it the exercise . Mr Reid - I believe that on the merits of the question there are few - honourable members on the Government side of the House who would riot vote straight for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the administration of the Postmaster-General's Department. Do I underit stand that honourable members of the the Labour Party are opposed to a Royal Commission being appointed?,22
139,Mr HALL,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Severa l of them are.,22
140,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,But a great number of them are not. This is one of the inconveniences of our present position,22
141,Mr WATSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,We are divided; but the party opposite-the Opposition,22
142,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I do not think that the solidarity party ought to complain if occabeen sionally the Opposition has a spasm of solidarity. Honourable members who year after year stand together as solid as might occasionally allow honourable members below the gangway and the Opposition to vote together. That does not occur very often.,22
143,Mr WATSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Look at the objective,22
144,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,And the luxury of it ,22
145,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,It - was rather an enjoyment; and I frankly admit that I was o atnever more surprised in my life.,22
146,Mr WATSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"It must have been the of the caucus meetings that honourable members opposite have been holding, Mr Reid.'- I have held none.",22
147,Mr WATSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The Opposition have.,23
148,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Migh t I suggest that these temporary vicissitudes are very likely to occur in a House in which the Ministerial support is in itself so slight. .Ministers, in the ranks of thf.ir supporters, have not one representative of Queensland, Western Australia, or South Australia. They have only two representatives of New South Wales",23
149,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Does not the Attorneyare General represent Queensland? ,23
150,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"In the ranks of porters the Ministry have only two representatives of New South Wales and one presentative of Tasmania. If five or members of the Labour Party at any time asserted their independent convictions on matter of considerable importance on which they felt strongly they would certainly cause a crisis. The position of the Government is. such that a crisis would occur at any time that five or six honourable members of the Labour Party differed from them on an important matter such as is that relating the appointment of a Royal Commission inquire into the administration of a partment of the Public Service. The position are not to blame. I do not think they are ashamed of the vote they gave. do not think that we have reached a position in which any honourable' member is a bit ashamed of the vote he gave. The crisis has been caused by six or seven the Labour Party exercising their honest convictions on an important matter without regard to the interests of the Government. We are not responsible for that. It is rather too bad to expect us to go to the assistance of the Government, although' would be very convenient for them if always did so. They have < had our votes Government. more than once to save them when the Labour Party have been against them, and . not do so. they expect us when six or seven honourable members of that party break to their assistance and patch up their position. I do not think an Opposition can fairly be expected to perform for the Government unless there is involved a matter of principle on' which they are agreement with the Ministry. Unfortuorable nately on the occasion under review were absolutely opposed to the Government. We felt that a Royal Commission should be appointed, and the only course open us was to vote for the honourable member ' for Gwydir's proposition. I can only that if the honourable member for Gwydir accepts the compromise proposed by. the Prime Minister I accept it with him. I raise no point upon it, feeling sure that he will carry his proposal to a straight out issue when the proper time comes. As to 'the Tariff, could any one have a greater interest in getting it out of the way than the Opposition have? The Opposition is absolutely powerless so long as the fiscal question remains' unsettled; consequently, the Prime Minister, so far as party interests concerned, has taken a course which is just as advantageous to the Opposition as their supit is to the Government.",23
151,Mr WATSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"It is advantageous to all reparties-let the situation be resolved. six Mr Reid - It is advantageous to all parties. I urged at the last general election a that we should allow the fiscal question to remain undisturbed-that the Tariff .should remain as it was-^but a large majority of the electors decided that the fiscal question should be re - opened. To complete it and put it aside now that it has been re-opened is an interest common to all parties in this to Parliament, and it will be well for the to Commonwealth when that has been done. DeThat being so, the actual result of this Oparrangement will not be harmful-it will probably be beneficial so long as the matter I respecting which we haye been so much in earnest is not pushed aside. I hope now that this storm is over we shall be able to go to our respective homes and enjoy a members of very pleasant Easter.",23
152,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"B y way of personal explanation I wish to say, Mr Speaker, that from remarks which have been ma'de it might be inferred that I , as a Ministerial supporter, had approached the leader of the it Opposition with a view to inducing him to we support me in a motion antagonistic to the",23
153,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable member did,23
154,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I did not approach the away, to rush question in that form.",23
155,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable member obtained in open debate the support of the that service leader of the Opposition.,23
156,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I obtained his support in in common with that of a number of honmembers in all parts of the House. we I made it known .that I intended to avail myself of the earliest opportunity to press upon the House a motion of which I had to given notice, and I asked the leader of the 'Opposition,, as an individual, what his say views were on the subject. I was aware at the time that even if my motion were brought on and carried on a division the Government would not regard it as a vote of censure.",23

I was therefore quite rightin doing what I did to secure an opportunity to carry it . I can assure Prime Minister that, when speaking to leader of the Opposition, I was careful to indicate when I intended to submit motion, and I repeat that it was with knowledge that the Government would regard the carrying of the motion as a of censure upon them, that I took action. Having done that, I sought support f o in every, part of the House, and the support of the right honourable member for East Sydney as well as that of 'other honourable members.

165,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,-- I have to say as regards the position of the honourable member for Gwydir that the course proposed by the Prime Minister involves - merely . the postponement of the matter in which the honourable member is interested until the Tariff is out of the way.,24

167,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"When it is convenient to do so I am always' very glad to answer interjections, but I venture.to say that the maiii object for which the House assembled today . has been accomplished, and it would I the presume that honourable members wish to to catch the Inter-State trains that they may the enjoy a week's holidav in their homes. We have every assurance that the important question dealt with in the motion of the the honourable member for Gwydir will be f u l ly the discussed, and that an ample, opportunity not will be given the House to arrive at some the conclusion upon it . The question to which the it must give place is one which concerns the not country rather than members of Parliavote ment, and every one. will be exceedingly glad that the Prime Minister has underr it taken to complete its consideration at the earliest possible moment. ' I wish to sug. gest to the honourable gentleman that it is doubtful whether any other business should with be permitted to intervene between the settleme to mentof the Tariff and the resumption of debate on the motion of the honourable member, for Gwydir. I congratulate the House upon the. wav in which the Prime Minister's motion has been received.",24
168,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Gwydir) [3.23] - I have no apologies to offer for anything that counmay have happened since the last meeting I set out to deal with the matter covered by..mv motion in no. party spirit, and .without any desire to make it to a party question. The re-adjustment of the wrongs that are known to exist in the Post with and Telegraph Department should, in my opinion, be a matter absolutely above all partyinterests.",24
169,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Why did not the honourable member support my motion ?,24
170,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I wish the honourable member for Robertson would say something relevant or intelligible when he speaks. So far as I am concerned,' I have felt it to be my duty to endeavour to secure the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into matters which I think can only be properly investigated by such a body. It is not a matter of very much consequence to me by. what means the appointment of such a Commission is secured. That is proved by what I said on Thursday evening,, and by the fact that I stepped across 'to the other side of the House when the question of the adjournment of the debate came to a vote, because I thought that by doing so I was adopting the best means to"" < bring about the result I * desired. On that occasion, it appeared to me evident that the Ministry were not prepared to give definite time for bringing my motion to an issue, and that is-why I voted as I did. At present, however, I have an assurance that the House will be given an opportunity to record a vote on my motion, and, consequently, I feel assured .that I shall be able in the near future to secure the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department.",24
171,Mr WILSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Then the Government are going to give the honourable member his Roval Commission ?,25
172,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"As I now feel satisfied that that will very probably be the result, I have no longer any desire to deal with the matter in the spirit which actuated me on Thursday evening.",25
173,Mr WILSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Then the honourable member has been assured that he will get this Royal Commission ?,25
174,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"T . am assured that the honourable member for Corangamite will not get on to this side of the House. That may be a disappointment to the honourable member, but I have no desire to help him over here. I can honestly say that, having had an opportunity to review the position since Thursday evening, I have found that to have pressed my motion to a. vote on Thursday might not have resulted in the attainment of the object for which I moved it. I prefer to take no chances in the matter, and to accept a proposal which will lead to the attainment of the object I have in view- a thorough investigation of and report upon the Department in which I have interested myself. T repeat that I have no apologies to offer for taking the course I did. It is not my mission to put Governments out of office, or to serve the Opposition. It is rather my mission to serve the people, and that is what I have tried to do in the most effective and disinterested way possible under existing conditions. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [3.26] - I do' not intend to detain the House for more than a few minutes, and I certainly should not have spoken this afternoon but for the extraordinarystatement of the Prime Minister with regard to the action of honourable members on this side in - relation to the question of the Federal Capital Site. The honourable geri.tleman has been pleasedto make some statements, which,-if they'had been made outside, I shoulddismiss' with a very short word of three letters",25
175,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable member cannot spell ' true ' ' in three letters ? 1,25
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"-Whic h the rules of the House prevent me from using to describe those statements in this Chamber. I , therefore, content myself by saying that' in repeating what lie had already said when . interviewed by representatives of .the press, the Prime Minister has, this afternoon, made some statements'which are absolutely incorrect, and for which there is not a tittle of justification. What happened on Thursday afternoon? Honourable members are aware that the honourable member for Gwydir was anxious to discuss the question of an inquiry into the condition of the Post and Telegraph Department, but the moment the House met the Prime Minister, with an acrobatic swiftness which has never been equalled here, jumped in . ahead of the honourable member with an amendment declaring that the consideration of that question should be postponed until the following day, knowing, when he did so, that the question could not be discussed on the morrow.",25
177,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I knew that it could; and I know that now.,25
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,And knowing as we now know that he took the course he didin order to prevent the honourable member for Gwydir going on with his motion at all,25
179,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,O r any other honourable member with his motion. There were three.,25
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"What was the first thing that happened ? I took a point of order that the question could not be debated on the morrow, and asked you, Mr. Speaker, for your ruling. You, sir, told the House very plainly that the carrying of the Prime Minister's amendment meant the shelving of the question for three weeks. Before the amendment was withdrawn, I objected to it, and for the reason t-hat I was drafting at the table an amendment providing that the - honourable member for Gwydir's motion in relation to' the condition of the Post and Telegraph Department should come on for discussion on the day after the decision of the House had been taken on - the Federal Capital Site , question^ It was only when the Prime Minister, - watching me drafting the-amendment, 'arid watching me hand it to my chief - ' Mr DEAKiN -^Watchin g the honourable member? I had not the slightest idea what the honourable member was doing.",25
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"The honourable gentleman, bounded to his feet the moment my amendment was handed back to me b j the leader of the Opposition.",26
182,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The Prime Minister knew nothing about it .,26
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I venture to sa > that honourable members who imagine that the Prime Minister has been acting with the utmost simplicity and straightforwardness in this matter know nothing about the real facts of the case. Point by point we are getting out of the honourable gentleman the information that he knew of this motion long before, and did his best to circumvent it. Will the Prime Minister say that he did not know of the matter two days before?",26
184,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I shall say nothing more to the honourable member, but I shall say something of him presently. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Will the Prime Minister say that he was not warned - two days before that the matter would be serious ?",26
185,Mr REID,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Hear , hear; and then he made the arrangement.",26
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I challenge the Prime Minister to deny the statement. These are the facts of the situation, and for the Prime Minister to say that we were trying to block the Federal Capital question ",26
187,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Hear , hear !",26
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"It is idle for the Prime Minister to say that we were trying to block the Federal Capital question, when we were seeking by every means in our power to provide that it should take precedence of the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir. I think it right to make this explanation as to what actually took place on Thursday last. We did not object to the Prime Minister's amendmentwe took no exception to it . What we did want to provide, however, was that the matter should not be postponed for three weeks, and we endeavoured to secure that the Federal Capital question should not also be shelved. These two desires were in no way inconsistent. The Prime Minister, of all others, was the honourable member who, after declaring that the Capital. Site question should be decided at an early date, did his best to postpone it for at least three weeks. On him, therefore, is the responsibility for any delay thathas taken place in regard to the settlement of that question. I do not mind telling the Prime Minister something else about the Federal Capital question, if it will do him any good. I do not mind saying that, so far as I am concerned, a delay of a day or two will not hurt. That I wish the Prime Minister to understand, and I hope he is satisfied now.",26
189,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,This looks promising for Dalgety !,26
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"So far as I am able to see, things do look a little promising for Dalgety just now. Mr AUSTIN . CHAPMAN -=-Tim e fights on our side ! Mr JOSE PH COOK - I believe time is fighting a little on the side of the honourable member just now, and doubtless that is. why . he looks so pleasant. My answer to all the jibes of the Prime Minister is that we do not object to the postponement of the Fede- ral Capital question for one or two days. This has been a mock political crisis- a sham affair-al l through. It has been pathetic to read in the newspapers of the desire of the Prime Minister to resign office, and of his, only at the last moment, consenting to remain in office. These reports may or may not be correct; the Prime Minister has not said one. word on the matter. But we have seen the Prime Minister in this kind of mood before. His attitude today is, "" I do not wish to remain a minute in office, but for heaven's sake do what you can to keep me here! "" That is the explanation of what has gone on during the last week-end. Where is the Government Whip? That gentleman never had such a busy time in his l if e as he has had in squaring matters outside; and - the result of it all is that the Prime Minister has consented 'to retain office, in order to put the Tariff through. There may be some danger to the Tariff in consequence of a possible change in the Ministry, but; personally, I confess I do not see what that danger is, having regard to the position of the Tariff in this House. The Government, however,' seem to scent some danger, and even the scenting of danger was a sufficient appeal to the Prime Minister to take the steps he has taken during the last week-end to ultimately persuade my honourable friends in the corner to take the action they propose today. I should like to know where we now stand. We are told that the motion of the honourable member, for Gwydir is to be postponed until the Tariff is out of the way. But what is meant by the "" Tariff "" ? Do the Government mean by the "" Tariff "" the schedule of requests that-is now before the House? Are my friends of the Labour.Party going to assist the Government to put this Tariff on the statute-book at the earliest possible moment,' and then trust to luck as to the complemental part of the "" new protection "" in which they are so interested? Does dealing with the Tariff mean dealing also with the ""new protection,"" or are the members of the Labour Party going to deliberately assist the Government to pass the Tariff at the earliest possible moment, and then, it may be, aid in putting the Government out of office before the ""new protection"" proposals are dealt with? If that be so, I can only congratulate them on their attitude.",26
191,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable member is in favour of the ' ' new protection ' ' ?,27
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"The honourable member ought to be under no misapprehension as to my attitude on. that question. It is for the honourable member to bear his own responsibility; I have no right, and I do not propose, to quibble at any vote he may give. But it does seem to me that, after the specific declaration of the Prime Minister that the new and the old protection are indissolubly bound, so far as he is concerned, we have a right to have it made clear whether the postponement of the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir is to be until the complete protection proposals have been dealt with, or only until the old protection proposals have been placed on the statute-book ? That is a question on which I should expect to hear something from .my honourable friends in the Labour corner. I dare say they have made up their minds, and I only throw this hint out, because I shall be glad to hear what the complete proposals of the Government amount to. As I said before, this "" crisis "" has, in my judgment, been a sham from beginning to end. The threatened resignation was a sham-ther e never was a resignation, threatened or intended. This is simply a repetition of tactics on the »part of the Prime Minister with which we are by this - time well acquainted, and they,. therefore, cause us no surprise - I say now,, as I have said during the whole of the last week-end, that there will be no resignation, and that no resignation was ever intended by the Prime Minister.",27
193,Mr MALONEY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Melbourne) [3-37]-- I have never heard the honourable member for Parramatta speak without something of bitternesss. It is not,' perhaps, altogether what the honourable member says, but ""- it's Ministerial Statement. 10475 the narsty way 'e ses it . "" Of course, the old fable of the fox and the grapes will naturally recur to - honourable members. There was one word I was sorry to hear from the honourable member for Parramatta, and that had reference to his charge of an absence of straightforwardness. When the honourable member was a leader of the Labour Party, I know that we wished we could transfer him fromNew South Wales to Victoria, but, after my experience of him in this House, I am glad that we did not catch him. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There is hope of his conversion yet!",27
194,Mr MALONEY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"There may be, but the honourable member fpr Parramatta has certainly astonished some of his friends, and, I dare say, some of his enemies. We may, however, compliment the honourable member on his unswerving opposition to the Government. I really believe that. if the Government were composed of angels from heaven, the honourable member for Parramatta would be able to find some grounds for complaint. I hope that some day the honourable member will be freed from the duty of filling the disagreeable post of acting leader of the Opposition, by the House deciding to elect its own Ministers. In that event there will be no Opposition in the present sense, when the "" outs '.' are always trying to displace the "" ins."" I am sorry that the right honourable member for East Sydney is not in the chamber. He made a statement that was not fair to the Government, to the effect, that there were no. South Australian or. Western Australian members sitting behind them. Mav I ask him how many members from Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia are sitting behind him?",27
195,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"There are all those in the Opposition corner, but they are a long waybehind him.",27
196,Mr MALONEY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"The honourable member's opinion of that corner nearly coincides with my own, and I do not think they would welcome it. The right honourable member for East Sydney did not mention the fact that New South Wales, by its population, can claim twenty-seven votes in this House as against Victoria's twentytwo. The difference is five votes and the direct Opposition' has exactly' five votes more than the straight-out Ministerial partu. There is nothing for the right honourable member to boast of in that - The honourable member for Parramatta will admit that in the direct Opposition there are members who are more - in - unison with the Labour Party than with the Opposition Corner Party. Out of the twenty-seven New South Wales members, there are only about twelve behind the leader of the Opposition, while he has not even one Victorian supporter. I hope the proposal of the Prime Minister will be agreed to as quickly as possible. By no act of mine in this Housewould I willingly have thrown the Tariff into the turmoil of a political crisis. I know that in one firm alone, over 200 more employees have been taken on, while 800 have had-their salaries increased. That was due to the difference of 3d. agreed to by this House in the Excise duty on hand-made and machine-made cigarettes. If we went back to the conditions of the old Tariff,, which was most incomplete, 200 employees at least would lose their places, and the other 800 would have their wages reduced. reason alone, I would take no step to prevent the Tariff from finally passing. ami after eighteen years' experience in Parliament, against Royal Commissions. If - tlye House wants to remove abominations that may exist not only in the Post and Telegraph Department, but in other branches of the Public Service, let us be honest, pass an eight-hours B i provide that every, hour of overtime shall be paid for, and compel officers to send in their claims every week. If that were done, there would be no need for a Royal Commission. Later on,- when that question comes before the House, I shall put my arguments forward. I will content myself now with saying that I hope the day will come when there will be no Opposition to be led by the honourable member for Parramatta, and when, no honourable member will consider it his duty to strike at the Government at every opportunity, no matter what happens. That is not democratic, or in accordance with Australian sentiment, ancl the sooner it is ended, the better.",27
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I should not have said a word'today, but for the outrageous statements of the Prime Minister.",28
198,Mr MALONEY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Are the honourable member's statements never outrageous?,28
199,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Robertson) [3.45] - I deeply regretted to hear from the Prime Minister's statement that Order pf the Day No. 2 - Seat of Government Bill - would be postponed. think he - assumed more than he was justified in doing, when he. assumed that his amendment, moved on Thursday last, in connection with grievance day, was going to be defeated. I came to the House specially to deal with the Federal Capital Site question, putting aside several important, business engagements to' be present. Before I came to the House I made inquiries in the proper quarter as to the course I should have to take to bring forward on grievance' day my motion to place the Post and Telegraiph Department, in Commission- a determination which would revolutionize that part of the Public Service. I might have prepared to rise just as the honourable member for Gwydir rose, to put forward my motion, had I wished to postpone the consideration of the Capital Site question.",28
200,Mr THOMAS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,It is too thin.,28
201,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"That is not so. I want the Prime Minister to underFor that stand that - the House may not have been against him on that da,y, when I he thought it was. I was prepared to bring on my motion, but had no intention of pressing it then, because the I understood that the Prime Minister wished to bring on the Federal Capital Site question. The honourable gentleman did not take a vote, and so he does not know l l , that' this side would have voted against him, but he withdrew his motion. He must not'be piqued,"" therefore, because he had a wrong impression, and so postponed the consideration of the Capital Site.",28
202,Mr SALMON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Every member of the Opposition spoke against the Prime Minister's amendment.,28
203,Mr HENRY WIILLIS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"That is not so; a great deal of impromptu talking was done, but, if honourable members had had an opportunity for reflection for an hour or so, many of those speeches would not have been made. What I am concerned about is that the Prime Minister is now going to penalize New South Wales because of what appears to be a crisis.' If I am a judge of what is going on, there is no course open to the Prime Minister except to resign on a certain day-that is, when Orders of the Day Nos. 4 and 5 have been disposed of. I hope, however, that the Prime Minister will not take that course, but will go on with the Capital Site question. If he is prepared to condone and overlook the I humiliation that certain honourable members have sought to impose upon him, he can safely do so. I will support him to the fullest of my power, if he will bring on the Seat of Government Bill after the sideration of the Tariff has been dissible posed of.",28
204,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I proposed to do it fore, if possible.",29

HENRY WILLIS - That is satisagainst the unfairness of the Prime Minfactory to me, and I will promise the orable gentleman my support if he will bring on Order of the Day No. 2, the of Government Bill. Mr LIDDELL ^ (Hunter) [3.48] - My remarks will be brief, and, I hope, to the matter ? point. I wish to say, on behalf of constituents, that I regret exceedingly, common with the honourable member for Robertson, that the question of the Capital Site has been postponed. I must congratuquestion. late the Prime Minister on having been able so successfully to save his face on the sent occasion, but I warn him that the people of New South Wales, at any rate, are getting tired of these proceedings.",29
207,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I should think so.,29
208,Mr LIDDELL,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Recently , when withmember in the bounds of my electorate, I was peatedly asked, ""When are we going to have justice at the hands of your ParliaGovernment. ment? When are you going to settle the question of the Capital Site?"" I believe that much of the irritation felt throughout the land today is due to the fact that that question has not been settled.",29
209,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,When is New South Wales going to accept our decision? That - is the trouble. We decided it.,29
210,Mr LIDDELL,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"That is a point which I am not prepared to debate just now. What I have risen to say is that the sooner the Capital Site question is settled to the satisfaction of the majority, the better it will be.",29
211,Mr WYNNE,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,It has been settled Parliament.,29

I urge the Prime Minister, if wishes to do justice, to bring forward the [373 ] conCapital Site question at the earliest posmoment. I , for one, will help him all I can to do so, though I confess that beI should be in a dilemma had I to choose between the bringing forward of the Capiquestion and the sweeping of this has Government out of office. Had I that Day choice, I should probably vote for the latter alternative.",29
213,Mr JOHNSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Lang) [3.52] - I wish, without taking up much time, to protest honister in attempting to saddle the members of the Opposition with responsibility for Seat the situation created by members of the Ministerial Labour corner.",29
214,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"What does it my Mr JOHNSON - It matters to the exin tent that, by a misstatement of fact, the Prime Minister seeks to saddle the Opposition with delaying the Federal Capital",29
215,Mr SALMON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The attempt would have prebeen all right had it been successful.,29
216,Mr JOHNSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"No one knows better than does the Prime Minister that his statement of the occurrence is not correct, and that the whole responsibility rests with a who sits on one of the Ministerial recross benches, and belongs to the party which is popularly believed to control the If a situation unpleasant to Ministers has arisen, the responsibility rests, not with the Opposition, but with that section of Ministerial supporters. Personally, I was desirous of getting on with the Federal Capital question, and rose several times to speak, but was unsuccessful in catching your eye, Mr Speaker. 1 hope that the question will be revived at as early a date as possible. I wish also to protest against the proposed postponement of business now. Notwithstanding the declaration of the Prime Minister as to the urgency of dealing with the Tariff, it is proposed that we shall not enter upon by our work for another week. Some honourable members have been obliged to tiavel 600 miles to get here this afternoon, and has we have to-night to return another 600 of miles without having done anything. We have met, but there is no business to be The least the Government we might do, before calling the House together, is to find business for it to proceed with. Honourable members who have travel long distances to attend here have he a legitimate grievance when, on getting here, they are told that it is proposed to adjourn for a week before proceeding to business. These proceedings are in the last degree Gilbertian, and those who read the accounts of them must be impressed with the absolute insincerity of the Government which is responsible for them.",29
217,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.55]--There is little to reply to, except the insinuation of the deputy leader of the Opposition that my course in withdrawing my amendment for the postponement of the consideration of grievances on Thursday last was taken because of my knowledge of His intention to propose another amendment. hint, suggestion, or conception of such action on his part, or on that of any other honourable member, was in my mind when I withdrew my amendment. I wished to ask ten or fifteen minutes earlier for leave to 'withdraw it ; but, on mentioning the matter to my colleagues, they said, ""Wait until we are certain that the House really wishes you to withdraw."" What decided me in asking leave to withdraw my amendment was not a doubt as to what the House wished, but the objection that notice had not been given .of my amendment. I admit that notice was not' given,' and that objection having been raised, felt bound to recognise it , and did so in the only way in my power, by asking leave to withdraw the amendment.",30
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The Prime Minister will recollect that I objected to its with- . Mr KELLY drawal.,30
219,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Yes . The honourable member objects to everything.,30
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,That is everything else the honourable and learned gentleman says.,30
221,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"On Friday I proposed an arrangement- which was telegraphed all over the Commonwealth-that the Fedeof truth in them. ral Capital Site question should be dealt with on Tuesday and Wednesday; while on my feet, it was pointed out to me that Tuesday's sitting would probably be occupied with the discussion of the Estimates, and therefore, without referring to the notice-paper, I made the arrangement for Wednesday and Thursday.",30
222,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable and learned member did that because of question which I asked.,30
223,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Yes . H a d I examined the notice-paper, I should have seen that Thursday was grievance day. when 1 discovered that fact, I saw that, I allowed the formal motion for going into Committee of Supply, under which grievances are debated, to be proposed in the ordinary way, I should be challenged with having broken the compact with the Opposition. It had been telegraphed all over the Commonwealth that members would be invited on Thursday to vote on the Federal Site question, and no other, and I felt sure that, when it was found that they were being asked to deal with any or every grievance, I should be charged with having deliberately brought about the postponement of the Federal Capital Site question. My mistake was, that directly T No found out that Thursday was grievance day., I did not point out the position to the House, and give notice*'of my intention to move to postpone the consideration of the Order of the Day for going into Committee of Supply. My action in moving the postponement of all grievances was impelled by the necessity for fulfillin g our pledge; 1 because I thought that my inaction would be distorted into an attempt to defeat the wishes of those to whom I had promised that we should deal with the Capital Site question. Those remarks dispose of the statements of the deputy leader of the Opposition, who has since said himself that there was strong reason for not dealing with the Capital Site question on Thursday, and that he had a motive for not wishing that the question should come on on the day fixed. - He did not say that, or anvthing like it .",30
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,How the Prime Minister can make such a statement is as true as beyond my comprehension.,30
225,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I appeal to every man in the House to say whether my statements are not in accordance with what occurred. :,30
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,There is not a tittle,30
227,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable membut ber must withdraw that remark.,30
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I do so; and say that the statements of the Prime Minister are not in exact accordance with the truth.,30
229,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I will be judged by those who heard what was said a - few moments ago. The Minister of Trade and Customs . replied by interjection to a the statement. of the honourable member. A colloquy took place between them, during which the honourable member stated that the prospects of Dalgety thai Later, night were too good. My colleague picked if up the remark, and rejoined that he thought that that was so, and that time was helping him. The honourable member for Parramatta did not agree with that statement, although he implied most distinctly that on Thursday last the prospects of the site which he is most anxious for were not so favourable as he wished them to be.",30
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I said no such thing.,31
231,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"All I wish for is the record of Hansard, about which there can be no mistake. I appeal to it, and by it I stand.",31
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Will the Prime Minister take the official record to which he appeals, and show that I offered the slightest objection to the consideration of the Capital Site question on Thursday night?

If those words, as they stand in the report, do not bear out what I say, I shall make the most absolute withdrawal and apology ever made in this Chamber. But every man on this side will have to do the same thing.. I appeal to every member here. Honourable members know that the honourable member said that he had motives for not wishing for a decision on Thursday.",31
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I never said such a thing.,31

238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I will tell the honourable member what I said.,31
239,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I heard distinctly what was said.,31
240,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I did not introduce this question, and did not propose to deal with it ; but I was compelled to do so because of interjections, made chiefly by the [373]- 2 honourable member for Parramatta. His action obliged me to make known the facts regarding the occurrences of Thursday night.",31
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The Prime Ministei is reported to have said It was with unfeigned amazement that I discovered,31

244,Mr MALONEY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Fro m what is the honourable member about to read?,31
245,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"This is a newspaper report of a statement made by me in the course, of an interview. I am reported to have said- . Under these circumstances, it was with unfeigned amazement that I discovered the very Oppositionists who had deliberately sanctioned but in the setting apart of Thursday for determining the Federal Capital Site insisting that our agreement be broken. I said that.",31
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I ask the honourable member to prove that statement from the' official record.,31
247,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I prove it by these facts: When I discovered that Thursday was grievance day; I took the only step in my power to keep the promise T had made to the House, that the vote on the Seat of Government Bill should be taken then, by moving the postponement of the consideration of grievances. I was aware that probably several honourable members intended to move amendments to the formal motion forgoing into Committee of Supply. I had not the honourable member for Gwydir particularly in' my mind, though I had heard that he and the honourable member for Riverina and another honourable member, whose name I cannot at this moment recall, each intended to move an amendment. No one was certain that any of these amendments would be moved; but every one knew that there were likely to be three or four amendments to the motion to go into Committee. I interposed with my amendment for the postponement of the consideration of the Order of the Daynot to interfere with the action of honourable members, but to keep faith with the House in regard to the Federal Capital Site. The instant I did so the leader and the deputy leader of the Opposition took objection to that course, urged every reason against it , and appealed to the House to insist on the discussion of grievances. They did notsay "" instead of the discussion of the Federal Capital Site "" ; but the consideration ot the Order of the Day involved the postponement ot the debate on the Seat of Government Bill. I warned them distinctly by interjection that by their action they were putting off that decision, and in spite of my warning they objected, as I have said.' The honourable member for Parramatta has stated that the reasons which actuated him and others in the matter",31
248,Mr JH CATTS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable and learned member for Parkes was one.,32
249,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Severa l members took up the position which I have described. That is the statement which I make in the presence of honourable members who were here, and heard what was said, both then and this afternoon. accuracy cannot be challenged. I did not introduce the subject, and am sorry that it has been introduced.",32
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Will the Prime Minister, to be fair, read this passage from the Hansard report?",32
251,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,It is an interjection the honourable memberThese questions have waited so long that might well wait ahother day until the Capital Site question has been disposed of.,32
252,Mr JH CATTS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,He said something besides that.,32
253,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Yes . corded on one page of the record that he twice rose to points of order, objecting to the amendment which I moved, while third point of order is recorded on the same page.",32
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,Rea d what,32
255,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"The honourable member took points of order upon the Standing Orders, and asked, "" Can we proceed the formal motion tomorrow ? "" So I found him throughout, even going so far, as has just admitted, as to object to me leave to withdraw the amendment or to on with it .",32
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,I rose to object the honourable member withdrawing a proposition which would prevent the movor ing of our amendment.,32
257,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"What would have been the result if his leader and himself moved the amendment which they say day. they had prepared? Simply a debate on that amendment which would have shut out the Capital Site question just as decisively as anything else. Had they submitted an amendment of that character - to put aside the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir in order to allow the Capital Site question to come on that evening-it s consideration would have occupied the greater part, if not the whole of that sitting. Would a number of men who were so strongly moved as they afterwards stated in regard to the necessity for. a postal inquiry that they would allow nothing to intervene-woul d they 'have stood aside lo allow even the Capital Site guestion to intervene ? If the pledge to me had no binding effect on those who made it to me, why should it have a binding effect on those who honourable did not make it , and therefore had not the same obligation? Therefore the statement as to the amendment is a mere cloud to cover their escape from the fact that their action put aside the consideration of the Capital Its Site, that their amendment would have done the same thing; and this too after an agreement had been arrived at all round the Chamber for its consideration on that day. I regret, sir, that I have been obliged by these constant interruptions to reply on this matter, but ven-' ture to say that there is nothing that honby orable members on this side have to conceal. Certainly I shall be only the better they pleased the more attention the honourable members opposite call to their conduct on the occasion referred to.",32
258,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I desire to make a perI find it resonal explanation, sir.",32
259,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I had better say to the honourable member forthwiththat, as a the Prime Minister has replied, no reference to the debate can be made, but if he desires to make a personal explanation he I said. is at liberty to do so.",32
260,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I do not propose to debate the question, but merely to state the' facts with so far as I know them. I went and saw the Prime Minister on the evening of Wedhe nesday last with the honourable member for getting Parramatta. We both .arranged with the go honourable and learned gentleman, in the ordinary parliamentary way, to take the to vote on the Seat of Government Bill on Thursday afternoon at half-past 5 o'clock, so soon afterwards as reasonable discussion would permit. At that time. I had not the slightest knowledge of any business had which was to intervene on "" grievance""",32
261,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,And I have never said that the honourable member had.,33
262,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"What I wish to be distinctly understood is that I thought that the arrangement was that the consideration of the Seat of Government Bill was to go on from Wednesday into Thursday, with no other business intervening. On Thursday morning I heard that other business was to intervene, and that there would be no opportunity to get to the Seat of Government Bill . The next day I was told by the honourable member for Boothby-that several days before he had warned the Prime Minister that the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir was to be moved, and that the numbers were against the Government.",33
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I also rise to make a personal explanation. What the Prime Minister has said is correct so fax as it goes. I have not risen for the purpose of disputing what he said, except so far as he has tried to read into the report of Thursday's proceedings something which I think does me an injustice. An agreement was made, and I do not take any exception to anything which he said in that regard. But I do take exception to his statement that we insisted upon breaking the agreement. Here is Hansard, and the honororable member will not find one 'word in the report of what took place on Thursday to show that I 'had any other desire than to facilitate the consideration' of the Seat of Government Bill , as my interjection to the honourable member for Gwydir clearly proves.",33

271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I have already plained that I was busy drafting an amendcalled ment to provide that the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir should be taken immediately after the question of the Capital Site had been decided, and that it was only the Prime Minister's swiftness which prevented me from .moving it . That is my explanation.",33
272,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I also desire to make a personal explanation. Some days ago the honourable member for Boothby informed me that he was in favour of a proposal for appointing a Royal Commission in regard to the Post and. Telegraph Department. He said that the question was coming on again. There was no reference made at that time, and certainly I have not the least recollection'of the honourable.member referring to its being set down for, oir coming up, on any particular day. In. fact, at that time, I believe it was on the notice paper, .and could not be brought forward on ""grievance"" day. The honourable member also told - me, if my memory serves me aright, that he thought that a majority of his party were in favour of the appointment of a Royal Commission. He - may have meant a majority of the House, but, if so, he did not convey his meaning to me. I took him to mean that a majority of his party were in favour of the proposal. I understood him to be referring to his own party.",33
273,Mr JOHNSON,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"He never came near me, anyway.",33

279,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Perhaps I may be to take this opportunity of stata point of order, because it bears so directly on what the honourable member for Melbourne has just said. The Prime Minister rose to ask leave to withdraw his amendment, and while he was standing, exthe honourable member for Parramatta "" I object,"" but that was not a call of which I could take any notice, because it was made while he was seated, and also at an improper time. 1 at once rose, and asked "".Is it the pleasure of the House that the Prime Minister have, leave to withdraw his amendment,"" and there was no objection. Had there been a single objection to that request-fro m the honourable member for Parramatta, or from any one else- I should have had to take notice of it, and the amendment could not have been withdrawn.",33
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I ran clear up this matter, sir, if you will allow me to make' an explanation.",34
281,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,What does the honourable orable member desire to explain? Mr. JOSEPH Cook - That I am being misunderstood.,34
282,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"If the honourable member considers that he has been - misunderstood, he can make an explanation.",34
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"I do indeed, sir.",34
284,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,It is an extraordinary attitude for the honourable member to adopt.,34
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,The honourable member for Melbourne is quite right. I did object to the Prime Minister withdrawing his amendment. But what was it? It was one to provide an opportunity for the consideration of the Capital Site question before the proposal of the honourable member for Gwydir. I did object to the with-' drawal of that.,34
286,Mr MALONEY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Why did not the honourable member say so before? . Question resolved in the affirmative. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.

287,Mr MALONEY,NORTHERN MAIL STEAMER,"Melbourne) [4-16] I desire to bring under the notice of the House a very regrettable fact, and that is that in Victoria criminals are being made indirectly out of the old-age pensions system. Anything 1 could say to persuade honourable members to push on with the question of establishing a Federal system I would gladly say. In Victoria, married sons, with familiesdependent uponthem, are being sent to prison simply because tru-y have not complied with an order made by a Court-to contribute so much towards an old-age pension. The sooner that this question is taken up by this Parliament, the sooner will that regrettable state of things be removed - Sir George Turner,- to his honour, instructed that no one should be sent to prison on account of his poverty, but I am sorry to say that it is now being done in Victoria under cover of a failure by a son to contribute to the provision of an old-age pension for his parents.",34
