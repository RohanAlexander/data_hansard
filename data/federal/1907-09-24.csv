Mr JOHNSON presented a petition from certain women electors of New South Wales, accompanied by the declaration by the officers of the Women's Liberal League of St. George, signed before a justice of the peace, that every signature attached to it was genuine, praying the House not to pass the Tariff. Petition received and read. Mr SINCLAI R presented a petition from certain teachers of music resident in the Moreton electorate.",14
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member read the prayer of the petition ?,14
2,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"The petition concludes with these words- -. 1 We respectfully urge that the duties hitherto levied on pianos are ciuite high - enough, and that, the proposed increased duties should not be agreed to by the Federal Parliament.",14
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I asked the honourable member to read the prayer of the petition because it is required by - standing order 73 that every petition shall conclude with a prayer.' What is intended is that the request which petitioners make shall be intimated to the House. Unless - a petition contains a request it is not in order. I am not quite sure whether the paragraph which the honourable member has read will be regarded by honourable members as a prayer, though I think that it comes near enough to the statement of a request to answer the requirements of the standing order. If honourable ..members will in future see that in the concluding paragraphs of the petitions which, they pre.sent something is asked for, the petitions will comply much more closely with the requirements of the standing order. Petition received and read.",14
4,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"In reference to petitions, I may state that certain documents have been intrusted to me for presentationto the House, but I am not sure that they are strictly in order.",14
5,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Are they against the Tariff? ' Mr Mahon - Yes .,14
6,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Petitions against the Tariff are comingin like snow-flakes.,15
7,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I ask to be allowed lo read part of one of these documents, so that you, Mr Speaker, may inform me whether I shall be in order in presenting them as petitions. These are the documents referred to in a letter received by the honourable member for South Sydney some time ago, in which it is stated'that the mining managers of Western Australia were forcing individuals to sign certain petitions. I notice several names attached whose owners could not be forced to do anything that they might be unwilling to do. One of these documents readsWc, the undersigned, recognising that the result of the new Tariff will operate most harshly upon the people and industries of Western Australia, beg resiicclfullv to record our protest against such a Tariff, and to ask our representatives in both Senate and House of Representatives to use every endeavour to have the additional duty rescinded. We are convinced[a) That under the new Tariff the mining, agricultural, pastoral, and other industries will suffer materially. (4) That the purchasing power of wages will decrease; and that stagnation in almost every department will be the inevitable result.",15
8,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Is this a petition? If so, it should not be read until it has been received.",15
9,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am asking, for information.",15
10,Mr WATSON,Unknown,What information?,15
11,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am asking whether I shall be in order ill presenting certain documents as petitions. To continue the quotation- . [c) That by the prohibitive Tariff on foreign magazines and literature, the readers of this State are cut off from the privileges and enlightening influences of the world's intelligence. The document from which I have, read comes from the Mount Morgans and Murrin Murrin districts of Western Australia, and there is another couched in almost similar terms from the Laverton district of the Mount Margaret gold-field. Neither commences with the usual preamble nor concludes with the usual prayer, which leaves a doubt as to whether they can without amendment be received.",15
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I take this opportunity to say that there is no such thing as a usual, prayer. The prayer required by the standing order is not that form of words which usually concludes a petition"" and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray."" These words are quite unnecessary, and are not the prayer of a petition. The standing order requiring that every, petition shall end with a prayer means that something must be asked for. A document which does not ask for something is not a petition. If this petition is addressed to the House, contains at its close a request, and is throughput respectfully worded, it may be received. But listening just now to the portion of the petition which the honourable member read it appeared to me that it has been addressed to honourable members representing Western Australia, and not to the House.",15
13,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"No , that is not so.",15
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If I am mistaken, and the petition is presented by the honourable member, I shall put the question that it be received, because I noticed nothing in what the honourable member read which would preclude it from being received.",15
15,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The petition is addressed "" To the Members of the Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth Parliament,"" and is headed ""Protest Against Increased Duties.""",15
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the petition ask for anything? If it does not I think that it cannot be received.,15
17,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Substantiall y it. asks that the increased duties should not be imposed, though in a particular form of words.",15
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"May I suggest that it would save the time of the House if honourable members intrusted with the presentation of petitions about the form of which they are not quite clear, would show - them to me before the meeting of the House at which they propose to present them. In this case I think from what the honourable member for Coolgardie has last said that the documents which have been ' intrusted to him are not' petitions containing a request, but are protests, and this House has no power, under any standing order with which I am acquainted, to receive a protest at the hands of any one. NA PRACTICE.",15
19,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I wish to ask the Minister of Defence without notice whether in view of the fact that the New South Wales branch of the National - Rifle Association' holds its annual meeting next month he will take immediate steps to supply cadets who desire to take part in that meeting with proper ammunition for practice purposes?,15
20,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I shall make a note of the"" honourable member's request, and will see that every necessary step istaken. CORDITE AND, SMALL ARMS FACTORIES.",16
21,Mr CROUCH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I wish to ask the Minister of Defence without notice if fore honourable members are asked in Comsmall mittee of Supply to agree to the votes proafter posed for the establishment of small arms and cordite factories he will arrange to liave all the papers dealing with these matters, including the reports of responPrime sible officers, - available to honourable bers?",16
22,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The question of _ the manufacture of cordite is a very intricate and important one, and honourable members will be supplied with the fullest informasufficiently tion before the Government will ask them to take any steps in the direction indicated. Mr Hake, the Government adviser in the matter, is at present in England. whole question of explosives is in such an uncertain state at the present time, not Australia but in Great Britain, that the House is entitled to the fullest information in order that honourable members may know exactly what the Government proto pose. I have spoken to the Acting Prime Minister, and can now state that the vote in reference to cordite will not be gone on ments referred to are correct. with today, or until the House is in session of the fullest information on .subject PRIME MINISTER.",16
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I should like ask the Acting Prime Minister, without tice, whether, in view of the many stater ments daily appearing in the press concernduce ing the possibility of Mr Deakin's early the defect. return to the House, he is able to inform honourable members as to the date of his return ?",16
24,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,""" A most impertinent question ! """,16
25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"In reply to the honourable member's question, I may say that I was speaking to Mr Deakin today cise on the telephone, and that be expects to Eegulationsibe in his place in the House tomorrow. Honorable MEMBERS--Hear , hear.",16
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I am glad to hear it. COAL COMBINE .,16
27,Mr KING OMALLEY,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Ministef a question with-' out notice. Reference is made in the Age this morning to operations of the coal vend, which, in my opinion, are a very serious matter. In an article in the Age dealing with the delay being experienced by Inter-State steam-ship companies in obtaining loadings of coal for their vessels at Newcastle, two illustrations are given ; beone of the refusal of the vend to supply a steamer with about 1,000 tons of coal, three months' notice, the reason be- ing that this vessel did not happen to be one of the Union Steam-ship Company's steamers. I should like to ask the. Acting Minister if that is not clear evidence memthat the colliery combine and the shipping ring have entered into a solemn partnership under which one party chloroforms the people while the other picks their pockets, and whether, if the law is not wide to reach these people, he will introduce a Bill in order that we may have an opportunity to so legislate as to prevent this plunder vend from robbing the The people of Australia?",16
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I did not read in the whole of the article to which the honourable member referred, but I read a. portion of it . On Saturday I .had a consultation with the Attorney-Genera] in regard this matter, and another today, and, as a result, action is being taken to see whether it can be proved that the stateThey are posmerelv statements, and. we must have abthe solute proof that they are well founded before we take action, so that we shall, not fai l in the course we take. I may say further that if there appears to be any to defect in the law at the present time nowhich would prevent our dealing widi such a matter the Attorney-General will introa Bil l of a clause or two to remedy PAPERS.

This motion is moved for the same, reason as that which justified the adoption of a similar motion last Tuesday. Question resolved in the affirmative. LATE MR. M . H . J. MCDONNELL .",17
30,Mr WEBSTER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"the PostmasterCommittee General, upon notice Whether it is the intention of the Department to grant.to the widow of the late Mr M . H . J. Minister? MCDonnell, a postal official for 45 years, any gratuity in lieu of the sum of ^231 paid by such officer into the Superannuation Fund during his term of service, he having died on leave prior to retirement?",17
31,Mr MAUGER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"This is entirely a matgenerally, ter of State law, and one for arrangement week. with the State Government. The official answer to the question is as follows:This case is governed by the provisions of Section 51 of the New S.outh Wales Civil vice Act 1884 which provides that If any officer die leaving a widow children under sixteen years of age necessitous circumstances, the Government may, on inquiry into the case, out of the Superannuation such widow or children a gratuity not exceeding six months salary which such officer shall have been receiving at the time of his death. Unless Mrs MCDonnell furnishes the requisite evidence that she is entitled to a gratuity in accordance with the above-Quoted provisions of the New South Wales Civil Service Act 1884, no gratuity can legally be paid. WOOLLEN TRADE WAGES BOARD.",17
32,Mr WEBSTER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice-1. Whether he is aware that the employers in the woollen trade have refused to sit on the Wages Board, unless one of the employees representatives is withdrawn? 2. In view of the new protection policy, will the Minister consider the advisability of reducing the proposed duties on woollens, and thus assert the principle underlying the said policy ?",17
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"In answer to the honourable member's question, I beg to state)I am not aware of the trouble referred to, but.it is the desire of the Government to obtain authority to deal with cases where attempts are made to clog the working of the Wages Boards or similar bodies, and it is hoped that this can be done in connection with the new protection. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",17
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Before the House proceeds with Government businessI should like to ask permission to put a. question to the Acting Prime Minister.,17
35,Mr SPEAKER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Is it the pleasure of the House that the-honourable member haveleave to. put a question at this stage? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",17
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"My reason for asking the question is the position of business before us. I see that the second order of the day is for the resumption of theof Ways and Means, apparently to be taken immediately following Supply. Is that the intention of the Acting PrimeHas the honourable gentleman dropped the idea of proceeding with the Billswhich he has already announced his intenwhile tion' to submit? I ask the Acting Prime Minister to give honourable members an idea,, as to the course of business this",17
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"There has beenno alteration in the order of business, but the resolutions in Committee of Supply Serwill have to. be covered by resolutions in» Committee of Ways and Means, and thenor any embodied in a Bill for transmission to> in another place. Therefore, the business regrant ferred to by the honourable member hasAccount to been placed second.",17
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,For the purpose of dealing with the Works and Buildings A p propriation Bill ? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Yes .,17
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,And then the other measures to which the honourable gentleman has referred will be taken?,17
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"On e or two of them. SUPPLY. ADDITIONS , NEW WORKS, AND BUILDINGS . In Committee (Consideration resumed"" from 20th, September, vide page 3619): DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS . Division 9 (Conimpmvealth Offices irr London), £1,000. Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) 1 [3.21] - When the House rose on Friday the understanding was that we were to havesubmitted to us by the Acting Prime Minister a memorandum setting out .all detailsconnected with the proposal for the acquirement of a site in London on which to» establish Commonwealth offices. A document has been placed in our hands, but apart from the fact that we have just re-ceived it, a cursory glance leaves the matter, - to my mind, as indefinite and chaotic as before.. I do not know what the Government propose to do. Have the Government a definite proposal in regard to this matter, and if so, what is it ? The statements in the memorandum are as indefinite - as were the statements made on Friday. For instance, we are told that there are three sites under offer to us, and that the '.lowest rent is 15s. per superficial foot.",17
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,If the honourable member reads the memorandum he will see 'that the person acting for the Commonwealth in London expects to obtain the land for 13s. per superficial foot.,18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"That is one of the points of indefiniteness about the whole - scheme. The Acting Prime Minister ought to have had a definite offer to submit to ""honourable members. What may or may not happen in further negotiations is' scarcely satisfactory to the House, particularly when the difference is so much as that represented tietween 13s. and 19s. per superficial foot. The last offer of the London County Counc i l was, I think, 18s. per superficial foot.",18
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,No .,18
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It appears from the memorandum that the London County surely ? Council made an offer of land at 18s. per - superficial foot, and that they have since - said they are open to. receive an offer, will not quote any lower price. We are further told that Mr Burr, the architect, - hopes to be able to get the land for the - same price as was paid for the site purchased by the Victorian Government. However, that is only the expression of pious hope, which may or may not be realized.",18
45,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Has the Acting Prime cil means. Minister made any statement in the matter Mr. JOSEPH"" COOK - Yes ; the Actthe ing Prime Minister made a statement which 'Jeft honourable members in such a condition of mind that they were not able to - appreciate the position.",18
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If I spoke fo - week I could not satisfy the honourable member, who already knows as much about ;the matter as I can tell him.",18
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Then I confess ii know nothing about the matter. If that .'is all the information the Acting Prime Minister can give me, I regret very much ""that his labour has brought forth ' such shocking mouse in the way of a proposal. What is the projected buiiding to cost?"" Has the Acting Prime Minister any information on that subject?",18
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,A little.,18
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"On e newspaper of this morning says that the building will Cost from £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 to .£200,000, while a second newspaper estimates the cost at between £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 8 0 , 0 0 0. Has the Acting Prime Minister any estimate of the proposed expenditure? Has he any definite statement to make to the House as to what the ground is to cost? Is there any undertaking with respect to the rates that will have to be paid? Having regard ' to the trend of politics in the old country there ought to be a very definite covenant in the contract as to the payment . of any land tax which may be imposed. All these are matters in respect to which the agreement may be modified very considerably, and as to which there ought to be some definite information given to the Committee by the Acting Prime Minister. If a land tax be imposed in the old country it will f all very heavily on these choice sites in the city of London. Who is to pay the land tax?",18
50,Mr KING OMALLEY,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,-^Not the tenant,18
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"But we shall be lessee for ninety-nine years-practi but cally the owners of the site, and, therefore, presumably the tax will f all on us.",18
52,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I think the presumption is the other way.,18
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"At any rate, a these are matters which ought to be settled in the covenant. We ought to know exactly what the offer of the London County CounI f the offer is from 13s.. to ? 19s. per superficial foot, plus rates of all kinds, and plus land tax, we may find site . cost us very dear indeed. But apart from the cost, there are matters which ought to be definitely dealt with in the contract. After all Captain Collins' stupendous efforts in the direction of negor a tiating for a site, we know nothing whatever as to price or conditions, except that a schedule of prices has been given, and that the London County Council are open to receive offers. . This leaves the matter as indefinite as it is possible for it to be; and before we pass this vote, which, I take it, will involve the subsequent voting a of money for a building, we ought to know exactly what are the terms of the contract.",18
54,Mr JOHNSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I understand that the municipal taxes in London amount, in some instances, to 6s. 8d. in the £ i .",19
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"And , judging by what we know of British politics, it will not be long before there is a land tax which will have to be added to the price.",19
56,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The land tax will not be added unless there is a clause in the agreement to that effect.,19
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am inclined to think it will be added-an y one who took a block of land for ninety-nine years would have to pay the land tax. At any rate, I shall be very much surprised to hear to the contrary.",19
58,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Does the honourable member remember what was the effect of the Reid land tax on the Cooper estate?,19
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Whateve r the' effect may be, we ought to have definite information before we decide to make the purchase.",19
60,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It all depends upon the title of the London County Council.. For all we know, the London County Council may not have the freehold, but merely an extended lease for, sav, 999 vears.",19
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"that , again, is a matter on which we ought to be informed, but not one word has been said by the Acting Prime Minister in reference to any of the points I have raised. When I ask for information, the honourable gentleman simply says that he could not satisfy me if he talked for a hundred years.",19
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I said I could not satisfy the honourable member if I talked for a week.,19
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"What is the difference? Will the Acting Prime Minister tell us what the terms of the contract are? If he will do so, I shall sit down and listen with every desire to help in the acquisition of a site. So far, however, we have had thrown before us a proposal which I venture to say'may involve an outlay of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 per annum in the shape of rent and taxes. - ",19
64,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,What about the interest on the building?,19
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am speaking of the. ground rent alone, which may involve us in .the amount I have mentioned"". Then it is proposed to erect a stately building upon it in accordance with plans which must be acceptable to the architect to the London County Council. We are also told very franklv that the building must be such as to add to the architectural beauty of the city. That again, if it means anything at all, means a huge expenditure in the shape of buildings. I venture to say that £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 will not be far from the mark as the expenditure which will have to be incurred before the buildings are erected and ready for occupation. That means a serious undertaking for the Commonwealth. If we are to pay for the office out of revenue it means that we shall have to go to the Customs for £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 for the purpose. Is that in contemplation by the Acting Prime Minister? From what source does he propose to raise the revenue to erect this huge and handsome building? Does he propose to raise a loan or to take the money from our revenue? We ought to know. If we are going to take the amount from revenue, involving by way of Customs duties the raising of four times the amount required for this purpose, the people of this country ought to be given definite particulars of the undertaking upon which they are entering. They ought to know that they will have to' pay £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 for the building alone, ground rent at the rate of £.10,000 a year, if taxes be added, and in all probability still more by reason of land tax, which is likely, soon to be imposed. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The London rates amount to about ios. in the £ 1 .",19
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am told that they amount to 6s. 8d. in the , £ i . At any rate, they are a serious item. Before we make a purchase of this sort we ought to know the full amount of the liability which we are incurring. And after all the expenditure that it is proposed to incur, have we a single function operative in London for which we need a building at all ? We have not one of any kind-no t a single Federal function operative in London requiring such a building. Of course we are hoping that in the future the Commonwealth will need a business office in London in order to transact a general agency business.",19
67,Mr HUME COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,What is Captain Collins doing?,19
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I venture to saythat that is a question which the Committee would like the honourable membet to address to the Acting Prime Minister. We should like very much to know what Captain Collins is doing. We know that the amount involved in the upkeep of his office is steadily and gradually increasing.,19
69,The CHAIRMAN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Order . The honourable member cannot enter into a general discussion on this item.,20
70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It has nothing to do with Captain Collins.,20
71,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Yes , it has.",20
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Nothin g to what with Captain Collins ? Acting Prime Minister say that the London office, as well as the ordinary agency business of the Commonwealth, has nothing to do with Captain Collins? take it that Captain Collins is undertaking certain functions in London, whatever they may be. Every one knows that .the Commonwealth requires very little financial and ordinary general business to be transacted in London just now, except perhaps in relation to the purchase of material ordered by the Federal Government; though what that material may be I do not know. am at a loss to know what Captain Collins is doing in London. I should like to be informed. He is supposedto be undertaking some complicated business for us, by means of which he is saving a great deal of money. But no one is able to tell us - exactly what those operations are. know that he is there, and we know that the cost of keeping him there is creeping up. In the Estimates for the current year the cost of the upkeep of the London office is from £ 4 , 0 0 0 to £ 6 ; o o o . forget the details, but.the expense is increasing. There is a large increase over last year's expenditure, it may be justifiable,"" but I do think that, in view of the tentative, or I might say secretive, methods employed in our London agency and functions, this Committee has a right to know definitely what is in the mind of the Government both in regard to the business to be transacted, and especially with regard to the financial obligations we are asked to incur in undertaking this fresh liability. Are we going to erect these buildings, costing £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £250,000-w e do not know-: Sir WftLiAM LYNE - Nonsens e !",20
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It is an easy thing to say "" nonsense;"" but when you - begin to add to the architectural beauties of a thoroughfare like the Strand by the erection of a building under conditions which must be approved by the architect of the London County Council, it is not nonsense to say that the expenditure will run into £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 or a Quarter of a million. Before the Acting Prime Minister interjects that my statement is nonsense, he ought to know a little bit more about the matter himself. That is not a proper way of disposing of criticism, and of criticism which is being made in all good faith, and with a desire only, to arrive at the best possible arrangement. We must begin this work in London sometime or other, but it is ""a rule that Does . the before you begin to house your functions you should begin 10 operate those functions, and to operate them effectively. In this matter it seems fo me that we are putting I the cart before the horse. We are taking steps to put up the building, and shall then begin to develop the functions which that building is supposed to house and accommodate. I should like to know to what extent we intend to operate our functions ""before we begin to do any such thing. We are told that the office is to accommodate the High Commissioner. Is a Bill proI viding for the High Commissioner likely to speedily become law ? I should like to know that. I know that the matter is associated in the Governor General's speech 'with the question of immigration. The High Commissioner is supposed to have something to do with immigration, and no doubt will We have something to do with it when he is set up in London to .do business for the Commonwealth. But just now we''have no High Commissioner, and we have no immigration policy. We are in the dark as to I all these matters. The least the Acting Prime Minister could do would be to tell us what is in the mind of the Government in reference to the High Commissionership and all kindred matters. A criticism was made by the right honourable member for Swan on Friday last with regard to'the inconvenience of the Strand site for purely financial reasons. _ The right honourable member told us that the site would be unsuitable for the purpose. May be it ' would, but from what I can learn about the site, it is not more than a mile from the Bank of England.' If that be so, it would not be unduly out of the way.",20
74,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It means a pennv 'bus fare.,20
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I do not think that any one who wished to inquire about inscribed stock, or to collect interest, would be debarred by a penny 'bus fare. If that .were the only criticism that could be made against the site, it would seem to me to be rather inadequate. I have not been in London, but from mv reading, and from the information which I have been able to obtain, I should say that the site is an admirable one for one of the purposes for which this building is to be erected, namely, to advertise the sources of Australia. I have with the site, but I complain of the indefiniteness of our information arrangement existing between the Acting Prime Minister, who is supposed to have bish. this matter in hand, and the London County Councii. Before we agree to this exActing penditure weought to know definitely temper. what the terms of. the contract are and what we are committing ourselves. So far we know nothing except that County Council will entertain an offer. Has an offer since been made ? offer has been made, then we are wholly in the dark. We might find after agreeing. - to this expenditure that the site was not . Sir WILLIAM LYNE obtainable. Mr Bruce SMiTH.^-The passing of this item will be an endorsement of the. ausame block? thority.",20
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"An indorsethe other end. ment of the action of the Acting Prime Minister in securing the option of ""this site. If we vote the sum of £ 1 , 0 0 0 , we shall give the Government authority to site, if no better terms can be secured, at the rental at which it has been offered, namely, 18s. per superficial foot. agree to this item, I should like to know what chance we shall have of obtaining the land at a lower rental. What shall we have of securing it at 13s. per foot ? - Mr Wilks - "" Buckley's."" Mr. JOSEPH COOK . ^ I should say so. The London County Council have certain sources of information open to them, and if we agree to vote this money it should be on the definite understanding that 'the Committee is authorizing the Acting Prime Minister to negotiate for the site, shall we say, on the same basis as that upon which Mr Bent has secured a block for Victoria, viz., 13s. per foot. may be that it was because of a want of the sense of responsibility on the part of Ministers that they were unable to make such a bargain as that made by Mr Bent. He did not wait to consult any one; he saw a bargain, and snapped it up. The Federal Ministers waited to consult the House, and the result is that the ""price has gone up to 18s. per foot.

86,Mr KNOX,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I think it is a better block,21
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It may or may If we not be better than the other corner block,, but surely it should be superior to the in tervening allotments. I should be glad tochance hear from the Acting Prime Minister a statement on all these points. They relateto ordinary matters of business that should be taken into account.",21
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I wished to speak, before the honourable member did, but he was so anxious to make an attack on thisproposal that I could not do so.",21
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I have not made any attack on the proposal; I have simply asked for information. I should bevery sorry if it were thought that I wasmaking an attack on the scheme. I have It endeavoured merely to put to the Acting-. Prime Minister some points which I invite' him, with the greatest possible respect, toanswer before we proceed to pass this item.",21
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.45] - I have listened to the honourable member's speech, a good deal of which was a'repetition of the remarks made by him a few evenings ago.",21
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Not at all . ',21
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I think it was.. It was a curious way of assisting the Government project. I brought the proposal before the House prior to making any de-finite move in regard to it. Had I made .a definite offer on behalf of the Government before consulting Parliament, what a .storm of indignation we should have had. Instead of doing what, in the circum-stances, I should have been justified in - doing, I took what seemed to me to be the proper course, and I think that the' - Government should be commended instead - of abused for their hesitation to acquire the land before consulting Parliament. The block owned by the London County Council is a large one, and with the consent of the House I should like to take the whole of the frontage to the Strand up to the point at which Aldwych-street leaves that thoroughfare, which is far more valuable ' than is the site acquired by Mr Bent.",21
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Who has abused the honourable member?,22
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I think I have had a little abuse from the honourable member.,22
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I simply asked for information.,22
96,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"After consulting the Prime Minister, I acquired the option of renting the land. That option expired on 20th July last. My intention was to bring the matter before Parliament in the earlier part of the session, with a view of securing the necessary authority to take the course desired by me. I do not know what exception can be taken to that attitude. I adopted it in preference to concluding any arrangement with the London County Council. Just before the original option expired, I cabled to the London County Council that I should be unable to bring the matter before Parliament prior to 20th July. A Committee of the London County Council deals with all these matters in the first instance, and, while it would not make ari offer, it extended the option for a further period of two months. That option will expire next Thursday. It remains, therefore, for the Commonwealth to make an offer. Had I done so before obtaining the authority of Parliament, I should have felt bound to honour it as an agreement made on behalf of the - Government of Australia, but I did not desire to take such a step until I had ascertained whether or not honourable members were agreeable to my proposal. I should like to know in what respect I am to blame. As the map in my hand shows, there are - three sites offered to us'. The Aldwych-street - corner is far more valuable than is that acquired by Mr Bent. It will be observed that the centre block does not meet that acquired on behalf of Victoria. I should like the site acquired by us to adjoin the Victorian block, because Mr Bent informed me, after he had' completed his negotiations, that he would be prepared to join with us. The land which,we take should extend right to the corner of Aldwych-street and the Strand, thus including the most valuable part, because it can never be obtained again at as low a price as that at which it is obtainable now. I can get nothing definite as to the price, but I have the assurance of the principal officer who deals with this matter that' he believes I shall get the whole for13s. a foot, including the end next to Aldwych-street.",22
97,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Would the honourable gentleman be satisfied with the authority of the Committee to conclude an agreement at 13s. ?,22
98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I do not think it would be fair to the Committee for me to state definitely that the land can be got at 13s. per foot. I do not desire to do anything without the concurrence of the Committee. If the London County Council asked for what I thought a much larger sum than was justified, I should not move in the matter without first obtaining the concurrence of the Committee.",22
99,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,What price do they put on the land?,22
100,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"For the site marked "" A , "" they put down 19s. a foot; for "" B , "" 18s. per foot; and for "" C, "" ! 15s. per foot. The most valuable of the three-sit e "" A "" - is the one which takes in the whole. The second one takes in the valuable part, but does not come up to the boundary of the part secured by Victoria; while the third site, marked at 15s. per foot; starts from the Victorian boundary and only goes a part of the way across to Aldwych-street.",22
101,Sir PHILIP FYSH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,They all face the ' Strand ?,22
102,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,All the land bas a frontage to the Strand. I obtained today-it is not easy to obtain these things - a copy of the agreement made by Victoria.,22
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Captai n Collins stated, on the 26th June, that the London County Council were prepared to receive an offer of 18s. a foot. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - The prices are marked on the plan.",22
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"That offer is dated the 21st June, so it was made before Captain Collins made his statement.",23
105,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I know, but what I have quoted is the value put down by the London County Council, because I have had two or three communications about the matter. The following are the terms of the agreement signed by Mr . Taver-ner, as Agent-General for the State of VictoriaA l l rents shall be payable quarterly on usual quartet days without any deduction - abatement, except the landlord's property tax. What that is, I do not quite know.",23
106,Mr GLYNN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It is 4s. in the £.1 on the unalterable rent. Si'r WILLIAM LYNE - T made inI quiries this morning, and understand that it is a fixed tax. The second portion the agreement isA l l rates, taxes, impositions, and outgoings whatsoever, except the landlord's property tax, payable by either landlord or tenant in respect of the said land or. the buildings thereon, shall, as between lessor and lessee, be paid by the lessee, but subject and without prejudice to the rights of the council under the stipulations inbefore contained. - Mr ATKINSON - Is anything said about the County Council paying the rates and taxes ?",23
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Accordin g to what I have just read, the lessee pays those.",23
108,Mr GLYNN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,That agreement is not an absolutely safe one.,23
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I do not know that. I know that-the honourable member is very keen on these points. I obtained a loan of this document only this morning from Mr Bent's office, with a view to inform myself upon this very point, because it is very difficult to ascertain such particulars at this end of the world. My intention was to read the agreement to the Committee. With regard to the price for a building, I hold in my hand an estimate by Colonel Owen. I found out what Mr. Bent had agreed to pay for his share of the building. I do not know whether he wants it to be known, but at any rate, on the same proportion, the cost of the whole of the building which we would put up would be £60,000-that is, along the whole frontage of 190 odd feet.",23
110,Mr HEDGES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"A building with 200 feet frontage for £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 must be a gimcrack affair.",23
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"What is the use of the honourable member saying that? An agreement for a building on the same terms, has lately been entered into by Mr Bent. The honourable member for Fremantle seems to think that he knows everything. The actual fact is that Mr Bent has entered' into an agreement for the construction of a building with a 25 feet frontage, which would be part and parcel of this building, for a sum of money that, on the same proportion; would mean £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 for a building carried along the whole frontage. The the part built by Victoria will form one end ofor the whole building. I mention what Mr.. Bent has done, because I am. very anxiousto give the Committee as reliable an authority as possible as to the cost of the building if it were all put up at once. What have stated is the estimated cost of the building if put up in the same way as Mr. of Bent has agreed to put up his share.",23
112,Mr LIDDELL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,As Mr Bent put up theCentral Railway Station?,23
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I do not think Mr Bent is a man who would put up ;r trumpery building in such a position, nor here- do I think Victoria would agree to such a proposal.",23
114,Mr KING OMALLEY,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Mr Bent is oneof the best business men in Australia.,23
115,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It is all very well'for the honourable member for Hunter to attempt to detract from Mr Bent's business capacity, but I am taking what Mr. Bent has done as the best information I"" can give the Committee. It is only a matter of speculation as to what the building will actually cost, because if"" marble, for example, were used it would cost a great deal mor.e. - Mr KING O'MALLEY - It should bebuilt of steel and concrete.",23
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,At any rate. I have given the Committee some indication' of what the complete building is likely tocost.,23
117,Mr KING OMALLEY,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Can it be built twelve storieshigh ?,23
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"No ; the pro-, posal is for six stories. The reason why I speak about erecting the complete building is that if we take the land to the corner pf Aldwych-street we shall obtain absolutely the cream of the site. The other end, although it is good, is not as good from thepoint of view of traffic as the end where, going along the Strand towards the city, one meets Aldwych-street. I believe that is the best site on the Strand.",23
119,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Are we bound in any way to f all in with Mr Bent's scheme?,24
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"We are not bound at all. What Mr Bent said was, "" If you take any other portion f c r the Commonwealth, I ' will f all in with you."" That is all that has been agreed to.",24
121,Mr ATKINSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Would Mr Bent take one end of it?,24
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,He has taken it.,24
123,Mr ATKINSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Would he agree to take it only if we put up a uniform building? Sir' WILLIAM LYNE - It would be looking a great deal too far ahead to attempt to make detailed arrangements before we have made up our minds to lease the land. What I want the Committee to agree to is that I shall open up negotiations. I have no authority to enter into negotiations of a permanent character unless I obtain the authority of Parliament.,24
124,Mr ATKINSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We want to know whether the honourable gentleman is going to negotiate for the whole block or only for a part.,24
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I wish to ascertain whether the Committee is with me in my desire to take, the whole frontage of 190 odd feet, including the frontage taken by Mr Bent, by a depth of 65 feet.",24
126,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The question is whether the Committee is with the honourable gentleman in granting the money for the purpose.,24
127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I am quite sure the Committee is.,24
128,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We shall find that out very shortly.,24
129,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"We shall find it out. I hope that there will not be too much debate before the matter is settled. Of course it is nothing to me personally, but I wish to see Australia properly represented in London. I was never more disgusted at anything than at seeing, when I went to London, little pigeon holes for the Agents-General all over the city, and no place to fitly represent Australia. little cribs of the present Agents-General are a disgrace to Australia, i found only two pf them while I was there, although I looked for the others.",24
130,Mr THOMAS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Captai n Collins makes up for all that.,24
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I gave the Committee information as to what Captain Collins had clone in London when I was asked to do so the other day by the deputy leader of the Opposition. that that officer had done one good thing since he went to London, in that he had secured for the Commonwealth interest upon money which was previously returning no interest. Prior to his present appointment our money was deposited in a number of banks and was earning no interest whatever. His instructions were to "" lump "" the whole of it , so that it might b'e made to earn interest. He has done so, and his efforts in that direction represent a considerable - gain to the Commonwealth.",24
132,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Do we want an officer in London simply to do that?,24
133,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,There are many other duties which Captain Collins has to discharge. Almost invariably he has to attend the Colonial Office two or three times weekly on behalf of the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Franklin cannot have the faintest conception of the amount of correspondence which passes between the Prime Minister and the Colonial Office.,24
134,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,What has Captain Collins to do?,24
135,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,If the honourable member would exercise a little common sense he would know that that officer has a great deal to do.,24
136,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,T e l l us what business lie has to transact.,24
137,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"A great number of communications are exchanged between the Prime Minister's Department and Captain Collins on a variety of subjects. That officer has been appointed to his present position only temporarily, but as far as I can judge he has done his work very well-sometime s under circumstances of great difficulty.",24
138,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I merely wish tc know what he has to do.,24
139,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The Government would not grant him an increase of salary, and I think that they acted quite properly. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I saw a stateThe ment to that effect in the newspapers, which evidently know more about this matter than I do. I scarcely know whether there is any other point to which honourable members desire me to refer in connection with this matter. Ten thousand superficial feet - the area first spoken of for the building-lease d at 13s. per foot, would amount to £ 6 , 5 0 0 . Of course there is no necessity to erect the whole of the building immediately if honI then showed orable members do not desire to'vote the money necessary for the purpose.",24
140,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"What will the London County Council say to a proposal to erect only a ""shell"" ?",25
141,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The London County Council allows us five years before it exacts the full amount of-the rent. , It will charge us no rental during the first twelve months, only a quarter of the full amount during the second year, one-half during the third year, three-quarters during the fourth year, and the full amount at the end of five years,",25
142,Mr THOMAS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Is the proposed building to be erected in accordance' with the idea outlined by the honourable member for Darwin some time ago?,25
143,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I do not know. The idea of the Government is that there shall be one central building to represent Australia in the most prominent part of London. It will be-if nothing else- a very great advertisement for this country. Visitors from the Commonwealth will know exactly where to go to find our offices in London, instead of being obliged to travel all round the city, as they are at present, in an effort to locate the offices of the various States.",25
144,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,What are the Canadian offices like?,25
145,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Canada , I understand, has secured the adjoining block, and I have here a plan of the building which it proposesto erect- a plan which was only received by the last mail. That building, I imagine, will cost more than £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",25
146,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It will cost more than £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",25
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,What sort of offices has Canada now ?,25
148,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It s present offices are situated in Victoria-street, Trafalgar Square. These it proposes tain, besides erecting a new building",25
149,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Probably Canada conthe templates taking a lease of London.,25
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"At any rate, don the Canadians advertise their country well,_ and we should copy their example. It no wonder that we cannot attract immithat grants from the mother country, when they cannot see any evidence of the rethat sources of Australia in London. But infor tending immigrants to Canada can be suping plied in London with full particulars as to Canadian resources. If for no other reason, we should have a respectable buildground ing in London in order that prospective immigrantsmay realise the sort of place that Australia is. I do not know whether honourable members desire any further information in respect to the proposed site. I am very desirous of securing authority to negotiate with the London County Council to secure this block upon the lowest terms possible. When the Prime Minister and myself visited London, the Council were asking £ 1 per foot for the whole of this block. I suppose they have found that they cannot obtain, that price, and accordingly it has been reduced to the 13s. per foot, which one block has already realized.",25
151,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If we wait a little longer, we shall probably secure the site for a less amount.",25
152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"There is no chance of doing so. The London County Council are very anxious that Australia should obtain this block. I have no doubt that when its members know that I have the support of Parliament, we shall secure it upon the best possible terms.. I fully anticipate we shall not be called upon to pay for it more than the 13s. 6£d. per foot which Mr Bent has paid.",25
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"What is the opinion of the Government with regard to the appointment of a High Commissioner to occupy the offices ? _ Sir WILLIAM LYNE - It is the intention of the Government to make these offices the home of the High Commissioner.. Plans are being prepared which, provide that one floor shall practically be the home of that officer. I hope that he will be appointed before very long.' There is a great necessity for his appointment, and it will not be the fault of the Government if the High Commissioner is not appointed before the present year has expired.",25
154,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Hav e the Governto rement made any selection yet? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - No . But in interests of the Commonwealth, there should be an energetic Australian in Lonfor the purpose of rebutting the extraordinary statements which are improperly is made concerning this country. I am glad the honourable member for Parramatta has asked me the question, because I think we can make these offices a good home the High Commissioner, whilst providsufficient room to enable the States to have their representatives located in the same building. I further desire that the floor shall be so built as to permit of a continuous exhibition of Australian produce in this great thoroughfare.",25
155,Mr KING OMALLEY,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Is it intended establish wine cellars in the basement the building?,26
156,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I cannot too arrangements, strongly impress upon honourable members the desirableness of maintaining an alextent most continuous exhibition of Australian products in this great thoroughfare, along which such an enormous traffic passes. as is .Canada. I should like to see a building erected which would permit of a display being made of the products of the six States the Commonwealth, either separately or combination.",26
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Does the Acting Prime Minister think that result can brought about without the co-operation of the States?,26
158,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I 'certainly hope to secure their co-operation. Bent has made a beginning, and I have to thank him very much for entering into arrangement the moment that I mentioned it to him. If it is advisable that Victoria 2,000,000 to, I think, 5,750,000. should secure offices in this particular it is certainly in the interests of the other States that they should example. 1 do not think that the people will allow their respective State. Gothat vernments to hold aloof very long. in London. They, of course, will save the expense of their offices in other parts of the city. We hope to debit them with a share tention of the cost of our building, that will be a matter for arrangement. I am satisfied that the Government is doing the right thing in taking the propose opinion of honourable members before I ing. send a cablegram to the London County Council- I shall be doing so within two or three days from the passing of the item - to ascertain the lowest possible value which we can hope to get this, property.",26
159,Mr GLYNN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Angas) [4. n ] - I agree with the Treasurer that this question ought to be settled quickly because I learn from his' statement that the time within which he must make an offer will expire on 26th inst. I almost regret that he under the necessity of making so many planations to the Committee, because not well to have the private negotiations which are associated with the name of Mr seems to be the case. Burr mentioned publicly so that they can come to the ears of the London County Council. We ought to close with the offer, because it is the best site which we can sibly expect to obtain. It is fa suitable for our purpose than would be site in the centre of the financial world to London-that is about the Bank of Engof land. What we want is a site which will not only be suitable for ordinary business such as, for instance, the inscription of stockj but also serve to some to advertise the existence and the prospects of the Commonwealth. In this matter, we are as much entitled to "" blow '""' It is true that Canada is having a bit of a boom at the present tune, but I do not know that its capacity for of ultimate development is any greater than in is ours. This morning, when I was travelling in the train, I was reading some extracts from old files of the Times. One be was an account of a boxing match conducted in the spirit which is sometimes displayed nowadays, while the other discussed the relative position of Canada and Mr Australia. During the intervening period, while the population of. Australia has in this creased from 100,000 to over 4,000,000, the population of Canada has jumped from About spot, five years ago, there were no less than 1,200,000 native born Canadians resident follow her in the United States.",26
160,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Canad a did not get increase by reason of her fine building,26
161,Mr GLYNN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I do not suggest that. A fine building is a means of drawing atto our jpotentialities which, on a but close comparison, are quite as encouraging as are those of Canada.",26
162,Mr KING OMALLEY,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The Canadians to spend £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 on their build",26
163,Mr GLYNN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"About twelve months ago, the Canadians were - spending 15s. a head, or £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year in importing imat migrants, and I understand that they have increased the amount. Besides the Canadian Pacific Railway is largelv subsidizing immigration. Were it not for"" that tremendous stimulus given by advertising, a certain amount of national "" blow,"" and the the annual public expenditure which is being was increased, and subsidized by the Canadian exPacific Rail wav Company, I doubt whether it is Canada would figure at Home so prominently in comparison with Australia as Having spent a few years in London, I know that the site under offer to the Commonwealth is a. very good one. It is not for us to do more posthan to authorize the Minister to make an r more offer. The limits of that offer are fairly a prescribed by the figure at which he can of obtain the best site-which , I think, ought to be obtained-and the amount which he is prepared to offer-w e do riot want to put a limit, but an approximation. to a limit is given by the figures, namely, 19s. for the best site, and 13s. which Mr . Burr says it may be obtained for. The Minister has quoted certain conditions, but I do not know yet whether he was reading from a draft or an actual lease.",26
164,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It is an agreement for a lease. - Mr Glynn - Las t week, by interjecthe tion, I urged the honourable gentleman be careful about the land tax. The land tax referred to in the document is a perty tax of 4s. in the posed ini 1689 on English profit rent, not on land. It is called a land tax, but really a tax on the rent capacity of land'' and the profit-producing capacity something besides land.",27
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,As existing then?,27
166,Mr GLYNN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Yes . Through the influence of the landlords the proceeds tax of 4s. in the £ , remains constant, because, as they controlled Parliament, they prevented any increase in the valuation. ""The so-called English land tax is-ther e being, no re-valuation- a fixed charge, instead of being a true land tax. Wherever they did get the opportunity this class interfered with the land tax; they did in India by making it a fixed charge. In England it is only 4s. in the £ , on the rental value, which was estimated about 200 years ago. As a matter of substance, I think the Minister will find that it is a very small tax. As a matter of law, it may not toe a land tax such as is likely to be imposed within a comparatively short period, I believe, in England: therefore, we ought to stipulate that we may deduct, not only the property tax, but also any land tax which may hereobtain after be imposed in addition to or substituerection tion for the property tax.",27
167,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I understand that the agreement with the Victorian Government provides that no land tax-that is, outside the property tax-is to be paid by the appointed. lessee.",27
168,Mr GLYNN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I think that the effect the agreement is that any land tax will have to be paid by the Victorian Governand ment. It says that the rent is to be clear of all rates, taxes and other outgoings cept that particular property tax. The result will be that if a land tax is imsistible posed, and probably it will be imposed in substitution for the existing property tax, it may not be capable of feeing depoint ducted from the rent which the Commonwealth will have to pay under the lease. If the lease is for a term of ninety-nine years, this is an important matter. On this point, I may refer to what is done in the Commonwealth. In South Australia, when they passed a land tax in 1884, it was provided that not only the owner of the feesimple was to paiy the tax, but that the tax was to have an incidence upon any holder of a freehold or any lessee in existence at time who was not exempt by contract, to and whose term had an unexpired run of seven years from the date of the Act. Our prolease would be within that category, bewhich was imcause if a land tax is imposed at any time within the next fifty or sixty years, is we shall have an unexpired term of long the duration which may be made liable to of land tax. In England, they are beginning to nibble at the question of direct taxation of land. In March, 1906, the House of Commons passed a Bill imposing an unimproved land tax in Scotland. I do not know whether the Bill became law, but I remember that it was passed by the House of Commons by the very great majority of 258 votes. That indicates how things are trending in the old country. I wish to keep within the Minister's suggestion to be curt, because I consider that, as he has only two days in which to make an offer, the sooner we dispose of this question the better. What I chiefly rose for was to direct his attention to the necessity of making a condition in his offer which will exempt the lessee from paying any land tax which may hereafter be imposed in substitution for, or in addition to, the existing property tax.",27
169,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"South Sydney) [4.20] While it seems to me the proper policy to a central site' in London for the of Commonwealth offices, the procedure now proposed is like that involved in putting the cart before the horse. The first thing to be done is to determine whether a High Commissioner should be Personally, I think that we have allowed too long a period to go by of without passing an Act providing for the establishment of a High Commissionership, appointing some one to fill the position. If we had a. High Commissioner, the proexblem would be much simplified, because when such an 'officer is appointed an irreagitation will arise for the withdrawal of the Agents-General. Probably the States will find it advantageous to apqommercial agents to look after their interests in London, but the maintaining of separate Agents-General, each with the elaborate staff and appointments of a plenipotentiary, will be so ridiculous that the constituencies of the States Parliament will insist upon the abolition of these offices or the reduction of their status.. The concentration in the Department of the High Commissoner of the work now beng done by the Agents-General would make it comparatively easy to arrange for the accommodation of the necessary staff in one building, but I think that the appointment of a High Commissioner should precede the acquisition of a site in London for Commonwealth offices.. At the same time, I admit that it may be a good thing to enter into the contract now proposed.",27
170,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The honourable member thinks that we should first catch our bird and then get a cage for it?,28
171,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Yes . . If a good man is appointed High Commissioner, his opinion on the suitability of the sites available to us will be of value. I was under the impression, when this matter was first spoken of, that the Government had a definite offer as to rental, but I find now that the price of the land varies from 13s. to 19s.",28
172,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,A very dangerous margin for middlemen to play with.,28
173,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It is a very wide difference. The question arises, what is Captain Collins doing in London? He is paid handsome expenses and a fair salary for looking after Commonwealth interests there, and he should either do so, and retire from the head of the Defence Department, or return to his original position. I should like to know why he did not go direct to Mr Burr?",28
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Mr Burr is the representative of the London County Council.,28
175,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Accordin g to the-paper which has been laid before us, Captain Collins, oh the 26th ult., ""repeated a suggestion already made by him that negotiations be conducted through Mr Burr.""",28
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If Mr Burr is an officer of the London County Council, how comes he to be in a position to negotiate on behalf of the Commonwealth?",28
177,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If Captain Collins knows Mr Burr to be an officer of the London County Council, he should, as a business man, go straight to him, and say, "" What are the lowest terms on which you will arrange a lease of this land with the Commonwealth ?""",28
178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"He could not do that. These matters are dealt with by a board, or a sub-committee, of the London County Council, which meets only every two or three months.",28
179,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If Mr Burr is the official to be gone to, why has not Captain Collins gone to him? If he is some one who is to get a commission out of the transaction, the affair has a somewhat fishy smell. Captain Collins should be able to go direct to a body like the London County Council to ask what its lowest terms are.",28
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"- It will not state them, except through this officer.",28
181,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am surprised that such an important body will not say definitely what its terms are. If it refuses to do so, and deals with matters of this kind as a hucksterer would, I cannot understand those whom it represents tolerating its actions. Such a body is on. a different footing from that occupied by any set of private individuals, and it should be easy to ascertain definitely from it what are its lowest terms for land which it wishes to lease.",28
182,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It seems preposterous that the London County Council should be unwilling to deal directly with a representative of the Commonwealth.,28
183,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I think it almost cer1 tain that, if approached, it would deal directly with us. The sub-committee to which the Minister refers must have sufficient business knowledge to be aware that, in dealing with the direct representative of Australia, commission can be saved to one, if not to both, parties. I do not think that there is much doubt as to the wisdom' 01 arranging for the erection of Commonwealth offices in London, assuming that Ave can obtain land for a reasonable rental, because the increase of values there is so great that, within a few years, we shall have made a very good bargain.",28

I think that the monwealth should have a block of buildtain ings in London, and that the securing of site for such buildings will, in the prove economical; but before entering into an agreement we should know definitely what rent is to be paid, and, in my opinion, it would be preferable to appoint a Commissioner before taking further steps in the matter.",29
191,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Dalley) [4.30] - All the information we have on this subject so f a is contained in two disconnected statements made by the Acting Prime Minister, and i the memorandum circulated today, which', if it shows anything at all, shows the inepbut titude of Captain Collins. The representaI tive of the Commonwealth Government in London, as th© honourable member for South Sydney has pointed out, is unable to conwho duct negotiations with the London County Council, and refers to Mr Burr, who is architect, and who it is said obtained very good terms for Mr Bent. This is the formation on which I am asked to vote this money. I ask whether we have yet heard anything which would warrant our voting £ 1 , 0 0 0 , to - say nothing of the much larger sum to which we are asked by this vote to commit ourselves. The Acting Prime Minister has spoken scheme once or twice as if it were a compliment to honourable members that he should six-story bring this matter before the House. We space of 60,000 superficial feet. know that he could do nothing else. He has said that instead of closing with offer when he was in London he waited exhibition ? until he could meet Parliament, and has thus endeavoured to make us believe that it has been out of compliment to the that he has submitted the matter for approval. There was no other course open to the honourable gentleman. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that let. we should do this thing well or leave alone. To do it well will involve expenditure of a large sum of money, and we know the difficulty under bour in raising money for expenditure on public works.

Cerhonorable members are apparently una der the impression that we can attract the end, attention of the people of Great Britain, only by the erection of an imposing structure in London. I differ from that view, and I trust that we can' suggest somethingHigh more original. From what I have read Americans travelling in Great Britain and on the Continent of Europe advertise their presence by ostentation, but the people of Great Britain are not, I think, to be atr tracted to Australia by any ostentatious display. I do not think that Australia would n gain very much by the erection of an i m posing Commonwealth building in London, In any case I would ask why this rush > do not say that the site proposed is not the most suitable site that could be obtained in London, because I understand that all are acquainted with it are agreed that it is the most suitable site for the purpose,, an but I say that we are not yet prepared* to deal with the matter.

200,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Then let it go.,30

202,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"We are to vote £1,000 to secure a particular site, because other like it can be obtained in London. Are we to understand that this is possible site for the purpose which we could obtain in the next twenty years?",30
203,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,This is the best site now available.,30
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The best site London has remained vacant for seven years. That does not say much for it.,30
205,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"That is so. There are ment. very keen business people in London, if this be such a good site, why has remained vacant for so long? I can derstand that the Acting Prime Minister has been impressed by the fact that the Premier of Victoria, who has the reputa- £1,000,000. tion of a keen business man, has got early, and secured for his State 25 feet , at this spot. That honourable gentleman knows what he intends to do. His views on the - subject are defined, his General is informed, and he does not sire to wait until the Commonwealth erects a building. I am prepared to believe . Mr Bent has made a very but the Acting Prime Minister says that because Mr Bent has dropped upon site the Government should I see that he in this says in his memorandumI t is expected that the Government of Victoria will agree to throw in the lot they have taken any land leased by the Government, and agree to rent part of the Commonwealth buildwhen erected. (Mr Bent informed me he of I suppose the authorities of the other not States are to be asked subsequently whethey will do what is expected of them. that To agree to this vote may not be the same as "" buying a pig in a poke,"" but the in Committee is certainly being asked to commit'itself to a very large expenditure without sufficient information. I should like city to say that I think £60,000 would not be the sufficient to erect a building which in the Australia would be regarded as imposing. matThe proposal is that on land with a frontalage of nearly 200 feet, and a depth of 75 feet, a structure six stories high is to is no be erected at a cost of £60,000.",30
206,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,And one which is to add to the architectural beauty of London:,30
207,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Exactly . I ask honourable members to consider' what kind of a building could be erected for £60,000 on a 200-feet frontage in any city of Australia. I should say that there is hardly one of the principal city offices of our no banks that has not cost more than that.",30
208,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,And none of them the only cover a. frontage of 200 feet.,30
209,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Ye t no one would say that they are such imposing structures as to attract attention for all time to the great potentialities of Australia. £60,000 in spent without any return would be a waste of money, whilst £250,000 spent with a good return would be a profitable investI am not afraid of the expendiand 'ture, but I am afraid of the provision it which would have to be made for such an unexpenditure as I anticipate, because, in order to raise £250,000, we should have to tax the people of Australia to the extent of Is the Acting Prime Minisin ter prepared to impose taxation to that amount within the next two years ?

211,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Simpl y because the Acting Prime Minister does not appear to know how the money is to be raised. want the Government to show their bona fides by appointing a High Commissioner, and, what is more, letting us understand what the High Commissioner's duties are to be. We have not as yet taken over the debts of the States; and I have had the idea-it may be a foolish dream-that the work of the High Commissioner would be that of a financier in this connection, and that, by his knowledge and ability in carrying out a conversion scheme, he might save Australia a large sum. I never expected the High Commissioner to be simply a wellhoused social pivot, but, rather, that, in addition to maintaining the dignity of his position, he would attend to such work as I have indicated. The Acting Prime Minister has said that the High Commissioner ought to be housed in the city of London. But if the Australian High Commissioner is to be on an equality with the Earl of Strathcona., will he be expected to reside permanently in the centre of a large city ? In other words, have the Commonwealth offices to be residential quarters as well as a place of business for the Commonwealth ?",31
212,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We do not know.,31
213,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"E x a c t l y ; and even Captain Collins, who receives a large salary, and only three weeks ago asked that it might be increased by three guineas a day, does not seem to have any information on the point. According to the memorandum now before us, that gentleman is not even able to negotiate' with the London County Council, but refers us to Mr Burr, the architect, who is said to have done very well for the Victorian' Government. Even the most supporter of the proposal to erect Commonwealth buildings in London would hesitate to vote the expenditure until we have been supplied with more particulars. We have been told by Captain Collins that the proposed building will be six stories h'igh, but we have not been told how the Australian exhibits are to be disposed there. I again emphasize the point that a building with the frontage suggested will require the expenditure of a larger sum than £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 . and, under all the circumstances, I suggest that the item be withdrawn. This would not necessarily mean an abandonment of the project of a London office; and I trust that, when premises are provided, they will be worthy of Australia. I cannot believe that an I expenditure of £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 would provide a building of dimensions calculated to be an advertisement for Australia. I am with those who are willing, if necessary, to expend £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 in order to make manifest to the British people the merits of this country.  is willing to impose taxation to the extent of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ?",31

As a matter of fact, the Acting Prime Minister was compelled to bring question before Parliament; and I refuse to be under any obligation to him or other Minister for the submission ot item. I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he really thinks Captain Collins has given him sufficient information ? the Acting Prime Minister honestly believe that Captain Collins is properly fulfillin the office of the representative of Austrawide. lia? The fact that Captain Collins shelters himself behind Mr Burr shows that he has not been doing the work the Commonwealth.

225,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"West Sydney) [4.50] I am not inclined to support the proposal It appears to me that no reasons have been put forward why we shoujd erect the projected buildings, Minand I certainly see no reason why they I say should be erected on the site mentioned. I have heard a great deal said by people who do not know London as to this being a very eligible site. But for my own part I ' Let us am inclined to think that it is not suitable at all. I lived in London for the best part It is not of twenty years, and know it very well. I have just had an opportunity of refreshI ing my memory; and I say that those people who imagine that, because the site is in the f he Strand and because the Strand is one of he the main arteries of traffic in London, site it is a good site, seem to have forgotten that a stream of traffic in the Strand is like other streams-it has its the ebb and its flow. The site is in a backwater of the Strand. In times gone by it any used to be one of the old thoroughfares this leading to Holborn through Holywellstreet. _ It never was a good business place, and it is no better now than, it was in davs Does gone by, except that whereas formerly ""it was crowded with old houses, and'the g thoroughfare was narrow, it is now very But I venture to say that if anv' man walked along the Strand he would notice that for every twenty people who of walk on the Somerset House side-the was right-hand side going to the city-onl y one walks on the other. You. may erect whatkind of building you like.' but you cannot pull a stream of people from one side the of the street to the other. It is impossible.",32
226,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,May that not be because be selected this land is vacant ?,32
227,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,There is very little to posattract people to that side of the Strand. Mr Bruce.SMITH - On e side is all shops and the other is not.,32
228,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Yes ; but in the vicinity - of this particular site, there are none. I .remember the site thirty years ago, when I was a boy, and I saw it again the other day. It has been made more commodious, but the characteristics of the thoroughfare .are still the same. People mostly go on one .side of the road. Let me illustrate what I mean by mentioning a street that we all know-Bourke-street . Suppose that it is proposed to erect a building there, and a person interested tells people in London "" We are going to put up a fine place in Bourke-street, Melbourne."" The man in London has heard of Bourke-street perhaps, but knows no more about it. But a man in Melbourne would inquire, "" What part of Bourke-street, and on which side of the street"" ?- I do not deny that the site in - question is a very convenient place from the point of view of being accessible from anywhere in London. You can get to it as quickly as to any place. But at the same time you cannot get people to go there. If it is proposed to take this site with a view of attracting immigrants, all I have to say is that country people do not go there and - are not likely to go.",33
229,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"We do not want to 4jet our immigrants from London, anyhow.",33
230,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"There is an unfailing stream of country people going to London, .many of whom would be suitable for immigrants. But they do not and would .not go near, the site.",33
231,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Does the honourable member think that to erect a building is the best way to attract immigrants ?,33
232,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"No, I do not. A theatre has been built in this locality now, and they are also building a hotel, the Waldorfia, which is to be the best hotel in England. But if you build a hotel theatre in such a. place it may be many years before you will get people into the habit - of coming to it. Or you have to put twice .as much money into your building as vou would otherwise do in order to get over the unattractiveness of the site. The honourable gentleman in charge of this measure - says that the site is cheap. As to that, I - say this: The London County Council pulled down a couple of miles of streets in - order to construct the Kingsway through to 'Holborn. They cut this crescent which they called Aldwych-street. But they have never been able to let much 'it. There is the theatre to which I have - referred, and also the big hotel, and the Morning Post office round the corner. But beyond that, they have done nothing at all. Now, does any one suppose that the people of London are such fools that they would not snap at it if it were such a. magnificent spot for business? Here is an opportunity of a lifetime to get land at 13s. a foot. Yet the business people of London will not take it. Why not ? There is always a good reason for such conduct. The reason is obvious in this case. It is not an eligible site. It is a convenient one- I do not deny that-bu t it is not eligible. My honourable friend the Acting Prime Minister says that the London County Council wants the Commonwealth to come there. On the face of it, that is an unbusiness-like statement. The London County Council wants people to take up its land at a suitable rent, and does not care two straws who they are. I expect the Council wants us to go there because no one else will take the property. That is the orily reason I can think of. My honourable friend also says that he found that the offices of the various States were scattered all over London, and that it was difficult for him to find one. Well, as a matter of fact most of them are in one street, and they are to be found readily enough. It would, however, be a very good thing if the offices of all the States were in one building. But if we wish to advertise Australia, andare prepared to spend £10,000 a year, I venture to say that we can do it in a far better way than by buying this site. £10,000 spent in advertising Australia through the press would do fa* more than putting £10,000 into the coffers of the London County Council, and ' would be _ a much better investment. What we want to do is to induce suitable immigrants to come to or a Australia. We do not want to establish a place to which Australians could go when they are in London. We are not going to P y ^ro,ooo a year to provide a place to a which visitors can go. If we want to attract immigrants, they are not to be found in London. They can be brought to London, no doubt, but the people in London are not the people we want at all. We want people who are suitable for going on the land, and we also desire that this country shall be extensively advertised.",33
233,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,In a somewhat more novel of way than by putting up a building.,33
234,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I do not know a better way of advertising Australiathan through the press. It is the method that Canada has adopted, and which business men adopt.",33
235,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We can also do it by means of lectures.,34
236,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"There is no medium so good as the press. The press of Great Britain naturally booms Canada, because it has been paid to boom, that country, and paid very well. It has been said- I think by the honourable member for South Sydney-that the land in question will probably be worth more in times to come. I do not think that it will be worth any more. I do not think the land will be worth any more in ten years' time, for instance, than it is worth now. I do not believe that the process of concentration can go on interminably, except, perhaps, upwards. Higher buildings may be erected, but, so sure as that is done, so sure will power be given to tax ground values. Nothing is surer than that. It is highly probable that within the next five years power will be given to municipal councils to tax ground values. Therefore, the land will not be worth any more to the holder than it is today.",34
237,Mr JOHNSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Does the honourable member think that the land isworth as much as the London County Council is asking fpr it?,34
238,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I know nothing on that point. I take it that the value of a thing is determined by what it will fetch. This land will not realise what we are asked for it, otherwise it would have been leased long ago.",34
239,Mr JOHNSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Has it not been .vacant for the last seven vears ?,34
240,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I think that fully seven years have elapsed since the resumption scheme was entered upon, and' the improvements were sufficiently advanced three or four years ago to make it available as a site for a building. It is notorious, however, that the property hangs fire. I wish to make my position clear. I do not deny - that the site is a convenient one, but I hold that the rental is not a low one, and that there is no reason to hasten to a settlement. The honourable member for Dalley has referred to the suggestion that something like £60,000 will be sufficient to erect a suitable structure. I do not know whether honourable members have seen a sketch plan of the proposed Canadian offices in London, which has been published, but I'should, like to point out that that' building will be on the Trafalgar Square side of the proposed site. It is nearer Trafalgar Square, and immediately opposite St. Mary's in the Strand. That is the better site, since the Strand at that point is narrower. It has always beenpart of the Strand proper. _ To put such a building in competition with a Commonwealth office costing £60,000, would benot to advertise, but to 'disgrace Australia. "" Comparisons,"" as Mrs Malaprop says,. "" are odorous."" On the one hand we should have a building costing something like£500,000, and on the other one costing. £60,000. Such a comparison would simply be an advertisement of our parsimony or poverty.",34
241,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It is proposed to expend something like £300,000 on the Canadian offices in London.",34
242,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Judgin g by the sketchplan it would cost fully that sum. It appears to me that if we desire to advertiseAustralia, and intend to secure in London a site for that purpose, we should obtainone in the very heart of the Strand, nearTrafalgar Square. More people would, notice the building if it were erected in that part of the Strand in half-an-hour than would notice it in half-a-day if erected' in the place proposed. That is not an exaggerated statement. If we desire to attract immigrants we cannot do better thanadvertise in the press. We have something, that is worthy of attention to offer.",34
243,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,And we might employ lecturers.,34
244,Mr HUGHES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Undoubtedly . All that we need to do is to notify the world' of our resources, and we cannot do that by.the erection of a building in the back waters of the Strand. The Treasurer hasno knowledge of these matters, and apparently Captain Collins has none. There is no necessity to hesitate between the conflict of opinion. Certain facts speak trumpet-tongued. One is that the LondonCounty Council has not been able to leasethis land at the price at which it has beenoffered to us. There are in London thousands of business men who will not have it at that price, and any one who knows London is aware that for business purposesthe side of the Strand on which this siteabuts is not one-tenth as valuable as the other. In the circumstances, I shall voteagainst the item.",34
245,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Parkes) [5.4] I approve of the proposal that we should* secure a site, for the offices of the High? Commissioner whom we propose to send to London, and I quite agree that it should be in a prominent business part of the city. But I think that this proposal, beyond being somewhat insidious, is one of the most unbusinesslike that Ave have ever had before us. I would ask honourable members to note the form in which it has been submitted. .It is proposed to vote not as a deposit upon the lease of the land, but towards the construction of "" a building."" By agreeing to the item, we shall practically authorize, not only a start being made with the erection of a suitable building, but the leasing of the area of land which the Acting Minister has suggested we should acquire. I hope that the Committee will not be beguiled into voting for this item, because of the smallness of the amount, since rhe mere £i,ooo that we are asked to pass, is no criterion of what would be the effect of an affirmative vote. It will mean, in the first instance, the authorization of the leasing of 200 feet in an important part of London, at an annual rental of at least £7,500. We shall enter into that obligation for ninety-nine years. This annual obligation, if capitalized, would represent £250,000. We shall also authorize the Government, because of the form in which the matter has been brought before us, to anter into a contract for a building of the kind suggested, in such quent terms, by the Acting Prime ister as likely to be creditable to Australia. What does that mean? told by the honourable gentleman to-daly that this building will cost £60,000. yesterday's issue of one of the Melbourne daily newspapers appeared a calculation made by a Commonwealth officer--and I take it that the officer in question is Colonel Owen - that the building £150,000. Then we are told that the plans published yesterday in the press are that of a building that would _£2oo,ooo to construct. I appeal to those who saw that reproduction to say whether it is not a building of the plainest possible character. In these circumstances, we shall, by affirming this vote, have in prospect an annual expenditure eaual to a capitalized sum of £250,000-since shall undertake an obligation £7.500 per annum for ninety-nine vears '-and an actual capital expenditure the building of either £60,000, or £200,000. The Acting Prime Minister does not seem to be able to tell the Mr Bruce Smith. Committee definitely whether the building to be erected will cost ,£60,000 or ,£200,000. One naturally asks, first of all, why we should incur this total expenditure of nearly half-a-million ? I take no exception to our having in London a representative of Australia. It is notable, however, that we have managed, for £i,ooo, seven years, to do without a High Commissioner without suffering any great inconvenience. We have found it necessary so far only to send to London an officialreceiving a few hundreds a year to do what work was necessary for the Commonwealth. But even admitting that it is necesPrime sary to have a High Commissioner in Lpndon, the Committee ought to ask itself what is the expenditure required to afford a suitable business habitation., for him. The Acting Prime Minister has talked today as if it were possible 1 tc combine in the one building a residence for the High Commissioner, an exhibition of the products of Australia, and a business office, in which the work of the Commonwealth might be carried out. My knowledge of London is not very recent, but I have kept myself up-to-date in regard to any changes in the nature arid character of its streets, and I do not hesitate to saiy that to attempt to provide the High Commissioner with a private regrandilo- sidence in the Strand would be just Min- about as reasonable as would be the building of a residence for the GovernorWe are General half way down George-street, Svdnev, or Lonsdale-street, Melbourne. In Therefore, the site is quite out of the Question for the purposes of a residence. Everybody knows that if the High Commissioner . is to exercise in London those social functions which some people think will cost be should do, his house wil l be one at which a great many callers will pay their - compliments to him and cost his wife from time to time. The Strand is a crowded thoroughfare, full of commerce, full of business, full of merchandise, and to suppose that a building in the Strand would be suitable for the residence of a High Commissioner is to show an absolute want of knowledge of we the fitness of things with regard to the to pay streets of London. The next question is the suitability of the site for exhibiting upon Australian products. I do not think this £150,000, House has yet made up its mind that the Commonwealth is to. usurp the functions of the States by taking upon itself that work. Each of the States is today doing its best to arrange for an exhibition in Agent-General's office in London of its particular products. It would be ridiculous - for the Commonwealth to attempt to cate that work. Certainly the Commonquite wealth has not shown a disposition yet take action in that direction. If you that out of the way as premature, although it may not be ultimately adverse to the wishes of the House, you reduce the of the Commonwealth in London in the mediate future to the office work of a High Commissioner. What is that work? seven years we have done without any representative at all. It is quite true if . by-and-by, the debts are from the States to the Commonwealth, and if the Commonwealth stock issued in place of the States stock is inscribed and managed that the holders of it may from time to time re-inscribe it in order it more marketable, we shall then a number of officials in.the Commonwealth London office. But at present we seem be as far off the transference of the States debts to the Commonwealth as we were"" lic would rush to occupy them. seven years ago. Consequently, looking at this proposal from a purely business point of view, we have no immediate need in London of anything more than a suite of offices in which to accommodate a repre-' sentative. Even if we appointed a Commissioner, all that we should want pose. within the next two or three years would be worthy office accommodation to enable him to do the work of the Commonwealth. residence. I quite agree with the honourable member West Svdney that we shall not promote immigration to Australia by fine buildings. Those who imagine that by the construcStates tion of a fine six-storv building in London ' direction. we shall attract attention in England, might similarly think that by the addition are doing is most absurd. of one star 'to the firmament we could attract all eyes to one particular part of the sky. London is full of fine buildings, many of them twelve stories high and more, and the idea that we should attract immigrants from all parts of Great Britain by having in London a fine six-story building costing £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 is an absurdity. There are other ways of attracting immigrants. The most effective is Bv advertisements and by ember's opinions. ploying lecturers, or by offering a small premium to those who would make it their business to go through England and secure the most suitable immigrants, according our wishes, to be brought to Australia. Where does that leave us in criticising this as a business proposal ? The honourable memits ber who is acting as Prime Minister told us own in very glowing language' what a splendid site this is, but the honourable member duplifor West Sydney, who was in London as recently, tells us that the side of to the road upon which it is proposed to seput cure this land does not have one pedestrian lo twenty who pass on the other side, and that for a great manv years the land has needs been unoccupied, because ..the London imCounty Council have opened up there a new wide thoroughfare, which is practically For untenanted at the present time.",34
246,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The reason of that was that that there was some doubt as to the probtransferred able width of the street.,36
247,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"At any rate the honourable member for West Sydney very so much impressed me with his recent experience of the thoroughfare. It appears that to make the London County Council have lately want embarked on extensive changes in the streets of London, taken down large - areas to of buildings, and made these great thoroughfares in the expectation that the pubBut the public do not appear to have done so. Now this site is put before us, and we are asked to approve of a proposal to lease a 200-feet frontage, when two of the three reasons advanced in support of it show it to be absoHigh lutely unsuitable for this particular purI am sure that no honourable member thinks for a moment that it is possible to occupy it for a High Commissioner's No one will hesitate to sayfor that it is quite premature to think of building there a place for exhibiting Australian products; when we know that the themselves are all at work in that",36
248,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,What the States ',36
249,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Of course the Acting Prime Minister thinks the States absurd. "" Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I did not say that the States were absurd. They have no place in which to make proper exhibits. Mr Bruce .SMITH - The States will not be influenced by the' honourable memDoes any one think that Mr Bent is likely to be influenced in his intentions because the Acting Prime Minister thinks that the States are acting foolto ishly? We have to look facts in the face. If the people of the States have made up their minds to exhibit their minerals and produce in London under the auspices of itheir own Agents-General, it would not only be foolish for us to duplicate the 'work, but it would be an attempt to usurp the functions of the States in making their resources known in London, purpose, then, do we require all this frontage of 200 feet? We are told that it is stipulated in the proposed agreement that the building shall be six stories high. Consequently, as the honourable member for Dalley pointed out, we should be forced to erect a building with a frontage of 200 feet, a depth of 65 feet, and six stories in height. That would be an enormous area of building for which we should have no immediate use.",36
250,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,T a l k sense ! Mr BRUC E SMITH - On e honourable member said we could let portion of the building.,37
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Why does not honourable member try to understand something about it?,37
252,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It is very well for the Acting Prime Minister to tell me that I and others know nothing about the - subject - approve of the proposal submitted to us,37
253,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The member knows nothing about it.,37
254,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Everybod y will be forced to the conclusion from the honourable member's statements that he himself knows nothing about it. I have spent more years in London than the Acting Prime Minister has spent months.,37

256,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,And failed all - time.,37
257,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I shall not reply to insulting remarks. The question - of one's success in life is not measured by .the number of times one can get into office. I am quite content to leave a question of comparison to unbiased onlookers. The Committee should deal with this proposal on business lines. - clear that the honourable member for South Sydney practically disapproves of it . He thinks that we are putting the cart before the horse, that we ought to have a High Commissioner in London first, and find out what his duties are to be before we think - of building a palatial residence. orable member for West Sydney has also - quite disillusioned the Committee as to the - suitability of the site. The Acting Prime Minister says that the States will probably join with the Commonwealth in occupying, the one building."" I submit that before we build upon that supposition we ought to . For what open up communications with the different States with a view to ascertain whether or not they will co-operate with us in the occupation of the great structure which it is proposed to erect. Before we embark upon this enterprise which means committing ourselves for a century to a capitalized rent of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 and to the erection of a building which, according to a Federal officer, will cost anything from £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , we ought to know what we are going to do with it. Honourable members will do well to recollect that if we are to maintain our non-borrowing policy this expenditure must come out of revenue. If the Federal officer's estimate of the £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 - the cost of the building-be correct, we shall have to spend that amount out of revenue. In other words, we shall have to raise £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 additional revenue in order to obtain the necessary money with which to erect this building. If we do not honourable today it does not mean that we are negativing it for all time, but rather that we think the present proposal premature. The honourable member for South Sydney has said that it is "" putting the cart before the horse."" We ought to have a more business-like statement presented than that which has been put before us by the Acting Prime' Minister. I do not like this extraordinary state of things under which Captain Collins tells us that we ought to approach the London County Council through' a Mr Burr. I do not know who Mr Burr is. I do not know the whether he is an architect or a property broker. But everybody knows that the County Council is one of the regularly managed organizations of London, and there can be no doubt that it has a secretary and plenty of assistant secretaries who would 'do business directly with an officer of the Commonwealth. It seems to me that a great corporation of that sort is not It is very likely to have half-a-dozen prices for its land. I am sure that much smaller corporations would conduct their businessupon more definite lines than that. The London County Council has a price for the leasing of this land, and Captain Collins is able to approach the secretary of that body in The hon- order to get it under offer from him or to close with the Council's offer. I have never before heard of a state of things in London which required one to approach a large corporation like the County Council through a third party. introduction of a third party means extra expenditure, and we do not want a repetition of our experience of negotiations recently conducted by the Government in connection with one or two large transactions. We desire to do' direct business, and we want to be assured that we get what we purchase at what is called the "" ground' floor price.'' We do not want the middleman to be introduced. Even if the Government have authority to do so they ought not to authorize any person in London to act in this matter unless they are perfectly satisfied that he is closing the bargain for them directly with the body from whom they are purchasing.",37
258,Mr THOMAS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Is the honourable member in favour of doing away with the middleman ?,38
259,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Certainl y not, but I object to paying him commission. Mr KING OMALLEY . (Darwin) [5.25] - After listening to the remarks of the Acting Prime Minister in reference to the erection of a six-story building in London, and after learning that it is not proposed to let any portion of that building, I am almost sorry that I offered the suggestion which I made in this House several years ago. To me as a business-man, it is ridiculous to talk about erecting a large building in London for the Commonwealth alone. When I first suggested that Commonwealth offices should be erected in that city, I dwelt upon' the absolute necessity for establishing great cellars in which Australian liquid products could be stored during periods when business in London was congested. Upon that occasion L pointed out that the first floor might be let to banks or to great business institutions. Some years ago many life insurance companies could scarcely find suitable office , accommodation in London. ing insurance offices now doing business in Australia-the Australian Mutual Provident Society, the Mutual National L if e Assurance Society, and the National Mutual L if e Assurance Society-ar e doing business in London. They require offices there, and they should be prepared to rent them from the Commonwealth. Mr TILLE Y. BROWN - Not upstairs fices. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes , upstairs offices in buildings which are fitted elevators. The honourable member is still living mentally in the dark ages. The day .The has passed when the fact that offices aresituated upstairs is regarded as being a. disadvantage. Nowadays all large buildings are fitted with express elevators. Tome it is ridiculous to talk about erecting a building of six stories in London. In this, connection, I would ask the Acting Prime - Minister whether he returned to Australia by way of New York, and, if so, did hesee the buildings of twenty and thirty stories there? Has he seen the "" Flatiron "" in New York? I know that it isdifficult to lift people above their immediate surroundings. Smallness in environment means smallness in everything. When. I ' first presented the idea of erecting Commonwealth offices in London to this House a good deal of sneering was indulged in. But experience is a good teacher, because it is absolutely impossible for the student to run away from the school. That is the reason why I , as an experienced businessman- a man who has done' business not merely in the Commonwealth,' but in NewYork, Chicago, and London-realise d what the Australian people required. Ever* though some persons may travel and have their eyes opened, they have not the power of learning from observation what are their own requirements, and that is the reason? why they remain in the rut. I shall not ' vote for this proposal if it is not to be a business one. I will not vote to commit the people of the Commonwealth to anannual expenditure of £ 7 , 5 0 0 for ninety-nine years unless the building which weerect is going to produce, a revenue, and* ' unless the High Commissioner is to have his offices absolutely free of rental. Upon a previous occasion I pointed out that the various States Governments were payingfrom £ 7 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 as rental for offices in London. When a visitor from the Commonwealth arrives in that city he All the lead- has to procure a cab, a microscope, and a map in order to find the present offices of the States' Agents-General. In WesternKansas, we had a "" dug-out "" for the rats, and the London offices of the different Australian States have been run upon similar lines - When one enters them, what does one find? A clerk is in attendance. When one inquires about Australia, he ishanded a manual to read- a manual fromofwhich he, can learn absolutely nothing.",38

I desire every Australian this who may be doing business in England to be able to go to the building and secure an office, if vacant. My ambition is to have what may be described as an Australia in London. I want every Australian, when he arrives in London, to be able to keep one eye set on the Star of Australia, so to speak,. just as when a man comes from Texas he heads for the Texas Building in New York.

288,Mr KING OMALLEY,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I suggest that there should be a bond in the basement. Nowadays, when you start to build, you try to get every ounce of silver and gold out of the investment. We do not want to take on a proposition which, after deducting ground rent, rates, and taxes, paying interest, and providing a sinking fund for the liquidation of money borrowed, will not give us a big profit. Does the Committee think that the business men of New York have built the great edifices which are to be found in that city merely that they may be looked at? They have built them to get rents from them.",40
289,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We are being asked to agree to the acquisition of a site before any scheme for its utilization has been placed before us.,40
290,Mr KING OMALLEY,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"That is quite true. But, unfortunately, with Governments, where all do business, no one does business. One could pick out the men who do the business in this Committee. Had I been running this affair, I should have accepted the site and allowed members Of Parliament to fight out the matter afterwards. When a proposition recommends itself to a business man as a good one, he should adopt it, leaving it to be fought cut by others afterwards. Now we have one making one proposal and another a different proposal. But all laws are the result of compromise with stipulations. If there were no compromise, there would be no finishing. ' But £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 will not pay for the erection of a suitable building. I would sooner not build in the great city of London, which is the centre of the earth and the highway of the universe, if I could get only £60,000 to spend. That amount would not pay for the foundations of a suitable building. We ought to construct the building of steel and concrete. Buildings twenty stories high made of those materials withstood the San Francisco earthquake and fire.",40
291,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We shall need a building which will withstand the mortgagee. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I would not have a mortgage.,41
292,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"How would the honourable member get the monev to pay for the erection of such a building as he suggests? . Mr KING O'MALLEY - If I were Treasurer I could get it before tomorrow morning, and so arrange that the building would not cost the Commonwealth a penny. There is no trouble about money if you know how to grab it.",41
293,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The honourable member ought to be Treasurer. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Unfortunately I am not Treasurer. We should provide space for an Australian restaurant where only Australian products would be sold. Everything in the building should be Australian.  lime and sand. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Last vear, when I was speaking on this subject, the honourable member for Dalley suggested that we should have a statue of the right honourable the leader of the Opposition on top. I do not believe in that. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will give Parliament an opportunity to say whether £60,000 or £250,000 is to be spent on the building. The principles which nowa-days govern the erection of buildings by private persons should be applied in this case, and there should be plenty of space to let. We should let the ground floor, because it will be of no use to us. Of course, if a man requires only a necktie or our own terms. a collar, he goes into premises on the ground floor; but the man with a cheque in his pocket, who comes into do millions of pounds' worth of business, is always ready to go upstairs. This building should make one of Australia's best assets, and such as every Australian, wherever he came from, would take a pride in, and would head for. Where do they go now? ' Mr Wilks - To the bankers. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is the position. In my day you got lost every twenty minutes in the narrow streets of London, and they were opening up Victoriastreet. That is many years ago. Now, I am told, there are many beautiful streets,, so that you can find your way about. Previously London was like Boston, where,, if you get lost, you have to employ detectives to find you, and to take you home.",41
294,Mr THOMAS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Was the honourable member a teetotaller in Boston? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I have been, a teetotaller for many years. The drink proposition does not appeal to me. There is nothing in it for a business man. I ask the Prime Minister to say that if we agree to this vote, he will give honourable members a subsequent opportunity to express an opinion as to whether this building, shall be six stories high or twelve storieshigh, if such a building can be erected inLondon. We do not desire to. lose the advantage of the space we secure. There would be no trouble in letting space in London. I ask the Prime Minister also whether' he is prepared to expend not £60,000 but £250,000 on this building?",41
295,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The honourable member frightens me. Mr KING O'MALLEY - What would! £250,000 be for the erection of a Commonwealth building?",41
296,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I tell the honourable member what I have, already told the Committee, that before any plan is accepted it will be submitted to the House. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Le t me adrJ to what I have already said, that thisbuilding, if erected, will be not for present use only but for all time.",41
297,Mr HEDGES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,What nonsense; we should lose it at the end of 99 years. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is not correct.,41
298,Mr HEDGES,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Le t the honourable member look at the memorandum. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - I admit that we are buying a lease, but we could make",41
299,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It is impossible to buy freehold in London.,41
300,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Scotc h leases fall in in 99. years, but the buildings do not fall in with them. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The point I wish to make in connection with the proposed' long lease is that we can make our own terms. Land is leased in America for ninety-nine years, but there is provision made for special buildings, and for a reappraisement - at the end of the lease, or for the purchase of the improvements at a valuation.",41
301,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The honourable memto ber should remember that this matter will have to be closed by cable not later the day after tomorrow. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is with respect only to the ground rent. It would - be easy to send a cable to London concernhold ing the conditions to which I have referred. If I were in the position, of the Acting Prime Minister, I should send a cable ing that we are prepared to take the land - on certain conditions.",42
302,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,That would be tantamount to saying that we are not prepared to take it at all.,42
303,Mr SINCLAIR,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The London County - Council can dispose of the land to other people if we let it go. Mr KING O'MALLEY - If they will not consider reasonable terms, we should not do business with them. To reason with unreasonable people is like administering - medicine to dead people. However, not wish Fo stand here talking all night on the subject; there is nothing.in it.",42
304,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Indi) [5.54]The speech of the honourable member for Darwin was certainly very eloquent, but is shorn' of its splendour when it is recog- £100,000. nised that the proposal submitted by the - Government is that we should build on lease - and that our building would become the property of the London County Council ledge. when the lease expired. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am opposed that. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I complain of the inadequacy of the information supplied to the Committee. The honourable member for Angas drew attention to a point with 'respect to a charge of 4s. in the £ 1 the Acting Prime Minister could not tell amount of money. the Committee what it meant. Sir. WILLIAM LYNE - I did tell the mittee, but the honourable member is Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I admit that when it comes to a question of a. deal Acting Prime Minister has the best of me. the Treasurer. If any man in business submitted a proposiTariff tion to his principal in a firm in the way which the honourable gentleman has subimmense confusion. mitted this matter to the Committee, he would be reminded that he was being paid to serve his master. The Acting Prime Minister does not appear to be possessed sufficient common sense to understand position. He has submitted to the Committee a proposal about which he knows absolutely nothing. He has not been able give honourable members one-half the information on the subject that other honorthan able members who bave been in London .have been able to supply. The honourable gentleman so failed to make it clear that he was proposing the purchase of a leasethat an honourable member possessing the business intelligence indicated by the last speech to which we have listened was sayunable to understand the position.",42
305,Mr KING OMALLEY,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I did understand it. I said that it might be reappraised at the end of ninety-nine years. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - No business has yet been introduced into this House by the Government in a satisfactory manner. No one will say that the Tariff was introduced in a commendable manner, or that the Bounties Bill, or the Quarantine Bill were submitted as they ought to have been. Yet all these measures involve additional I do expenditure by the Commonwealth.",42
306,Mr THOMAS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Why did not the honourable member vote against the Bounties Bill? Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I helped to it reduce the expenditure under it by over I may be called pessimistic, but I am content to be so called.. We are now a. again being asked to enter upon an important undertaking without sufficient knowI am satisfied that the majority of the citizens of the Commonwealth are to agreed that this is no time to authorize heavy additional expenditure, 'which I am credibly informed will amount to between £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",42

310,Mr TILLEYBROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am not discussing the Tariff, but referring to.the fact that we - are deriving revenue under the Tariff .at, a cost ten times greater than the. unfortunate taxpayers should be asked to bear.",43
311,The CHAIRMAN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Order ! The honourable member must not pursue that line of argument. Mr TILLEY 'EROWN - Surely the question of the way in which the money required is to be raised is the all-important question? If the Government propose the expenditure of £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £500,000, I am entitled to direct attention to themanner in which the Commonwealth revenue is now being collected. I have no wish to transgress the Standing Orders, but I desire to point out that a principle is being fol lowed in the collection of revenue which is so harassing to the people that it is likely to lead to very great difficulty in getting revenue from them in the future. The cos""t of collecting revenue under our present system is enormous, and the confusion that exists is really dreadful. Men cannot get their stuff away within from three to six weeks. All this arises from the pure cussedness of one man, because that is what it amounts to. I have made up my mind to vote against this proposal not because I do not think that some measure of representation of the Commonwealth in London is necessary. I believe that it is necessary that the Commonwealth should be represented there, but this proposal has been introduced in such a .way, and at such a time, that, in my opinion, no member of the Committee is justified in voting for it. I hope there will be a division on the question, when, after the explanation I have made, I shall be found voting against the proposed vote.",43
312,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Fawkner) [5.59] I should like to say a few words on this question. From two or three points of view I hold the opinion very strongly that the Commonwealth ought to be represented in London. One reason is that when one is in London and sees the magnificent show that Canada is making there he must be impressed with the view that we ought to do something in the same direction, and that before very long. The Agents General of the States ought to be brought together, and housed in one building, before they get further rooted in their present positions. But I am sorry to say that, in my opinion, we are on the eve of bad times again. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I do not think so.",43
313,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I know a good deal of the conditions in the country all over Australia; and, I regret that I can f u l ly endorse the opinion that if we do not have rain very shortly we shall have bad times.  rain within forty-eight hours.",43
314,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am glad to hear that. . But a further fact is that we seem to be getting to the end of our tether financially, . seeing that we have only £ 1 0 3 , 0 0 0 left of our portion of the Customs and Excise revenue. That is another fact sufficient to make one pause. Until the Acting Prime Minister made his explanation I was inclined to support this item; but when he tells us that he proposes to erect, on 190 odd feet of land, a building which is to cost only £""60,000, I must say that, in my opinion, the scheme has not been well considered. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to obtain an extension of the option, and, in the meantime, to submit a well-considered scheme-to place before us a business proposal which we shall be prepared to support. As I have remarked, there is much to be said in favour of the proposed site, which is one of the best in London; and I am Very much in favour of our taking a position alongside' Canada, with the view to attracting immigrants. But to ask us to vote this large sum quite in the dark",43
315,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,An unknown sum.,43
316,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Q u it e so; to ask us to vote such a sum is to place too great a strain upon honourable members.,43
317,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Let the Acting Prime Minister ask for an extension of the option.,43
318,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Yes ; - and I think the Acting Prime Minister will find that this piece of ground will .not run away. If the honourable gentleman desires to make a business bargain he will take the view I have presented. There is no doubt t that rates and taxes in the old country are increasing by leaps and bounds. The extraordinary action of the Progressive Party in the London County Council is making the rates in that city almost unbearable. Business enterprises are being removed from London wholesale, and a great number of business men may leave that city. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Busines s will never leave London.",43
319,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Anybod y who has studied the last balance-sheet of the London County Council must have seen there a most striking figure. What the London County Council call their "" remunerative undertaking,"" namely, the river steamboat service, has resulted in an annual loss of ^ 5 J ° ° 0 ) 2 o r makes one feel that if we agree to pay rent for these Commonwealth offices for ninety-nine years, there may be an increase in the rating to an extent more than the Commonwealth can bear, or, at any rate, more than the Commonwealth would be justified in bearing. I gain, it ought to be stipulated that the London County Council shall pay any extra taxation; and I ask the Acting Prime Minister to think this matter over. We are all anxious that the Commonwealth shall be properly represented in England, but we require a thoroughly thought-out scheme, so that we may intelligently cast our votes.",44
320,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Wide Bay) [6.6] --The remarks of the honourable member for Fawkner appear to me rather singular. The honourable member admits that there is need for a building in London, so that the States of Australia may be represented under one roof, and, further, that the proposed site is a good one. But the able member goes on to say that the London County Council, which manages the affairs of the great city exceedingly well, has issued a balance-sheet which shows that it has carried on one of its enterprises at a loss. The inference is that there is a danger of London disappearing.",44
321,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It is quite possible. Business men are leaving London in numbers.,44
322,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Then, from patriotic motives alone-takin g the cue from honourable members in the Opposition cornerit is the duty of Australia to go to the rescue of the Imperial city. From that high stand-point, especially if we desire to have a building representative of Australia, surely the great Imperial idea, of which we have heard so much, will influence honourable members. quite agree with the criticism that this proposal has been introduced without even the Minister being in possession [128] of all the facts. For instance, I hear a number of honourable members saying that men at the end of the ninety-nine years the London County Council will claim the land with all the improvements.",44
323,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Absolutely .,44

329,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Is the honourable member speaking of Scotland or England ?,44
330,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am speaking of Scotland and Ireland, and, in some instances, of England. What I say is that this is a matter on which there should be no doubt j all the facts should have been, ascertained and stated to honourable members. If the London County Council is. issuing leases of the kind suggested by honourable members, that Council is not the honorradical body it is represented to be.",44
331,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"We do not know whether the municipal rates are 6s., 7s., or 1 os. in the pound.",44
332,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If the London County Council has bought up a portion of the city of London, and is leasing the ground, it is departing from what I consider sound business principles, if it* claims the improvements at the end of the term. A continuance of the lease at a higher ground rent might be granted, but the lessees ought to be paid for any improvements they may have made. However, we cannot alter the conditions prescribed by the London County Council, who will, determine what it considers a fair price. Our business is to ascertain the whole of the facts, and then decide whether or not the bargain is good enough. Notwithstanding I what has been said by the honourable member for West Sydney, I think the proposed site is a good one in every respect; but before we enter into an expenditureamounting to about £250,000, we ought to have a great deal more information than we possess at present.",44
333,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"In voting for this item, we commit ourselves practically to the erection of a building.",45
334,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"No , I shall not commit myself to any further expenditure by voting this £ 1 , 0 0 0 .",45
335,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"At any rate, this Committee will be committed to the larger expenditure.",45
336,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I shall vote for the expenditure of £1,000 as a direction to the Government that, in the opinion of the Committee, it is advisable for the Commonwealth, at the earliest possible date, to have in London a suitable building representative of Commonwealth's interests.",45
337,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,On this particular site?,45
338,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Yes .,45
339,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Then what follows ? Shall we not be bound to carry out the work of erecting a building? Mr.'FISHER - I go further. The Acting Prime Minister has stated clearly and distinctly that, as regards himself, if the amount of money demanded is higher than, I think, 14s. per superficial foot, he will not conclude the agreement without first consulting Parliament.",45
340,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I do not think the Acting Prime Minister said that.,45
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I said that if the price asked was unduly higher than that paid by the Victorian Government, I would do as the honourable member for Wide Bay has indicated.",45
342,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"That is an important statement. It does not enable the Executive to agree to any condition that it thinks fit. I do not see that it is necessary for the subsequent arrangements to be subject to the control of Parliament. The Executive must take some risk and exercise some responsibility. But, before the matter is finally decided. Parliament should examine the plans, and have the fullest information.",45
343,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I have said that I will submit the plans to Parliament before I take any action.,45
344,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The matter comes to this-firs t of all. is the time ripe for the Commonwealth to have an establishment in London to represent its interests? If that question be decided in the affirmative, the second question arises-is this site suitable? I think that both propositions must be answered in the affirmative. .That being so, I am prepared to support the vote for £1,000 as an indication to the Government that they can proceed; but I wish it to be distinctly understood that I do not commit myself to an expenditure amounting to such a large sum as £250,000.",45
345,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The honourable member does so by voting for the £1,000. He knows that.",45
346,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The honourable member for Indi is not youthful, but he is impetuous. I say that we can build as we please after we have voted the £1,000.",45
347,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We shall have to build as the London County Council pleases.,45
348,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If honourable members look at ""the plans, they will see that the London County Council, wise in their day and generation, have divided the land into certain lots. The Commonwealth Government will not have the whole of those lots, unless they act as they ought not to do, and bind themselves absolutely without consulting Parliament to take the land, and put up a building of which the London County Council approve. It is, however, quite right that the Council should have authority to determine what kind of building should be erected. Every decent self governing municipal authority exercises such control.",45
349,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The Sydney City Council does it, and so does the City. Council of Melbourne.",45
350,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"-Quite right, too. What sort of authority would it be that did not exercise control over the sort of buildings to be erected in the principal streets under its jurisdiction?",45
351,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If the honourable member looks at the Estimates, he will see that the vote is "" towards the construction of a building."" . That commits us to the construction.",45
352,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The words in the schedule are in conflict with what the Minister has just said.,45
353,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The matter had to be put in that way, because I could not provide for it on these Estimates in any other fashion. But the vote does not commit us to anything except getting the land.",45
354,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It is just as. well that that assurance has been elicited. The statement of the Acting Prime Minister is that he asks for this vote only to ascertain whether Parliament will grant power to negotiate and determine the subsequent matters.. .,45
355,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It commits us to the whole scheme.,46
356,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It does nothing of the kind. Honourable members are not going to commit themselves.,46

359,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We are getting business. The Acting Prime Minister assures us that he was not able to bring the subject before us in any other way than this.,46
360,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Not in these Estimates.,46
361,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Bu the has also said quite clearly that he desires a vote for £1,000 only as a guarantee of good faith, that Parliament authorizes the Government to negotiate, and within certain limitations to determine that this shall be the site. tells us that he will subsequently come Parliament, and ask for authority to coninvolved. struct the necessary building. I wish to say, further, in regard to such a building tion of the British people. as we shall have to construct that, if law is that the building will fall to London County Council at the end of ninety-nine years, I am one of those who say that the cost should not be sustained absolutely out of revenue. I think .if we erect a building that is going to last site. for such a length of time, it should be construction out of loan funds, with a ing fund sufficient to meet the whole of subsequent payments, together with the ligations that , will accrue at the end of ninety-nine years. That plan would be both business-like and sensible. One the great reasons why this Parliament taken the very proper, wise and necessary' course of stopping loan expenditure has been to prevent what has taken place many years in Australia on the 'part of 1 the States, namely, reckless and unnecessteps sary expenditure out of-loan money.",46

The honourable member for Wide Bay and the honourable member for Darwin both seemed to be of opinion that if the for land is to fall into the London County Council at the end of the ninety-nine years, should at least be taken to secure that ' the Commonwealth shall receive compensation for the improvements made. The honourable member for Wide Bay has instanced certain Statutes in Ireland and Scotland, insure that improvements shall become the property of the tenant, who shall receive their value at the expiration, of his the lease. But unless I am very much misthat legislation apnlies entirely to agricultural holdings. I am not aware of any such legislation which is applicable to in Loncity or town property. The honourable member for Wide Bay has pointed out as an indication that the buildings will not f all to the lessors at the end of the term that there is nothing in the, memorandum to indicate that there is not to be a re-assessment at the end of the term. whole point, for if one desires to impose special conditions as to what is to become of a building at the end of the term for which the land on which it is erected is leased, one must have those conditions in - black and white. In their absence the buildings fall into the lessor as a matter of law. Having regard to the fact that no freehold will be granted, I think that both the honourable member for Wide Bay and the honourable member for Darwin will find that by voting for the item they will vote for something to which they are absolutely opposed. Mr FISHER. - No ; I do not object the facts are understood.",46
366,Colonel FOXTON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Neithe r the honourable member for Wide Bay nor the honourable member for Darwin has moved ' an amendment providing that the lease should be entered into only in the event of a proposition for a renewal being entertained. We know that the London County Council will not part with the property for one hour longer than ninety-nine years.,47
367,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"All I said was that if we entered into a ninety-nine years' lease at the end of which period the buildings would f all in, we should have a sinking fund to liquidate the whole amount in that time. I made that point quite clear.",47
368,Colonel FOXTON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I beg the honourable member's pardon if I misunderstood him. We must face this proposition as one - which involves a ninety-nine years' lease, --and the loss of the Commonwealth -""buildings, whatever they may cost, at the - end of that period. Such are well-known - terms in London. We all know the - enormous revenues derived by the Duke of Westminster, the Duke of Bedford, and other great landlords from property in the immediate vicinity of this site. similar leases the buildings have fallen in and have enormously increased the gigantic revenues of these noblemen.",47
369,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It is too true.,47
370,Colonel FOXTON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Quite so. I heard this proposal mooted and listened to the first intimation given in regard to it by the Acting Prime Minister, I felt it was one that I should be glad to support.",47
371,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"On general lines, I suppose the' honourable member would support it at the present time ?",47
372,Colonel FOXTON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"This proposal that we should have, as graphically deThat is the scribed by the honourable member for Darwin, a Commonwealth building in London appeals to one's patriotism. But businessmen perhaps look at business matters from different view points, and notwithstand1 ing the glowing picture drawn for us by the honourable member for Darwin we must view this matter from a strictly business standpoint. We have to consider, as the honourable member for Wide Bay said, whether the time has actually arrived for launching upon a scheme of this sort,- and secondly, whether, assuming that we do not seize this opportunity, we shall not have later on another opportunity to secure an equally if eligible site. I am one of those who believe that if we do not take this site, it will not be difficult, certainly not impossible, to obtain an equally good, if not a better, site for such a stupendous rental as is proposed. For a ground rental varying from not less than £ 7 , 5 0 0 to £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, we could command a very good site anywhere. I cannot believe that it is not possible to obtain an equally good site. I was very much impressed with the remarks made by the right honourable member for Swan. He has had practical experience in the old country, and he has expressed the opinion that it would be impossible for us, at the site in question, to carry out what is certainly one of the most important branches of Commonwealth business-the inscription of stock, by which we should make a saving of something like £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 per annum.. Such a saving would - not be immediately effected, but it would possibly be made in the course of time, as' the States debts were taken over. As to the question of whether or not we have yet arrived at a point at which it is desirable to launch upon a scheme of this sort, I am at one with those who have, said that Ave are putting the cart before the Under horse, or, in other words, that we are providing the cage before we have caught our bird. Are we ready to appoint a High Commissioner? What would a High Commissioner have to do if he were appointed now, or even one or two years hence ? It may When be said that it is very desirable that we should have in London a Commonwealth building in connection with our immigration scheme. If I thought that it would be a really potent factor in attracting immigrants to this country, I should not hesitate to vote for the item; but in Queensland, as I have had occasion to point out, we have done more in the direction of encouraging immigration than has any other State, and we have always found that lecturers, provided with caravans, going amongst the people whom we wish to attract to Australia, are infinitely more effective than anything that could be done in the city of London.",47
373,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,That is how Canada secures her immigrants.,48
374,Colonel FOXTON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"That is so. Canada has had for years, and still has a very large staff working in a direction that justifies her proposal to erect a fine building in London. It will be used to house the staff which she has not only in London and the United Kingdom generally, but throughout Europe. we are to take any portion of this site, then I hold that we should lease the whole frontage. If we were to lease only a small frontage, ourbuilding, as an honourable member has said, would look mean and contemptible when compared with the palace which Canada is going to erect. Indeed, if we are to have such a building, it would be better that it should not be in the vicinity of the Canadian offices, so that odious comparisons might not be drawn. If the item be agreed to, I hope that the Government will acquire the whole frontage, from the corner which has been secured by Victoria, to the corner nearest the city, in order that we may appear to be, at all events, nearly the equal of Canada.",48
375,Unknown,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Sitting suspended from 6.30. to 7-4-5 p.m.,48
376,Colonel FOXTON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Prioi to the suspension of the sitting, I expressed the hope that if this vote was agreed to we should acquire the whole of the frontage right up to the corner nearest to the city, for the reason that if we did not the Commonwealth building would be completely overshadowed by that which it is intended to erect for Canada. I find, in the weekly edition of the London Times, of 26'th July, reference to the fact that a - French syndicate has acquired the whole , of the central block fronting both the Strand and Aldwych, and that the Canadian Government had acquired from them the Strand frontage. It is stated that the intention of the French syndicate is to have in the centre of the Aldwych frontage a magnificent. building for. the purpose - of an expositionof French industries, with, on either side, places of entertainment presumably on French lines. I do not know whether that would be an advantage to this site or not from the Commonwealth point of view. I .find that the frontage of the Canadian building is to be 413 feet. TheTimes states- , The Strand buildingreferring to the Canadian buildingwill have a frontage to that thoroughfare of 413 feet, and of 176 feet to each of the side streets. The cost of the Strand, or, as it may be called, the Canadian block is estimated at ^'400,000. I presume that means the buildingThe Canadian buildings will be designed by Messrs. A. Marshall, Mackenzie, and Son, who are the architects of the Waldorf Hotel, Aldwych, which is now approaching completion. That is a great hotel, which has been If erected on the other side of Aldwych. Consequently, witha Canadian building occupying no less than 413 feet of frontage to the Strand, and costing £400,000, it will be conceded that if we were to have anything less than, the whole of the available frontage to the Strand for Commonwealth purposes, our building would be completely eclipsed, and it would be better for us to go elsewhere. If there is to be an arrangement,, such as is proposed, that this should be a Commonwealth building, used by the Commonwealth and all of the States individually, it would be better for us, even although we might have to sacrifice this opportunity of acquiring such a site-if that can be called a sacrifice-and go elsewhere, to ascertain from each of the States if they would be willing to fall in with the proposition and make this building their head-quarters, before we commit this Parliament to any such proposal as that which is now foreshadowed. We have indications that some of the States are inclined to do otherwise. From a purely business point of view, it would be essentially desirable to enter into such an arrangement with the States, or otherwise the Commonwealth might find . itself saddled for many yearsto come with a huge building which it could not occupy effectively and completely without subletting, and sub-letting is to be deprecated. The Commonwealth, notwithstanding what the honourable member for Darwin said, would not be consulting its own dignitv by erecting buildings merely, for the purpose of sub-letting, to tenants, even although, as foreshadowed* those tenants might be Australian corporations and financial institutions.. I believe that an equally good, if not better, they had agreed to pay. Site for many purposes, especially for inscription of stock, could be found Same amount of rental as it is proposed to pay. by. way of ground rent for this site. It has been mentioned that, a considerable area, including the area submitted to us, has been vacant for some years. believe that that is strictly correct. believe, also, that a considerable proporto tion of the frontage of Kingsway-the great new thoroughfare, which has been created by the London County Council, and which, in some respects, offers more desirproach able sites than this-is still unoccupied. I Mr Burr. was informed by a gentleman who had recently been in London-possibly the Prime Minister will correct me if I am wrong-that about eight months ago a numthat ber of tents had actually been erected the instance of the King for the housing of the London poor in Kingsway It must also be borne in mind that, matter of mere advertising, which is a perfectly legitimate undertaking for the Comnected monwealth, it will be necessary at all times to work in with the States. I am informed that Queensland proposes to spend duringproposed the next twelve or eighteen months something like £20,000 in' making a display of its resources at the pending Anglo-French Exbe hibition. ' Whatever steps the Commonto wealth may take for the purpose of adver-. tising Australia as a whole, it will always be found that those States which most need immigration for the filling up of their great empty, spaces will exert themselves in this way"" independently of the Commonwealth,, in order' to direct to their shores a stream of' immigration-- which we all hope to coming to Australia.' I have, with others, to complainof the lack of information regard to this transaction. We know that the rental, if the whole frontage is taken, will be approximately £10,000 a year. If it. one may judge by other instances of leases taken ""in other portions of London not far distant from this, the charges by way of rate's'will also be a considerable item. only charge from which the Commonwealth up will in.this instance be exempt is that ferred to' by the honoraSle member for Angas and described in the contract bebuilding. tween the London County Council and Victoria as the Landlord's Property Tax - be Some friends of mine, who took a lease residential' property some distance to - west-of this site in London, found that the Colonel Foxton. rates for which they were liable' as occu-r piers amounted to 40 per cent, of the rent: . ; the Mr Wilks - The rates in West Ham* for the are as high as 12s. in the £ 1 .",48

392,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"This proposal, if carried, will commit us to. an expenditure of £200,000.",51

It might just as reasonably be urged that in"" authorizing the expenditure for survey of £20,000 upon what is sometimes called the "" desert"" railway, we have committed ourselves to the construction of that railway.",51
394,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It is a totally different thing.,51

In that case, we voted £20,000 for the survey of the line, and in the present instance, we are authorizing the Government to make an offer to the London County Council, subject to the approval of Parliament. I shall support the Government proposal because I thoroughly believe iri it. When we voted for Federation we expected that the Commonwealth Government would do what is now proposed. But I thought that it would have been done five years ago. If the proposal be carried-and I hope it will be- I trust that the appointment of a High Commissioner, and the establishment of temporary offices for the Commonwealth, will not be delayed. We require such offices, if population is to be attracted to our shores. When the permanent buildings have.been completed in one of the highways of commerce in London, the High Commissioner will be able to move into them, and possibly we may then be able to arrange with the various States Governments to provide their Agents-General with accommodation under the same roof.",51
396,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Mr Bent has already verbally agreed to take accommodation there.,51
397,Mr HANS IRVINE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Mr Bent is an ardent Federationist-despit e all that may be said to the contrary-and naturally he believes in doing what is suggested. In the past, the Government have not set a good example, but now that they are doing so honourable .members should support them, because the time is ripe for this undertaking. Delay will be detrimental to the interests and progress of Australia. I approve of the proposal, but I want an assurance from the Acting Prime Minister that its acceptance will not commit the Commonwealth to an enormous expendi- is. ture. I would have preferred the Government to come down with a proposal to spend £200,000 on the erection of a building which would - be an emporium for the display of Australian produce of all kinds. I would have supported such a proposal just as heartily as I approve of that now before us. I hope that it will be viewed by honourable members in the same way as it will, I think, be regarded by every primary producer and taxpayer. In London,we want to attract attention to what we are capable of producing here. By following the example of Canada, we shall get our money recouped fourfold. Each new settler will share our prosperity, and will share also the burden of our taxation, whilst at the same time assisting us to make Australia one of the finest parts of the British Empire.",51
398,Mr WYNNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Balaclava) [8.7] - I was in England at the same time as the last speaker, and I do not believe that there is in London a better site than that suggested for the erection of public offices for Australia. I am very pleased to learn that the Government intend to negotiate for a lease of the site. It is all very well for some honourable members to talk about the Commonwealth negotiating with the States. I do not think that the Government need or should negotiate with them. My view is that we should giv the States free offices e in this building, because the people of Australia will pay the rent. It will be of no use to the Commonwealth unless the offices of the States are located there. It will be all the same to the people of Australia whether the money comes out of the one pocket or the other, because it will be provided by them. I advise the Government to secure the site if it can be obtained at a reasonable price, to erect a large Australian building, and to allot to each State sufficient accommodation for its use. We ought not to ask the States to pay any rent, because that would mean only a book entry. I do not believe that the Government tan get a better site in London for their purpose, and therefore I intend to vote for the item.",51
399,Sir PHILIP FYSH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Denison) [8.10] I have listened very attentively to all the speakers on this subject, and I suppose that most of us have arrived at the conclusion that at the end of the proposed lease this land would revert to the lessor.

403,Sir PHILIP FYSH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"During the past"" few years, Bedford-square, Russell-square, Longacre, and Covent Garden Market, which are immediately behind this block, reverted to the lessor at the end of a ninety-nine years' lease.",52

405,Sir PHILIP FYSH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The Duke of matters Bedford.,52
406,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Yes ; but he is the London County Council,",52
407,Sir PHILIP FYSH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"No , but the Commonwealth will make the same terms with the London County Council as the lessors of those lands made with the Duke of Bedford. If that point has not been established, then we are groping in the dark, and that is a reason why we should delay. It has been made manifest, think, by various speakers, that the capitalther ization of the ground rent of £ 1 0 , 0 0 a year during the period of ninety-nine years, and possibly an expenditure £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 more, will entail an annual cost of about £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 , irrespective of not good service. less than 6s. 8d. in the £ 1 for rates to the London County Council, so that probably £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year will represent cost of this building, regardless of the fact that we shall have to find a High missioner, and to pay his salary and penses. We have lost sight of the conAgent-General dition which ought to be precedent to a vote of this kind, and that is whether or the not we intend to haw a High Commissioner. That has not been settled by House, and even if it is favoured by Parliament as a whole, it will not be given effect to for some time to come. What position shall we be in if , after ing arranged for the acquisition of a site, a High Commissioner is not appointed? On that subject. I find myself, in combuildings pany with a large number of honourable members who have spoken today, very scribes her own stock. much at sea. I should like the Governmon-wealth ment to lay upon the table, as a condiwill tion precedent to the consideration of the a High Commissioner. question, a precis of the various matters which, during the past five, or even twenty, years have been . referred to of floating loans on their behalf. the Colonial Office by the States Governtest ments. I contend that, so far as the reas premature. of the Commonwealth, are concerned, there can be no immediate necessity shown for the appointment of a High Commissioner. From time to time there may be to communications with the Colonial Office from whomsoever mav be acting as Agent General, but we know that for a long while the Imperial Conference has been the medium through which, the wishes of the Commonwealth have been conveyed to Lord Elgin and his predecessors at the Colonial Office. There has been no matter of great the importance referred to the Colonial Office during the past five years, and whatever may have been referred have been settled by correspondence or by a represennot tative who has gone home for a special occasion. Before we talk of appointing a High Commissioner and spending money on a piece of land in London, with the probability of involving the Commonwealth in a large annual outlay, we should be furnished by the Government with a full statement of their intentions. I could quite understand a proposal of this kind coming from I the Government after we had decided wheor not there should be - a High Com0 missioner. I am sorry to find that there is amongst honourable members generally an of impression that the High Commissioner will render the Commonwealth great and I should like to know what has been done by Mr Reeves, of New Zealand, Mr Coghlan, of New the South Wales, and the ' other Agents General. I had two years experience as an ComAgent-General in London, and I can inform exhonorable members that the duties of an are very small indeed. So far, there have been no matters necessitating expenditure of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 - or £ 1 5 , 0 0 0, o r £ - ; 0 ° by the Commonwealth. If 2 0 0 this honourable members think that a High the Commissioner will act as an immigration agent, or that the States will lease offices from the Commonwealth, or in other ways havshare the expense of a Commonwealth establishment in London,"" they are making a great mistake. South Australia has already of its own in Bishopsgate-stree{.. near the Bank of England, where she inUntil the Comhas work like that to do, there be practically little employment for But the ' States are not likely, for many years to come, to delegate to the Commonwealth the business I proagainst the proposed expenditure Before makingsuch a proposal, the Government should have submitted to Parliament a scheme for the appointment of a High Commissioner, letting us know what duties he would perform, and what his establishment in London would cost. Our people rely too much on Governments to do things for them; they could do much better for themselves. appointment of commercial agents is,"""" to my mind, a great mistake. None of the commercial agents or Agents-General in London can be pointed to as having, done any great amount of good in introducing Australian products to the notice of English buyers.  Tozer, the Queensland Agent-General ? I understand that he hawks about vegetables, carrying them under his arm, and proclaiming loudly that they were grown on the Darling Downs.",52
408,Sir PHILIP FYSH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"No doubt Sir Horace Tozer supplies reports to his Government, as I supplied reports to the Tasmanian Government, and as Mr Coghlan does to the New South Wales Government, but the only useful work done in London is performed by the Agent-'General of South Australia, who, under an arrangement  Australian stock at a cost of less than £100 per £1,000,000 borrowed, while many of the other States pay £600.",53

It is ridiculous to argue that if we pass this vote we shall not be committed to the expenditure' of ' a very large sum of money. It is impossible that any member of the Committee should' believe that the passing of this vote will corn-mit us to the expenditure of only £ 1 , 0 0 0 . What is proposed is that we should make a contract with the London County Council, and having made the contract we may be quite sure that we sball'be bound' to'erecf'a building that will meet with their approval I con- - and that will have to be a very expensive building. We are being asked by a' spendt h r if t Government to agree; to - this vote ""without sufficient information. It is only today that the memorandum'to which, reference has already been made was placed in the hands of honourable members. It contains a certain amount of information, but honourable members have had no time to inquire into details regarding the proposed vote. . Mr Wilks - The only information afforded by the memorandum is that Captain Collins is unable to conduct a simple negotiation and must leave the matter to a local SL nc li x £&ct*",54
428,Mr LIDDELL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,That is one of the things to which' I particularly object. We have already had examples of the blundering of the present Government.,55
429,Mr THOMAS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I invite the honourable member to name one matter in which the Government have blundered !,55
430,Mr LIDDELL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I can refer the honourable member to the blundering of the Government in connection with the mail subsidy. I would remind the honourable member for Grampians that if a child starts to run before he has become strong enough he will go bandv.,55
431,Mr HANS IRVINE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We must have population.,55
432,Mr LIDDELL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,B e for e we spend this money ?,55
433,Mr HANS IRVINE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We are endeavour to attract population.',55
434,Mr LIDDELL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I shall come to that later on. I confess that I am not a business man, but ' if I were going to buy a property and build a house I should consult a valuator and seewhat he had to say about it . - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member would first of all sit down and count the cost.",55
435,Mr LIDDELL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If I were an honest man I . .should do so, and should know whether I had the money to spend. I should get a valuation of any property that I proposed to buy, but we have no evidence of any valuation of the property which the Government propose to 'buy in London having been obtained other than that of the vendors of the property. We know something of the work of the "" gobetweens "" in connection with the mail contract, and I understand that the architect who it is suggested should be the go-between in this case is a London man, about whom we know nothing, but that it is said he is a servant of the London County Council, from whom we are buying the land. From the expression on the ""face of the Government Whip I assume that the Government have the numbers to carry this proposal. I am very much afraid also that honourable members in the Labour Cornerare going to support it .  should look after himself and not mind honourable members in the Labour Corner.",55
436,Mr LIDDELL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I can tell those honourable members that if they vote for this proposal they will be voting directly against their principles. They never talk of encouraging immigration. The fact is, they do not desire - immigration and are doing their test to keep immigrants out.  ber doing to populate the country ?",55
437,Mr LIDDELL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am doing my best. What I wish to point out is, that one of the main arguments put forward by the Government in favour of the proposal is that the new building will be useful in the way of encouraging immigration to Australia. Further, I have looked at the plan, and I see that Canada proposes tospend £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 on a magnificent building which will take up the whole of the centre of the large crescent, while Australia, which is a greater country thani Canada, and is rapidly out-running the going to Dominion, merely proposes to occupy one of the.small blocks on the corner. That, is an arrangement to which I object. I object to Australia beingovershadowed ii> this way in London. I suppose I knowLondon as well as the honourable member for .Grampians, or, perhaps, any honourable member in the Chamber; and this, is not the site I should have chosen for a building of the character suitable for the Commonwealth. I would not have the Australian buildings overshadowed by the Canadian buildings, or by the Frenchbuildings immediately behind, nor would' I have them situated in the theatre centre. What has France done in connection witln her proposed building? What would any sensible man do who desired to make asuccessful commercial"" speculation of anysuch structure? Surely there would bean endeavour to make the buildings pay for themselves. France, for instance, proposes to have an exhibition surrounded with cafes, cafe chantants, and shops, all with the object ' of assisting the project financially. There is no such proposal' on the part of Australia; we do not seem to have any heads for business. Wepropose to throw' open ' the whole of the front of our building, and there have an exhibition, I suppose, of hogsheads of wine in one window and other produce in another. All the frontage will be thrown open free to the States for this purpose, while the rest of the building, I presume, will be used for Commonwealth offices, and as a residence for the High Commissioner. No rent will be gathered from any source; and this I regard as a foolish business proposal. Then, what guarantee have we that the States will f all into line with the Commonwealth? Is it likely that the States, through their representatives, can be brought side by side without arousing 1 jealousy, or without each endeavouring to advertise itself at the expense of the others ? Sufficient information in regard to the project has not been placed before us; and for that reason, and also because the Commonwealth is faced with very large financial responsibilities, and, as a youngnation, we are not prepared to launch out on buildings in the way proposed, I intend to vote against the item.",55
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Parramatta) [8.38] - In listening to the discussion, I have come to one conclusion, and I should like to know whether it is justified. When the honourable member for Grampians was speaking he was very strong in pointing out that we were not committing ourselves definitely to any building or any complete proposal. Moreover, the honourable member was very emphatic in the statement that whatever was proposed by the Government would be subject to further confirmation by Parliament. That sentiment, I understand, is cheered almost to the echo by Ministers; and, if that be so, can there be anything wrong, I wonder, in making the intention clear in the vote we are asked to pass?",56
439,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,If the honourable member desires me to make the matter clear I can repeat what I have said twice before.,56
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If the underto standing I have indicated is clear in minds of Ministers, the statements which have been made to the House on behalf the Government are altogether misleading. The item reads, "" Towards construction ot explanation a building in the Strand,"" and so on.",56
441,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I gave the reason why the item is worded in that way.,56
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If the' underthis schedule. standing I have indicated is all .the vernment contemplate, the phraseology the item is altogether wrong. I now stand that all the Prime Minister is asking for is authority to negotiate for this site.",56
443,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,That is all .,56
444,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"As the Acting Prime Minister asks for authority to negotiate for this site, it seems to me that the phraseology of the item ought to be altered so as to make it read"" Towards the purchase of a site in the Strand, London, for Commonwealth offices, provided that the terms and conditions of such contract be first submitted to this House.""",56
445,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Hume-Trea surer) [8.41] - I thought I had made the matter quite clear, but, in view of the remarks of several honourable members, and. of what has just been said by the honourable member for Parramatta, there appears to be an erroneous impression in the Committee. Let me again state exactly what the intention of the Government is. Before doing that, however, I desire to show the reason why this item appears in the Works Estimates. An item originally appeared-and , in fact, still appears-in the Estimates-in-Chief in connection with this matter, but I gave instructions for it to be placed in the Works Estimates, as I desired to have the decision of the House regarding it as soon as possible. When the Works Estimates had been laid on the table, and I was going through them, I noticed that the item did not appear, and I asked the officers of the Department the reason. I was told that these were Works' 1 Estimates, whereas the item in the Estimates-in-Chief, as it appears on page 16, is "" Rent, telegrams, stationery, travelling and incidental expenses, £ 3 , 2 0 0 . "" Included in that sum was ,£2,000 .for rent, as the intention of the Government was, if necessary, to rent a certain portion of the land. When I discovered that the item did not appear in the Works Estimates, and that the only means by which it could be inserted was by bringing down a fresh message, I requested the Secretary the Treasury to take the necessary the steps; and the item was submitted as "" Additional Estimates,"" in order that of honourable members might know exactlv what I desired to do. That is the of the appearance of the item in the Works Estimates. I hope it is sufficient to show honourable members exactly how the item comes into I did not consider that I Gohad authority to proceed with the neof gotiations until I had consulted Parliaunderment. Consequently, there have been no negotiations with the London. County cil in the true sense of the term. On Thursare day the second extension of time expires.",56
446,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The Government can get another extension for six months or six years if they like.,57
447,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The honourable member is sarcastic on every question. The London County Council will not in the meantime place the property under offer in the sense of allowing us to ask the lowest rent that they will take. I conceive that the reason is' they do not desire to submit the property at a low rent, which would jure their interests in relation to the mainder of the land.",57
448,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,That is highly probable.,57

As I have said before, the terms as to building are that if the London County Council accept the offer which the Government make, the is required to be paid. subject will be again brought before Parbe liament. The offer will be within a reaexpenses. sonable degree of the amount for which site has been sold to the Victorian GovernGrampians ment.",57

457,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"No ; the perty with which we are concerned is worth more.

458,Mr WILSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The honourable gentleman is building now. He is building castles in the air !,57
459,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I have not incurred any responsibility. Some honourable members advised me to take the responsibility of securing the property, but I would not .do so without consulting Parliament.",57

461,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Mr Bent did, inbut. I felt that I should be acting justly reby honourable members in' consulting them as I have done.

That is the money that will be used, and not the £1,000 now to. voted.

466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Has not the Acting Prime Minister already told us that he cannot get this land and build upon it except the London County Council approves of the plans ?,58
467,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,That is a proper thing to do. The honourable member in New South Wales himself helped to pass a law that no building should be erected in Martin's Place except the Government architect approved of the plans.,58

471,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We shall be committing ourselves.,58

478,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Parramatta) [8.55] - The more one hears of these explanations, the greater the muddle appears to be. Here we are tied up in Committee with an item which is covered by a Governor General's message, and the phraseology of which may not be altered. The phraseology itself is entirely misleading. It does not indicate the object of the vote. On the contrary, there is in it a contradiction of the very object that we are supposed to have in view. I do not know ""why the honourable gentleman should have taken this course when there was a simple one open to him.",58
479,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,What is it?,58

485,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Then it is a It cannot be right to ask the"" Committee to vote a sum for a building when a building I is not in immediate contemplation.' ' In ' order to secure the passing of the proposed vote, the Treasurer tells the Committee that he will not erect any building till he has further consulted the House, when, as a matter of fact, all that is in contemplation is negotiations for a site, with, a distinct understanding that all plans and pro, posals tor dealing further with that site are to be specially submitted to the Parliament. How can it be said that that is' the proper procedure? If the honourable member desired to obtain from the Committee authority to negotiate for the site, why did he not come down with a specific motion, which did not involve the voting of any sum ? Of what use will this £1,000 be? It will be of no service for the purpose of paying the rental of the land. In the original Estimates a sum of £2,000 was provided for rent. The Acting Prime Minister has removed from those Estimates an item of £1,000, and bas submitted a special Estimate in respect thereof. We were told forsooth, that the money was to go towards the construction of a building in the Strand, London. The Acting Prime Minister now tells us that he is not going to put a brick in the building till he has further consulted the House. His phraseology is misleading.",58
486,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I have explained why the proposal was brought forward in this wav.,59
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Quite so, but that is only an argument against the item being included in ordinary - Works :i.nd Buildings Estimates. Why should it not have been treated as a separate item, and brought down in the shape of a motion not - covered by a message from the Governor General, which limits the terminology and therefore cannot.be altered. I am not now permitted in Committee to propose 10 amend the terminology of the proposed vote. All that I can now do is to submit an addendum, since the honourable member intends to press the proposed vote to a division.",59
488,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The lease itself will compel compliance with certain building conditions.,59
489,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"That - is quite clear. The Acting Prime Minister has already told us that one of the stipulations in any contract of the kind is that the building to be erected shall be approved by the architect to the London County Council, and shall be such as in the iudgment of the London County Council will add to the architectural beauty of the Strand. The hon. orable member therefore sets out, knowing full well that in negotiating for a site he has also to negotiate as to the type of building to be erected on that site. It is idle for him to say that he is going to do nothing but negotiate for a site; that he will not put a brick in the building till he has consulted Parliament. It is true that he will consult Parliament, but he will do it in this wav : he will submit to Parliament a type of building which has already been agreed upon between his negotiator in London and the architect' to the London County Council, and it will be for Parliament to accept or reject it. That is what we now understand, and we have been engaged the whole night in endeavouring to arrive at that understanding.",59
490,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I mentioned it at the very outset.,59
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I suggest to the Acting Prime Minister that it would be very much better to withdraw this Estimate altogether, and to come down with a specific motion asking for the authority-and an open authority-of Parliament to negotiate. I do not think we ought to tie his hands, if he is to negotiate, except to the extent of asking him to consult Parliament before he concludes any agreement which will bind the Commonwealth to expenditure in this matter. That is all I propose in movingThat after the word "" offices,"" the words "" provided that, the terms and conditions of any contract be first submitted to Parliament,"" be inserted.",59
492,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Then the honourable member is not prepared to take the assurance of the Acting Prime Minister ?,59
493,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We are not prepared to accept the addendum. The honourable member may take my assurance of that. Mr Bruce SMITH'(Parkes) [9.1] The Acting Prime Minister has very wisely informed us that he is not a lawyer.,59
494,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Neithe r is the honourable member.,59
495,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am sure that no one who has had any experience of his administration, either in the Parliament or out of it, would ever suspect him of any legal learning. The honourable gentleman has over and over again demonstrated to everybody who has heard him that he lacks the first element in the qualifications of a lawyer, and that is logic. He has allowed his temper to get the better of him to-night, and I think he has placed his : Government in a very humiliating position. They are now vacillating between altering their own proposal and submitting to an amendment from the Opposition, which at first they were determined, in most lion-like fashion, to resist. The honourable member has tried to placate the Committee by telling them that this £ 1 , 0 0 0 will be used only for the purpose of purchasing a leasehold site. The item itself has no reference to a leasehold or a freehold, but merely sets forth that £ 1 , 0 0 0 is to be provided as a contribution towards the cost of erecting "" a building."" Every one can see that this is not mere innocence on the part of the honourable member, but a deliberate attempt to conceal the real object of the proposal. The Acting Prime Minister has proposed that the Committee shall vote [£1,000 for a building which cannot possibly be erected until the Commonwealth secures a site. I have no doubt that the honourable gentleman, in failing to credit the Committed with as much acumen as it possesses, imagined that if honourable members were induced to vote £ 1 , 0 0 0 towards the building, they would impliedly authorize him to enter into a very considerable contract, representing a capital value of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , without any further direction from the House. He does riot seem to' display a knowledge of the elements of commerce, when he says that the Committee may rest assured that ""he will do nothing more than make an offer.",59
496,Mr WH IRVINE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,He has not said that. He has said that he will enter into a contract provided that the price does not greatly exceed the price paid by Mr. Bent for the Victorian site.,60
497,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,No ; the honourable member said that he would make an offer. I wish to show that the making of an offer will involve the making of a contract. Mr W . H . IRVINE - He expressly said so.,60
498,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I understood him to say that he would make an offer for the land. In the event of his doing so, it will be open to the London County Council to at once accept it - The lowest estimate of £ 7 , 5 0 0 per annum in respect of ground rental is equal, at 3 per cent., to a capital value of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0. The honourable member does not seem to realise that if he makes this offer, and it is accepted by the London County Council, the Commonwealth will be liable to all the conditions of the Countv Council's leases. He himself told us this afternoon that one of those conditions is that a six-story building shall be erected upon the leasehold, such building to be approved by the Council's architect. That involves us in the value of the building. The Commonwealth's own officer, Colonel Owen, as has been pointed out this afternoon, has estimated that a building of the plainest description, as illustrated in the Argus, will cost £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 . Consequently, this simple vote of £ 1 , 0 0 0 resolves itself into the offer of a rental which represents a capitalized amount of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , and an obligation to spend a further £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 , so that, although the item as submitted to us on the Estimates appears so innocent, it means an obligation of at least £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 on the part of the Commonwealth. If the theory or doctrine of having no more loans is f o l : lowed in the Commonwealth we shall have Lo raise at least four times that amount in order to pay the cost out of revenue.",60
499,Mr HALL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We might reduce the surplus which is at present given to the States.,60
500,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It was announced recently that that surplus has now come down to a little over £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , so that if we spend £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 on a building, taking the middle estimate, and not the highest estimate of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 , we shall have spent more than the £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 the moment we enter upon the contract.",60
501,Mr HALL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We need not spend it all in one year.,60
502,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I know that we need not, but the moment we have committed ourselves to the contract, we shall have to erect a building within five years.",60
503,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I said the full rent was not due for five years. I did not say anything about the building having to be erected in that time.,60
504,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am very glad that the Committee has come round to'the view, as it apparently has, after a great deal of discussion, that the whole matter has been put before it in a very complicated and bungling manner. Whether that was intentional or not, I leave to the conscience of the Acting Prime Minister. But if he is willing that this vote of £ 1 , 0 0 6 shall be taken as a contribution towards the purchase of a site, and that the question of the building shall be submitted to us at a subsequent date-not , as the acting leader of the Opposition said, after a - contract has been entered into,"" simply to submit the plans to us in order to let us see theiri-i it is understood that before a contract for building is entered into, we, as a House representing the people, shall have the right of approving or disapproving of it, there can be no objection. I think, howthat ever, that the Committee are entitled to more. They are entitled to a statement from the Acting Prime Minister as to how far he is prepared to go in making the the item. offer. Why should we ' authorize the Acting Prime Minister",60
505,Mr WH IRVINE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"We cannot take [9.10] the responsibility of that. The responsithe bility must still remain with the GovernParkes, ment.",61
506,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I quite recogdefiance nise the distinction between legislation and administration, but the Acting Prime ister has stated that the prices vary from 13s. to 18s. a foot. He might tell us his first offer is to be.",61
507,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I said twice tounanimity night that it would be the same as Mr. Bent gave.,61
508,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If we underspeech' stand that the honourable gentleman's offer will be the amount which Mr Thomas Bent has given for the land for Vicwhen toria, and no more, then we know the what we are doing. We shall have the satisfaction of knowing that, even if the Commonwealth is committed to the purchase of the lease for a term ninety-nine years, we shall have an opporCommonwealth tunity of expressing our opinion before building is contracted for. Then, if price asked for the building is so high that we do not feel inclined to embark upon contract, it will be open to us to say "" we will not build at that price, and we can dispose of the lease."" We should then only lose the difference, if there is a loss all, between the price we gave for the lease and the price for which we have to sell One of the most important facts omitted from the Ministerial statement was that under the conditions laid down by the ness County Council the lessees are liable to pay all rates and .taxes upon the land. Rates and taxes upon municipal properties in England have actually reached 14s. in the j£ upon the rental. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is confiscamier tion.",61

565,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Dalley) [9.30]' --The honourable member for Gippsland concluded his speech with a statement that we have to be satisfied with the proposal. This afternoon I objected to the word "" party "" being used. During the debate the leader of the Labour Party and the honourable - member for West Sydney, who support the - Government invariably, were the strongest opponents of '.the proposal. The former said that he was'.opposed to it owing to the absence of proper information. Honourable members on this side took up exactly the - same position, but when we speak in that <strain it is called party warfare. I have Taeen - watching the Minister of Trade and Customs very closely of late. I have dis-covered that no man can fight as valiantly as he does, can exhibit such a stiff upper lig as he does, when he knows that the numbers are up. He is a real study in politics. Within the last two months he has developed a new character, and one *which I appreciate. He will not venture upon a fight until he knows that it is safe. As soon as he learns that it is safe we receive from him, not only a defence of a principle, but an attack upon us. He is always very brave when he has the num'bers behind him. If we carry the item, - and it is not party warfare, we shall insult not only ourselves, but the Governorgeneral, who recommends an appropriation of £ 1 , 0 0 0 - Towards construction pf a' building; in the - Strand, London, for'Commonwealth offices. We are now told that we shall be voting not for that proposal, but for something else. If eyer a farce was.played in poli-. deal life it is being played to-night. The leader of the Government, who realizes that it is a mistake, was merely asked by the. acting leader of the Opposition to withdraw the item, and bring down another proposal. Sometimes more courage is shown by a . man in admitting a mistake than in forcing a proposal through a Chamber by mere numbers. Surely it will not be entered upon our records that the members of this Committee voted £1,000 ostensibly for one purpose, but actually for - another purpose ? The Government. have blundered; the Acting Prime Minister has muddled the business. This afternoon I said I was not in a position to say whether this is the best or most suitable site. Honourable members who have been in London declare that it is a very good site. I was not cavilling at that, but at the action of the Acting Prime Minister in saying that he intends to erect a building at a rost of. £60,000, and then telling us that it is to be erected for the purpose of ad- vertising the Commonwealth, and that Canada will have a building, erected at a cost of £400,000, practically nexfdoor to our building. I opposed the item, because it will be simply a waste of money, 'and. what is more, I wanted to know how the Government intended to raise the necessary 1 funds, assuming that this is the best way in which to advertise, the Commonwealth,; Does the honourable member for Gippsland mean to say that every honourable member who .opposes the item does so for party purposes? Even supporters of the Govern- ment .have opposed"" it. The honourable member for West Sydney has told us that he lived in the district for twenty years, and' that a more unsuitable site could not be selected in London. He. is not an opponent of the Government, but. one of its strongest supporters. In my opinion, we could spend money better at the present .time, than in erecting a building such as is proposed. The Minister has had to make several speeches in order to explain his intentions. In the first instance, he gave us practically no. information, merely exhibiting three diagrams, and leaving us trJ choose that which attracted us most. At half past 6 o'clock, the Government would have been defeated if a division had then been taken in regard to the proposal, but now, owing to the information, which has been drawn from the. Minister, the position is different. In the first place, he brought the matter before the Committee merely a compliment, but now he says that he will not do anything definite without the conState, sent of Parliament. The bringing forward of this proposal has been merely an atits tempt to ascertain the feeling of honourable members. The honourable gentleman is glad to have to support the wide-awake Premier of Victoria, who, though less agile, has been able to run rings round building him. Mr Bent, with his eyes open, picked up a site at 13s. 6d. a square foot, and Acting Prime Minister says'that he will keep as close to that figure as he can. earlier in the afternoon, he told us', that Captain Collins could not get what we wanted for less than 18s. a foot. The honourable member for Gippsland talks about party warfare; but he did' not up and defend the Ministry this when the item was in danger. It was only after he had received an assurance from the Whip that the position had been saved, that this courageous friend of the Governnow ment was brave enough to tell the Comshape. mittee, ""You will have to take it. numbers are up."" Why did he not support the proposal earlier?",65
566,Mr WISE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I could not get in a word edgeways earlier in the evening.,66
567,Mr WILKS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The honourable member would not get in himself. In my opinion, ,£60,000 will be wasted if no return gained from its expenditure.' while £250,000 will be properly spent if its penditure produces good results. But the Government has not told us how it is draw his amendment. going to raise the money which will be required, and we have only about £100,000 assurance. to spare for extra expenditure. The Acting Prime Minister says that there is mistake about the message. If so, cannot he withdraw it, and substitute other? He says that he will do nothing until he has submitted his intentions to Parliament, and all the deputy leader the Opposition wishes to do undertaking into words. Mr LIDDELL . (Hunter) [9.40] - I : shall not allow a division to be taken this question until I have entered my test against the. proposed expenditure.

If he does not fulfil . this term of the agreement, he is to be liablethe to forfeit a certain sum. My eyes have been opened in regard to this matter as they But, never were before.

I thought that members of the Labour Party were as strongly opposed to the Inauguration of a loan policy by the Commonwealth, as to anything conbe nected with Commonwealth politics. When this matter was first referred to I thought that it was one of Urgency, and that are Acting Prime Minister had only until next to decide as to this site. I our understood that if it was notdecided to take this land by that time, the opportunity to secure one of the best sites in the bemetropolis of the world would be gone for I have listened attentively to the debate, and on the subject of the value of the proposed site no speech impressed me so much as' that of the honourable member The honourable member declared that he had lived in London twenty years, and when lately revisiting to that city, he found the circumstances conwith the locality of the proposed site had ' remained practically unchanged as to from what they were in his boyhood. He kind further stated that for one person who passes on the side of the thoroughfare on which the proposed site is situated, from the twenty to one hundred pass on the other side. When the time is ripe, I should like to see a great Commonwealth buildI ing erected in London, in which the States Commight each have separate offices, for conwhich they would pay a proportion of by the London I think the building Goshould be one from which we might expect to receive considerable revenue, sufficient in excess of that received from the States to cover the balance payable to the London County Council, and also to provide a sinking fund to meet - the coyt I of the building, so that when the lease We had run out, the money expended by the to Commonwealth would-have been returned. is what, as business people, we should try to do.

If it is made clear, I shall have all the pleasure in the world in withdrawing my amendment. I should like to understand, from the Acting Prime Minister, what he means by making an offer for the site to the London County Council. It is clearly stated in the memorandum circulated amongst honourable members, that the honourable gentleman, when in - London, had an interview with the valuer of the London County Council, and .received information as to the building conditions, terms of lease, &c. As to the building conditions not one word has been vouchsafed by the Acting Prime Minister; and at this moment we are in complete ignorance on the point. Yet we are told that the matter has been made perfectly clear. We must remember that this site is not all that is in question, but that we are practicallv deciding also as to the building. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance for us to know to what building conditions we are likely to commit ourselves in giving this wide power to the. Minister to negotiate. The memorandum goes on to stateThe Council have laid down stringent regulations as to the class of buildings which may be erected in this neighbourhoodWhat are the regulations? They may be stringent or lenient; but we have not been told one word about them. This much, however, is made clear in the memorandumthe intention is to make it architecturally one of the finest parts of the whole of London.",68
576,Mr KING OMALLEY,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"W it h £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 !",68
577,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It is ridiculous ! To erect a building which will assist in making the Strand architecturally one of the finest parts of London means a huge expenditure. I understand all these leases have building covenants attached; and I take it , therefore, that conditions. before any offer will be received by the London County Council, those building conditions will be stipulated. Is that so?",68
578,Sir WILL,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"IAM LYNE - I do not want to fix myself, as itwere, technically, the honourable member may say afterwards that I have not done exactly as I said I would. I shall find out what the building conditions are, very likely tomorrow. At any rate, I shall trv to do so; but they will be ordinary building conditions.",68
579,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Do I understand the Acting Prime Minister to say that, after he has submitted his - offer, which I understand will not be a definite offer",68
580,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Yes , it will .",68
581,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,But it will be subject to the making of a contract?,68
582,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Yes .,68
583,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Then , before the contract is finally decided on and settled, do I understand that the whole matter will be submitted to honourable members ?",68

I do not know that I shall move its confirmation, but it will be laid on the table. However, I am not a schoolboy to be catechized as to whether I shall do this or that.",68
587,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Is it not becoming clear that the honourable member has been playing a trick on honourable members in bringing - down this proposal ?,68
588,Mr GROOM,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,That is not fair.,68
589,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It is not unfair, I think. The Acting Prime Minister said that he Came to us for authority to negotiate, and now he tells us he will make an offer.",68
590,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I said that at the time.,68
591,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"And , further, that the Acting Prime Minister says that he will not consult us as to the terms and",68
592,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I did not say anything of the k in d ; I said I would lay not the terms and conditions on the table of the House.,68
593,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Yes , after the so that contract is settled.",68
594,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I did not sav that.,69
595,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The 'Acting Prime Minister might as well have completed the business without consulting the Parliament at all. I wish honourable members to be very clear that the Acting Prime Minister is going to submit nothing to Parliament until the contract is finally settled.,69
596,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I did not say so.,69
597,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The Acting ' Prime Minister has said so now. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I have not said so.,69
598,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,What does the Acting Prime Minister say he will do?,69
599,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I have nothing further to sav. Mir. JOSEPH COOK - I am.anxious to know the exact position. Very well, my amendment will stand. Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [10.0] A simple business process would be to adjourn the discussion until tomorrow,, the Acting Prime Minister in the meantime to - cable to the London County Council, and get an offer for the land, together with the building conditions. We should then know what we are doing, and not, in the dark, - commit the country to an expenditure of £500,000. There is not the slightest doubt that the purchase of the site involves the erection of a building; and it will be no use later to tell the Government that they have neglected their duty. What would the Government care? They have been told so a hundred times; but with the support they have in the corner they are allpowerful.",69
600,Mr KNOX,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Kooyong) [10.2] - 1 certainly understood on Friday that the desire - of the Acting Prime Minister was to be placed in possession of £1,000 in order to secure the option or right to negotiate for a lease of a site in what I regard as a most - desirable part of London. We have heard all sorts of conflicting statements today, many of which I consider are at entire variance with our estimate of the position on Friday. A few moments ago I understood, the Acting Prime Minister to say that he wanfed this money , more as an expression - of opinion that honourable members are favourable to the erection in London of Commonwealth offices to be known as the Australian Buildings, and to the purchase for that purpose of a site on reasonable terms. I believe that such an option or purchase, if secured, can cause nofinancialloss to the ""Government; but, if. the Acting Prime Minister imagines that I am. prepared to vote for this expenditure, with the prospect of placing in the hands of the Government, responsible or irresponsible as they may re T gard themselves to honourable members, the huge expenditure which has been, mentioned, he is quite mistaken. I should like it to be understood that by this vote to-night we. express our concurrence in the desirability, of securing a domicile for the High Cpmmis^ sioner, who, I hope, will be appointed at no distant - date; but it has not yet been made clear as to how far we are committing outr selves .to the building that may be erected. The acquiring of a leasehold from, the owner, pure and simple, is an operation 1 which will involve very little, if ' any, ex-r pense; but we may be committed to a character of building quite unsuitable for subsequent purchasers.",69
601,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I "" have informed honourable members four times that'. I shall accept no building conditions until honourable members have had an opportunity of considering the matter.",69
602,Mr KNOX,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,But the answers of the Acting Prime Minister to the honourable member for. Parramatta rather stultify his assurances. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE:-Than k you !,69
603,Mr KNOX,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I have risen simply to make it clear that so far as I am personally concerned, the responsibility rests with the Government. I fear that they will not obtain a lease from the London County Council which does not also involve a building contract. Is the Acting Prime Minister prepared to say that he will not enter into any contract if there is a building condition attached to it? That is the whole matter in a nutshell. If we can secure this site at a price somewhat similar to that paid by Mr Bent we need not fear the risk, because if Parliament afterwards decided not to go on with the business it would be possible to sell the lease at a very small loss, if any. But if there is to be a building condition attached to the lease it is quite another matter. If the Acting Prime Minister will tell me that he adheres to the assurance that this vote is intended simply to enable .him to secure a prior right to a building lease, I shall vote for it. Will he give me that assurance?",69
604,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am not going to make any other statement, except that I adhere to what I have said in reply to the honourable member for Grampians and the honourable member for Flinders.. ;",69
605,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,They are not the whole Opposition corner.  not the honourable member put the Government out? .,70
606,Mr TILLEY BROWN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I would do so tomorrow if I could.,70
607,Mr KNOX,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"It is recognised that this should be a non-party question. if there is any matter upon which we can vote without respect of party it is this, in connection with which we simply desire to make a reasonable, rational, and proper bargain.  not have spoken except for the remarks of the honourable member for Indi, who never rises without attacking the members of the party to which I belong. If I entertained the enmity against, any man in this House that the honourable member entertains towards us, I would get out of Parliament quick and lively. The honourable member seems to be unable to speak on any question' without abusing some of us.",70
608,Mr TUDOR,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"He - cannot help it. Mr.'PAGE -- I suppose not. With regard to the ""push"" in the Opposition corner, I am reminded of what was once said by a member of the Queensland Parliament concerning the Defence Forces of that State. He said that the forces consisted of all oflicers and no privates. That is exactly the position of the Opposition corner-the y are all officers. Each member is a leader in himself. The honourable member for Indi has had the assurance to say that, if he could, he would put the Government out tomorrow. If he could put them out, Mr Chairman ! have no .doubt, however, that he would put himself out before he was able to put this Government out. As regards' the acquisition of a site in London for the purpose of advertising the Commonwealth, I venture to say that if one landed at Tilbury and inquired where the offices of the Agents General for the Australian. States were, not one cockney in a dozen would be able to give an answer. To erect a noble building for advertising purposes would, in my opinion, be simply throwing money away. I lived in London for a year or two, and know the site in question as well as I know where this House stands. From a business point of view, it-is undoubtedly one of the best sites that could be secured. The Strand was always one of the principal thoroughfares in London. In fact it is one of the sights of London. As to. there having been no alteration for twenty years, let me say that I do not suppose that there has been any part of Londor* that has been so much improved. Wherethe Law Courts now stand in the Strand,. Temple Bar used to be. There was a narrow street with a church standing in the Surely middle of the road, the Strand running towards the cit-y, to the right of it, and Holywell-street, the book row, to the left. The whole of the buildings in the vicinity have been pulled down, with the exception of the two churches, St. Clement Danes and St.. Mary's in the Strand. They still stand! in the centre. There is now a broad road 1 running right from the Strand to Holborn, and where there used to be a crowd of rookeries running through Longacre, St.. Giles and Seven Dials-simpl y a collection, of narrow lanes-ther e is now a fine broad thoroughfare. . We have beentold that there are no business places in the vicinity of the site in question, but, as a matter of fact, all the principal theatres are quiteclose. On the south side-r-the part of the Strand leading to Charing Cross-are - the offices of the illustrated newspapers, some very fine shops, and the road leading to Waterloo Station. Some' of the oldest businesses in London are to be found there. Only a day or two ago I was looking at the London directory, and found that there are - still some - of the firms that werethere, when- - I was; aboy. I do not cavil at the site, but I fear the conditions. If we are to erect a building costing £250,000 on land of which we have only a ninety-nine years lease, and at the end of that time tBe building, is to become I the property of the .lessors, then, - I-think we might make a better bargain.",70
609,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE," [10.16] - I rise only to deal with the point raised by the honourable member for Kooyong. I wish.the Committee to clearly understand that if. the proposed vote be agreed to, and the Acting Prime Minister enters into a contract with the London'County Council, we shall be committed to a building lease. Mr W. H. IRVINE - There-is no ques- tion about that.",70
610,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"We are told that the building lease contemplated will be a stringent one; that under it the Government will , have to conform to the wishes, not of this Parliament, but of the - London* County Council. Even if the Acting Prime Minister submits the plans to Parliament, we shall not have the determination of the class of building to be erected. That is a question which will be determined by the architect to the London County Council. The building must be of a certain character.",70
611,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,^It must not be unsightly; and no one wants it to be.,71
612,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Quite so. must also be a six-story structure, and such as to commend itself to the architect to the London County Council.",71
613,Mr WATSON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The land is so valuable, that one would not think of erecting on it a building of less than six stories. Post-office Place, Sydney, eight or nine story buildings are being erected.",71
614,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I wish merely to emphasize the point that by agreeing to the proposed vote, we shall bind ourselves to a building lease, and to erect a building, not in accordance with our own designs, but according to plans approved by the London County Council.",71
615,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Buildin g plans of this character have to be approved in almost every part of the civilized world.,71
616,Mr BOWDEN,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I would also remind the Committee that under the agreement made between Mr Bent, on behalf of Victoria, and the London County Council, the plans of the proposed building have to be submitted to the architect to the London County Council within three months, and that within four months from their being approved thb construction of the building must be entered upon.

I presume I need not enter into the question of whether Australia could obtain rifles in drontime of war. The probability is that at of such a time we could not purchase them. anywhere. When arms were wanted during the Boer War firms of great repute refused to sell arms of any description to Great Britain. Mr - PAGE - Who were they?",73
646,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Krup p was one, and it went further than that. At that time Great Eritain was not able to supply arms to and munitions for her own forces. If war were to break out tomorrow we should' probably not be able to purchase arms, and if we were we should have to run the and gauntlet to get them to Australia. Some (honourable members may ask: Why can we mot lay in a stock of rifles in time of peace? It would appear to be feasible to .save this expenditure if that could be done. But if honourable members will recollect for a moment that a rifle costs £ 5 7s., and that to lay in 100,000 rifles would mean, an - expenditure of over £500,000, it must be obvious to them that an alteration in the type of rifle would land' us in the loss of that sum, which would be sufficient to build more than half a dozen rifle factories. A rifle factory does not become so certainly and rapidly obsolete. A large storage of rifles may become obsolete very rapidly. The Committee is asked to vote £32,000, which is approximately one-half of the - cost of a rifle factory. That will provide an up-to-date factory, which will be able to turn out not only rifles, but cadet rifles, bayonets, revolvers, and everything - of that description.",73

664,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,No. My idea is to let a contract for the whole of the plant. I am informed that it will take fifteen or eighteen months to prepare the plant. Next year will be time enough for me to ask honourable members to vote the balance of the money.,74
665,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,It is a ridiculous way of cost in submitting the proposal.,74
666,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I am sure that no honourable member who is finding fault with my method will trouble very much whether the building is to cost £10,000 or £50,000; he will vote the money.",74

670,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,This is not a matter which can be done in a day. The building should be decided upon after the site is chosen.,75
671,Mr CROUCH,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Does this estimate come from Colonel Stanley, late Chief of Ordnance ?",75
672,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I do not think that he would dream of giving an estimate for the details of a rifle factory, because that is the work of specialists. The honourable member for South Sydney inquired about the output of the rifle factory. With an eight hours shift, it would produce fifty rifles a day, and the plant will be equal, working three shifts, to the production of 150 complete rifles a day. I estimate that 15,000 or 16,000 rifles per annum ought to be sufficient for us in time of peace. With a possible daily output of 150 rifles, the factory would give us material help in time of war.",75
673,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,We would make almost as many in one year as we would need.,75
674,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"In view of the expansion of the military rifle clubs and the cadet systems, I hope that for many years we shall be requiring 16,000 rifles a year.",75
675,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Runnin g full time, the factory would turn out 45,000 rifles a vear.",75
676,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Workin g three shifts a dav. it would, approximately.",75
677,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Our forces are supposed to be fairly well armed now.,75
678,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Our supply of up-todate rifles is 55,000. When the vote for this year has been passed, and the order executed, we shall have between 60,000 and 70,000 rifles, and there are 21,000 single loaders in stock. Australia should not be satisfied with about 60,000 rifles. An imported rifle costs £ 5 7s. Allowing for Australian wages and conditions, a rifle should be produced in Australia at a cheaper price than has been paid for the imported one. No community is self-supporting if it simply puts together parts of articles which it imports. So effort has been made to ascertain whether not only the machinery to make the rifles would be complete, but whether Australia at the present time can furnish the steel and the wood. I am pleased to be able to say that there will be no trouble in regard to the wood. The question has been tested, and a statement has been made by the War authorities in England that at least three kinds of Australian wood are satisfactory; and doubtless the number could, be extended. Further investigations are in progress. I cannot speak so definitely as to the steel required; but we all believe that it will not be long before we shall be able to make rifles from steel manufactured in Australia. However, the importation of steel is not quite so important as honourable members might think, because the total value of the, material in a rifle is only about us. 3d. The question of cost in regard to the establishment of a factory is not one that troubles me, because £10,000 or £20,000, more or less, does .not matterwe have to make the rifles here whatever the cost; and they can be made quite as cheaply, in fact, I believe more so. than they can be imported. I shall not deal with the question of the site of the factory at present, but before anv steps are taken honourable members will be consulted. Honourable members will realise how difficult it is, in these times of State jealousy, to steer clear of complications'we would gladly avoid. The factory must be situated in the best place for Australia, irrespective of party obligations or political purposes to be served. Every member, of course, would like to have the factory situated in his own State or electorate.  people of Queensland would say that Lithgow is the best place.",75
679,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The question of site is an important one, and I should like honourable members to consider whether it would not be possible to adopt the procedure followed in Victoria and New South Wales in regard to railway construction, and have a Committee appointed composed of half-adozen men in whom we have perfect confidence.",75
680,Colonel FOXTON,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Are not the Government half-a-dozen men in whom we have perfect confidence?,75
681,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"That may be; but the selection of a site for the factory is a serious matter; and I shall make a statement later on, and take honourable members fully into my confidence. I only mention the matter tentatively at present, and assure honourable members that no steps will be taken without their being informed.  suggest that the site should be?",75

686,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Any course may be adopted that will give the best results. A Minister has power to do much, but the controlling body is Parliament, and I look for the assistance of honourable members. It was the honourable member for Parkes who, I believe, aided in passing the Bill in the New South Wales Parliament appointing a Public Works Committee to assist the Government of that State.",76

690,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Firs t of all, I take it that honourable members are agreed as to the desirability of establishing a. small arms factory; and, whether the cost be £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 does not matter, because the factory has to be established.",76
691,Mr THOMAS,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"If we vote the money, how soon will the Government start operations ?",76

693,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,The honourable member for Barrier was referring to the making of rifles. I should think that a commencement with orders for machinery would be made within a couple of months.,76

700,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Nothin g preserves the harmony of procedure more than to present all proposals in the clearest possible way. But for the explanation I should have thought that the £65,00 0 was for the complete equipment of a small arms factory. I agree entirely with the policy of the Government, because it is high time we had a factory of the kind under Commonwealth supervision and control. The honourable member for Maranoa and others have consistently advocated the establishment of a small arms factory for our own preservation and the protection of the public revenue. We are now told by the Minister of Defence that, by the establishment of a factory, we shall not only get more up-to-date weapons, but will procure them more cheaply than we could import them. My own opinion is that we ought also to manufacture many of our heavier guns at the earliest moment. Credit should be given to those honourable members who earlier in the history of this Parliament persistently advocated the establishment of not only a small arms factory, but other factories for the production of articles necessary to the public welfare. I object to. the Minister's statement that it will be eighteen months before anything is done.",76
701,Mr EWING,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,No ; I said before rifles are made.,76
702,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"I take it that before any rifles are made there will be a roof over the factory, and there should, therefore, have been an estimate submitted of the probable cost of the building.",76
703,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"And the site in view, also.",76
704,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,I do not agree with the honourable member. What we have to consider is whether it is net essential and urgent that there should be a small arms factory established in the Commonwealth. We have had enough of provincial considerapurchased tions as to where public money should expended.,76
705,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,That is not the in question at all.,77
706,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"Honourable members should try to remember that this is an Ausdifficulty tralian Parliament, and that the local manufacture of arms is necessary for the of our rifles. protection of Australia. It is not a question of spending a particular amount money in a particular Commonwealth elecwith torate.",77
707,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,Is that the only consideration that enters into the selection of the site?,77
708,Mr FISHER,AMMUNITION FOR RIFLE,"The selection of site is a purely Executive matter, for which the Government should be called to account by the Opposition if they make an error. I commend the Government for taking the initial step in this matter, and my only complaint is that they have not submitted a complete scheme.",77
