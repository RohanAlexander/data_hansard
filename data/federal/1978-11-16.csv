The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the provision of payments of the Medical Benefits Schedule is an unacceptable endorsement of abortion which has now reached the levels of a national tragedy with at least 60,000 unborn babies being killed in 1977. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will so amend the Medical Benefits Schedule as to preclude the payment of any benefit for abonion. And your pedtioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Aldred, Mr Bourchier, Mr Burns, Mr Fisher, Mr Hunt, Mr Roger Johnston and Mr Lloyd. Petitions received. To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectively showeth: That because this budget will further increase the number of persons unemployed, because it reduces the average worker's spending power by $ 10 per week, because it will reduce the income of pensioners, because it is unfair in placing a greater burden on the poor rather than the rich, and because it is driving this countiy into a depression. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that The Federal Government withdraws this budget and provides Australia, within this vised budget that increases the level of economic activity in Australia, lowers unemployment, removes the burdens placed on the disadvantaged, and revives business and consumer confidence in the future of this potentially great country. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Humphreys, Mr Charles Jones, Mr Kerin more and Mr Stewart Petitions received. Royal Commission on Human Relationships To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of promise Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because the Repon of the Royal Commission on ried Human Relationships and especially its Recommendations(a) Have been widely condemned for its suppon of un-Australian, anti-family, anti-child behaviour and morals such as incest, promiscuity, abortion, pornography, homosexuality, prostitution and brothels, et cetera. (Note: Refer quotations reverse side) (b) Have been strongly criticised by the medical profession PETITIONS for the absence of any medical practitioner on the Commission or on its staff of 31 persons, and for the Commissioners' action in rejecting or ignoring relevant medical evidence. (c) Have been discredited as irresponsible in adopting a new definition of the family, i.e., 'a varying range of people living together in relationships of commitment', which has effectively confused the real meaning and intentions of the Repon where it refers to the 'family'. Therefore the Parliament has a responsibility to the families of Australia not to adopt this controversial Repon and its Recommendations. for abortion through items Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Parliament will: (a) Simply receive the Report and not adopt its Recommendations, (b) Set up a Select Parliamentaiy Committee along the lines of the New Zealand Select Committee to conduct a public inquiry into the ways and means of supporting and strengthening family life and providing adequate protection for children from physical and sexual abuse before as well as after binh in accordance with the UN.O.

That immediate action be taken to provide that all sections of the Australian work force be allowed to retire under a comparable level than that which exists at present. That we protest at the re-introduction of the means test for people over seventy years of age, especially those people who have already been assessed by the Social Security Depanment before being placed on a full age pension. That we protest at the Government's failure to honour their to have pensions adjusted in line with the C.P.I. cost of living adjustments, which is applied to all other sections of the community. That the amounts allowed for earnings by single and marpensioners should be increased to a more comparable level to the high cost of living, before it affects the pensions. That the amount allowable before a pensioner pays income tax which covers all forms of income, including the annual pension, should be increased, as the high cost of living warrants this consideration. And your petitioners as in duty bound will every pray, by Mr Humphreys. Petition received. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we oppose of Kingsford-Smith Airport which entails the building of a new runway as it would have the following detrimental effects. (1) The loss of one mile of waterfront including Lady Robinson's Beach and a huge part of Botany Bay (2) The loss of up to 1,230 houses neighbouring properties (3) The creation of more noise pollution in the area (4) The creation of more traffic congestion on streets leading to and from the airport (S) The forced diversion of Cook's River and further damage to the ecology of the area. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government will not consider satisfying the airport needs of Sydney by extending Kingsford-Smith Airport and that any decisions related thereto are not taken before there is an opportunity for adequate consultation with any community particularly affected. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of we the undersigned fully showeth that: The proposed introduction of a Retail Turnover Tax will1. Impose an intolerable burden on retailers-seriousl y inconvenience shoppers and prove difficult and expensive to administer. 2. Increase the cost to consumers of clothing, food and other goods essential to maintenance of an adequate standard ofliving. 3. Place a disproportionate tax burden on Australians least able to pay. Your petitioners humbly pray that the Members in the House assembled will not introduce indirect tax measures such as a Retail Turnover Tax or the administratively more difficult Value Added Tax as to do so would exacerbate the inequalities in our taxing system. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Aged Persons Accommodation To The Honourable, The Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Assembled. (a) The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:(a) That surveys reveal a substantial percentage of adults over the age of 55 years in the LoftusEngadine-Heathcote and Waterfall areas of the Hughes electorate, are in urgent need of special housing and nursing home accommodation. (b) That many families in the area are experiencing difficulty in the placing of their aged parents in suitable nursing care; many cases having to be placed in care many kilometres from their families and consequently causing great strain on the relatives concerned. (c) That this problem is aggravated by this area's geographical and public transport isolation from the rest of the Sutherland Shire. any expansion of the facilities (d) That Government subsidised nursing homes in other parts of the Hughes and Cook electorate have long waiting-lists and in fact, have closed their lists to further inquirers. and a drop in value of remaining Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will1. Acknowledge that there is a need for the construction of an aged persons complex in this area as already acknowledged by the Federal/State Co-ordinating Committee for Nursing-Home accommodation in NSW. 2.

To prevent the sexual exploitation of children by way of photography for commercial purposes; 2. To penalise parents/guardians who knowingly allow their children to be used in the production of such pornographic or obscene material depicting children; 3. To make specificaUy illegal the importation, publication, distribution and sale of such pornographic child-abuse material in any form whatsoever such as magazines, novels, papers or films; 4.

The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we believe the Federal Government changes to the health insurance system are bureaucratic. The planned abolition of bulk ary burden on the poor and the disadvantaged in our community. The decision to reduce cent to 75 per cent of the scheduled fee is an attack on real wages. Your Peddoners therefore humbly pray that the Government should reverse its decisions on these matters and develop proper consultation with the trade unions and the community. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les MCMahon. Petition received. NA",17
3,Mr BURNS,OLYMPIC GAMES, I give nodce that on the next day of sitdng I shall move: That this House supports the application of the City of Melbourne to the International Olympic Federation 1988 Olympic Games to be held in that city. NA NA,19
4,Mr HOLDING,ABORIGINAL HOUSING,"Has the Minister for Abordying iginal Affairs received complaints from Aborigithink nal housing associations in New South Wales that the construction firm, Stawell Timber tries, knew which housing associations were reprofit ceiving grants this year before the housing sociations themselves knew? Can the Minister explain why the Ngemba Housing Co-operative actively at Brewarrina and the Wytaliba Housing Associfessional ation at Weilmoringle were induced Stawell contracts before they had been informed that their applications for housing funds for 1978-79 had been successful?",19
5,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL HOUSING,"I have not received any represenpens tations from any Aboriginal community in New South Wales concerning the matter the honourthat able gendeman has raised. I do not know whether any such matters have been raised with departmental officers at the area level, but I will check it. With regard to the particular instances to which the honourable gentleman has referred, I will make inquiries within my Department and provide him with an answer. Medibank DRUG CHARGES: AUSTRALIANS NA",19
6,Mr SAINSBURY,OVERSEAS,"Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware of the growing number of Australians currently in gaol overseas on drug charges? Is he satisfied that all possible steps are unjustified, cosdy and artificially being taken to warn Australians going overseas about the dangers of involvement with drugs? billing will place an unnecess the rebate paid from 83 per arrested overseas on drug charges has been a matter of very great concern to the Government for some considerable time. Currently 79 Australians who are in gaol on drug charges in 21 countries are receiving consular assistance from the Department. An aspect of real concern is the mounting evidence of an increasing involvement in hard drugs, particularly heroin, and in trafficking. So far as the warning is concerned, all Australians receiving a passport are given a booklet prepared by the Department which has a prominent section dealing with drugs, with the severity Notice of Motion of penalties, and with the changes that some countries have made in ensuring that those severe penalties are carried out. It seems that we can warn and warn and warn-the media have been particularly helpful in this regard-bu t for the others will disregard those warnings. Two years ago most of those arrested were young Australians on cannabis charges, usually related to small amounts apparently for personal use. But now increasingly arrests involve heroin, and the transition to heroin has brought with it the inevitable tragedies of young Australians overseas from drug overdoses. I do not there is anyone in the House who would disagree with my own feelings on this. One has Indusnothing but contempt for people prepared to by drug trafficking. It is an evil, pernicious asand destructive practice. Unfortunately, it has become only too clear that some Australians are involved in this traffic in a highly proway, and there has been a trend to sign towards more severe penalties",19
7,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OVERSEAS,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I appreciate the thrust of what the Minister is saying, but one of my constituents hapto be one of those charged. Whilst I do not interpret the Minister's statement as meaning he has no concern for them if they are guilty, it could well affect the attitude of the Thai authorities to this particular case. Of course, one of the penalties is death by firing squad. I think it is a bit unfair to the three Australians, in the context of the words now being used, who might think that their fair trial could be prejudiced by these remarks.",19
8,Mr SPEAKER,OVERSEAS,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposidon, by way of a point of order, has made a point. I will not rule that the Minister is not free to speak on the matter, but I am sure that the sensitivity of the Minister will allow him to adjust his answer accordingly.  made, which was made in absolute fairness so far as I am concerned. Nothing I was going on to say would have in any way traversed what I hope will be a fair trial in Thailand. Nevertheless, my remarks must be directed time and again to the increasing concern of the Government and I am sure of the House and the honourable member who took the point of order. The harsh reahty is that almost every day of the week there is someone somewhere being tried in this particular area. My remarks in the past and at the present moment of course are not directed towards prejudging any person who may be facing a trial. I put that to one side but, as it is within my responsibihty, it must be for me to comment generally on the increasing incidence, which is causing a great number of members on both sides of the House as well as the media, who have been very responsible on this matter, a great deal of concern. I was going to indicate that I was not referring specifically to the people who have been charged in Thailand, who have had so much prominence in the media. I want to close by saying that the vast majority of Australians who travel abroad are law abiding citizens, but the point cannot be emphasised enough that Australians visiting or residing in another country are subject to the laws of that country. They cannot look to the Department of Foreign Affairs suddenly to extricate them from difficulties if they set about committing breaches of the law of the country in which they are residing or visiting. Australians do not have any special immunity overseas. They are not operating in a legal vacuum, in other words. So, in a nutshell, the whole question of drug involvement overseas is a matter which the Government does consider very seriously. In answer specifically to the latter part of the question, I beheve we have been giving warning after warning, and I will continue to do so. It is a tragedy that people seem to dismiss those warnings as nothing but mere rhetoric. NA Mr Stewart having addressed a question to the Minister for Primary Industry",20
9,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Order! Before the right honourable gendeman answers that question, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is a fine balance between the responsibihty of a Minister in this House for pubhc affairs and the absence of responsibihty in this House for private affairs. Where that balance is difficult to test and to define, I have permitted questions to be asked, on the basis largely that I have to hear the question before I can rule on it. Once the question has been stated it is in the public arena and therefore it would not be fair to rule a question out of order, thus depriving the Minister of the chance to answer. However, a substantive motion on the subject now raised was moved recentiy. The House dealt with the matter. I am not prepared to allow this type of action to go on, despite the resolution of a substantive motion by the House. Therefore, in pursuance of that ruling, I declare that the question is out of order on two grounds: Firstly, that it contains an innuendo in relation to the right honourable gendeman which can be tested only by substantive motion; and, secondly, that it is repetitive of a matter already determined by the House. The question is out of order. Mr Stewart- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I feel that the Minister's integrity and fitness to be a Minister of the Crown is under question. Therefore, this question is in order because his outside affairs must have some influence on his abihty and his integrity to occupy the position of a Minister of the Crown.",20
10,Mr LUSHER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Mr Speaker, I wish to speak to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Grayndler. He has the opportunity to move a substantive motion if he wants to take up the sort of matter that he is proposing but he cannot do it by way of question. I think that you should uphold the ruling that you have already given, Mr Speaker.",20
11,Mr YOUNG,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order, we find the Parhament in quite aridiculoussitution in that the only way in which the Minister for Primary Industry can be subject to any discussion in this Parhament is by substantive motion. You have ruled, Mr Speaker, that no question can be asked on the subject. That is not in keeping with the conduct of the people who are now in government when they were in opposition. The conduct of the Minister for Primary Industry is of great consequence, specifically to this Parhament and in general to the Austrahan pubhc. It does not seem to us that we can put ourselves in a corner and say that no questions can be asked of the Minister. The censure motion, the substantive motion, was on the Prime Minister, not on the Minister for Primary Industry. It reflected on the conduct of the Minister for Primary Industry. We drew attention to the different levels of action which the Prime Minister has taken with Ministers in the Liberal Party vis-a-vis a Minister from the National Country Party. The question asked this morning was asked directly of the Minister for Primary Industry, and was about whether in fact a statement which he made publicly some time ago is still now operative or whether, to use a Nixonian tone, it is no longer operative. It seems to us that the Opposition should have the opportunity to question these matters in the Parhament.",20
12,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,The Opposition will have an opportunity to question matters in the Parhament if they come within the Standing Orders. The question which is being asked by the honourable member for Grayndler relates to personal matters of the Minister for Primary Industry. The question is out of order.,21
13,Mr HAYDEN,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Mr Speaker, I wish to take a point of order. I argue, however, that the matter that has already been dealt with and concluded in this Parhament is a totaUy different one from that which has been raised this morning. The matter which was dealt with and concluded related to the concern of the Opposition that, consistent with the practice followed by the Prime Minister in other circumstances somewhat similar, the Minister for Primary Industry should be required at least to stand down, or be suspended, because of an investigation of a very serious nature into affairs with which he is associated. It is not only a matter of the pubhc administrative responsibUities of pubhc office; it is also a matter of one's standing and credibUity, while holding that pubhc office, in areas outside that pubhc office. If a person's private behaviour can sully his position in pubhc office, it is totally unacceptable if the behaviour of that person in relation to those private matters is beyond any question or reproach. This Parhament is placed in the invidious position of being constantly distracted by this matter simply because the Minister for Primary Industry is being evasive. The Standing Orders of the House",21
14,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition is arguing the issue beyond his point of order. If he has a point of order to raise, I ask to state it succinctly.",21
15,Mr HAYDEN,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Mr Speaker, my point of order is as follows: As I understand it, you are arguing that this matter has been concluded; I am argution. ing that it has not yet been dealt with properly. We are being prevented from dealing with it properly and I submit that it is an obligation the Parliament to discuss it.",21
16,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Order! The honourable gendeman is arguing the issue. He is not taking a point of order. The point of order is whether or not my ruling, that the question is out of order, is correct. I do not want to hear the honourable gendeman explain what he beheves are the circumstances surrounding the Minister. This is one of the reasons I have ruled the question out of order-becaus e it relates to matters which do not affect the administration of the Minister for which he is responsible to Parhament.",21
17,Mr HAYDEN,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Mr Speaker, are you ruling against my point of order?",21
18,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,I am. NA,21
19,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING," Mr Speaker, I move: That the ruling be dissented from.",21
20,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,The honourable member will need to put it in writing.,21
21,Mr HODGMAN,OBJECTION TO RULING,You cannot take it.,21
22,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,I am about to give it. Mr Haslem-Why do not you deal with substantive matters?,21
23,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,If you behave properly we will.,21
24,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,The Leader of the Opposition has moved a motion in these terms: ' I move: That the ruling be dissented from.' I call the Leader of the Opposition.,21
25,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I have moved dissent from Motion (by Mr Bourchier) proposed: That the quesuon be now put",21
26,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,I will not accept that motion. I call the Leader of the Opposition.,21
27,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, reluctantly, I have moved dissent from your ruling. Motion (by Mr Bourchier) proposed: That the Leader of the Opposition be not further heard.",21
28,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order! The Leader of the Ophim position will resume his seat. I find myself in a most awkward position. It is this: When a motion such as that moved by the honourable member for Bendigo is moved, I have no discretion under the Standing Orders other than to put the quesBut as the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition relates to me, I would not want the matter to be resolved without any discussion. of I therefore ask the honourable member for Bendigo not to proceed with his motion. Mr Bourchier- I withdraw the modon, Mr Speaker.",21
29,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,I call the Leader of the Opposidon.,22
30,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I want to develop the argument that I was seeking to estabhsh earher. You said that it was argument and not acceptable in terms of a point of order. This Parhament cannot function satisfactorily while this matter remains unresolved. I argue that as much as pubhc administration is a responsibihty for which a Minister is answerable in this House in respect ofhis ministerial responsibiUty, also he is answerable in respect of his private conduct to the extent that it could impinge in some way upon that responsibiUty, or upon his stature or credibUity as a Mmister in this House, or upon the standing and respea which should be accorded to this House in the pubUc view. To the extent that his private conduct can impinge upon those things, it must be a matter which can be raised in this Parliament. There is only one way in which this matter can be resolved, that is, to follow the proper procedures which have been foUowed in three previous cases in which Liberal Ministers have been involved in investigations arising from serious allegations about propriety. They were suspended.",22
31,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I ask the honourable gendeman to be relevant to the issue. The issue is his disagreement with my ruling. If the honourable gendeman disagrees with my ruling, he will find the basis for the disagreement in the Standing Orders. I direct him to that purpose.",22
32,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, the Standing Orders refer to a Minister's responsibiUty to answer and be accountable for matters related to his pubUc responsibiUty in this House. I am arguing that pubhc responsibiUty in the circumstances which now present themselves to this House in this matter must be defined broadly and that his private conduct is as much the pubUc responsibiUty of the Minister in terms ofhis answerability to his House as are the relatively narrow matters of public adrninistration as a Minister of the Crown in charge of a department. There can be no confidence in the administration by a Minister of his department and the discharge of his pubhc responsibiUty arising from the conduct of that Department if matters with which he is associated in a private capacity are such as to raise conceivably, not justifiably Ught of subsequent evidence",22
33,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. This debate, as I understand it, is about a motion of dissent by the Leader of the Opposition concerning a ruling that was made by you as to the vehicle by which certain matters can be raised in this Parliament. This debate is not about the veracity of the allegations that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition and others. I put it to you very strongly, Mr Speaker, that any reference in the Leader of the Opposition's speech to the unsubstantiated aUegations which he and his colleagues have continued to make against the Minister for Primary Industry is not relevant to the motion and merely continues the very blameworthy behaviour of which we have accused the Opposition over recent days.",22
34,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The Treasurer's point is correct. The Leader of the Opposition, in moving dissent from my ruling, must confine himself to the reasons for that dissent.",22
35,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Le t me quote this statement which I think is relevant. It states: They seem to have been nin in precisely the same fashion before and after his deathThat is, the death of George Sinclairand for the benefit of the same person really. This is a most serious statement from Mr Finnane in the mquiry that is being conducted in New South Wales.",22
36,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,I wdl not permit- Mr HAYDEN-It raises grave matters which must be considered by this Parliament.,22
37,Mr SINCLAIR,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. I ask the honourable gendeman to withdraw the imputation that is contained in that unbacked, unjustified assertion that he just read into the Hansard. It is an assertion that has no substance in fact. It is an assertion that has been made in cross examination and is in no way justified by the facts.",22
38,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,I ask the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw.,22
39,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I was quoting from an official document.",22
40,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,I ask the honourable gentleman to withdraw.,22
41,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,I withdraw.,22
42,Mr BAUME,OBJECTION TO RULING,Where did you steal it from?,22
43,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,It was given to me by Creighton Walsh. I do not have to steal. I am not in the in charge of any bookkeeping processes,22
44,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I ask honourable members on myrightto remain sUent. I call on the Leader of the Opposidon to remain relevant to the issue.,22
45,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I ask for an offensive comment from the other side to be withdrawn. Somebody interjected: 'Where did you steal document from?' I pointed out that I have no reason to steal. I am not in charge of bookkeepthis ing processes in a private company, as are some people.",23
46,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The honourable moved member will resume his seat. I heard the sentence: 'Where did you steal the document from?'. I do not know who used it. I ask the honourable gendeman who used the term to self withdrawn.,23
47,Mr BAUME,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I withdraw it, Mr Speaker.",23
48,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,The Leader of the Opposition will continue and remain relevant to the matter.,23
49,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,That is a testimonial from Patrick Partners. Could we ask for anything tions. more?,23
50,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The Leader of the Opup to it. position will resume his seat.,23
51,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I believe that that comment ought to be withdrawn.",23
52,Mr KEATING,OBJECTION TO RULING,Enoug h of the mock indignation from the other side of the House. They should and take it for once.,23
53,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order! I call the honourable member for Blaxland to order. I have before me a motion that my ruling be dissented from. The honourable member for Bendigo proposed to move that the Leader of the Opposition be not further heard. I asked the honourable member for Bendigo not to move the motion so that Leader of the Opposition could speak to the motion. If the honourable gendeman speak to the motion but instead argues wider issues, I will be prepared to hear the motion the honourable member for Bendigo.",23
54,Mr HAYDEN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I can terminate this matter in two or three sentences. The propSpeaker. osition simply is that the private conduct of Minister is a matter for this Parliament, especially when it brings into question the priety generally of his standing as a public office bearer. That essentially is what we are arguing from the Opposition side. Finally, while this ter remains unresolved, the Parliament tinue to be distracted towards it. That is unfortunate. We would prefer to handle the matters of substance, but we also have an obligation attend to these very important matters of priety of conduct in public office on the part Ministers. I think it sits uneasily on the shoulders of the Government in view of its record during the 1975 period.",23
55,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING," I second the motion. I will be extremely brief. We on side of the House dissent from your ruling because it seems to us that before any substantive motion can be moved in any way, in addition to the substantive motion that has already been against the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), questions must be asked. Those questions must delve into the statements which the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) himhas made publicly, both inside this Parhament and outside it. The personal integrity of the Minister does affect his public standing, the standing of the Government and the standing of this Parhament, and should be subject to question. I should have thought that the Minister would be more than happy to answer those quesThere is certain ministerial accountability in this Parhament and the Minister ought to face",23
56,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The honourable member will remain relevant to the question.,23
57,Mr YOUNG,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Speaker, I think that you sit ought to allow that course to be followed. You pointed out here once before that we do not follow the Westminster system in every way in terms of the role of the Speaker and that your activities outside the Parliament were not necessarily the course that would be followed by the Speaker at Westminster. It seems to honourable members on this side of the House that, unless we are allowed to follow this course, perhaps the your role will come under a cloud. I cast no further reflection on it, but we do have a course does not to follow in seeking the rolefrom Mr Haslem-You are threatening the Speaker.",23
58,Mr YOUNG,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I am not threatening you Mr This matter does throw up the matter of a the difference between the role of the Speaker at Westminster and the role of the Speaker, as prointerpreted by you, in the Parliament of Australia. If the air is to be cleared on this issue, the Minister for Primary Industry ought to make mathimself available to answer the questions we are will conputting to him.",23
59,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING," I wish to speak very briefly to the promotion moved by the Leader of the Opposition of (Mr Hayden). As I said in raising a point of order, this motion is not about the veracity of the allegations that have been made by the Opposition against the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). This motion is about the forms of this House. This motion is about the vehicle by which certain matters can be dealt with. In no way, Sir, does your ruling prevent the Opposition from raising personal matters on substantive motion. In no way does your ruling, which the Government completely upholds, constitute any kind of cover-up of this matter. In no way does it prevent members of the Opposition from raising under the forms of this House, which have been in existence for a very long period, matters that they may wish to raise. The motion of dissent moved by the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates that the man increasingly has litde respect for this institution. He happens to be the man who last night said to Mr Deputy Speaker in this chamber 'We will do you tomorrow. You can just chew on it overnight'.",23

61,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,The Treasurer will resume his seat. The honourable member for Blaxland will remain seated. I call on the Treasurer to remain relevant to the question.,24
62,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The purpose of this motion is to call in question a procedural ruling by you, Sir. I think it is proper, in responding to that motion, to query why the Opposition calls into question that procedural ruling. The fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition has demonstrated by his attitude to this matter that he little regard for the forms of this House and he has little understanding that the forms of House do not prevent his legitimately raising matters by way of a substantive motion. I think he also demonstrated by his conduct in this matattitude ter that he is becoming increasingly out of touch with some of the people in his own party. I think it is worth quoting the remarks of the New Wales Attorney-General",24
63,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,The Treasurer will not proGovernment ceed with that line. I ask him to remain relevant to the issue.,24
64,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I think it is relevant to the issue that the Leader of the Opposition demonpaign strates by this motion that the Opposition is pared, irrespective of the fact that the forms this House provide a vehicle for raising particuoccasions. lar matters, to use every single opportunity continue what the Government regards as temptible and unsubstantiated attack on the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). The issue in this motion is very clear and simple. Speaker, you have given a ruling; you have said that a certain procedure can be followed by the Opposition. It is open to the Opposition to do so. The Minister for Primary Industry is available to respond to that procedure. It is not a reluctance of the Minister for Primary Industry to respond to matters that we are debating now. We are debating",24
65,Mr KEATING,OBJECTION TO RULING,I raise a point of order. The Treasurer is now arguing the case. The Minister for Primary Industry failed to respond in debate and to answer the charges laid against him in a substantive motion the day before yesterday.,24
66,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,There is no point of order.,24
67,Mr HOWARD,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I simply conclude by saying that in no way does the Government's opposition to this motion represent an unwillingness by the Minister for Primary Industry to respond to these matters. In no way does the Government's opposition to this motion constitute other than the Government's belief that your ruling, Mr Speaker, is thoroughly correct and proper and fully in accordance with the Standing Orders. Motion (by Mr Howard) agreed to: That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the negative. NA NA NA",24
68,Mr RUDDOCK,OF THE SOVIET UNION,"My question, which is on a has substantive matter, is addressed to the Prime that Minister and is subsequent to a number of petthe itions I have presented to the House concerning human rights in the Soviet Union. Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the Government's towards the Soviet Union's attempts to deny the rights and liberties of those of its citizens wishing to exercise the democratic rights of South free expression and peaceful dissent?",24
69,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OF THE SOVIET UNION,"On behalf of the and, on behalf of the overwhelming majority of the people of Australia, I would have beUeved the Foreign Minister has on a number of occasions expressed the view that the camof suppression of Soviet dissidents ought precertainly to be condemned. The Government has of made this view perfectly plain on a number of We strongly condemn the trials of to Soviet human rights defenders such as a conScharansky, Orlov and Ginsburg. We have urged the Soviet Union to implement important principles of human rights embodied in the HelMr sinki Accords, and if that could occur I am quite certain that the thrust for peace throughout the world would be enormously strengthened. I think it is a matter for very great regret that the Government's attitude was not supported by the Victorian Branch of the Austrahan Labor Party at the recent Austrahan Labor Party conference, which rejected a motion condemning the Soviet trials of dissidents. The motion was rejected. The only impUcation from that can be that that conference of the Victorian Labor Party was supporting the actions of the Soviet Union. There were obviously some red faces around, and the Opposition can put whatever complexion it likes on that. But the leaders of this move were three devout defenders of Uberty-Mr Bill Hartley, Mrs Joan Coxsedge and Mr Bert Nolan, the State Secretary of the Seamen's Union of Australia. Mr Molding- Mr Speaker, I raise a point order.",24
70,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OF THE SOVIET UNION,Her e they come the dissidents in; the friends of the Left come into defend Left.,25
71,Mr SPEAKER,OF THE SOVIET UNION,The Prime Minister will sume his seat. I cannot hear the point of order while there is so much noise. I ask the House to come to order.,25
72,Mr HOLDING,OF THE SOVIET UNION,"My point of order is that the question directed to the Prime Minister was quite specific. It asked him about the Government's position inrespectof trials of dissidents within scribed the Soviet Union. It did not ask about the situation in the Labor Party. If the Prime Minister is to make statements about that he has a duty to the House, and to the Parliament to be accurate. What he is saying is not only outside the framegendeman work of the question but also true and grossly inaccurate.",25
73,Mr SPEAKER,OF THE SOVIET UNION,"I overrule the point of order because the question asked caUed for an answer. The answer being given is relevant to the question. As I understand it, it is a comparison between the Government's point of view and other persons' points of view, and that is what the Standing Orders permit.",25
74,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OF THE SOVIET UNION,"It is important that the Government's point of view be reaffirmed, especiaUy since an important section of the Australian Labor Party has taken a contrary point of view, as widely reported in the Press and coming out of the Victorian conference. Those people are-Bi U Hartley, Mrs Joan Coxsedge and Mr Bert Nolan, State Secretary of the Seamen's Union. But the interesting thing is the reason for the rejection of this motion. Mr Nolan said that he preferred to believe the accounts that he heard from feUow unionists in Russia rather than those he had read in the Australian Press. Really, he chooses to beheve what the communists of Russia teU him about these things in preference to what he finds out from other sources. Quite plainly that is a matter of some embarrassment to some members of the Australian Labor Party. A great service would be done if the Leader of the Opposition could dissociate the Federal Labor Party totally from the attitudes of Mr Nolan and from the attitudes of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party because then we would have what we thought we had, that is, a bipartisan policy in relation to these matters. But for the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party to reject that motion condemning Soviet actions against the dissidents in of the Soviet Union on the grounds that these people would prefer to believe what the Soviet Union, what communist Russia itself, said about is, I believe, a totally unreasonable the situation and one that would be widely condemned throughout Australia. It is in fact a perrefect example of socialist realism. It is worth noting, I think, that one recently elected Labor senator has been moved to comment that it appeared that the Labor Party had closet totalitarians in its midst. I am surprised that even a newly elected Labor senator should be so naive, because if Mr Hartley can be deas a closet totalitarian it certainly is the first time he has emerged from the closet to expose himself.",25

76,Mr HAYDEN,COMMISSION DISPUTE,"I ask a question of the Minister for Post and Telecommumcations. Did the Minister recommend to Cabinet the abolition of the position of staff elected commissioner in the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the central issue in what has now become a serious industrial dispute? Does he consider the ABC management's decision to stand down staff was appropriate in the circumstances, given the inevitable results that would follow? Does he agree with the priorities of the ABC General Manager, Mr Talbot Duckmanton, who apparently considers his attendance at a conference of broadcasters on Mauritius to be more important than attempting to mediate in this dispute?",25
77,Mr STALEY,COMMISSION DISPUTE,"The Government decided that the staff elected commissioner position would not be continued and that is clear and plain. A number of matters have been raised by the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission, the most important of which is the question of staff ceilings and their impact upon the ABC. These matters are being looked at sympathetically by the Government. As for the industrial action which is under way, the ABC management is taking those decisions which it must take when faced with the refusal of members of staff to fulfil their normal duties-dutie s which are undertaken under an Act of Parhament. The ABC management, of course, has the full support of government in taking those appropriate actions. NA",26
78,Dr EDWARDS,WAGE AND SALARY INCREASES,Wi U the Prime Minister inform the House whether overseas governments are adopting the same poUcies as Australia towards excessive wage and salary increases?,26
79,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WAGE AND SALARY INCREASES,"To a greater or lesser extent a number of countries adopt the same poUcies. I do not know of any government, of any poltiical complexion, in the Western world that does not place a great deal of importance on moderation in wage demands in maintaining the fight against inflation. Not all ments have had the same degree of success in relation to these matters. I think it is worth noting that at the present time the Labour Government of the United trade Kingdom is putting up a particularly valiant fight to maintain its anti-inflationary stance. It had tangible? sought to negotiate with the trade unions a wage increase through the coming period of not more than S per cent. That failed. Since then the Minister, Mr CaUaghan, and more recendy the matter Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Healey, have had some pretty cogent and relevant things to say on this issue. Mr Healey warned on a telethe vision program that he would either cut pubUc spending, raise taxes or do both if there were pay explosion. The ChanceUor oudined this cumulation tough line he would have to take when he was interviewed on ITV's Weekend World program. He went on to say that if pay setdements were agricultural too high he would have to consider cutting expenditure and increasing taxes, otherwise creases in pay would not only throw people out of work but would generate a price increase which would be damaging to the whole country. He indicated that this was not a threat. he was not prepared tofinanceinflation by printing money. He noted that he did not want to make threats; he was just describing the laws of arithmetic. I think it is a great tragedy that some trade union leaders in this country cannot take heed if not of us then at least of the Labour Parry in the United Kingdom, which has recognised the reaUties in thefightagainst inflation.

If not, wdl he investigate attempts to introduce this practice by his Ministers?",26

82,Mr KATTER,AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES,The Minister for Trade and Resources will recaU statements he made earUer this year to the effect that there were signs of a governwillingness by the European Economic Community to reconsider its attitude to agricultural imports and to the heavy subsidies it pays on agricultural exports. I ask the Minister whether there are any signs in the current multilateral negotiations in Geneva that the attitude of the EEC will be translated into something more,26
83,Mr ANTHONY,AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES,"The operation of the comPrime mon agricultural pohcy of the EEC has been a of great concern to Australia ever since its introduction. It is progressively having a more and more severe impact. The high protection and keeping out of products are leading to greater inefficiency of production. The policy means that a greater subsidies are being paid. It means an acof surplus stocks. It means the dumping of those surplus stocks on third markets round the world, interfering with traditional trade, and of course that is having its impact on Australia. At the MTN round of negointiations held in July I made those points as cogently as I possibly could to the EEC Ministers and I felt that we were making some impact there, with greater recognition of the detrimental He said effect those operations are having. Whilst in Britain following those discussions I also spoke with British Ministers and I was very pleased with the response I got. For the first time they were saying quite openly that there was a need for change in the common agricultural policy. I think that the attitude of the British Government has been highlighted in the last few days by a speech by Prime Minister Callaghan, who openly came out and attacked the common agricultural pohcy, saying that there must be changes in three areas. He said that the EEC's attitude to food imports should be more liberal, that the EEC should make better use of its export subsidies, and that the EEC should reconsider its pohcy of pushing up production and surpluses by annual increases in price supports. These comments by the British Prime Minister are most welcome and I hope that they are being listened to by the member countries of the EEC, because some of them are hell-bent on a course which must ultimately lead to disaster, not only for themselves but also for other countries. As far as Australia is concerned, it will be continuing its fight to get more liberal access to the EEC and we wdl be using our negotiating strength at the MTN to try to do so. NA",26

His Honour said: The deponentThe Ministerdoes not state that he has himself perused the particular documents. He does not specifically state that the minutes record either in full or in summary form the discussions which took place at those meetings or whether they record merely the decisions arrived at. His Honour went on to say that he found the great affidavit completely unsatisfactory. I therefore ask: Why was the claim of Crown privilege made in such an unsatisfactory form?",27

91,Mr NIXON,AIR FARES,"On e of the aspects of the cheap air fare proposals has been, of course, the introduction of a cheap air fare regime not only out of Australia but also into Austraha. One of the strengths of the proposals that I have been putting forward to the various countries involved has been that the proposals have been put on just that basis. What we are seeking to do is to get a cheap air fare regime from approximately 20 countries- I do not want to Ust them again-int o Austraha with the hope that we can encourage a number of tourists to this country. I am deUghted with the way in which the discussions have gone with the Americans this week. When they return to Australia on 4 December I hope that we will be able to conclude negotiations on the cheap air fare package to America that I it proposed to them so that-this takes up pretty much the matter about which Mr Monk was talking-this cheap air fare package will be available to Americans from about 1 February 1979. That is the date for which we are aiming in relation to the introduction of this cheap air fare package. I am hoping that when the American is team returns on 4 December we can wrap that up actions of and be conclusive about it. Of course, included in the honourable member's quesdon is his concern that the Austrahan Government do more to encourage tourists to come to Austraha. I remind him of the specinc increase in the allocations made to the Austrahan Tourist Commission in the Budget which was brought down in August. One of the purposes of those increased allocations was that, in the knowledge that we were seeking a cheap air fare regime to Austraha, the Austrahan Tourist Commission would be better based to explore the matter of the number of tourists who might be encouraged to come here.

Right at that moment, without having listened to the nonsense being spoken by the honourable member and not knowing that he perhad made this challenge, I nonchalantly rose from my seat and walked across to the table to make some notes about a remark which I had heard behind me and which I thought ought to be kept for posterity.

The correct form of that sentence should be: ""The person was a Mr Brian Mahony'. to say: I tabled a telex received from Mr Brian Mahony Secondly, I have been misrepresented by the Sydney Morning Herald this morning in an article which attributed this New South Wales Attorney-General: I take the view there is only one source for that. The is the pubUcation in a recent issue of letin magazine of a letter by the special invesCreighton tigator, Mr M. J. Finnane to me. Mr Walker continues: It must be a source associated with Mr Sinclair. As I have remarked in this House production in the Bulletin is quite obviously not from the original document. The original document is in my possession only. The copy could not have come from the document which is in my possession. Other people have been attributed with being the source of that information. It would seem to me, however, that it is far more Ukely to have come either from the New South Wales Attorney-General, or from Dr George Venturini, or perhaps from Mr Finnane. In any case, I gather that neither the New South Wales Attorney-General nor Mr Finnane claim in any way to have been associated with it. I take point but at the same time. I say that it certainly could not have come from me. The third misrepresentation place and in the other place reference has been made to a number of assertions made in a tranhave script of evidence of proceedings before Mr committee. Finnane and a cross-examination of a Mr Creighton Walsh. Mr Creighton Walsh is a He minor shareholder of A. Walsh Investments Ltd. He is not a director of any of the The assertions made in that cross-examination are not, in my view, in accordance with the facts. I believe that the comment made by Mr Finnane (Mr on 18 October 1978 that in fact he has no conclusions on the matter reflects the present position on those comments. Therefore, any inference that might be drawn from the assertions in that evidence I believe must be seen in thetightof Mr Finnane's that he has reached no conclusions on the evidence bebeen fore him.

I will not take up the time of the House by going into all the details. Suffice to say that at the weekend the following resolution which constitutes the policy of the Victorian platform was carried by a very substantial majority of members at the conference: Delegates voted that 'support for human rights and dignity is a fundamental principle of Labor foreign policy and that the ALP is opposed to all forms of authoritarian and totalitarian Government whether based on the ideologies of the Left or the Right'. In moving that motion the speaker made a very specific reference to the position in the Soviet Union and referred to the Dinzburg trial in particular.

In response to a question which was asked at Question Time and which related to the matter ofhuman rights in Russia and a recent decision of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) challenged me to make a statement dissociating myself from that decision. The impUcation was that if I did not make a statement dissociating myself from that pohcy decision, it would be interpreted as evidence that I was not concerned or was not opposing the onslaught against human rights in Russia. The detaUs of that poUcy decision which was carried at the Victorian Branch of the Labor Party have been outlined by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). I wdl notrepeatthem. They condemn slaught against human rights by any authoritarian and totalitarian government, whether based on the ideology of the Left or the Right. I have gone on pubUc record several times quite recently condemning the onslaught against dissidents in the Union of Soviet SociaUst Repubtics but also pointing out that there are extensive erosions of basic human rights in just about every countiy within our own geopoUtical To be consistent, we would have to raise concern about those matters in specinc terms if we set upon a campaign of condemning other countries inrelationto the abuse of human have no objection to doing that. I will consider that matter further and we will see what we can do to test the Government's genuineness about its relations with countries near us on this matter in the course of the next week.",31

128,Mr SPEAKER,HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SOVIET UNION,"I remind the honourable member for Cook, as I did the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that it is the practice to inform the Speaker beforehand that he wishes to make a personal explanation so that the Speaker may call the honourable gentleman. Does the honourable gendeman claim to have been misrepresented?",31
129,Mr DOBIE,HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SOVIET UNION,"Yes , on the same grounds as my colleague the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Simon) which related to the attendance at the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which is investigating human rights in Russia. As wdl be shown from the document which was incorporated in Hansard, the attendance of all members of that sub-committee is substantial and there is no evidence of any member of that sub-committee regularly being absent. I would also point out in view of this point that the membership of that sub-committee to date has been most bipartisan in its approach to the witnesses who have appeared before it. I would hate to think that matters such as this one would damage the reputation of the sub-committee as it proceeds with its hearings. I also seek your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to point out that the membership of that sub-committee, with the exception of the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), is identical to that of the other subcommittee which has been appointed to investigate issues concerning South Africa. I seek leave to have the attendance list for that subthe oncommittee incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA 12 April 1978-Jacobi, Blewett, Dobie, Simon, Wheeldon. 4 May 1978-Jacobi, Blewett, Dobie, Simon, Wheeldon. 27 September 1978-Dobie, Blewett, Martyr, Simon, region.

132,Mr SPEAKER,SOUTHERN AFRICA,The honourable gendeman may proceed.,32
133,Dr KLUGMAN,SOUTHERN AFRICA,"This question was raised by the honourable member for St. George (Mr Neil). He made generalised allegations that members on this side of the House were not concerned about the question of human rights in the Soviet Union. I will look at the attendance records of the sub-committees which have been incorporated in Hansard on a couple of occasions today, but I would be surprised if they did not show that on numerous occasions, if not on the great majority of occasions, Labor Party members had a great majority as regards attendance on that sub-committee, if indeed they were not the only ones who attended. This would not have happened had the Liberal Party and National Country Party members of that subcommittee attended with the same keenness as members of the Labor Party. Let us be clear about that. Mr Bourchier-Oh !",32

137,Mr BOURCHIER,SOUTHERN AFRICA,I wish to correct comments made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) when he claimed to have been misrepresented. He was wrong.

144,Mr YOUNG,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES," I move: That a joint select committee be established to inquire into and report upon: (1) all aspects of existing electoral laws affecting the Australian Parliament; (2) changes that should be made to existing legislation; (3) the provision of proportionate subsidies by the Australian Government to political panies and candidates in federal elecuon campaigns and the disclosure of the amount and nature of assistance by corporations and individuals to these panies and candidates, and (4) the possibility of establishing fixed election dates subject to a government retaining the confidence of the House of Respresentatives. The Opposition presents to the Parhament today a most reasonable and rational proposition: That a joint select committee be established to inquire into and to report upon the matters listed in the motion I have just moved. This is not the first occasion upon which I have spoken on many of these subjects, especially the funding of pohtical parties and candidates and the disclosure of political donations, and it will not be the last. But in the period since I spoke on this subject there has been some movement by Government members. Private discussions reveal to me that there is a growing number of supporters of the view that these steps that have been taken in so many other countries, are going the to have to be taken in Austraha. The standards set in other countries are standards that are going to have to be set in Austraha. This modon is not put forward as a party polidcal proposition: It is put forward in the manner in which it has been put forward and carried in so many of the democracies-as the motion of a private member. We have previously presented private member's BUls. The Government was reluctant to agree with them. In 1973, 1974 and 1975, the Opposition, the present Government, opposed aU the reform measures presented to the Parliament, using its numbers in the Senate to frustrate the legislation introduced by the then Labor Government. Subsequent upon the Liberal-National Country Party coalition taking over the government of this country at the end of 1975, the Labor Party sought on no less than three occasions, through a private member's Bill and through separate motions in this House, to get some movement going to inquire into the funding of poltiical parties and the electoral laws that govern this country. There has never been a major overview of the electoral laws of Australia. As a result, one tends to believe that people do not take the electoral laws of Australia as seriously as they ought to. Some people do not even know the electoral laws of Australia until they become a candidate or a member of parliament. Some people in the Parliament are not aware of the strange way in which the law moves; are not aware of how the electoral laws of this country affect the electoral responsibUities of candidates and of members and the rights of voters. We ask nothing more than that a parUamentary committee should look at those laws, should see the way in which reform is required to bring about some sense to them, especially those laws which honourable members know are frustrating the proper rights of citizens of this country and are being ignored by those of us who stand as candidates for our respective poltiical parties. I wiU say more on this as I come to each of the sections. The Electoral Act is a most complex document and it has a very interesting history. It covers all the matters affecting the rights of citizens. enormously important document, following upon the Constitution, in seeing that civil liberties are avaUable-for example, therightto elect or not elect a party in this country. Why people have not taken this matter more seriously in the past is beyond me. Already this year a very senior Minister of this Government has been dismissed because of an mquiry in Queensland. The royal commissioner said that the Minister had acted improperly and in contravention of the set down in the Electoral Act. Leaving aside that specific case, it seems to me that we ought to look a Utde more closely at the way in which these laws perhaps could catch us all at some time. Every member of this Parliament knows that if the law were enforced, certainly in respect of the limitation of expenses incurred by candidates, which is covered by a section of this Electoral Act, we could perhaps all be subject to some sort of legal action. I wish to raise just one or two matters that could provoke some thought on the other side of the House about whether or not there should be a committee of this Parhament to look at the Act before I deal in more substance with the question of subsidies paid to poltiical parties. We must look in the first place at the question of electoral commissioners. There has always been in this Parliament, irrespective of who is in government, some question about the third commissioner appointed in each of the States. It seems to me that perhaps there is a mechanism for overcoming those criticisms which arise when the Government of the day takes it upon itself to appoint the third commissioner in each State. As honourable members wdl know, there was a raging controversy over the way in which the redistribution was carried out in Queensland. I raise that matter because two positions of commissioner are laid down in the Act, but the appointment of the third commissioner is still subject to the whims of the Government of the day. The second matter, which again was subject to a great deal of debate prior to the 1977 general election-it resulted from the 1977 redistribution-is the final report of the commissioners. We would all want to continue to have therightto object to thefirstreport of the commissioners. But the final report-the report that is tabled in this Parhament as being the final redistribution upon which we wdl go to the polls-is not subject to objection. Some very major changes were made to it. Boundaries in the inner city area of Sydney were changed radically because of minor objections that were It is an raised with the Commissioners. It seems to honourable members on this side of the House that if the Commissioners were brought to task on the way in which they varied theirfirstreport they would find it very difficult to justify what they had done. If objections can be raised to the first report, why should objections not be raised to the second report before it goes to the Parliament? Nothing is more important than the way in law which these things are done. Nothing could bring the Electoral Act into jeopardy more than the way in which the Commissioners carry out their duties. A simple thing like the right to abolish polling booths also causes problems. We all know that if acdon is taken to aboUsh the smallest polling booth in our electorate all the constituents in that area think that it is the greatest sin ever carried out under the Electoral Act. Perhaps we can have some more permanency about where people go to vote as it seems to be extremely important to the electors. That is something else that could be looked at. Not the least reason for which I raise this matter today is the quesuon that is raised from dme to dme of compulsory enrolment and compulsory voting. Much argument has taken place about who was responsible for the introducuon of compulsory voting. A search of the record shows that in 1924 all the major parties agreed with the introducuon of compulsory voting but no party would introduce it. It became law as a result of a private member's Bill. I suggest that that epitomises the point I am making today. Perhaps the only way in which we can bring about reform in this area is by estabUshing a parliamentary committee so that aU the major parties which make up this Parliament can look at the matter. I will read from a speech that was made a shorttimeago about this subject by the Acting Chief Australian Electoral Officer, Mr White. He said: Until 1911 enrolment on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll was voluntary, although the electoral authorities and political organisadons made every effort to secure the enrolment of qualified persons. However, sory enrolment provisions were embodied in the Commonwealth electoral law for the first ume. The enrolment of persons already enrolled on the Electoral Rolls was unaffected, but the introducuon of these compulsory enrolment provisions necessitated a complete revision of the existing Electoral Rolls and, henceforth, the submission of a claim for enrolment by every qualified person. With the introducuon of compulsory enrolment, the responsibility for enrolment or change of enrolment devolved upon the elector and, from that time forward, every person becoming entitled to enrolment was required to complete an electoral claim and forward it to the Electoral Registrar for the Subdivision. Compulsory voting for Commonwealth elections was introduced in 1924 and became applicable for the first time at the Senate and House of Representatives 14 November 1925. While compulsory voting was apparently favoured by both the Government and the Opposition at the time, no party wished to take the responsibility for its introduction. arrangement, the Bill was introduced as a Private Member's Bill. No Minister in either House spoke on the Bill. One of the most important measures in the Electoral Act of this country was agreed to by the major parties and introduced by a private member. So no Minister spoke upon it. This is indicative of the faa that if a parliamentary committee looked at all these measures and said that we did not need any changes at all no harm would have been done. I suggest that the honourable members who are participating in die new House of Representatives legislation committees will vouch for the value of giving closer scrutiny to legislation that has been brought before this Parliament. No doubt exists in my mind that a joint parUamentary committee looking at the Electoral A a would agree on amendments that should be made to it. Obviously other matters ought to be looked at. An issue arose last year in relation to nominations under section 70 of Part XI of the Electoral Act. Two previous State members of Parliament were elected to this House. I refer to the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). The Act says that a State member cannot be a candidate at a federal election. We have never thoroughly discussed why. The matter affects both sides of this Parliament. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) was also a State member of Parliament. These members resigned their positions to stand as federal candidates. It seems to me to be logical to look at whether that provision is absolutely necessary. Who in this Parliament Ukes the procedures that are followed, particularly in the marginal electorates, for postal voting? Who Ukes to go in that year the compulround the hospitals trying to get the matrons on side with respea to assisting in getting the maximum number of votes out of the private nursing homes, the geriatric wards, the hospitals and so forth? No one likes the system in this respea. The system under the South Australian Electoral Aa has been altered so that the Electoral Office sends its own officers into those places which have a certain number of beds. No one acting on behalf of a pohtical party is allowed by law to visit those places. The South Austrahan Eleaoral Aa used to be the same as the federal Electoral Aa in this respect but it has been changed radically. The names of candidates for the Senate are elections held on placed into groups and those groups of names are put into a barrel which is rolled over and then the group names are picked out one by one, and By that is the way the candidates then appear on the baUot paper. The honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) will sympathise with me when I ask: Why should the Yates and the Youngs of the world always appear last on a House of Representatives ballot paper? The names should be drawn out of a hat and the names should appear on the ballot paper in that order. No one should suffer because his name starts with a letter at the bottom of the alphabet. Obviously it would be common sense to amend the law to see that names are put on the ballot paper in the order in general which they are drawn, as is done in the Senate. Now is the dme for a committee to look very seriously at the introducuon of an optional preferential voting system. It is a system that is looked upon more kindly now than it was years ago. Everyone knows that the part of the Art concerning the limitation of electoral expenses, which I touched on briefly at the commencement of my speech, is a joke. I do not know how many membersfillout the returns required by the Elecreactions toral Act. Section 151 of Part XVI requires form to be returned within eight weeks showing how much has been spent and how it was spent. There are all sorts of laws covering tilings cannot be done. Everybody knows, especially me after having been a campaign director for 11 campaigns, that it is an absolute joke. That part of the Act ought to be looked at seriously. have introduced, both in government and in position, BiUs that would have set a certain ing on expenditure, depending on whether a House of Representatives election, a separate Senate election or a joint election was being held. This would have enabled some common sense to prevaU in regard to the expenditure on elections in this country. I notice that under the part of Act dealing with electoral offences and punishOther ments a person who wagers on an election result is Uable to afineof $100. Many members would be subject to those provisions if close scrutiny were made of their activities. I refer now to the question of the funding poltiical parties, which forms an enormously portant section of the motion that I moved this morning and which I have moved so many times before. I do not believe that members of the Government will take notice of what I say as an individual about this matter but I have very strong feelings about it. I turn again to the most recent, comprehensive and perhaps most relisations, evant report on this subject to overseas. I refer to the report of the Houghton Committee to the British Parliament. I will read a summary of its recommendations. We recommend the introducuon of a system of state cial aid for poltiical parties in the United Kingdom. Such aid should take the form of: (i) annual grants to be paid from Exchequer funds central organisations of the panies for their purposes, the amounts being determined according to the extent ofeach party's electoral suppon; (ii) at local level, a limited reimbursement of the elecuon expenses of Parliamentary and local government candidates. In order to qualify for a grant a party must at the previous election have either. (a) saved the deposits of its candidates in at least six constituencies; or (b) had at least two of its candidates returned as Members; or (c) had one of its candidates returned as a Member, and received as a pany a total of not less than 150,000 votes. Under those recommendations the total cost of state aid to pohtical parties was estimated at £Stg2.25m a year. It is also interesting to note the of the various parties. The Conservaa tive Party as a party said it did not believe in state aid. The Labour Party said that as the parties were indispensable to democracy they which should be assisted, they were finding things difficult and it came down in support of state aid being given to poltiical parties. The Co-operative Party said that it also would support state aid. We The Liberal Party said that previously it had a opview which opposed state aid but now it came ceddown in support of it. The Confederation of British Industry came down reluctantly in favour of a limited form of state aid. The British United Industrialists came down in favour of the present system of private donations. A number of trade unions were opposed to the idea; a number of the major trade unions were in support of the idea. groups throughout England had mixed views on whether state aid should be provided. Let me give the results of a survey throughout England of people representing the various political parties. Of the 91 repUes received from various sections of the Labour Party throughout of the United Kingdom 69 were in favour of state imaid, 10 were opposed to it and 12 were neutral. In spite of the fact that the Conservative Party in its formal submission to the mquiry said that no state aid should be given to poltiical parties, of the 84 repUes received 32 were in favour of state aid 39 were opposed to it and 13 were neutral. Of the 80 repUes received from Liberal Party organ63 were in favour of state aid and 10 be brought down were opposed to it. A survey, commissioned by the Houghton Committee, of the British pubUc without any canvassing at all showed that 45 per cent of those finaninterviewed were opposed to state aid for political parties and that 44 per cent were in favour of it. State aid for poltiical parties is becoming the to the system throughout the Western world. We cangeneral not continuaUy hide our heads in the sand and say that it does not exist or there is no reason for providing state aid. People a lot smarter than us have adopted the system in favour of consolidating the role of pohtical parties, not just at the parUamentary level, not just for the purpose of issuing propaganda and making announcements at election times, but to establish proper research and work in the electorate from the local level right through to the national level that we serve in the Parliament. All we on this side of the House are asking is that a parliamentary committee be established to look at the system. If that committee recommends that nothing should be done, then we can have a look at its report. I assure the House, as I have done so manytimesbefore that on these questions if we form such a committee it will recommend change.",32
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,Mr M ill a rOrder! The honourable member's time has expired. Is there a seconder to the motion?,36
146,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,I second the motion and I reserve my right to reply in order that we can have a vote on this matter.,36
147,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES," I have been trying to work out why the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) has moved this motion. I think he has done so to embarrass his own Leader because the economic and the financial consequences of such a proposal are totally preposterous. The consequences of such a proposal for the nature of the democratic system are even more alarming. It will become obvious as we read the heart of the motion to which the honourable member for Port Adelaide is wedded. Paragraph (3) of the motion reads: The provision of proportionate subsidies by the Australian Government to political parties and candidates in federal election campaigns . . . That is the heart of what the honourable member for Port Adelaide is talking about. Under this motion candidates, members of parUament and poltiical parties are to get into the private purse. Under this proposal they are to plunder the pockets of Australian taxpayers. Our attitude on this side of the House quite overfinances whelmingly would be more in tune with the motion, notice of which I gave in this House on 21 February in which, among other things, I House. said: That this House, believing(1) that any proposal to divert taxadon or loan to fund a polidcal party will eventually lead to a weakening of the vigour and responsibility should reside in freely formed polidcal parties; (2) that public funds should be used for the benefit of the Australian people and not to promote the contest for power by polidcal panies, and (3) that such funding is contrary to the interests of emerging panies and will prolong the power of contrasting polidcal organisadons, That proposed motion opposed the call that such funding should be provided to pohtical parties. The honourable member for Port Adelaide should not pretend that he is merely proposing an objective, academic, dispassionate inquiry by a committee. What he is doing is in line with what was proposed by a former Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitlam, who called over and over again for this kind of subsidy. It is in line with what was proposed by the Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Graham Richardson. He has caUed for it on a number of occasions. It is in Une with what has been proposed, for example, by the Federal Secretary of the Labor Party. So it is not a random proposition that the honourable member for Port Adelaide has thought about and brought into this place. Mr Whitlam, Mr Richardson, Mr Combe and the honourable member for Port Adelaide are in agreement. It is not a random proposition. It is part of a campaign and it ought to be seen as part of a campaign. For example, I quote Mr Combe, the Federal Secretary of the ALP, who on 28 May last year said that the only rational solution is for a system of total state funding as now applies in the United States presidential elections or a system of television and radio time, and so on. AU those people I mentioned have supported that proposition. The honourable member for Port Adelaide has been persuaded to run this campaign because he supports the idea. His own party leaders, organisationally and otherwise, have been persuaded to run it because they support it. I am fascinated that he should take this action because it runs contrary to the principle which was enunciated by his own leader in South Austraha, Premier Dunstan, who was asked to comment on his own slush fund in South Australia. I do not argue the merits of that fund but Mr Dunstan stated: It is totally and completely separate from any Government and, as such, it is not the business of this House. In other words, the funding of parties, condidates and campaigns is not the business of this",36
148,Mr COHEN,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,It should be.,36
149,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,"I am sorry to hear the revenue honourable member for Robertson say that bewhich cause it ought not to be the business of this House. Let me for a few moments deal with the consequences in the event that such a process were introduced in Australia. The consequences would be enormous. The honourable member for Port Adelaide or the honourable member for Robertson could be accosted in a street in a suburb of the electorate by a pensioner who received a payment from the Government, say, an aged pensioner, and he would say: 'Look, I am sorry, you know, we could have paid you an extra dollar a week in pension payment but we have taken that money because I need it to pay for my campaign and my party's poUdcal campaign'. That is a proposidon with which honourable members would be faced.",36
150,Mr YOUNG,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,Why don't they say it in England?,37
151,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,"We are dealing with Australian democracy; we are not dealing with English democracy. I am interested to see the imperialists trying to impose the worse of what they see in other countries. Another consequence if this modon were accepted would be a situadon in which the honourable member for Robertson would say, when he comes across a mother of three or four chUdren in a street: 'We would like to have given you a Uttle more money in fanuiy allowance payment for your chUdren but-and I know that you wiU understand-w e have taken that because I want that money to pay for my political campaign and my party's campaign. You should support it because it wiU go to pay for some of those television operators, radio station broadcasters, and the printers so that can put out the propaganda on my behalf for you. I do not know how you voted, but you will feel happier about this proposition'. I could imagine nothing that would be so designed to destroy any of the responsibUity of the people for their own democratic system. Irrespective of what happens elsewhere, honourable members on the Opposition side must face up to the situation which I have described and which would occur in the streets in their own suburbs or cities. The people will not accept such a proposition and they ought to say so. Therefore, I beheve that the honourable member for Port Adelaide has moved this motion to embarrass his own Leader because his Leader, a friend of mine for many years and a man whom I respect, has been trying to steer a sensible and responsible path for his own party especiaUy in terms of economic affairs. He has been trying to get away from the proposition put by the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr Willis), who sees virtue in having increased taxation because of the virtue of pubhc expenditure. His leader, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), has been trying to avoid those propositions. Now the honourable member puts it on him. I ask the honourable member What is he about; why is he doing it; why should he do it? The honourable member may be given an opportunity to say more a little later. We all know that there has never been a time when there has not been a crisis over pohtical party funds. This crisis ought to be recognised for what it is and for nothing else. It does not invite this absurd kind of proposition. There is an old saying: The pop of the pop gun is the pop of a pop gun; it is not the crisis of doom. I beheve that the honourable member for Port Adelaide has made a serious and very significant error of judgment. Look at the moraUty of the proposition. The Opposition would plunder the pockets of people and ask them to pay direcdy for poltiical campaigns on issues to which they would have been totally and completely opposed for all their working Uves. Consider the morality of that proposition. Honourable members opposite are not going to ask for money to be allocated through the Parliament; they are not going to ask for money from general funds. They have put forward a direct proposition that people be asked to make a subvention for this purpose. I believe it is almost a totally immoral proposition",37
152,Mr COHEN,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,What about the immorality of the they present situation? It is a greater immorality.,37
153,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,"The present situation has a great deal wrong with it but the Opposition would be compounding error upon error and grievous fault upon faults that are nothing like it. I ask the Opposition to consider this matter. The honourable member for Port Adelaide spoke about proportionate funds. The Opposition would ask people to pay out of their own pockets for the campaigns of revolutionary parties which are designed to bring down the very system in which they operate. I am not talking here about the legalrightof such parties to exist. The Opposition would import its own Trojan horse into the Australian democratic system. I would ask the Opposition to reconsider what it is about. Quite frankly, it has made a mistake and it ought to consider that it has made a mistake. I have said that I think the honourable member for Port Adelaide has raised this matter to embarrass his own leader. But I do not suggest that he has done it in order to pose such a threat to democracy. But whether he is doing it knowingly or unknowingly, he is in fact doing it. Consider the Pubhc Service. Can anyone imirreparably. agine anything which is designed more sensiPort tively and quickly to politicise the PubUc Service? It is proposed that the PubUc Service inspect the tactics, the books and the campaigns parties and see what they are about. It is proposed that the Public Service examine whether poltiical parties are running bona campaigns or whether they are running false campaigns; whether they are readyranningcandidates or whether they are rurming dummy didates in order to get funds. The Opposition proposes to put pubUc servants in offices to minister the law. It proposes that pubUc servants administer the proportionate subsidies that would go to poltiical parties in campaigns. The Opposition would completely politicise the Puband Uc Service in a way that has not been contemdemic plated previously in Australia. So I plead the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I Ueve there is the faintest glimmer of understandview. ing coming across his brow now as to what he has been about. I ask the honourable member to consider again what he has done and to consider again the kind of doomsday situation into which he is leading his own party. The United States of America has a system something Uke the proposed system although not quite of the order envisaged by the honourable member. The system distorted the 1976 presiopposed dential campaign enormously. The evidence that during thefirsteight months of operation the Federal Electorate Commission over 17,000 man hours were spent merely on the pubUc financing of the law. At the moment the PubUc Service has staff ceUings, people ance to paying more taxation and loan funds are difficult to raise. Yet the Opposition is asking for revenue for this purpose. The Opposition should consider the pensioner and the mother of the family aUowance and what it proposes to do to them. There are other matters that need to be brought into mind. We are not frozen into our present poltiical system forever. There government and there is an opposition. Other parties have therightto come on to the scene to depart from the scene. This has happened since Federation. However, the Opposition would divert pubUc funds into freezing the present poltiical system.",37

However I will pass on his views and the points he made to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Chaney) for his information. The honourable member, as the House knows, has for the establishment of a committee to a inquire into a number of aspects of electoralMr Kevin Cairns-What about my views? WUl absolutely and you pass them on too?",38
161,Mr STREET,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,"Of course. I shall ensure that the honourable member for Lilley's very constructive contribution in this debate is also passed on to the Minister. The committee proposed by the honourable member for Port Adelaide would be designed to inquire into a number of aspects of the electoral legisladon. On this point I need to point out that the Minister for Administradve Services, who is responsible for the administration of electoral legislation, said in answer to a question on nodce that a review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act is being undertaken at the moment. The Minister said that he could give no indication as to when the results of that review are likely to come forward for his consideration. Clearly, given the scope and importance of the existing legislation, of necessity any review must be a long and painstaking one. In that context, although there have been a number of important amendments to the lawfor example, those relating to compulsory enrolment, preferential voting, proportional Senate representation, and redistribution machinerymany of the existing legislative provisions do not take account of developments and changes that have occurred since the Commonwealth Electoral Act wasfirstdrafted. The advent of television and the increased importance of radio as a significant medium of mass communication are cases in point. Members will be aware, for example, of the Government's desire to overcome difficulties which have arisen in respect of talk-back radio programs. At the same time, it is important to appreciate the very real need to ensure a close link between electoral administrative procedures and the legislative provisions which relate to them. Accordingly, the Government's view is that questions of this nature are more appropriately items for consideration within the Minister's portfolio of responsibUities, and in those circumstances the Government opposes the honourable member's motion.",39
162,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES," I wish to support the motion moved by my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), which seeks the establishment of a joint select committee of the Parliament to examine electoral laws and procedures. I am disappointed that the Government does not want to estabUsh such a committee. I think that everybody in Australia wants to see a more efficient method of conducting elections on the basis of every party wishing to contest the various seats having an equal opportunity to do so. The honourable member said that we ought to be able to improve the laws, and I think that everybody in Australia is convinced that the laws need a lot of improvement. From the point of view of contributions to poltiical parties, everybody would want to know, in terms of open government, that they were voting for people who were not beholden to anybody else. There ought to be open disclosure of the funds given to poltiical parties. From the point of view of democracy, it does us no good if a multinational company subscribes $lm to assist a particular party without that fact being disclosed. Obviously, if that sort of subscription were made there would be some suggestion of a pay-back or payola arrangement. That is not in the interests of democracy, it is not in the interests of pohtical integrity, and it is not in the interests of any candidate carrying the banner for the party. I faU to see why there is any objection to such disclosure. In regard to slush funds, I think it is very important that aU poltiical parties declare here and now the source of their subscriptions. The source of their funds should be made known to the people of Australia. Why are we so secretive about it? We ought to be able to indicate that information clearly to the people, and the parties themselves have a responsibiUty to introduce rules requiring them to disclose to their own members the source of their funds. The Bowen committee is inquiring into members of parUament declaring their pecuniary interests. I think that information ought to be made avaUable to the pubUc, as is the case in Canada. If we are going to have a strong democracy, the people who elect members to Parhament are entided to know aU about those members and the poltiical parties for which they stand, and that includes, particularly, the way in which they are able to get monetary subscriptions, perhaps of substantial amounts. That is done in England; it is done in other countries around the world. Why are we so worried about it? The suggestion that there are some difficulties and that the Government is considering the matter is not good enough. There are many examples throughout the world of what should be done. We could pass laws within a week providing for a strong and effective method ofhaving elections on the basis that poltiical parties could get a subsidy, clear and open and above board, to assist them in the course of the election, and guaranteeing that any subscription would be disclosed and, I suggest, audited by the Auditor-General. That could be done easUy. I want to address my remarks to the fourth aspect of the motion, which I think is very relevant. It refers to the possibility of establishing a fixed election date for Federal elections, subject to the Government having the confidence of the House of Representatives. It is very significant that between 1969 and 1977 we had six elections and this has affected the democratic fabric. People in Australia feel that there is no real strength in a government if it can be brought down by the decision of somebody else. In my view, we cannot have a stable democracy if we are going to have elections as frequently as that. There are three factors which cause instability. Firstly, it is ludicrous that we do not have a stitutional requirement for simultaneous elections. In 1977, 62 per cent of Australians favoured such a proposition. Secondly, there is the sad fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) appears to carry a dissolution in his pocket. His view is that provided the Government retains a lower House majority it will normally be granted a dissolution on request. That is not in accordance with what I would call good constitutional practice. Unjustifiably early elections, that House of Representatives within thefirsttwo and a half years of a parliament, have occurred on only three occasions-in 1955, 1963 and 1977. Elections caused by the loss of a House of Representatives majority occurred in 1929 and 1931, and there have been four double dissolutions. The election held last December was held for reasons which were clear to everyone. The conlong. siderations were purely political. The Fraser Government was worried, there benchers, and so there was an early election because the Prime Minister wanted it. I asked the Prime Minister on 3 November last year when would table a letter of request for a dissolution and the Governor General's letter of acquiescmajority. ence. That has not been done. For thefirsttime, no reasons have been given in this Parliament, to why we had an early dissolution last year. make the point that it was purely to suit Prime Minister, purely for political reasons. correspondence was not tabled. The third factor relates to the Senate itself. The Senate can guarantee that a government will be insecure by refusing Supply. Upon the advent of a Hayden Labor Government in 1980, if a hostile Senate refused Supply it would invite consternation this nation. If that situation arose again it almost be a question of having to call out the Army.",39
163,Mr YATES,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,Why?,40
164,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,"Because we cannot have the elected House of the people dissolved because another House, not elected in accordproposition ance with the mandate, decides that it grant Supply. That situation is not tolerated even in Great Britain, from whence the honourable member comes. I often think, from his approach, that he must have come from the House of Lords, not from the other side. The point I want to make is that if we are going to have a strong democracy we have to overcome the problem. A fixed election date would overcome all three problems. We need stabUity and we must have proper respect for democratic principles. The cardinal principle of our system of government con- ought to be that the government wiU govern for its full term unless it is rejected in the House of Representatives. There have been suggestions in recent years that the Ufe of the House of Representatives could be extended to four years. That is afineproposition, but unless it were a fixed term it would achieve absolutely nothing because of the three factors I mentioned previously, that is, a government seeking an early dissolution it could lose its majority in the House of Representatives, or having Supply rejected in is, elections for the the Senate. We could overcome those problems by guaranteeing the synchronisation of elections. Certainly we could reduce the term of senators to four years and elect all senators at one election. Alternatively, we could have eight-year terms for senators, but in my view that would be far too A four-year parUament is one suggestion, but it would require an alteration of the were jittery back Constitution. The proposition I am now putting forward he would provide a mandatory term unless the Government lost its House of Representatives If that occurred, the Governor General would have a discretion, subject to accepted as principles, to determine whether there should be I an election or whether an alternative govern the ment was possible without an election being That held. That should be the only time when a Governor General has that independent discretion. The proposition would involve some sacrifice on the part of both the Opposition and the Government, to the benefit of the Australian people. It would mean that governments would in be unable to call elections when it most suited would them and that oppositions would be unable to force elections in the Senate. The concept of a fixed term parUament is one which already has a degree of supportrightacross the pohtical spectrum. It has been supported by Senator Missen, Senator Hamer and Senator Chipp. I stress that fact because I do not want to put forward this as being one that is to our advantage. will not The Australian people would be the beneficiaries. There is no reason whyfixedelection dates, such as apply in the United States for Congressional as well as Presidential elections, cannot apply here. Debate interrupted.",40
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,"Mr Armitage)Order! As it is now two hours after thetimefixed for the meeting of the House, the debate on the motion is interrupted. Motion (by Mr Street) agreed to: That the time for discussion of Nonces, General be extended until 12.4S p.m.",41
166,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ELECTORAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES,"I thank the House. In fact, if one looks at the reasons advanced House by the Prime Minister on 27 October of last year as justification for holding of an early election, the inescapable conclusion is that right honourable gentleman should be an ardent supporter of this proposition. He tried at time to draw an analogy with the dissolution 19SS. I had already dealt with that matter in Press statement the previous evening. That Press statement stated: Apart from double dissolutions, dissolutions have granted within two years on only two previous occasions-i 1963, when the Government of the day had a majority one, and in 19SS, ostensibly on the basis of bringing Houses together, but in fact 19SS election was held in December, which clearly any suggestion that it was held to make the elections Houses simultaneous because to achieve that it should been held in May 1936 . . . The fact that the Governor General granted the 19SS election was a perfectly proper example of the paramount principle that Governor General acts on the advice ofhis responsible isters. In seeking an early election, the Prime Minister once more breaching convention. That he did. The Prime Minister's other argumotion. ment was surprising. He said that an election necessary to kill speculation He was the only person who had created that speculation. So, from that point of view, it was case of suicide. His Government likes to mainreason tain a high profile posture on questions of cal processes and humanrights.It does so parSenate ticularly when it talks about foreign affairs. the Government does nothing about the unwant democratic pohtical processes in Austraha or about humanrights.For example, last Thursday the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), in his capacity as Minister representing the Attorney-General, had the following to say and about human rights: The Commonwealth does not have constitutional the area of freedom of speech assembly . . . So it is for each State to pass its own laws either to preserve freedom of speech or freedom of assembly . . . The Commonwealth does not have direct power to overrule laws of that kind. That is quite untrue, quite improper and not in accordance with the law. The Commonwealth does have such power under the external affairs power in the Ught of the International Covenant on CivU and PoUtical Rights. The question of Austraha exhibiting all the poltiical instabUity of a banana repubUc is equally as vital as that of humanrights.In view of the fact that some government members have indicated their support for the proposition offixedelection dates, it is desirable that this matter be considered by a Business, joint committee of this Parliament. It is no answer to say that this matter should be considered by the Constitutional Convention. The Convention does not have an exclusiverightto in this consider constitutional questions. We beheve that the Australian Constitution is the in desperate need of overhaul. We do not see the Constitutional Convention as being an adequate that vehicle by which to achieve the major constiof tutional tasks ahead. It is important that the a national Parhament involve itself in these questions, hopefully in a bipartisan way. No one can contend that the holding of six elections since been 1969 is a satisfactory situation. No one can pren tend that the Australian Constitution is an adof equate vehicle by which to take us to the end of the this century and beyond. A proposition such as for purely political reasons. The negatives that contained in the fourth paragraph of this for both motion offers a solution to three serious and imhave portant constitutional questions. The Austrahan people have demonstrated very clearly that they the are not as negative about constitutional reform Minas is sometimes thought. Important as the simulwill be taneous elections proposal is, it is only one aspect, and not the most important aspect, of this The most important aspect of the motion was is combining stabUity with basic democratic about an election. principles. I shall refer again to the three factors mena tioned earher. I do not try to hide the fact that by of its terms the proposal involves removpohtiing one power only, namely, the power of the to reject or to block Appropriation BUls. YetThis matter was debated at Perth and I do not to canvass those arguments again. However, I make the point that this motion offers a fair quid pro quo for the removal of the powers which the Senate claims. It is our intention to reform the Senate into a genuine House of review not to aboUsh it. The power to reject or block Supply is not consistent with the role of a genuine power in House of review, as well as with normal demoor freedom of cratic principles. The motion involves the recasting of sections any S3 and 57 of the Constitution. No apology is necessary for doing that. Therightof a Prime Minister to seek an early election for reasons of poltiical advantage would be removed. The only circumstance by which an early election could be held would be if the Government lost a vote of confidence in the House of Respresentatives. I want to make it clear that I do not agree with or support the views of Sir John Kerr as expressed in what is known as the Indian Law Institute lecture on similar views expressed by Sir Paul Hasluck, namely, that a Governor General should refuse requests for mid-term dissolution unless the Parliament has become unworkable. I believe that those views are wrong. The Governor General should always act on the advice of his Ministers, provided they enjoy the confidence of the House of Representatives. What I want to do is to prevent Prime Ministers from being able to seek early dissolutions. The synchronisation of elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives is part of this proposal. Half of the Senate would face the electors whenever the House of Representatives was dissolved. That would normally occur every three years. As I have explained, this proposal provides solutions to three important constitutional questions.",41

170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NEGOTIATIONS," Mr Kerin, J.C. Klugman, R. E. Speaker has received letters from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron) and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) proposing that definite matters of pubhc importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by Standing Order 107, Mr Speaker has selected one matter, that is, that proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, namely: The Government's failure to debate the implications of the issues now before the Multilateral Trade Negodations. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",42
171,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NEGOTIATIONS,"At the present time in Geneva the countries which are signatories to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are meeting. They hope to reach an agreement, this dme they say, by the middle of December. The current round of Multilateral Trade Negodadons began in 1973-as far back as that-in Tokyo and are now known as the Tokyo Round. We know that the Minister for Special Trade Representations (Mr Garland) left again to be in Geneva during those negotiations. Prior to his leaving to go to that Geneva conference he was here in Austraha for some time, but during that time he made no effort to debate the issues which, we say, are of fundamental importance to the people of Australia. Indeed, the remarks that he made outside this Parhament about what will be the situation are rather depressing utterances. His remarks are also somewhat significant as to his competency in the matter. For example, on 24 October 1978 I asked him whether, in discussing matters outside Parhament, he had said: We have to relinquish the production of some goods can be more sensibly and more economically produced developing countries. He told me that I should read the words in the context of the complete speech he had made. Two days later, he came into the House and said that he did not use those words at all. Of course, that could have been a mistake on my part but I thought that he would have known when I asked the question whether it was accurate. On 25 October, the Minister, as Minister in charge of the Export Expansion Grants Bill 1978 in the Legislation Committee, got into some difficulties. The right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon) said: This is supposed to be a Committee of the Parliament and MinistersIn that case he was referring to the Minister to whom I am referringwho are representing somebody else must come along with a fair degree of authority . . . The Minister should be in a position to say that so far as he can see there is what is said. That is what the right honourable member for Lowe had said. This is the Minister to whom the Government has entrusted what it claims to be most important negotiations. The appropriateness of the appointment can be looked at from the point of view of the problems that the Minister in question has had over a period of time. People in Australia are well aware of the Minister's behaviour when travelling overseas because of some reports as to what has taken place, whether on trade matters, or related to Florence, or Rome, or his baggage or what he thought of the European Economic Community. The real problem is to indicate clearly what we are about in international trade. The Minister is only a small part of the Government's perpetual motion machine. It is a machine that seems to be cluttering up all the time and making very little progress. The lack of connection between the various small cogs in the Government is clearly illustrated by the Australian Financial Review and the National Times over the past week concerning the attempt by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) to prevent the publication of all the Industries Assistance Commission draft reports until the Multilateral Trade Negotiations are finished. This was apparently done on the basis of a misreading of a request in respect of only one report from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) relating to primage duties. As the National Times observed, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs: . . . appears to have been a complete cipher, signing whatever letters are placed in front of him. which Incompetence is not confined to one or two Minin the isters. On 23 October, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), when speaking about Multilateral Trade Negotiations, said: . . . an agreement will set the pattern for international trade for the next few decades. But . . . the omens for a satisfactory conclusion of the MTN are not all good. He went on to say: It is essential that the MTN succeeds in liberalising trade in all products, not just those of interest to the major industrial countries. Again those remarks were not made in this Parliament. The Prime Minister has not joined in any debate on this subject in the Parliament. In fact there has been no real debate on this matter in the Parliament unless it has been initiated by the Opposition, as it endeavoured to do last May. On 9 May last, as a member of the Opposition, I proposed a matter of public importance concerning the damage that has been caused to substance in Austraha's short term and long term trading interests by the Government's activities. In that debate we highlighted the problems of confrontation with the European Economic Community and how we would not progress simply by trying to bluster our way through what is the Government's view of our position. One could look at statements that have been made since that time. In front of me I have an article from the Australian Financial Review which is dated 12 July 1978 headed 'European Community Lashes Australia on Tariffs'. That is a complete denial of what the Government is putting forward in our approach by confrontations. Austraha wound up bearing the brunt of the criticism at that time. Can we confidently expect that in that climate we will make any progress? Why is it that the matter has never been debated in the Parliament concerning our offers that are being made in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations? Again, adverting to a statement which was made by the Minister for Special Trade Representations, he said: . . . the timetablethat is, the December 1978 timetable for the Multilateral Trade Negotiationsis still achievable because basic agreement seems already reached between the major powers . . . The major stumbling blocks in the negotiations between the major powers . . . are the question of agriculture and the rules covering subsidies and countervailing. The Minister then proceeded to indicate that Australia could accept no multilateral trade negotiation agreement without a concession on agriculture. He launched into a severe criticism of the European Economic Community and the non-tariff barriers in the United States of America and Japan. It is very significant when one looks at his speech that was made on that occasion when he was talking about what he called a 30 per cent tariff reduction. Previously we understood that it was to be a 40 per cent tariff reduction. The Parliament had been told nothing about it. He said: A widespread reduction of industrial tariffsBear in mind that this statement was made outTokyo side the House in the order of the average of 30 per cent seems close. One would have thought that we could be told about it. It is of paramount importance in dealing with this matter concerning manufacturing dustry and its position in this country. liament ought to be able to indicate its views clearly. But we are just drifting along. There does not seem to be any national economic planning. policies We do not understand what sorts of are taking place in the Multilateral Trade NegoThe tiations and it appears that they are heading for faUure. On 9 November last year Sir Eric Wydnham-White, the former Director-General that of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and now adviser to the Canadian delegation the Multilateral Trade Negotiations said in Financial Times in London that the faUure of the Tokyo Round could provoke a worldwide rePress cession comparable with the Great Depression 1929. Sir Eric said that this could lead to the breakdown of the whole system. He also expressed concern at the lack of public interest in the negotiations. Our concern is with the lack of effort on the part of the Government adequately to inform the country and debate the issues in the Parliament. Sir Eric Wyndham-White also made comments of direct relevance to the Fraser Government's obsession with European agricultural poUcies. He said that it was unrealistic to expect the EEC to make major concessions on the operation of its Common Agricultural PoUcy during the Tokyo Round and that such concessions would not be made under negotiating pressure. But he thought that the sheer cost of that policy could well lead to its liberalisation in due course. It is important that I make this point because these comments bear directly on the Government's poUcies. They come from an eminent and experienced adviser to another major agricultural producer. Those of us who attended a luncheon which was given by this Parhament for the President of West Germany heard him clearly indicate that there would be no retraction from the agricultural policy in Europe. He attributed that point of view to the problems of food, war and famine that could obtain if there was no adequate incentive to encourage food production. Here we are beating on the Community's door and threatening to make it change that pohcy. I want to make this point: The Fraser Government has said that it will block the Multilateral Trade Negotiations on agricultural issues with Europe. In our view if that sort of action takes place the Round will certainly faU. The world economy can get into a mess and there could be a depression. The Fraser Government has not thought through the issues and they have not been discussed in this Parliament. Let us look at what representatives of the private sector are insaying. The Confederation of Austrahan IndusThis Partry four weeks ago stated: Manpower planning and policy making involves the application of a comprehensive mix of social and economic designed to achieve the maximum utilisation of a discussions nation's human resources. Prime Minister's approach is one of vested interest, that is, a vested interest in himself. He is prepared toridethe country into the ground on basis. His earUer reputation for strong control of his ministry is not well-founded. There to have been a number of problems that I have the already mentioned. We are getting nowhere from this lack of co-ordination. We read in the that it was in a Tokyo hotel in April that Mr of John Stone changed the Prime Minister's mind about tariffs. Surely we should have been told about that. When we questioned the Prime Minister about what a 40 per cent tariff reduction would mean, he said that it merely means an average of 0.5 per cent a year over eight years. We clearly indicated to him in subsequent questioning what particular tariffs we were talking about. Some of them are as high as 30 per cent or 35 per cent. Could we get an answer on that? No. That is the problem.",43
172,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,NEGOTIATIONS,What are your propositions on tariffs?,45
173,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NEGOTIATIONS,"A question was asked by one of the honourable member's colleagues from Queensland as to how we should be looking at this matter from the point of view of exchange alterations. He asked whether there would be arrangements for Austrahan currency to be better protected instead of having it move offshore to Chicago. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) said 'that is a matter that ought to be kept under continuing consideration, depending on any circumstances that might arise'. We are talking about our exchange rate. People in Chicago will fix it. A question was asked by a league of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) and the Treasurer said that Government is keeping it under review. Of course exchange rate alterations can well tariffs and can be equivalent to them. These are matters in which we want to say: 'Where are you heading? Who is running the are economy? Who is running our trade pohcies? are What are our propositions to GATT?' We are saying that there is no plan. The Government is not prepared to discuss the matter in this Parhanuclear ment and no real discussions are taking place outside, as far as we are concerned. The latest news that we have heard is that the Prime Mimsnatural ter is going to Jamaica again. He wanted to there this year but he is going next year to Mr Manley. We understand that he is still trying to meet the President of the United States America. He wants to participate in the economic summit. I understand that the President of the United States again is not available doubt that the Jamaican conference will take place. What are our propositions for the economic summit talks? What is the plan for the financing of the Common Fund? It was said here that Governments should finance the fund. We then heard the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) say outside the Parliament that it will be financed on a private loan basis. The developing countries want to know whether it will be made on a loan basis on a non-loan basis, because of repayment at fixed interest rates. We cannot get any answers. We have to look at the Government's pohcy and we want to know why it is not discussed in this Parhament. There should be government support for export and other foreign exchange earning activities. The support should include the following: An effective national assessment of the international economy and strategic planning for trade; a review of the operation of traditional forms of trade promotion and assistance in traditional markets, establishing country by country plans and priorities; incentives for export gains and export development to efficient industry by providing assistance in inverse proportion to the scale of other industry assistance; the estabUshment of governmental machinery to facUitate trade with new markets, small markets, other governments and their instrumentalities engaging in trade, in co-operation with, not competing with, and with a view to assisting, private industry. Let us be realistic about what we can do. There colare plenty of avenues for us to open trade negotiations. It cannot be done by confrontation. It the cannot be done in an area where we have no chance of success when we are dealing with the affect European Economic Community. It must be done on the basis, surely, that the people of Australia are entided to know what this Government is putting forward as its propositions. What the tariff reductions that it is offering? What the trade-offs that it is offering? If it is anxious to seU uramum, on what basis would it do so? I read with interest the other day that the Finnish reactor is provided by the Russians who are also providing the enriched fuel. We are entering into arrangements for supplying the ore. These are matters that we would like go to discuss because the Government runs a very meet hybrid arrangement when it comes to foreign policy. The real issue is that there is no coof ordination in the Government and no clear understanding of where we are going. It is for that reason that we are critical of the lack of debut I have no bate in this Parliament.",45

175,Mr ANTHONY,NEGOTIATIONS," I have listened intently to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) addressing himself to the matter of public importance before the House, namely: The Government's failure to debate the implications of the issues now before the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. His address seemed to be a mixture of confusion of allegations about insufficient debate in the House, requests for more information and allegations of Government ineptitude. Certainly there was nothing in his speech about his own Party's pohcies or attitudes. In fact, one could say that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition took the opportunity just to sound off and to say something about international trade. However, I would join with him in one of his remarks and that is that the Multilateral Trade Negotiations are of extreme importance. They are negotiations which commenced with the Tokyo Round Declaration in 1972. It has taken all the time since to get to the critical negotiating position we are in at the moment It was hoped that finality would be reached in July. In Geneva a deadline was set for IS July. Unfortunately, volume of work and the complications of massive negotiations were such that it was possible to complete them. However, progress was made to that stage. At the moment disfides, cussions are taking place in Geneva as to whether another round of concentrated negomum tiations will take place in an attempt to reach finality by 15 December. It is not clear whether these negotiations will take place. Differences of opinion between the United States and the counon tries of the European Economic Commumty, mainly relating to the failure of the United States Congress to pass a waiver on the countervailing duty question have to be resolved. Unless they can be resolved, these negotiations will be poned until sometimenext year. But these negowrong tiations are quite crucial to international trade. We beheve that strenuous efforts must be made by all countries to try to liberalise trade as further boost to stimulating international trade activity, which is desperately needed throughout the world today. This round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations is really the seventh in a huge series of negonotion. tiations since the Second World War. But these negotiations are by far the most significant being cause they cover not only the question of indusapplies trial tariffs but also a wide gambit of subjects lating to international codes, codes of trading behaviour and codes of commerce. They also cover questions of multilateral trade negocountervailing, tiations. In all these areas it takes a lot of cussion and negotiation for countries to be to come to some resolution. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made the allegation that we have treated the House with contempt because we have not given it more information. Let me remind the honourable and member that in 1973, when his Government decided to join in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations, the responsible Minister then, Dr. J. F. Cairns, who was then the Minister for Overseas Trade and Minister for Secondary Industry, did nothing more than put out a Press statement, copy of which I have here. He did not even have the decency to make a statement in the Parhament. There was never any statement made in Parhament. There was never any debate on the matter during Labor'stimein office. Earlier this year, before I went to Geneva in June, I made a comprehensive statement in this House detailing Australia's negotiating attitude, that we enter into the formula approach to the cutting of tariffs based on a 40 per cent across-the-board tariff cut to commence in 1980 and be implemented over a period of eight years. This was in accordance the with the approach that had been taken by most the other countries, with the exception of New not Zealand and South Africa. We took this approach because we wanted to show our bona to show that we were genuine in these negotiations. We also wanted to make the maxiimpact in trying to free international trade in agricultural commodities and to see that certain actions were taken against the behaviour particularly of the EEC, in relation to the subsidy exports and the dumping of those exports on third markets around the world, which is completely disrupting international agricultural trade and having very serious consequences for some of Australia's agricultural trade. So the postDeputy Leader of the Opposition was quite when he made the allegation that we have been deficient. If we have been deficient, I would not like to try to put a description of the honoura able member's Party when it was in government. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked in terms of more debate in Parliament on the negotiations. That is really a rather quaint One has no negotiating position if one starts telhng the pubhc at large of that negotiatposition, if one reveals all one's cards. That to all countries. Massive negotiations are regoing on, on an item-by-item basis, in relation to the codes which I mentioned before, namely, the code on standards, the code on subsidies and the code on government procuredisment, the code on safeguards, the code on cusable toms valuation and the code on licensing measures. All countries have their own points of view and in the course of conferences they reveal what their negotiating stance is. We just cannot negotiate in pubhc. No other country negotiates its position publicly. One states a point of view perhaps one has to backtrack a Uttle from it; but one does not come out and embarrass a set government or those negotiating by stating what one's attitudes are going to be. There are also joint disciplines on commodiNegotiations. ties agreements. Three major commodity agreemember ments are involved-the wheat agreement, meat agreement and the dairy products agreetalk ment. All of these are of vital concern. I never known of any commodity agreement being brought into this House prior to the negotiations taking place and all the facts being laid on table. It just cannot be done. It is naive to that it can be done. Why should Australia do so when no other country does so? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition seems derive some joy from the fact that as yet we have not succeeded in our negotiations with the EEC to try to UberaUse agricultural trade. The able member writes it off as if it does not matter; as if it is of no concern to Australia. Let me the honourable gendeman that we will continue our efforts to try to get some liberalisation agricultural trade within the EEC. This morning, in answer to a question in this House, I menAt tioned the attitude of the British Labour GovernEEC ment about the Common Agricultural PoUcy. Mr CaUaghan, the British Prime Minister, strongly attacked the operations of the Common Agriculation tural Pohcy. Mr CaUaghan said that there should be more imports of food; their regulations should be hberalised; that something ought to be done about their export subsidies; that the European Economic Community should reconsider its price support poUcies. Is the Labor Party taking the attitude that this problem is too hard? Is it just going to run away from it? Is it going to betray all it. the farmers of this country who are being affected by these poUcies overseas? Is this what is saying: That we should just ignore it, not about it, and that it is a difficult problem? assure the Opposition that we have been having negotiations and discussions with the EEC. What was the EEC's counter to that proposition? It was that the proper place to press this question the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. The Government is doing just that in Geneva at moment. Some of the remarks by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about the Minister for Special Trade Representations (Mr Garland) were quite unfair. It was nit picking criticism at its best dismiss it out of hand. This Parliament has been informed. Questions have been asked and out the market place consultations have been taking place with industry. When the Labor Party was in office a special industry consultative group up and that group has been consistently meeting all sections of industry. A very large booklet has just been put out giving aU the information about what is going on in the Multilateral Trade I am happy to send the honourable a copy of it if he likes to be informed. It the is avaUable and my department is avaUable to to him if he wishes. But to talk about the have EEC not being significant! Mr Callaghan mentioned in his speech that export subsidies were costing the EEC £2,000m. Its total agricultural the budget is now $A8,000m-that is, $60 per head think for everybody Uving in the EEC. On top of that there are huge consumer prices, something in the order of two to three times that of the world price at the moment. It is just wrong and it cannot go to on. Even Mr Callaghan said it cannot go on. What are we saying? We are not asking for a honourcomplete reform of the Common Agricultural PoUcy. We recognise that it is an inherent part of assure the whole operation of the EEC. But we do want some modification at the edges, a litde more of access for certain Australian products. I see no reason why they should be completely banned. least we ought to be given some access. The ought to start recognising the deleterious effects of its export subsidy programs. We want an international code that will cope with the situand we are pressing very strenuously for it at the MTN. These are the sorts of things we are doing as a national government with a sense of responsibUity for the people we represent. Those people happen to be Australian farmers. If their situation is well looked after there are repercussions on the rest of the Australian community because they are the biggest purchasing sector of it Let us look at what is happening with some of worry the EEC expon subsidy programs. This year it Let me will be exporting 150,000 tonnes of beef and each of those tonnes of beef wdl be subject to an export subsidy of $1,000. There will be 500,000 tonnes of butter exported for which there will be was at an export subsidy of $2,000 per tonne. Two rnilhon tonnes of skim mUk powder is being the exported with a subsidy of $600 per tonne. Twelve million tonnes of wheat is being exported with an export subsidy of $1,000 a tonne. Three million tonnes of sugar is being exported and it will cost the EEC a total amount of $A800m. Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that and I we do nothing about it. Let me assure him that we will continue our stance in seeing that there in are modifications-and there will be modifications provided there is resolution on the part of the Australian people. The Government is going was to display it even though the Labor Party may want to walk away from it. We will continue to face up to any debates or discussions in this House but it is unreal to imagine that confidential information can be brought forward and revealed in public and to say that that is going to help our negotiating stance. We want to get the best negotiating position for all industriessecondary industry and primary industry-in the course of these negotiations and, at the same time, we want to be a responsible member at these international discussions and see that they succeed. I believe that our performance and record at these negotiations until now confirms what I have been saying.",45
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NEGOTIATIONS," cluded. Order! The discussion is concluded. NA Bill presented by Mr Anthony, and read a time.",48
177,Mr ANTHONY,ATOMIC ENERGY AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of the Bill is to enable the Act to be amended so that a mining authority to be issued under section 41 of the Act for ntining at Ranger affords the persons on whom the authority has been conferred security of tenure similar to that enjoyed by the holders of a rnining lease under laws in force in the Northern Territory and most of the States while, at the same time, ensuring that it is subject to appropriate controls. On 25 August 1977 the Government announced its pohcy to develop the uranium ore deposits in the Ranger project area on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding of October 1975, which provided for mining to be undertaken under the Atomic Energy Act by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, Peko Mines Ltd and the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd as joint venturers. In this regard honourable members will recall that in June this year the Atomic Energy Act was amended to authorise the participation of the Commission in the Ranger project for the purpose of ensuring the supply of uranium. The legally binding agreements to implement the Memorandum of Understanding are now being negotiated to estabUsh the joint venture and thus enable an 'authority' to mine to be issued under section 41 of the Atomic Energy Act. The need for further amendments to the Act has been identified in the course of working out those legally binding agreements. Honourable members will appreciate that laws which normally govern mining operationsfor example, State and Northern Territory mining laws-contai n provisions which provide the holder of a lease with security of tenure and make quite clear the circumstances under which leases may, for example, be cancelled or revoked, assigned or transferred, and the conditions under which leases may be renewed. The Ranger joint venturers have pointed out that section 41 of the Atomic Energy Act, as it presentiy stands, does not provide them with adequate security of tenure. WhUe the Act was designed to allow mining, detailed provisions to cover mining on a commercial basis were never inConsequendy, the Act does not address these issues. Because of the decision to proceed with Ranger under the Act, amendments to deal (No. 2) 1978 with them have now become necessary. Tbis does not indicate, however, that the Government first has in mind using the Act for other mining projects. Second Reading The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said on 25 August 1977 that it should not be thought that the Commonwealth's participation in the Memorandum of Understanding would give Ranger advantage over other mining compames. The Government, of course, also beUeves that the holders of an authority under the Atomic Energy Act should not be disadvantaged in respect of such an important matter as security of tenure in comparison with prospective competitors. In order to take appropriate account of requirements for security of tenure and, in addition, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, the recent agreement with the Northern Land Council in respect of Ranger, and the Memorandum of Understanding, the resulting provisions in this Bill are somewhat involved. Before turning to the detaUed clauses of the Bill it is appropriate to recall some of the provision of the 1975 Memorandum of Understanding, presented to Parhament on 29 October 1975 and incorporated in Hansard on 27 October 1977, which are relevant to the matters covered in this Bill. One provision of the Memorandum requires that the initial authority for rnining should be issued for 21 years; others provide that the Ranger project will be conducted as a commercial venture and continue in force during the economic life of the uranium ore deposits in the area. Another provision of the Memorandum requires that the Commonwealth contribute 72 per cent of the capital cost and be entided to receive 50 per cent of the proceeds of sale; stUl another provision dealt with the circumstances under which the joint venturers would be able to assign their interest to other parties. The Government considers that it would be inappropriate for it to continue to contribute 72 Vi per cent of the capital cost of the Ranger project on a permanent basis, that is, after the initial 21-year rnining period, as might be thought to have been contemplated by the Memorandum. Consequendy all costs of rnining beyond 21 years at Ranger will be shared on a straight 50/50 basis, and provisions to this effect will be incorporated in the legal agreements now being negotiated between the Commonwealth and Peko-EZ. I tum now to the detailed provisions of the Bill. Honourable members will note that the Bill is to commence in two parts. AU except the provisions dealing with renewal-claus e 6-wU l commence on royal assent. It is the Government's intention that clause 6, which deals only with Ranger, will be proclaimed to commence at the same time as the agreements now being negotiated with Peko-EZ are executed. Clause 4 of the Bill makes it clear that an authority issued under section 41 of the Act continues in force for the period for which it was granted unless terminated earUer in accordance with its own provisions, or unless it is revoked under new provisions dealt with in clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill. By way of example, I draw the attention of honourable members to a provision of the proposed authority for Ranger which would lead to its termination if the Government varied a determination as to payments to be made to the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account. This provision is included in detaUs of the proposed authority contained in documents tabled by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) in Parliament on 7 November when he disclosed detaUs of the agreement reached with the Northern Land Council. Clause 5 will introduce two new sections into the Atomic Energy Act, namely, sections 4lA and 41B. The new section 41A will provide the basis on which an authority can be revoked or its conditions varied by the Minister. I draw the attention of honourable members to sub-section (3) of section 41A, which ensures that the Minister cannot revoke an authority upon apphcation unless conditions and restrictions relating to rehabUitation of a mining area have been observed. This is consistent with the obligations the Government has undertaken in its agreement of 3 November with the Northern Land Council in respect of the Ranger project. Sub-section relevant in this regard. If a breach of a condition or restriction in the authority occurs, sub-section (4) of section 4lA will empower the Minister to prohibit or suspend mining operations, as distinct from operations to rehabilitate the rnining area, until the breach is remedied; but the Minister must first give the authority holder proper notice of the breach aUeged and specify action required to be taken by the authority holder as provided in sub-section (5). The new section 41B expressly authorises assignment of an interest in an authority. It provides a proper framework within which assignments may be made and will enable those provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding that provide for assignment to be given effect. Sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 41B will enable a person holding an interest in an authority to assign, with the consent of the Minister, the whole of an interest to a person not having an existing interest in the authority. Sub-sections (3) and (4) are designed to enable interests in an authority to be assigned as between parties engaged in a joint venture, each of which holds an existing interest in an authority. Clause 6 of the Bill wiU introduce into the Act a new section 41C. That section provides for the renewal of an authority granted in relation to the Ranger project area. The initial authority for Ranger is to be issued for 26 years and under that authority mining will cease after a mining period of 21 years unless the authority is earlier renewed or extended. Under sub-section (1) of the proposed new section 41C an appUcation for renewal-onl y one renewal is provided for-mus t be lodged between four and six years before the end of the mining period. Sub-section (2) provides that the existing Northern Land Council agreement must be extended, or a new agreement under section 44 of the Land Rights Act entered into, before the entitlement to a new authority becomes effective. Sub-section (3) requires the relevant Minister to endeavour to obtain an extension to the Northern Land Council agreement or a new agreement with the Northern Land Council, and honourable members will note that he will have a period of three to five years in which to do so. I emphasise that the Bill does not empower the Minister to have resort to arbitration proceedings to secure extension or renewal of the Northern Land Council agreement during the currency of that agreement. The conditions and restrictions of the renewed authority are to be determined under sub-section (4) at thetimeof the renewal. I have explained the provisions of the Bill at (8) is some length in view of their complicated character and in view of the relevance of other legislation and agreements relating to the Ranger project. Honourable members will recognise the care the Government has taken to ensure, by this Bill, that rnining at Ranger is able to be undertaken on a commercial basis and consistent with the Government's policy as is reflected in the agreement so recently entered into with the Northern Land Council. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Keating) adjourned. QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED (LOAN GUARANTEE) AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",48
178,Mr NIXON,ATOMIC ENERGY AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Act 1978. The Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Act 1978 was enacted to authorise the Treasurer, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to guarantee overseas borrowings by Qantas Airways the extent of $US80m or its equivalent to finance the purchase of two Boeing 747 series aircraft. Heavier Qantas sought the Treasurer's guarantee for a borrowing of $US80m under the provisions of the Act. Negodations for a proposed borrowing were not sufficiently advanced, however, for Qantas to be enabled tofinalisethe borrowing before taking delivery of the aircraft. Qantas had funds earmarked for other purposes, but which were temporarily avaUable, to make the payments owing on the aircraft in anticipation of these funds being recouped in due course from the proceeds of the $US80m loan for which a guarantee was being sought. Doubt has arisen as to whether section 4 (1) (a) of the Act as originally drafted provides for the giving of the guarantee in the circumstances oudined above. The amendment to the original Act provided for in this Bill is intended to put the question beyond doubt. Qantas has very heavy financial commitments to meet before the end of 1978 and is relying on the loan proceeds. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on modon by Mr Morris) adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time. Second Reading",50
179,Mr FIFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1978 now before the House proposes amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The Bill, which contains 16 schedules, is necessary to enact tariff changes made since May 1978. All the changes were incorporated in Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 13-29 (1978) which have been introduced into the Parliament at different times since May 1978. In the main, the amendments give effect to decisions by the Government in respect of the following reports by the Industries Assistance Commission and the Temporary AsSecond Reading sistance Authority: Ball and Roller Bearings; Bench or Pedestal Drilling Machines, Belt Driven, Pulley Operated (Non-Power Fed)-Interi m Report; Brassieres-Rat e or Rates of Duty Outside Quota; Brooms and Brushes; Carbon Coated Film; Carpets, Carpeting etcetera; Domestic Refrigerating Appliances etcetera; Gearboxes, Gears and Shaft Couplings; Hoists, Pulley Tackle and Winches (Interim Report); Hosiery, Undergarments and Knitted Sleep-Wear-Sho n Ltd to Term Additional Assistance; Insulators; Light Commercial and Four-Wheel Drive Vehicles and Commercial Vehicles and Components; Metal Working Machine Tools; Orange Juice; Products of the Printing Industry; Starting, Regulating and Control Apparatus and Other terms of a Electrical Equipment, and Vices. The Bill also contains increases in Customs duties on beer, spirits and manufactured tobacco products which formed part of the Government's Budgetary program. Honourable members will recall that when the tariff proposals were introduced into the House a comprehensive summary in respect of each of the proposals was circulated which set out the nature of the changes. I have had a consolidation of those summaries prepared, and copies may be obtained from the Table Office. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned.

180,Mr FIFE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Income Tax (Non-Resident Companies) Bill, the Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Amendment Bill and the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of each of these Bills to be discussed in this debate.",51
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Is it country. the wish of the House to have a general debate covering each of these matters? There being objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",51
182,Mr WILLIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The now before the House form a part of a continuZealand, ing campaign to protect the revenue against the marauding activities of tax avoiders, a campaign which the Opposition supports but beUeves must be made much more effective than is currently the case. The BUls also seek to plug a blatant tax loophole regarding the repatriation foreign companies operating in Australia as branches of their parent company; to protect the revenue against a recent court decision which threatens to reduce tax revenue gready unless counteraction is taken; and they implement the concession on capital investment in Australian film rights to encourage investment by AusAustralian traUans in the production of AustraUanfilms.We of the Opposition support all of these measures although we consider the rate of tax that has been set for the branch profits tax to be lower than appropriate, and I will say more about that later. The major detaU in these BUls relates to amendments to the current income tax law rethe garding current year losses and dividend stripdisaggregate ping. It is pointless for me to discuss these in detaU as they are extraordinarily complex and in any case the Opposition does not oppose them. is more important to note that the amendments are now to be subject to some cal amendments in the Committee stage as the Government tries to block off all the possible means by which the new provisions could be subject to further avoidance. The result is an almost bewUdering array of technical jargon which is utterly incomprehensible to all versed tax lawyers, consultants and the officers of the Taxation Office, one presumes. This is a very important matter to which I wiU return later. The imposition of a branch profits tax is welcomed by the Opposition. It is indeed scandalous that a company such as Utah Development Company could announce a dividend of $ 141m for 1977 and not pay any withholding tax on it at aU because it operated in Australia as a branch of its parent company. This was possible because the current tax system discriminates in favour of foreign companies which conduct their operations in the form of an Australian branch of the parent company as against a subsidiary company which is incorporated in Australia. Subsidiaries pay company tax at 46 per cent on their Australian taxable income plus dividend withholding tax on dividends remitted to their home The basic rate of dividend withholding tax is 30 per cent, but this is reduced to 15 per no cent where the shareholder is resident in a country with which Australia has a double taxation agreement such as the United Kingdom, BUls United States of America, Canada, New Japan and Singapore. Branches are, for tax purposes, resident in another country. They are still liable for 46 per cent Australian company tax but remittances of branch profits to head offices do not attract additional Australian tax. This legislation is aimed at correcting the imof profits by balance that thereby exists. The reason for a branch profits tax rather than a dividend withholding tax is that it is impracticable to impose a tax on the remittances of branch profits. Subsidiaries must, by law, lodge audited statutory accounts in respect of their operations. It is therefore easy to determine their profit distribution. On the other hand, branches are not obUged to lodge statutory accounts regarding their Australian operations. They have to lodge only the accounts which they lodge in their home country. These accounts may contain detaUs of the operations in several countries and are not necessarily broken up to give detaUs of operations in individual countries. In case of branches it is also very difficult to their cash flow. There may be subany stantial cash flows throughout the year which can involve, as well as profits, loan repayments, It purchases, management charges or other cash transfers. Profit remittances therefore cannot be 44 further technireadUy identified. The basic reason then for the different taxing arrangement is the difficulty involved in determining the profit distribution of branches. Because of this difficulty other countries, such as but well New Zealand, Canada and France, have introduced a branch profits tax on branches operating in their country, and it is therefore not trendsetting for Australia to be taking this acdon. We are doing only what other countries have already seenfitto do. The only practical alternative would be not to tax the profit remittances of branches at all. To aUow the continued tax-free repatriation of mammoth profits such as those of Utah would, in our view, be a scandalous dereUction of duty by the Government. It is bad enough that there is no resource tax applying to companies like Utah, let alone no tax on the profit repatriations. Some other overseas companies will be affected by this new tax. Compames such as Esso Exploration and Production, American Metals and the General Motors Acceptance Corporation are three which have been drawn to my attention. During the Committee stage we will argue that the rate of tax on branches should have been 8 per cent instead of 5 per cent. But I will leave that argument for that later stage in the debate. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3) has become necessary through a decision of the Victorian Supreme Court which, according to the Treasurer (Mr Howard), has placed revenue for the current year at risk to the extent of up to $600m. Hence he has had to introduce legislation to prevent that potential considerable loss of revenue. The matter concerns section S1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act regarding losses and outgoings incurred in gaining or producing assessable income being aUowable as a tax deduction. The section makes no statement in regard to when employers may claim such UabiUties as a tax deduction. The particular case before the Supreme Court involved a company known as NUsen Development Laboratories Pty Ltd and concerned long service leave and annual leave. The Commissioner of Taxation up until this time has only allowed such outgoings by employers when payment was made rather than while the habiUty for that leave was being incurred or accrued by the employer. The NUsen case upset this by aUowing employers to claim a deduction for the cost of the employee's leave in the year in which he became entided to the leave. In some ways this seems to us quite reasonable. It is accepted accounting practice for an employer to make provision for employee leave habitity, and to aUow the tax deduction at the time when provision is made would seem to be in conformity with that general accounting principle. The Commissioner of Taxation's interpretation of section 51 in this connection is not such an accepted and standard practice as the Treasurer claimed in his second reading speech. I understand that many firms regularly claim accrued leave and then lodge objections with the Commissioner when he disallows the claim, all this being part of a continuing program by firms to change the nature of the assessment. That being the case, it does not seem right to say it is accepted practice. It might be accepted by the Commissioner but it is certainly not accepted by manyfirmsin this country. Previous committees of inquiry into taxationnot only the Aprey committee but also the Spooner and Ligertwood committees-hav e all recommended change in the tax law to aUow leave provisions to become a tax deduction as the UabUity accrues rather than when it is paid. One could also argue that the refusal of a tax deduction until leave is paid also acts as a disincentive to the employment of labour. For instance, on the one hand an employer may be faced with an expense in the sense that he has to put aside year after year to cover the leave UabUity for labour funds for which he may not claim a tax deduction until sometimehence. On the other hand he may claim in each year depreciation on machines. He may take these factors into consideration when he is deciding whether to invest in a labour saving machine or continue with the current level of labour, that is, deciding between the employment of labour and the employment of capital. To the degree that they are taken into consideration, they would certainly make it less likely that the employer would opt for labour rather than capital. So in this area, which is now of increasing importance, given the growing impact of automation on this country, the tax law would seem to be showing a bias in this area towards capital rather than labour. I do not want to put this argument too highly but I think it does have some relevance, and to the extent that it does, it provides an argument for allowing leave to be made a tax deduction as it is provided for rather than when it is actuaUy paid. However, against aU this one must set the fact that there could be up to a $600m loss of revenue in this financial year, according to the Government, if the NUsen decision is allowed to stand. Although the decision is being appealed against by the Commissioner of Taxation and, indeed, by NUsen, which wants to be able to claim for all the leave UabUity which has accrued in earUer years as well, the intention of this Bill is to make sure that such revenue loss does not occur. There have been queries regarding the sum of $600m, and I must say that it does seem to be extraordinarily high for a loss just for leave provisions in one year. However, we do not have the basis on which to oppose or to declare that the Treasurer's assessment of this sum is incorrect, although I note that the Australian Taxpayers Associauon has claimed that the amount is greatly overdrawn and would in fact be far less than the sum mentioned. However, not having a sound basis on which to reach any conclusion that the Treasurer is totally wrong in this respect, we have litde alternative but to accept that the Taxation Office has made some calculation of this order and to accept therefore that that is the likely loss if the law is not changed. For that reason we therefore support the Government's legislation. In doing so we realise that there is clear retrospectivity involved because the Bill seeks to make clear that from 1 July 1977 leave UabUity is claimable as a tax deduction only at thetimeit is paid. But we are not deterred at aU by the principle of retrospectivity. In faa, we believe that there may have to be greater recourse in the future to retrospective legislation in this regard if we are to defeat the machinations of tax avoiders and protect the revenue. No one Ukes retrospective legislation. But the Opposition has already made it clear that it does not shrink from supporting retrospective legislation when it feels this action is justified. this particular area the Opposition feels that there is indeed every justification for retrospective legislation, although one would seek to keep it to the minimum extent necessary. I turn now to consider the defects in the caseby-case approach against tax avoidance which is being pursued by the present Government. There has been, of course, a rash of tax avoidance activity by the Government this year. Since acting against the Curran schemes in AprU the Treasurer has put out nine Press releases regarding tax avoidance measures, introduced three major BUls plus the minor machinery BUls that accompany them, foreshadowed action on 23 separate avoidance schemes plus the many varieties of each one, taken action on at least 10 schemes which have been designed to circumvent earUer announced legislation and is now about to introduce during the current debate 44 technical amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2), most of which are said to be of the slip-of-the-pen variety. I simply note in passing that there must be some very slippery pens in the Taxation Office. However, I understand the complexities of what is involved and I do not intend to be really critical in making that off-the-cuff remark. The effect of all this is that various tax avoidsensible ance loopholes will certainly be closed off. But seems to us that others are just as likely to up soon thereafter. As we have already seen, the Treasurer has had to bring in supplementary legislation to ensure that earUer tax avoidance legislation remains effective. We must realise that there is a whole industry working out how to avoid tax for those who can afford the fees. Of course these are the people with high incomes. With such complex legislation as this income tax law it is quite inevitable that highly skUled lawyers and accountants operating in this area will continue to find new loopholes as fast as the Parliament closes off existing ones, at least while we proceed in the present way. Thus this caseby-case approach, in our view, is not Ukely to be effective in eUminating or severely restricting a blatant tax avoidance. There are also great administrative and legislative burdens involved in this case-by-case approach. The process of drawing up legislation to cover aU the possible means by which a scheme can be used must be creating a severe administrative burden, especially as there is no seeming end to the process. As things stand, it will just go on and on, with more and more avoidance BUls being brought before this House, creating an admimstrative burden for the Government and, In indeed, creating a parliamentary burden. We will be faced continually with a vast array of complex legislation seeking to close off new tax avoidance schemes that have been opened up. One commentator has described this whole approach as 'one of applying band-aids to a patient bleeding to death from multiple gunshot wounds'. It may not be an entirely pointless exercise to apply those band-aids, but we must recognise that it is an extremely frustrating process, knowing that it is not going to achieve any lasting effect. This surely should lead us to seek alternative means of overcoming the problem. Especially is this so when one considers the sort of tangled mess the income tax law is Likely to become a few years hence if this process continues. The original Act of 1936 was 90 pages long. The Income Tax Assessment A a now is over 700 pages long and is likely to become longer in the near future. A well-known taxation lawyer, Mr Daryl Davies, QC, recently described the jumble ofincome tax legislation as follows: The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1977 is practically incomprehensible . . . The uninitiated could not possibly read and understand the Act. Even the initiated will find difficulty in locating and bringing together all the matters that are relevant. Mr Davies also pleaded for the Act to be entirely recast, and that seems to us to be an extremely suggestion. We realise, of course, that it recasting the Act would be no simple process. open Indeed, it would raise enormous problems. But the fact is that this legislation is now so complex that inevitably it facilitates an unending stream of tax avoidance schemes. The Government's attack on tax avoidance schemes is not as comprehensive as it might been. The various well-known devices to avoid tax or through which tax is reduced have been lowed by this Government to continue. Admitequity. tedly it has done quite a bit about tax avoidance, but it has allowed blatant tax avoidance areas continue to operate. One of those areas is income spUtting. As we all know, income spUtting Treasurer through family trusts is a blatant area of avoidance, and although this has been pointed out to the Government time and time again in debate, both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer have made it clear that they have no intention of moving to close this substantial tax loophole. Income spUtting through service trusts is also something which quite open to those who wish to employ tax avoidance processes. The Australian Financial Review on 23 August 1978 carried an article headed 'Income-sphtting upheld', and I quote briefly from that article: An income-splitting case of interest to all professional persons was handed down by the Federal Court this month. The court, inrejectingthe Commissioner's appeal Phillip's case, has ruled that on the non-professional activities of an accountancy practice was fully effective for tax purposes. The importance of the scheme used is that it enabled income to be diverted by professional practitioners to mate benefit of their wives and families. What happens is that income is diverted to people who are in much lower tax bracketshappened wives and chUdren-and is therefore taxed at lower rates than if it remained in the hands professional person. In today's Australian Financial Review there is a report of a simUar cision by the Federal Court of Austraha in lation to income spUtting by partnerships. cision has been made enabling those who participate in partnerships to mirumise their through income-sphtting devices. Clearly, in area it would seem that there is a lot more to done if the Government is really serious about cutting down on tax avoidance. Again what about foreign-earned income? In June, when the Treasurer introduced the BUls now before the House, he spent a good third of his speech taking about the Government's plan to tax foreign-earned income at Australian rates, or to ensure that total tax paid on that come was at Australian tax rates. As we have seen since, the Government has backedrightoff that measure and announced that it has no intention of going on with it. When the Treasurer announced that the Government was not going to go ahead with the scheme, I made the point in a speech in this House that it did involve allowing have tax avoidance to go on. At that time the Treasurer seemed to think that I was being alunfair and that he was concerned only with It is not just a matter of equity, it is a matto ter of tax avoidance as well, and the two are closely related. I draw the attention of the to a recent advertisement for the Small tax Business Letter in the newspapers which read: Tax havens overseas. Treasurer Howard has thrown the gate wide open for you to minimise tax through overseas tax shelters. That relates to the fact that the Treasurer, on beoff half of the Government, announced that they were backingrightoff the proposal to clamp is down on these foreign tax havens by taxing foreign-earned income at Australian tax rates. So there we see two examples-incom e splitting and foreign-earned income-wher e the Government if it was really serious about this matter could be doing a lot more. The result of all this-the ineffectiveness of the action taken against tax avoidance and the tolerance of some tax avoidance procedures-is that in the tax system is becoming very inequitable, and the use of a service trust to carry that is of great concern to the Opposition. Pay-asyou-earn taxpayers-the great wage and salary earners of this country-hav e litde or no chance the ultito avoid tax in the way that is open to those who do not come under the PAYE provisions. I draw the attention of the House to what has over the last few years to the level of tax raised from PAYE taxpayers and others who of the do not come under the pay-as-you-earn provisions. In the period from 1976-77 to de1978-79- I am using the Budget Estimates-ne t rePAYE tax increased by 21.2 per cent but other A depersonal income tax- I am talking about provisional taxpayers-increase d by only 2.9 per tax cent There has been very litde increase indeed, this and the high income earners are in the second be category, the personal income tax area. They are not increasing their tax payments to the Government because they are able to utilise tax avoidance techniques, despite all the efforts of this Government to this stage to close them off. As I mentioned, a lot more could have been done if the Government was really serious about it. It is also relevant to note that over the last few years tax there has been a move towards a larger proinportion of the work force being self-employed and therefore not paying pay-as-you-earn tax. However, despite that, we still have this very low rate of mcrease for non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers during the period from 1976-77 to 1978-79. In considering what alternative approach can be taken, one has to bear in mind that the problem for the Government has been made much more difficult than it otherwise would have been by the actions of the High Court in this country. I do not have time to go into this area in any detail, but I think it is well known by all honourable members that section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act is one that has been written down by the High Court over the last decade or so to the point of near meaninglessness. Yet on the face of it, to the layman it seems to say quite clearly that tax avoidance procedures are void as against the Commissioner-absolutel y void, to use the words of the section. Somehow this has been interpreted by the High Court as not applying and therefore the Government has no general armihilation provision, as it is known, in the Act, working to prevent tax avoidance schemes being utilised. Of course, this makes it extremely difficult. The alternative approach the Government is now employing, not having an effective annihilation provision, is to legislate against every tax avoidance scheme that it finds out about, but that has all the problems I have been talking about in regard to the complexity of the law and the administrative and parUamentary burden. It is a very unsatisfactory alternative, and it seems to us that the Government, if it is really serious about chopping off tax avoidance in this country, must do something about section 260. It should not just accept the fact that the High Court is able to ignore the wishes of parhament when it introduced such a provision and to interpret that section in a way which renders it virtually meaningless. In considering what kind of action can be taken by the Government to overcome tax avoidance, let me make a few points. Thefirstthing it must do is to create in the minds of the community a sense of immorality regarding enormous tax avoidance. Probably everyone tries to cheat the Commissioner of Taxation to some small degree, either by overstating the amount of his chemist bills or doing something similar. I am sure that most people in this community understate their income to a degree. But the amounts involved are very small and for most people the tax avoidance is very minor. What we are talking about are the actions of people who are able to undertake absolutely artificial schemes that are blatandy designed to avoid paying tax. In some cases those schemes wipe out totally their tax tiability and in other cases that liability is wiped out for years in advance. Of course, we are talking about people on very high incomes. It is totally inequitable that we should allow that procedure to continue. We say that thefirstthing the Government must do is to create in the minds of people the feeling that it is immoral to engage in such blatant tax avoidance. If we can create great community indignation about such tax avoidance and the realisation that those people who are able to escape from their tax liabilities are imposing a greater burden on the rest of us who are unable to engage in such practices, we may find eventually that the judiciary of this country will be forced to pay more regard to the wishes of Parliament than it seems to be doing at the present time. Nevertheless, we feel that we ought to try to take other action, such as revamping section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. A couple of alternative drafts of section 260 have been made available to me, one by Dr Uri Grbich, a senior lecturer in law at Monash University and the other by another tax lawyer who wishes to remain anonymous. One is an extremely detailed and lengthy rewrite of section 260 and the other is an attempt to explain that section in a very simple form. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard those two alternative drafts of section 260. Leave granted. - The documents read asfollowsSUGGESTED REDRAFT OF SECTION 260 OF THE NA Section 260 This redraft should be enacted in the Income Tax Assessment Aa 1936-75, the Estate Duty Assessment Act 1941 -67, and the Gift Duty Assessment Aa 1941 -72. (1) Taxation avoidance transactions shall be illegal. (2) A 'taxation avoidance transaction' shall be any transaction: (a) which has the effect of diminishing or postponing any liability imposed by this A a or any possibility of future liability which may be imposed by this Aa, and (b) the particular steps by which that transaction was carried into effect reasonably raise the inference that the transaction was artificial when compared with the steps normally used to achieve substantially the same non-taxation effects, and (c) one reasonable hypothesis explaining the artificiality of the particular steps by which the transaction was carried into effect was that a reasonable man in the position of the taxpayer would use the particular steps in the transaction in order to bring about the effects described in section 260 (2) (a), and (d) which is not excluded from the operation of section 260 by section 260 (4). (3) This section shall override all other provisions in this Act (4) (a) In interpreting the provisions of this Act proper weight shall be given to the objective of preventing taxation avoidance transactions. (b) Where there is a conflict between the objective of preventing a taxadon avoidance transaction and the economic, social or administradve objectives of other provisions of this Act the Commissioner shall in resolving such a conflict give proper weight to the objectives of this section. (c) Notwithstanding section 260 (1) to (3) but subject to section 260 (4) (a) and (b), where the consequences of applying section 260 conflict with the consequences of applying any other provision in this ably be drawn from that other provision that the carrying out of the transaction in that particular way was necessaiy to satisfy the economic, social or administrative objectives of that provision the taxation avoidance transaction shall not be illegal. (5) In drawing the inference that there was a taxation avoidance transaction the Commissioner shall have regard to the following matters: (a) whether the transaction might reasonably be expected to have been carried into effect or carried into effect using those particular steps if it had not a tax diminution effect; (b) whether a transaction having its non-taxation effects or substantially the same non-taxation effects might reasonably be expected to have been carried into effect in that way by bona fide fulfilling the normal family obligations of the taxpayer havingregardto the options open to the taxpayer when he carried out the transaction and all the circumstances; (c) the tax diminutionresultingfrom the particular steps used in the taxation avoidance transaction when compared with a hypothetical transaction having the effects described in section 260 (5) (b); (d) the income, profit or other gain which might reasonably be expected from the taxation avoidance transaction and the difference between such income, profit or other gain and a hypothetical transaction having the effects described in section 260 (S) (b); (e) how unusual the steps in the taxation avoidance transaction are when compared with those in section 260(5) (a) and having regard to all the circumstances; and (0 the extent of control the taxpayer enjoyed before and after the transaction over the subject matter of the transaction. (6) (a) Where there is a taxation avoidance transaction the Commissioner may but shall not be bound to treat all or any part of the taxation avoidance transaction as void for the purposes of this Act. (b) Where there is a taxation avoidance transaction the Commissioner may for purposes of this Act treat all or any part of the taxation avoidance transaction as effective or he may notionally construct any ance transaction for the purposes of this section. (c) Notwithstanding anything in section 260 (I ) to section 260 (6) (b) the Commissioner shall as a result ofhis annihilation and reconstruction of the taxation avoidance transaction or any pan thereof produce a taxable income which having regard to the matters in section 260 (5) and having regard to the non-taxation effects of the transaction and all the circumstances is not unreasonable and counteracts the taxation advantages of the taxation avoidance transaction. (d) Notwithstanding anything in section 260 (6) (a), (b) or (c), the Commissioner shall not treat any pan of the transaction as void if the amount of tax diminished or postponed is not a material amount. (7) In any proceedings in which a taxpayer is appealing from a determination of the Commissioner under section 187 of this Act: (a) the onus of establishing that there was a taxation avoidance transaction shall lie on the Commissioner; and (b) the onus of establishing that the taxable income resulting from the operation of section 260 (6) is unreasonable shall lie on the taxpayer. Act and the inference can reason(8) (a) The Commissioner shall supply to the taxpayer the basis on which he arrives at a new taxable income including the steps of the reconstructed transaction and the calculation of any approximations made in achieving the new taxable income. (b) In supplying the basis on which he arrives at a new taxable income under section 260 (8) (a), the Commissioner shall not be required to use technical or legal language. (c) It shall not be a ground for reversing the basis on which the Commissioner arrives at a new taxable income had under section 260 (8) (a) that the grounds he states are inaccurate or do not justify his decision so long as aU the grounds read together justify a taxable income which is not substantially different from the taxable income assessed. (9) In this section: persons dealing at arms length or 'diminishing' includes lowering, avoiding, defeating or relieving, whether directly or indirectly, and whether wholly or in pan; 'non-taxation effects' means the effects of the transaction other than the effects defined in section 260 (2) (a); and 'transaction' means anything or things done or omitted to be done whether involving conscious action or not and whether enforceable or not by any person or persons whether together or separately and whether in concert or not. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing it shall include any understanding, arrangement, agreement, plan, contract, conveyance, transfer, assignment, grant, creation, settlement, delivery, allotment of shares or debentures or convertible notes, variation of share or debenture rights, release, surrender or failure, renunciation, nonenforcement of anyrightfor a period exceeding that which would normally be expected for the non-taxation effects of such non-enforcement, abandonment, effluxion of limitation period, exercise of any power, option or other right, or the failure to use a power, right or vote which would prevent such effects as aforesaid.

183,Mr WILLIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT,"Anothe r measure that can be taken is to ban all advertising of tax avoidance schemes. I cannot see why, for instance, the MCCabe letter should be able to advertise 'income tax wipe out'. No detail is given as to exactly how the people behind that can wipe out income tax entirely, but they are able to advertise schemes which claim that if they are followed one's tax obligation will be totally obliterated. I do not think we should make it easier for people to evade tax by allowing the advertising of such schemes. I turn now to retrospectivity. As I mentioned previously, the Opposition does not shrink from endorsing retrospectivity in this area. As I have said previously, we think there is absolutely nothing wrong with backdating legislation at least to the beginning of thefinancialyear in which the Taxation Office discovers the operalso ation of a tax avoidance scheme. That would seem to be very limited retrospectivity indeed. that did not go far enough, we would not shrink from applying retrospectivity beyond that datefor example, to the period when a tax avoidance schemefirstbegan to operate. I think that the aptice phcation of retrospectivity is an element absolutely ruins the tax avoidance industry. If retrospectivity were introduced in relation to every scheme the tax avoidance industry simply Government could not operate. The existence or otherwise of retrospectivity means the Ufe or death of the avoidance industry. If members of the Governquite ment are really serious about preventing these practices from continuing they ought to think happened more seriously than they have in the past about supporting full scale retrospectivity. There are other measures which can be taken. I refer to the imposition offinesand even perthis haps taking such matters out of the hands of the courts altogether, as has been recommended the Emeritus Professor of Law at the Australian National University, Professor Geoffrey Sawer. do not havetimeto go into that matter now. the approprate stage I will be moving an amendevasion ment to the motion for the second reading of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978. Although that Bill is currently being debated cognately with other BUls, we are fornothing mally debating the Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 3) 1978. So I will move that amendment at a later time.",57
184,Mr BAUME,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT,"I think that all honourable members on this side of the a transHouse would congratulate the Government and to the its Treasurer (Mr Howard) for the enormous steps they have taken to confront the tax evasion industry. There is no doubt that, as the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr WUlis) said, there is an excessive use of evasion methods and that it is the duty and the role of government to ensure that the tax burden is spread as fairly as possible throughout the whole community. In that context, it is interesting to note that in the three years that this Government has been in office an enormous number of measures have been introduced to prevent from operating the more blatant schemes which have been practised without difficulty in previous years and which, of course, have cost the revenue-that means the taxpayer-larg e amounts of money. If a very large scale evasion industry exists, there is no doubt that it means that the tax burden is heavier on those who have the sense of responsibUity to pay their taxes. It may be not only that they have the sense of responsibUity to pay their taxes but that they do not have the capacity to hire the experts who devise evasion schemes. I use the If word 'evasion' rather than the word 'avoidance' in this context because some of the schemes that we have seen are of such a curious nature and fly so clearly in the face of normal commercial practhat the word 'avoidance' is, to my mind, irwhich relevant when dealing with them. WhUst we should congratulate the present for its enormous effort in this area and for the large number of Bills it has tax introduced, many of which have been held to be controversial, we should perhaps look back and compare that enormous effort with what in the preceding three years when evasion schemes were being proceeded with and when the rate of tax rose so rapidly that the desire, the need in some cases, to seek to avoid income tax in order to survive became so great that industry reaUy began toflourish.I submit that the avoidance industry received no serious by impediment whatsoever in the three years that Labor was in government, apart from a stateI ment from the then Treasurer, Mr Crean, in At which he stated that one particular form of would be dealt with. That that scheme was not dealt with in the subsequent two years probably represents a pattern in the methods adopted by the Labor Government. In fact, of any significance was done at all by those now in opposition to limit tax evasion and to ensure that the tax burden was spread fairly throughout the whole of the community. I was fascinated to hear the honourable member for Gellibrand claim that an unfair rise in pay-as-you-earn taxation is taking place under this Government. Good heavens! Would the honourable member like to go back to the Budget which was introduced by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) and which set out to increase wages by approximately 22 per cent but in which pay-as-you-earn tax-that is workers' tax-wa s to rise by approximately 44 per cent? That was to happen under the last Labor Budget. No wonder it was the last Labor Budget. Whilst one should not be detoured into this kind of discussion, despite what was said by the honourable member for GelUbrand, I think we have to recognise that a very significant effort has been made in this area by the present Government which, I will concede, received grudging support from the honourable member for Gellibrand. However, I think we have to recognise that many other problems are still facing the Government and that it is no secret that the Government is maintaining a continuing examination of tax avoidance and evasion schemes. I am certain that the honourable member for Gelhbrand must be aware that section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which he mentioned, is at present subject to close examination by the Government and its back benchers. There is no doubt that many further proposals to restrain tax evasion schemes as they arise are either under examination or soon wiU be. Throughout this session statements have been made by the Treasurer about measures that will be taken. I simply contrast this action with the words-the y have only ever been words-fro m the Opposition. I also would Uke to commend the Government for what it has deUberately not done. I draw attention to the matter that the honourable member for GelUbrand raised in relation to the taxation of foreign earnings by Australian corporations and Australian personal taxpayers. The honourable member for Gellibrand made the comment that he did not find it satisfactory that the Treasurer would withdraw these taxes because they were inequitable. That is an extraordinary statement. For an honourable member of this House to concede that what was originally proposed would have been inequitable but that that did not matter is, I think, a reflection on the sorts of attitudes that members of the Australian Labor Party appear to have to equity throughout the community. The honourable member for GelUbrand said that it is not a matter of equity, that it is a matter of tax evasion. Goodness me, if we are to rely on that kind of thinking from the Opposition and if ever the Australian nation has the misfortune to see honourable members opposite again in government, the sort of inequitable legislation that will be brought down will make even the three years of the previous Labor Government from 1973 to 1975 look like a kids' picnic. This is an absolutely apalling concession by the honourable member for GelUbrand. If we do not have paramount in our minds considerations of equity in tax matters, we have no right to impose taxes. The whole thrust of the taxation system must be directed towards sharing the tax burden as fairly as possible throughout the communityamongst those people who have the capacity to pay. The efforts that this present Government has made in its three years of office have been eminently successful in that direction. It has blocked some of these blatant tax avoidance schemes. But we must recognise that although it is quite true that there is some area of tax avoidance and evasion involved in foreign earnings of Australian corporations and Australian individual taxpayers overseas, the fact is that the very great majority of those earnings is not in that category. The initially proposed legislation would have acted unfairly on the great bulk of honest and honourable corporations and people earning income from overseas. It is inequitable that they should have been unreasonably and unfairly treated simply to catch the small proportion of people involved in taxation devices. The fact is-the honourable member for GelUbrand might recognise this-that the kind of legislation originally proposed would not have caught the people using the more disgraceful devices that are apparendy avaUable. The hidden incomes being secretly established overseas would not have come within the realms of the legislation because, in fact, it related to declared earnings. Therefore, the legislation was withdrawn not only because it was inequitable- a major point-bu t also because it did not strike effectively at the heart of the recognised evasion. For the honourable member for GelUbrand to suggest that a MCCabe letter or any other letter which deals with foreign taxation havens can exist only because this Government withdrew some proposed legislation that would have been inequitable is arrant and utter nonsense and he knows it.",57
185,Mr WILLIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT,It is just easier.,58
186,Mr BAUME,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT,"It may be just easier, but it is not true. I congratulate the Treasurer for the way in which he has responded to pressure from the committees set up by this Government to deal with matters of this nature. The House will be aware that there is not only a government member's Treasury committee but also a taxation sub-committee. The right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon), who is in the House at the moment, is a member of that taxation sub-committee. I am the secretary of that sub-committee and Senator Messner is its chairman. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is also a member of that subcommittee as is the honourable member for  committee. I am very glad that immediately the Treasurer announced these matters he asked the sub-committee-as is customary-for its views. I stress that the style of government represented here is very effective. Statements are made by the Treasurer. He then requests pubhc discussion of the matter concerned so that inequities will be avoided, so that the Government will be fully aware of possible effects when it eventuaUy legislates and so that it will not be relying entirely on in-house advice from a department which regrettably is involved in the main at looking at the dark side of Austrahan business and the Australian taxpayer. NaturaUy, the Taxation Office has the view that it is continuaUy being cheated. The fact is that people in the Taxation Office understandably may not have the same happy, cheerful view of human nature that most Australians have. After all, if one is involved in tax evasion matters aU the time, one no doubt becomes a litde sour. The point is that this is a sensible form of government in which pubhc and expert advice is sought and gained. The taxation subcommittee was overjoyed at the response that it received on this matter, as on every other matter that it has discussed with the Treasurer. A high degree of expertise exists within the committee gathered from outside sources. I repeat, that the Treasurer, should be commended for his response to the very alert and, I beheve, capable submissions made to him by members of the taxation sub-committee on this and various other matters. I shaU deal with a point made by the honourable member for Gelhbrand relating to retrospective legislation. I am concerned at his general point of view. He states that there may have to be greater retrospectivity in the future. That is the honourable member for Gellibrand's view. He suggests that the tax evasion industry would be dealt with properly only if this threat of greater retrospectivity existed. I know that a view has been expressed by, I think, a Privy Councillor in Britain or by the High Court. Certainly it was expressed by a judge in Britain. He said that as this is open war and as it is regarded as war by both sides, it is pretty hard to have peaceful rules applying to tax evasion. Nonetheless, I submit that retrospectivity is not a principle that should be embraced by any government as a matter of course. It would be most regrettable if in any instance actions which were legal at thetimethey were done were then retrospectively made Ulegal. That is a basic principle of law. What we have to look at here is to what extent the retrospectivity involved in fixing up the mess created by the NUsen case, as dealt with in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3), offends any of the principles of retrospectivity. I am certain that honourable members on this side of the House in particular would strongly support such principles. I submit that in this case retrospectivity is not the principle at risk because, as one will see from reading the judgment, this case changes a situation that had been assumed by everyone to exist. All that the amendment is doing is restoring the situation that everyone had assumed to exist anyway. In fact the retrospectivity does not offend the proposition that people should not act on the expectation that the law states one thing only to find out that the law has been changed after the event. In essence, everyone expected the law to be as it has now been established to be in this legislation. To deny the point about retrospectivity that was raised by the honourable member for GelUbrand, I say that those people who in fact had a different view of the law and who believed the law to state what the learned judge in the Victorian Supreme Court said in the NUsen case will not be subjected to the retrospective nature of this legislation. In the Treasurer's second reading speech it is stated: The amendment will not apply in respect of assessments yet to be raised in respect of earlier years and it will not apply to assessments already raised in respect of the 1977-78 and prior years where the taxpayer's rights are protected by way of objection or appeal to a court. We are not chopping out anything that had existed in the past. In effect we are only changing the legislation back to the situation which existed and was beUeved to exist in the minds of the taxpayers at thetimethey earned their incomes. I concede that there is a significant point about whether deductions for long service leave, annual leave and so on should be deductible for tax purposes. No doubt there is a very strong case that they all should be deductible at the time the provision is made rather than having to wait until the amount is actually paid. After all it is a cost against profits and it is rather Ulogical that a company should present one set of accounts to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation on which it is taxed and yet another set of accounts to the public, in the case of a public company, in which these items aie deducted. The accounts which are presented to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxadon do not have the provisions deducted but the accounts that are presented to the pubhc have them deducted. Certainly it is illogical. The argument against allowing the deductions is that because the money has not passed out of a corporation's control, it should not get the benefit of the tax deduction. The Nilsen case would have an immense impact if it were alto lowed to go on this year. I believe that the Government should look at this point as a future poUcy matter in the hope that one would move and towards a situation in which provisions are ductible for tax purposes at the time they are made. I believe it would be of great assistance, particularly to small businesses, in allowing to retain in their businesses money that is and in fact essential to allow them to expand, develop and in fact employ people. It can well be argued also that with the prevenclaim tion of transfer of losses-curren t year losses being prevented from being transferred in this legislation-ther e is a fair case for aUowing transfers of losses anyway and to aUow trading losses, recognising it as one of the few ways which creditors of a faUed company can ever get any money back; the loss becomes an asset if it able to be traded. I submit that this matter could be raised in the large review of taxation which presently being carried out within the GovernsuccessfuUy ment ranks. I conclude by stating that a continuing inquiry about tax is going on. The honourable member for GelUbrand has referred to evasion and tion 260. As I said, section 260 is being examined. This point about evasion probably dramatises the need to look at other forms ation which do not allow for evasion. That is of the reasons that the Government an inquiry into such matters as indirect taxes and retaU turnover tax. It is extraordinary that the RetaU Traders Association apparently takes the view that this Government does not have the right to examine the best way to tax the Ausgood traUan public.",58
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT, turn Order! The honourable member's time has made expired.,60
188,Mr MARTIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT,"Five taxation BUls which are now before the House are being discussed, two of them being income tax assessand ment BUls. I will direct my remarks primarily the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill friend (No. 2) 1978. When the Treasurer (Mr Howard) introduced this Bill on 8 June 1978 he said: The Bill . . . contains funher measures to counter tax avoidance and to improve the equity and balance of the income tax system. I am pleased to note that this Bill contains provisions to encourage investment in Australian films. It deals with current year losses and rebates on dividends that are received as part of a dividend stripping operation so as to counter tax avoidance situations. It also contains provisions impose a branch profits tax. To the extent that this Bill sets out to counter tax avoidance schemes, the Opposition does not quarrel with it it certainly does not oppose the legislation. It dealso does not oppose the provisions of the Bill which set out to encourage investment in AustraUanfilms.This is a very worthwhUe effort that them is being taken by the Government and I only useful hope that it succeeds in its objectives. In recent years there has been a great upsurge in the Australian film making industry. I might credit for the Whidam Government which, are after it came to office in December 1972, set out to introduce measures to encourage the AusaU traUan film making industry. Some States have followed the example of the Whitlam Governin ment. The Labor Government in South Australia is particularly noteworthy for the efforts that it is has made to encourage the industry. FUms of the calibre of Picnic at Hanging Rock are evidence is of the types of films which can be made quite in Australia by the Australian film making industry, provided of course that sufficient encouragement is given to produce worthwhUe films and not muck. I am pleased to see that the bulk of the films which have been secproduced in Austraha have been worthwhUe. Picnic at Hanging Rock is a particular example. It is a very worthwhUe film and many other films of taxthat have been produced subsequently have one received almost rave notices from the interis conducting national film industry.",60
189,Mr BAUME,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT,Caddie.,60
190,Mr MARTIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT,"As the honourable member for Macarthur points out, Caddie is an extremely film. It goes to show that provided sufficient incentives are given to people in the industry and provided they can get a reasonablefinancialrefrom money invested, capital can and wU be avaUable. History has shown that there are sufficient good actors and actresses in Australia to provide worthwhile Australian films. We also have sufficient producers, directors, cameramen supporting staff in the industry. I well reto member discussing in early 1972 with an old who was in the film industry the possibUity of encouraging a worthwhile film industry in Australia. This old friend of mine was somewhat of a cynic. He was Chips Rafferty, who was rather a Jack Blunt as well as being cynical. He was very blunt and very cynical of politicians. He made the statement that politicians, for many years, had held out hopes for incentives to be provided and assistance to be given to the Australian film industry but nothing worthwhile had been done. This was before the Whitlam Government was elected in December 1972. I discussed this matter with Chips Rafferty one day when he was wearing a sarong and hosing the front garden. He was my daughter's landlord. On a rather warm summer day in December at Vaucluse Chips had a long sarong around his paunchy stomach which had been built up with the best Australian brew- I think Tooths KB Lager had buUt him up into the fine figure that he was. Chips was out there hosing the garden and ranting and raving about what a bunch of bludgers Australian politicians were. That was before he found out that I was a politician. But that did not change his ranting and raving. He stUl ranted that the Australian film dustry had been led up the garden path by politicians for many many years and that neither I nor a Whidam Government, if it ever got into office, would be able to do anything about it. But Chips was made to eat his words in later years and he helped to assist in buUding up the AustraUanfilmindustiy. He had been in the Australian industry for many many years before the Australian FUm anything Commission was created by the Whitlam bulk Government. Even when that was created, he still had his doubts about anything happening. But he Uved to see the day when the Australian film industry did become a worthwhUe project. Fortunately he did Uve long enough to see that industry make worthwhUe developments. He also played a useful part in those developments. As I said before, the early upsurge in the industry came after the Australian FUm Commission was set up by the Whidam Labor Government. If the 'avoidance'. measures introduced by this Bill have a similar effect, then I say quite advisedly that they will be most worthwhile. This Government claims to be lending sigwith nificant support to the AustraUanfilmindustry and to aU those people who are engaged in it by the measures it is introducing in this Bill. Briefly, these measures wiU aUow capital investment in Australian film rights to be written off over two-year period, instead of, as at present, over much longer period of up to 25 years. This should, and hopefuUy will, encourage a greater investment and participation by Australians in the production of Austrahanfilms.An Australian film, by definition, is one which has been made or is to be made whoUy or substantiaUy in Australia, and has a significant Austrahan content. I congratulate the Government for inserting such a provision in this Bill because I do not believe that we should be assisting overseasfilmindustries to developfilmsin Australia if they are to be the ones to gain the advantages from those films. We have to encourage the Australian film industry to do its own development work, its own spade work, in developing the Austrahanfilmindustry. The Australianfilmindustiy has come a long way in the lastfiveyears. With the assistance that is provided in this Bill, hopefuUy it will go a lot further in the nextfiveyears. However, it is noteworthy that any time steps are taken to grant a tax benefit to any section of any industry it becomes necessaiy to guard against misuse of that benefit for tax avoidance purposes. I am pleased to see that this Bill has taken steps to prevent misuse, for tax avoidance in- purposes, of the measures which are being introduced to grant assistance to the Australian film industry. One would think that it should not be necessaiy to take steps to prevent tax avoidance, even with a concession of this nature, but unfortunately it is necessary. I say that it is symptomatic of the tax avoidance minds of skilled advisers who would do anything for a fee. That apphes to some accountants, some lawyers and some other tax avoidance experts. They will do for a fee. It is necessary for the great of people to be protected from having to share additional tax which has been thrust upon them by the machinations of such tax advisers. Even in recent times, despite the measures which this Government has taken, advertisements on how to avoid tax have still appeared constantly in the Press. It is not called 'evasion'; it is called 'avoidance'. I have often wondered what is the difference between 'evasion' and Mr Barry Jones-'Evasion ' is Ulegal.",60
191,Mr MARTIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT,"'Evasion ' is not in accordance the law and 'avoidance' is the nice way of saying that it is not evasion. But to my mind 'avoidance' still carries the same stigma. It still carries the same benefit to those people who shirk their responsibUities for the amount of tax a they avoid paying. In the Australian Financial a Review of 12 September this year, a half-page advertisement appeared advising of a one-day conference on special incentives and tax shelters. It referred to 'New Horizons on Tax and Investment Planning'. One of the statements in that half-page advertisement was as follows: Arealisticfuture orientated assessment of tax and ment planning in Australia cannot be complete without working knowledge of the scope for legitimate tax tion and the potential of tax sheltered investments. Among the subjects for discussion by skilled barristers at law were: Tax Shelters and Special Incentives in Australian Tax Law: Opening Pandora's Box. Presumably Pandora is a female because she has a box. Obviously Pandora's Box has been opened many times, if one takes into account number of Bills that have been introduced in this House to close that box, in other words, to close off tax avoidance schemes. Another topic for cussion, as mentioned in the advertisement, was: Variations on a Tax Shelter Theme: Forestry Operations, Macadamia Nut Plantations, Wheat Pooling, Bulbs, Wineries, Indoor Plants, So apparently nothing is sacred. Not even Section Macadamia nuts or indoor plants are sacred. They all come within the realm of the tax planner, the tax rninimiser. I notice that on page 39 of today's Australian Financial Review, the followaction ing advertisement appears: NA Investor is interested in purchasing for cash any investment or family trust with accumulated or come tax losses from $ 10,000 to $3 million. Replies in strictest confidence to: Because that advertisement mentions family trusts, I have no doubt that when the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) speaks in this debate he will open up Pandora's family trusts as they have apphcation in some sections, even within this Parhament. Measures are being introduced in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) to deal also with current-year losses, that is, artificiaUy created tax losses which are being injected into companies. What will happen is that the same tests will be appUed under this Bill as presently apply to losses in prior years. There are two tests. There has to be a same shareholding tests and a same business test. The High Court has ruled that the same business test means that the ness must operate in the same premises, with the same employees, et cetera. The High Court held that in the case of the Federal Commissioner Taxation v. Avondale Motors Pty Ltd. the Taxation Office has persuaded the Government that steps should be taken to close off that tax loophole, and indeed such steps are being investtaken in this Bill. The relevant provisions will opa erate from 7 AprU 1978, which was the date on minimizawhich the Treasurer made his statement in this House. Additional provisions are being made in regard to dividend stripping. Those provisions will Income date from 7 May 1978, which was the date of the Treasurer's Press release. No matter how hard the Taxation Office or any government tries to clamp down on tax avoidance schemes, skUled the promoters seem to find a way around the new provisions, as they did with the dividend stripping provisions of other income tax legislation. disThe promoters found a way round legislation brought down as late as April 1978 to interpose a company or a unit trust between the company to be stripped and the stripper. Section 46R is to be et cetera. amended to apply the provisions of previous legislation to the schemes I have just mentioned. 46B is to be further amended to cover the interposition of a trust as well as a company. I commend the Government for taking this and for taking the advice of the Taxation Office in introducing this legislation. But no matWANTED ter how hard the Taxation Office tries and no matter how hard a Government responds to trading, pressure from the Taxation Office, it never seems current into be able to close down the tax avoidance schemes. I often wonder whether the only solution to the discontinuance of tax avoidance and Trust Losses tax evasion is the introduction of a compulsory Box 2157, GPO, gaol sentence similar to that introduced in the Sydney United States of America. It seems to have had the effect, in the United States of curtaUing tax avoidance and tax evasion. I think it istimethe Government had a look at whether tax evasion and/or tax avoidance should be made the subBox on ject of a mandatory gaol sentence. I think that that is one of the few ways in which the Government will be able to cut down on these nefarious schemes which force other sections of the community to carry an unfair burden of the tax. If it is introduced it should not apply only to the people who do the tax avoidance and do the tax evasion but also the people who advise them to do it. Surely they are just as much culprits in the conspiracy to evade or avoid as those who do the avoidance or evasion work. If there busiwere a compulsory or mandatory gaol sentence for the tax avoider or evader as well as the tax adviser who gave the advice on these schemes, I of am sure we would whittle down tax avoidance to So at least a very minimal amount. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) righdy mendoned steps which should be taken to amend secdon 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I commend his remarks and would suggest to the Taxadon Office that it have a very close look at the suggested amendments of that secdon. He brought forward two suggested amendments of secdon 260 which were incorporated in Hansard. As honourable members should be aware, section 260 was inserted in the Income Tax Assessment Act many years ago to give blanket coverage for taxation officers in their administration of the Income Tax Act to prevent tax avoidance schemes. It should not be necessary-as has been happening in recent years-to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. There should be a blanket, worthwhile and watertight provision to prevent these tax avoidance schemes. Only in that way will every person bear a fair share of the income tax which has to be levied for the good government of any country. I commend this Bill to the House and trust that the Government will take note of the remarks of the honourable member for Gellibrand and me in regard to the apphcation of section 260 and the necessity to amend that provision and make it truly watertight.",61
192,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES," I wish to deal only with Order of the Day No. 1, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3). I think this question has to be answered for the benefit of the House: What are we considering? We are considering section 51 (1) of the Income Tax Act. That section says: All losses and outgoings to the extent to which curred in gaining or producing the assessible income or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business . . . shall be allowable deductions . . . The appUcation of that section has already been answered in the NUsen case and in several other cases. In this case there is no question of avoidance or evasion of tax, none whatsoever. That has to be stated. I put it to the House-this was mentioned by the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr Willis)-that it is in many respects retrospective, but to a minor extent there is a guarding clause to prevent retrospectivity, and I am thankful for that Further, I want to put pretty clearly to this House that there is a long Une of High Court decisions which show clearly that the decision in NUsen's case was legitimate and proper. They follow the text of other decisions given there. The honourable member for GelUbrand also mentioned that the Asprey Committee recommended the very process which we are now trying to overrule. Let me come back to what has happened. In the case before the Victorian courts called the NUsen case it was argued by Counsel, on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office, that losses or outgoings incurred could be claimed as a tax deduction only in the year of the tax return and only when payment in fact occurred. The finding of the Victorian court was clear and obvious. It said this: The provisions for long service leave was a loss or outgoing necessarily incurred within section 51 (1) of the Taxation Act The taxpayers obligation to pay was an indefeasible one. The court dealt with long service leave mainly but said exacdy the same principles applied to annual leave. That is a critical decision. Once it becomes accrued and indefeasible-that is, you cannot negotiate to getridof or change the obligation, the law has to be appUed-the taxpayer can claim the tax deduction. The Victorian court also said this: Losses or outgoings are incurred when either they accrue due or when they are realised. I think it is regrettable that we have heard in this House and in other places that this is something new. It is not new. I have said, and I emphasise it again, that it is consistent with a long set of rulings of the High Court of Austraha. Within the NUsen case the background to it all was traced by the judge or justice who heard the appeal. He referred to the James Flood case in 1953, reported in 103 Commonwealth Law Reports at page 655. In that case the High Court held that the word 'outgoing' in section 51(1) has been- I want to emphasise these words-interprete d as they are incovering outgoings to which the taxpayer is definitively committed in the year of income although mere has been no actual disbursement. How can it be said that this is something novel and something new? In 1953 the Taxation Office, in its magnificence and greatness, should have let the Government know what was involved in the Flood case, and the Government, if it wanted to, should have taken remedial action then in order to change the law if it thought it desirable to do so. I also ask people who like the law and above aU have a tremendous admiration for the legal practitioners in Austraha, particularly those who go on to the High Court bench, to read the decision of Dixon C.J. in the Caltex case which says exacdy the same thing: Therefore, I do not accept this nonsense about it being something novel and something new. I believe there are several other things we should mention. Firstly, it is critical to remember that if the deduction is not claimed in the tax year in which the allowance is claimed, it cannot subsequendy be claimed. That is another protection. Then it has to be remembered when we are looking at this that it is a 'one off' proposition-that what the Taxation Office gains today it has to allow for by way of a deduction in the following year. I would point to two other matters that have not been emphasised anywhere but are of tremendous importance to us. First we must ensure that the profits of corporations are built up to somewhere about 19 per cent of our gross domestic production. That has to be done. It is fundamental if the economy of this country is to recover. Why then do we turn around and deprive companies of the opportunity,firstof all to be able to appropriate and then claim a tax deduction which, under the laws they are perfectly entitled to do so? Second I refer to the fact that in Gorton's case the Governof ment said that we will obey the law. We will let the processes of the law and the appeal provisions take place and we will be guided by that. In the present instance it is to be done both ways. We will let it go on to appeal but at the same time we will amend the law although the law has been there for a very long period. Let me mention two facts which also deserve to be stated in the light of what I want to say later. This has nothing to do with the Statute law of New South Wales and Victoria-in the case of New South Wales the Long Service Leave Act, and the Annual Holidays Act, and in Victoria the Victorian Labour and Industries Act. The law of those two States provides that leave must be granted within six months of accrual unless the registrars of the various departments of labour-o r whatever they are called-agree . The NUsen case was based upon Metal Trades Awards. I deal now with the two arguments that were put in the second reading speech. The first is that uncertainty has been created by the disturbance of a practice foUowed by a great majority of taxpayers over past years. Taxpayers have been waiting since 1953-2 5 years ago-to see justice done and seen to be done. I cannot accept what has been said in this respect. Too many people have been hoping that the law as expounded in the Flood case would prevaU, and that the disturbance created by the tax office would be overruled. The second argument relates to the loss of revenue which will occur if an amendment is not made. When the matter was first explained to me I was alarmed to hear the loss put at an amount as high as $600m. I could not believe it I cannotfindanyone else who is prepared to justify such an assertion. I will teU honourable members why later. One of the decisions in the Flood case was that there was no prospect of a pro rata claim being accepted and that the provisions of either the award or the law had to be carried out. In the case of long service leave a person had to have 15 years continuous service and in the case of annual leave the period was one year. No pro rata allocation was appUcable. Let me analyse some of the points in that respect. Firstly, let us look at the long service leave situation to see whether there is any justification for such an amount being mentioned. A person has to serve for 15 years before such an entitiement arises. After that 15 years has been served a further period of several years has to be served before there is any pro rata entitlement for that subsequent period. In considering this matter one has to remember that there is a labour turnover 20 per cent to 30 per cent in a year. Against thosefigures,the tax loss amounting to $250m or a htde more than that, seems highly improbable! That is the main point I want to make on that aspect. I turn now to the annual leave. I have referred to the fact that there is various State legislation, most of which was referred to in the NUsen case. The trend today, and it is in accordance with the law, is for leave to be taken within the relevant period or the following six months. In view of that situation, surely one is entitled to ask how the amount could rise to the extent stated. Usually this leave is taken at Christmas when the kids are on hohdays. By June they are not entitled to anymore. We have been given no evidence as to the way in which the amount of $600m could possibly be lost to the Treasury this financial year. In an endeavour to get information about this matter, I had to do my own homework. What did I do? I am glad that the honourable member for Gellibrand has returned to the chamber. He referred to this matter in his analytical and well-delivered speech. I went to the Bureau of Statistics and found that it had no facts and no basis on which such an opinion could be arrived at I went to the Reserve Bank, which is usuaUy a pretty well informed organisation. It could not give me any information either. I went through the annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation and found nothing about this matter. I went then to Statex, which is the information centre for most of the companies Usted on the stock exchanges. It could not find any readUy avaUablefiguresthat would help me.",63
193,Mr HODGMAN,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,"Where did the figure come from? Sir WILUA M MCMAHON- I believe it came from one of those intuitive judgments we heard about a few weeks ago from a former member of the Taxadon Office. If not, maybe it was the result of crystal baU gazing. The honourable member's imagination is a Uttle better than mine. He will have to answer the question himself. One argument was put to me-no t very persuasively-to which I took rather strong exception when I heard it. It was that as the wages and salaries supplement amounts in total to $50 bUUon one can draw the conclusion-by intuitive judgment and by other means-that $600m could be involved. I do not think that remotely touches reaUty. Let us analyse the situation. From that amount of $50 bilUon one has firstly to deduct for the three tiers of government and the hospitals and educaton. One has to look at a dozen and one things before one can ascertain what percentage of the amount of $50 bUUon should be deducted. The honourable member for GelUbrand also referred to the fact that certain people, particularly in Victoria, had made guesses about this matter. I have made inquiries about it. I have the approval of Mr Risstrom, the Secretary of the Australian Taxpayers Association, to say that he does not think the amount could be as high as $30m. From barristers and accountants whom I regard as being among some of the best professionals dealing with taxation matters I have obtained one common expression of opinion, that is, that it is a storm in a teacup. I believe that that statement is true. I refer now to the attitude of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the business sector and the community generaUy to annual and long service leave. The trade union movement believes that annual leave and long service leave are benefits that have been acquired over the years for the purpose of ensuring that the workers have time off from work and that they are part and parcel of their conditions of employment. It is not the money consideration that is important. It is the fact that under modern conditions, with the complexities of Ufe and the unpredictabUity of the world in which we Uve, the workers must have time to rest and recuperate. For example, automobUe workers, whose awards should be read, are given time off because of the dullness and the routine nature of their work due to mechanisation. It would be nothing but hypocritical if the ACTU and its members did not stick to that principle. I favour it, too. The large corporations, particularly those in the United States of America, are more and more realising that if the law provides for long service and annual leave to be taken at a particulartimeit should be taken then. I concede that on a large number of occasions technical officers, administrative officers or specialists cannot be giventimeoff immediately. In those cases some dispensation must be made. But from a sociological, physiological and psychological point of view in the interest of the workers themselves, and given the fact that the mind and the body need refreshing frequendy, I beheve that it is in the best interests of this country to ensure that annual and long service leave are taken when it is avaUable. To sum up, I look at this matter from two points of view. I have asked myself whether, in the interests of the country and in the interests of ensuring that we achieve economic revival quickly, it is a proper measure. I have mentioned why I do not beheve that this legislation is in the best interests of the country. Secondly, I have very grave doubts about whether, given the guesswork or intuitive judgment of those concerned, the amount could even get as high as $600m. I believe that $ 100m would be the maximum. We will find out in the wash up. When we add together all the amounts that we think will be recovered by the various pieces of legislation-and see the Neimeyer statement for 1978-79-1 think we will find that the amount that will be saved by the Treasury will be very small. I make one final comment, and it has already been made by the honourable member for GelUbrand. I believe that the incidence of tax avoidance and evasion has become so bad that it amounts to a taxation conspiracy. Therefore I would like to see a brief relating to section 260 of the Act given to lawyers outside the Attorney General's Department with a view to devising some change to the legislation to enable it to stand up against tax avoidance schemes as interpreted by the High Court. When I was handUng the waterfront I had to brief professional counsel to prepare special legislation. It was successful. I believe that it can be done on this occasion. I also believe that an appeal ought to be made to the two great national taxation societies to use their prestige and authority to try to stop these shockingly bad tax evasion practices. They are bad in terms of moraUty. They are bad in terms of a perversion of what is in the best interests of the community. Therefore, I believe that drastic action ought to be taken in order to prevent them. Above all, at a time when the Government is seeking ways to reduce the deficit, let us hit tax avoidance and tax evasion, not legitimate commercial and business practices on which we will have to rely if this economy is to recover from stagnation. I could not vote for this Bill.",64
194,Mr ARMITAGE,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,"The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) foreshadowed in his speech earher this afternoon that he would be moving an amendment to the modon that the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) be read a second dme. I point out that this is a cognate debate and the proposed amendment relates to the Bill listed on the blue sheet as order of the day No. 2.I wish to outline the precise nature of that amendment, which reads: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view stituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House: (1) is of the opinion that: (a) despite the passage of considerable designed to close off tax avoidance the Government various well-known tax avoidance schemes; (b) the continued operation of a large scale tax avoidance industry is creating grave inequities in the incidence of taxation, substantiaUy reducing Government revenue, providing a substantial administrative burden for the Government, and imposing an increased legislative burden on the Parliament; (c) the process of countering tax avoidance schemes by the continual passage of complex legislation is cumbersome and inefficient; (d) the income tax law has already reached a state of exceptional complexity, and (e) continued resort tering tax avoidance will add greatly to the complexity of the tax law, and (2) therefore calls on the Government to redraft the income tax legislation with a view to increasing plicity and efficiency, to institute an effective annihilation provision based on Section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and to implement other general provisions designed to deter and restrict tax avoidance'. Because this is a cognate debate and that amendment has been foreshadowed, these are the areas of concern to which I wish to address my remarks. Undoubtedly the dramadc growth of the various types of tax avoidance schemes has created a very difficult situadon particularly for the taxadon office which has to counter such schemes. Unfortunately the Office has not been helped by the High Court which in a number of cases has found against the Office and in favour of those organisadons or companies which themselves have been conducting what could only be called the most outrageous tax avoidance schemes. I would like to cite a few of these cases which have come before the High Court and in which the Court has ruled against the Office and in favour of the tax avoider. One case involved the Curran scheme, another concerned South Austrahan Battery Makers Pty Ltd, with which I will deal in a moment. There was also the Cridlands case in 1977. Another was the Slutzkin case in 1977. In those last two cases the Court held that the provisions of secdon 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act did not apply. I wish to deal particularly with the minority judgment of Mr Justice Murphy in the High Court in the case of the Commissioner of Taxation, the appellant, and South Australian Battery Makers Pty Ltd, the respondent. The Acting Chief Judge was Justice Gibbs. The other judges were Justice Stephen, Justice Jacobs, Justice to subMurphy and Justice Aickin. I will quote from Justice Murphy's judgment one or two paragraphs which I think are of vital importance. All members of this Parhament, and particularly the legislation Executive arm of the Government, should take loopholes, note of them. The judgment says: has failed to legislate against Literal interpretations of the Act have allowed tax avoidance devices to succeed and have encouraged their growth. While the Act is read literally, no amount of legislative amendment will be able to stem the proliferation of such devices which are inconsistent with the general legislative intent. The strictly literal approach departs from the traditional respect of the courts for the legislative will. In his minority judgment Justice Murphy also said: Literal compliance with the terms of an Act is not enough if the real result is contrary to the general intention of the legislature. This approach should be taken to tax Acts. The appeal should be allowed. to the present means of counThat was the appeal by the Commissioner of Taxation. As I said, the High Court itself for some reason or other has departed from the its simpractices of the past when it did take account of the legislative intent. But now, time and again when the Court has to decide a case between the Taxation Office and some organisation which has been involved in some very blatant tax advoidance schemes-the Curran scheme is one very good example-i tfindsin favour of the tax avoider. I think that the Court should take into account that there is a legislative intent and that legislative intent should prevail. It is obvious that the Executive wishes to get rid of these tax avoidance schemes. Accordingly, the wiU of the legislature should apply. I particularly wish to deal with paragraph (2) of the proposed amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) As I said, the amendment will be moved later by the honourable member for GelUbrand. Paragraph (2) of the amendment reads: (2) therefore calls on the Government to redraft the income tax legislation with a view to increasing its simplicity and efficiency, to institute an effective annihilation provision based on Section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment and to implement other general and restrict tax avoidance. When the Act was first printed it comprised 90 to pages. Today it is over 700 pages. I invite honourable members to have a look at the large number of amendments now lying on the table simply for the purpose of closing some of the tax avoidance loopholes. If the changes keep going at this rate it will be no time at all before the Act will comprise about 1,000 pages. The Act is getting more complicated every day and it is a lawyer's feast. It is well and truly dme that the Government woke up to the fact that there can be only one final answer to this issue and that is to re-draft the Act and to re-draft it in such a way that no court can obviate or get around the will of the legislature. I also want to deal with that part of the proposed amendment which says that the Government has failed to legislate against various well known tax avoidance schemes. I will cite very good examples of this by referring to the Hansard records of 26, 27 and 28 September. I asked the Prime Minister questions regarding family trusts. I have pointed out in this House on a number of occasions that family trusts are one of the main tax avoidance schemes operating in this country today. Unfortunately they have been given some element ofrespectabilitybecause they are indulged in by some senior members of the Government such as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Lynch). On 26 September I asked the Prime Minister a question. The Prime Minister's answer is recorded at page 1352 of Hansard. He said: There are many people throughout this community . , . who believe that a fanuiy trust is necessary for the best discharge of their own familyresponsibilities, and the Government will not move away from that position. We are not going to be in a position any family trust, no matter what the circumstances may be. I repeat the words 'no matter what the circumstances may be'. In other words, no matter whether it is a family trust for tax avoidance purposes, whether it is a family trust which in the past has been used by people, including the Prime Minister himself, to avoid death duties the Prime Minister will not have the loophole plugged. He went on to say: Quite plainly, a family trust serves many purposes ought to be stated quite plainly that this Government been very concerned about the breaking up of family farms. It has been very concerned about the breaking up of businesses and, in a high tax situation, especially was low profitability in many small businesses and on many Act, farms-unde r those circumstancesprovisions designed to deter I emphasise thismany people introduced family trusts to enable their assets be held together, their farms preserved . . . I will refer to this again later. The Prime Minister used those same words in a statement he made to his electorate on 8 October this year. Incidentally, I have quoted that part of the Prime Minister's answer as a good example of his straight out, flat refusal to correct the large scale avoidance of tax and death duties in the past by the use of family trusts and these involved interlocking companies that he himself has such as Fraser Properties Pty Ltd, the Nareen Pastoral Co. and L.J.W. Nominees Pty Ltd. These are the types of propositions that are involved in this instance. The Prime Minister went on to say: I admitted at thetimeofthe last election that I have a family trust, and there is no reason why that should not stand. That is what the Prime Minister said on 26 September. Mr Birney-At what page?",66
195,Mr ARMITAGE,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,"At page 1354 of Hansard. On 27 September he is reported at page 1430 of Hansard as saying: Before the last election I never hid the fact that I had a family trust. I made it perfectly plain also that the purposes of family trusts have generally been to hold a family's assets together . . . Those remarks will be seen also in the speech made by the Prime Minister on 8 October. He went on to say: Does a trust mean that less tax would be paid than otherwise would be the case? That is the general result of trusts. I emphasise that the Prime Minister said: ""That is the general result of trusts'. In other words, he admitted it. He went on to say: I do not know of any trust which has been established to look after the family interests which does not also have that result. At page 1484 of Hansard of 28 September the of denigrating any person with Prime Minister is reported as saying: There is no doubt, if we are prepared to face what had been occurring plainly in Australia, that the tax laws of this country-the weight of taxation, the punitive nature of death, estate and gift duties-ha d caused people in small businesses of many kinds, whether in country towns, in the cities, or on farms, in an effort to hold those businesses together and to leave something to their childrenI emphasise thatto enter into a degree of complicationand it One can say 'complication' again. One ought to has see how involved are these intricate series of family companies and trusts that he himself has. The when there Prime Minister continued: . . . in their affairs especially in a low income which has been typical of many small farms or otherwise. I would now like to quote what the Prime Minister said in his electorate talk on 8 October. He said: Repressive and unfair taxation tax evasion. He went on to say: Punitive taxes forced many small businessmen and farmers into a situationI emphasise thiswhere they were obliged to make arrangements to ensure the continuity of their enterprises. I ask honourable members to note the similarity of what the Prime Minister said on this occasion and what he said in the House. The Prime Mmisation ter in his electorate talk went on to say: Many of the complex arrangments which people entered over the years were simply designed to keep family and businesses together. Is that not what I read from the Hansard record? In other words, not only was the Prime Minister avoiding income taxation by this extraordinary complex series of companies and trusts that he has but also he was avoiding death duties. Is any wonder that this government moves quickly to aboUsh death duties, gift duties and the like? Is it any wonder that we on this side of the House speak of the need for members, and particularly members of the Cabinet from the top right down, to declare their pecuniary interests? It would be very interesting to those pecuniary interests made pubUc because then we would know whether members of the government, not matter what party were in office, were acting in the interests of the the people as a whole and not in their own individual interests. It is very obvious, I think, from what shown this afternoon that the Government's actions in legisladon on death duties and gift duties and its refusal to close up the loophole respect of family trusts have been taken in the interests of individual and senior members of Government itself. Have a look at some of the names involved in the Nareen Pastoral Co. They are John Malcolm Fraser, Tamara Margaret Sandford Fraser, Sandford Robert Beggs, that Rupert James Hamer, Una Arnold Fraser and Harry Vincent Sampson. These names are listed in a statement of change of persons in relation whom a business name is registered. This inforthe mation was obtained as a result of a search ried out at the office of the Commissioner for Corporate Affairs in Melbourne. The names situation associated with the L.J.W.

197,Mr ARMITAGE,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,"I withdraw that. Let me say that it does not relate to the controversial matters that are before this Parliament at the moment.

200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,Order! The mass of honourable member's time has expired.,68
201,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,"In rising to support these taxation BUls, I think that I have often we learn nothing as we go from one amendment to the other. We seem to hear the same diatribe everytimefrom the speaker who in preceded me. It is a great pity that he resorts to the type of character assassination and vindictive the crusade that he has carried through this Parliament. I had hoped that the Federal Parliament would have been more constructive. It is a great pity that many of the constructive suggestions have come forward in this debate have been ruined by the sort of remarks that have been made. There is a sense of uniformity between the to Opposition and the Government on this matter; Income Tax Assessment Act we have today cardoes demand instant and immediate review. Before I get on to that broader subject, I want to speak on the amendments before us, the main one being an amendment relating to accrued long service leave and annual leave. I should like to make it plain, as did the honourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon), that in no sense can this be classed as a tax avoidance measure. It merely seeks clarify what is stiU a very muddied stream of undemanding. The Flood case, which was once regarded as being the authority in this regard, has been overtaken by the events case, and even that, if read by itself, is actually a determination made in connection with one award. No longer can we say with any clarity what is the situation one way or the other with annual leave and long service leave. While the case is on appeal to the High Court, I beheve respect of both parties, the matter will remain this situation of uncertainty and thefinaldecision will deterrnine the abihty of taxpayers to take advantage of a situation some 12 to 18 months arrears. The amount involved has been because, estimated by the authorities at some $600m. I not in a position to say whether that is correct not, but I recall that on a previous occasion, when it was suggested that we might allow a deavaUable duction for taxation purposes of all long service leave accrued to that point, the cost was some $2.5 billion. So in respect of an annual accrual, $600m may be thefigure.However, nobody is in a position to say one way or the other. It has been said that in some respects this lation is retrospective. Of course, retrospectivity is a matter that has been tossed around a lot this Parhament over the last 12 months. I think retrospectivity must be considered in terms taking from an individual his expectation of what he might normally have regarded as the normal practice. Up to die time of Nilsen's there was no expectation in regard to this matter in the minds of taxpayers throughout Australia, in spite of the fact that accountants had been asked to make sure of these provisions and cruals for accounting records. There was pectation that a taxation deduction was involved, although many would have hoped that that was the case. So the legislation is not retrospective that sense because it has been dated 1 July Very few people in the community would have had an expectation of getting such a taxation duction for the year ended 30 June 1977 and tainly not for 30 June 1978. As I have said, by amendment to section 51 the legislation puts the situation in its proper perspective, without reservation. In that regard, it is unfortunate the Government could not take this opportunity, along with the Asprey Committee's recommendation, to aUow these amounts as taxation deductions in the time they are accrued. I believe such a course would assist to some extent the right Uquidity of small business and big business throughout Australia. Unfortunately, the budgetary situation did not aUow the Governto ment to make a commencement in this year, although it would have been a great opportunity. However, as all other speakers in this debate have said, I hope that in subsequent years the deof Nilsen's duction will be forthcoming. Other aspects of the Bill to which reference has been made by previous speakers include current year losses, and I want to pay a litde attention to that because it is the subject of criticism. As we in have heard, the size of the Act has grown from in 90 pages to 600 pages. This is a simple piece of legislation in relation to what it wdl achieve in terms of cost, but some 42 pages will be added to in the existing Act. The provision is very complex from my understanding of it, it endeavam ours to place an accounting interpretation on a or division of profits during the year. In a normal commercial sense, this practice has not been in the past, and this has led to complications. It is just not the fact that the Taxation Commission has not been allowed a discretion. The amendment should have been considered from the point of view of the actual cost to revenue. Having determined that, one should then have looked at the amendment and asked whether it was worthwhile to do it in this way or legiswhether some concession should be allowed through a taxpayer being able to carry back in losses. The current year's loss situation rather staggers me when one compares the length of the of legislation and what it is endeavouring to do. Dividend stripping and branch profits taxes case are amongst the matters that have been mentioned. I want to take up the matter of the branch profits tax because the honourable member for Gelhbrand (Mr Willis) when he opened the deacbate for the Opposition, mentioned the old no exannual, the situation of Utah Development Company. I think it is onlyrightand proper that I should read into Hansard the situation in rein lation to Utah. If Utah had not come to Australia 1977. vast tracts of land, particularly in inland Queensland, still would not be developed. We dewould still be running one beast to a thousand ceracres. Today that area has two thriving townthe ships paid for by Utah Development. In 1977, 56.5 per cent of its gross profit was paid to the any Commonwealth Government and the that Queensland Government in taxes, royalties, payroll tax and so on. I want to make the point that that is not a bad collecuon by a government that has no other interest, participation or responsibility in this development. It should also be recognised that that S6.S per cent does not include rail freight to the coast which is paid by the company and includes a fairly considerable margin of profit for the Queensland Government. So excluding that, 56.5 per cent of the gross profits as defined by the company goes to the Queensland and Austrahan governments. Of course, with this branch profits tax there will be an additional margin for the Commonwealth. We should also remember in relation to Utah that, while the Government is not responsible, it is probably the biggest participant as far as dividend sharing of the profits is concerned. At this moment the company is conducting trials at underground collieries which indicates to me that it is encouraging development. It is prepared to tackle the development of the secondary coal seams at a lesser profit just to maintain its faith with its employees, the State of Queensland and the nation of Austraha. I just wanted to mention that briefly in thetimeavailable to me. I return to the remarks made by the honourable member for Chifley. They were the remarks that he normally makes when he discusses tax Bills. I had occasion to make some comments on his remarks during the second reading debate on, I think, the Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 1) 1978. Unfortunately, I have to make similar comments again. If the honourable member were to look at the amendments which were announced in the 1977 Budget he would realise that there is very little advantage to be gained today from setting up a trust for a child under the age of 16 and that there is very Uttle avenue for a zero rating. The penalty rates of 50 per cent to 60 per cent can be appUed more to those smaUer margins of income than can the normal rates at the other end of the scale. In this regard it is very difficult these days to persuade a lawyer to draw up a trust agreement for a chtid on the basis that the purpose is to save tax because that no longer is the situation. So I suggest that the honourable member for Chifley reads the fine print of the legislation that was introduced following the 1977 Budget announcement and examine what constructive measures the Government has taken in the trust area. One would imagine from the comments that have been made that nothing has been done. That is far from the truth. I think it reflects vague knowledge that the honourable member for Chifley has of the Act that he makes these aUegations in the House all thetime.Of course, is easy to say that if one had the opportunity would have done certain things. We acted on those opportunities by doing the things I have just recalled. The Labor Party also had the opportunity to do something in regard to trusts in the period that it was in office. That was the period when the greatest proliferation of trusts for tax avoidance purposes occurred in the history of taxation in Austraha. I ask the honourable member to look at the situation which appUes at thetimebefore he makes aUegations in this place against people who have trusts. I disagree with his view that it is the responsibUity of the Taxation Office to review the Act and update it. It is the responsibUity of this Government and this Parliament to do that. I hope that that is something that will be achieved, particularly as I feel that the views of the Opposition and those of the members of the Government are one in this regard. I noted on a date block not so many weeks ago die thought that a human being is born with two ears and one mouth and should use them in those proportions. I suggest that politicians, and officers of the Taxation Office, should go into the marketplace, which is where the taxes are collected to get the feelings of the people and to Usten to what they have to say about it. The message that I get loud and clear from a normal taxpayer in this country and the ordinary accountant and lawyer is one of utter despair in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Act. For the accountants and the lawyers, the change and complexity of the Act is a continuing feature which makes it almost incomprehensible. For the taxpayer, there is not only this aspect to consider but also the continuing inequity between the situations of one class of taxpayer and another, even though they might enjoy the same level of income. I can understand the situation occurring of a taxpayer in this country earning an income identical to that of his neighbour and yet having to pay a larger amount of tax because he is not able to take advantage of schemes which are legal under the Act and which minimise the amount of tax paid by the neighbour. WhUe this situation exists, more and more tax avoidance will occur. More people will be prepared to take the gamble, if they are given the chance, not to record their fuU income and thereby try to lessen the impact of tax on their Uves and their incomes. Anybody can come into this place and say that the we can lower the tax rates and that we can stamp out the known tax avoidance areas but that will not change the tendency towards tax avoidance. it I can recaU the American taxpayers rebelling in one exacdy the same way about 10 years ago because they felt that they received no thanks for the payment of foreign aid to other nations. The American taxpayer just could not accept that situation any further. That resulted in major tax avoidance in that country. Today in Austraha we see the same thing occurring for another reason, namely, that there is no equity between the tax paid by one taxpayer and another. On Thursday of last week, I think it was, during a speech in the Adjournment Debate an honourable member made a very valid suggestion which I believe could form the basis of the creation of a litde more equity in relation to taxation matters. His suggestion was that a family unit and not the individual should be taxed so that a family in which the husband earns a salary and the wife stays at home has the advantage of spreading that income with his wife and getting the benefit of that, as would apply with the nontaxable ceiling that the neighbours would have if the two of them were at work. I beheve that this is a responsible way of achieving equity under the Act. A reduction in taxation rates might help in some way to achieve that equity, but I believe that we have to go back to the start and review the Act, defining 'income' even if it means including capital gains tax, and then minimise the number of exemptions and exceptions to the payment of tax on that amount. It is significant that the size of the Income Tax Assessment Act has increased from 90 pages to 600 pages. Since 1901 the Constitution has not changed in size, yet that Constitution can still be understood quite thoroughly by anybody who reads it. I am sure that if we were to return to the situation of having the Income Tax Assessment Act written in plain and clear language we could avoid many of the traps into which we have fallen in relation to that Act. We need to cooperate with the specialists. I feel that, as the right honourable member for Lowe has suggested, an approach to those people who administer the A a in the marketplace would be a good start. At this stage I refer to a question I asked yesterday, which I believe reflects the concern and despair of people outside this place who have to pay tax. My question was in these terms: Will the Government, as part of its tax reform program, review the whole principle of the taxation ofincome with a view to simplifying the Act, discouraging avoidance, ing equity and providing incentives for the earning of income? If we do that, I believe that we wiU be going a long way towards satisfying the requirements those Australians who are being called upon to finance the running of this nation. The whole Aa wiU always be under pressure and probe, particularly while it is in its present form. WhUe the Act grows in volume but lessens in comprehension through the closure of loopholes, the granting of concessions and exemptions and the widening of the gap between accounting principles and taxation procedures, these probes by the taxpayers wiU become increasingly successful. In this regard government, through the ever increasing incomprehensible Income Tax Assessment Aa, wiU be held further in contempt. That wiU apply irrespective of whether it is a conservative government or a Labor government. The amendments that are before the House quite clearly do not constitute anti-avoidance procedures or legislation but are just aspects that seek to clarify the Aa. But in the more general sense I believe that we have to look at the whole aspect of taxation of income in Austraha. We have to look at the whole aspect of how this Government coUects its revenue in order to ensure that we can rely on the pubUc and the people in the professions to make certain that that money is coUected but that an equitable situation is still retained so that the taxpayers are encouraged to go out and earn more. In that way this nation can prosper through the increased coUections of taxation. I have much pleasure in supporting these BUls.",68
202,Mr LES JOHNSON,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,"Much of what was stated by the previous speaker in the debate, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) makes sense and I do not find myself at variance with him. The House has five BUls before it at the presenttime.It is extremely complex legislation. It is sufficient to say that despite this legislation and its ultimate passage through the Parliament, the Government will be found to be ineffective and innocuous in legislating against the various well known tax avoidance schemes. The honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr Willis) has indicated that he will move an amendment at a later stage. It impUes that there will be a continued operation of a large scale tax avoidance industry. This is creating grave inequities in the incidence of taxation. Indeed, the schemes are also having the effect of substantiaUy reducing government revenue. I will just make brief mention of some of the BUls before us. Thefirstone is the Income Tax grantAssessment Amendment Bill (No. 3). This Bill deals with and clarifies the position of entitlement of employers to deductions for the cost of their employees' long service, annual and of other leave entitlements. The Bill puts beyond doubt that an employer is entitled to claim as a taxdeduction in the year payment was made any payments made to employees for long service leave, et cetera. The Government's decision to amend the Act by this Bill is based on two factors. The first is, the Victorian Supreme Court decision in the case of NUsen Development Laboratories Pty Ltd v. the Federal Commissioner of Taxation which held that an employer was able to claim a deduction in respect of a Lability to pay long service leave to employees for any one year the UabUity accrued even though no actual payment was made to employees in that year. The revenue impUcations of not legislating to meet that position would mean a loss to the Treasury of approximately $600m next financial year. It is gratifying at least to note that the Bill does not affect the employees' tax position. The Government has indicated that it intends to legislate further, depending on the results of the appeal in the NUsen case. No doubt we wdl hear more of this matter in the future. The next Bill with which we are dealing is the Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 2) which deals with tax avoidance schemes. They are schemes relating to, for example, current year losses. That is a practice of buying loss companies and offsetting these losses against profits of compames owned. The schemes also deal with rebates on dividends received as part of dividend stripping operations and branch profit tax. Compames could avoid tax UabUity by firsdy claiming a fuU rebate of tax on dividends received in the course of dividend stripping and also a deduction for the loss on sale of snares after value had been dropped because of the loss of the dividend. This Bill introduces tax measures designed to promote investment in AustraUanfilms.It also amends the period of distribution by the liquidators of private companies and alters the appeal provisions for deregistered agents. The provisions designed to prevent tax avoidance through dividend stripping are to operate from 7 Apnl 1978 which was the date on which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced the Government's decision to act. This issue, of course, invoked the controversial retrospectivity factor which has already been thrashed out in this Parliament The Income Tax (Non-Resident Companies) Bill 1978 imposes a 5 per cent branch profits tax on the taxable income of non-resident companies to bring into line companies operating in Australia but which, for tax purposes, are resident overseas, with companies resident in Australia which are Uable for dividend withholding tax on profit remittance. In his statement on this tax, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) said that the purpose of the Bill was to ensure that the benefit Australia obtains from foreign investment by way of tax revenue is not reduced because of the form in which operations are conducted here. Branch profit taxes are imposed by other countries and such a tax was recommended for Australia by the Asprey Committee sometimeago. The Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Act is not imposing the branch profit tax. Another machinery Bill, the Income Tax (Rates) Amendment Bill 1978, simUarly makes it clear that the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1976 does not impose a branch profit tax. We now come to this tax avoidance issue which is a main theme of the legislation. It is certainly the main theme of the debate and it revolves around the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2). This Bill continues the stated Government objective of closing off tax avoidance schemes. I commend the Treasurer for taking this action. He says that he intends to continue to act against avoidance schemes. I am not conceding by any means that sufficient has been done in this regard. Severe budgetary problems are probably the motive for the Government's action. I think it is necessary to say that the government's formed by the Liberal and Country parties during the long 23 years of unbroken government that they enjoyed did not make any significant moves to close the tax avoidance scheme. Even when in Opposition the coaUtion faUed to press or call for legislation against tax avoidance schemes. This Opposition has caUed for a concerted approach to tax avoidance schemes and not just a piecemeal approach or a one-off approach. We think that there is a good example in evidence but we want to see more done. Last month, the Treasurer was asked whether the Government would consider amending section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1978. This section was designed to catch all the schemes to avoid taxation. Honourable members will know the main theme of the section. A little notation beside section 260 of the Act describes the provisions as, 'Contracts to evade tax void'. That is the position in a nutsheU. I shall summarise that section briefly. It states that every contract, agreement, or arrangement altering the incidence of any income tax, relieving any person from UabUity to pay, defeating, evading or avoiding any duty or habiUty, preventing the operations of this Act in any respect shall be absolutely void. That is the effect of section 260. This section, notwithstanding the clear expression of the words which would seem to the layman to be fairly watertight, has been emasculated over the years by judicial interpretation. More than 20 years ago Mr Justice Kitto said in the case of the Federal Commissioner of Taxadon v. Newton, (1956): Section 260 is a difficult provision, inherited from earlier legislation, and long overdue for reform by someone will take the trouble to analyse tions with precision before putting pen to paper. This message, despite its clarity, seems not to have reached its intended destination up to this time. In the recent case of Cridland v. Comvidual missioner of Taxation (1978) it was stated: Although the very restricted operation conceded to by the course of judicial decision and the generality language in which the section is expressed stand in trast, the construction of the fore a source of some surprise that it continues to upon when its defects and deficiencies have been apparent for so long. When the issue of amending section 260 was put to the Treasurer he said that it was not an matter and it ought not to be assumed, given terpretations of revenue statutes, that it is simply a question of re-arranging some of the words. indicated, Justice Kitto thought 20 years ago. No amending legislation has been put forward by successive governments. The Whidam Labor Government, facing a hostile Senate, did not have any hope of passing legislation. Anything that it tried to do to injustices of this kind at thattimewas blocked the Senate. If the Fraser Government is fair dinkum about tax avoidance schemes it must seen legislate to change this section. The Australian community should not have to wait much longer to see it happen. A suitable amendment to the following effect would not be opposed: If transthe actions, Heatings or financial affairs of a taxpayer are artificial or contrived, the tax liability of the taxpayer concerned may be determined accordcigarettes, ing to the commercial reaUties; provided of diture course that machinery for judicial appeal and remained to protect the individual from the Commissioner's excesses. One would not want the bureaucracy to be able to runriot.There has to be some checkpoint, some redress. Therefore that appeal provision would be essential. The Opposition's priority tax reform is motivated by a sense of tax not, as is the case with the Government, by the sole need to increase tax receipts. The taxation system that is operating in this country at this time is not equitable. It has manifestly faded distribute wealth. One per cent of the Australian population owns 22 per cent of aU wealth Australia, five per cent of the population owns 40 per cent of all wealth and ten per cent of population owns 60 per cent of aU wealth, acadded-th cording to a survey that was conducted recendy by an Australian university. This means that the wealthiest 2,000 people in Australia own as much as the poorest 2,232,000 people. Tax revenue for the year 1977-78 amounted to who 91 per cent of total receipts. This is estimated to his ideas and define his intenrise marginaUy to 91.2 per cent this financial year. Pay-as-you-earn taxation which was collected last year was 41.1 per cent, other individual taxes were 10.6 per cent, giving a total inditax component of 51.7 per cent of total tax receipts. Company taxes collected were 13.7 per s. 260 cent and other indirect taxes brought in 25.6 per of the cent of tax revenue. This year's Budget is high conexpected to bring in tax revenue in the following section is now settled. It is therebe relied proportions-som e changes are worth noting: 39.7 per cent from pay-as-you-earn taxation, that is, direct tax- a marginal drop; ten per cent from individual taxpayers- a slightly larger drop; 12.9 easy per cent from companies-onc e again a drop; inand 28.6 per cent from other indirect taxes- a significant increase indeed, that is, from 25.6 per As cent. The shift from direct taxation to indirect otherwise over taxation is apparent. The Government's response is to legislate against the most blatant tax avoidance schemes on a one-off basis, such as the Curran scheme such and the schemes that have been legislated redress against in Income Tax Assessment Amendment in Bill (No. 2) 1978 and proceed to this new emphasis. We aU know what it is about. We have early manifestations of it. First of all, we have seen as a result of the Budget the raising of individual tax by 8 per cent. I think that represented a tax grab of $570m, breaking all promises that were made at election time. Then there was this trend towards increased indirect taxes with the raising of the excise on beer, spirits and petrol. Government expenwas reduced by shifting the cost of services faculties, which were previously paid for by governments from tax receipts, directly on to the individual. I refer of course to the health scheme and pre-school centres where the consumer is being required to contribute more in a direct way. The reduction in the social wage means that taxpayers have to spend more of their take home for pay on services that were previously and traequity ditionally provided by government. The Government's taxing pohcy is not based on equity or substantial reform; it is based on to minor reform of blatant abuse in order to keep the inequitable system intact. It is for this reason in that the Government, with its budgetary restraint, is seeking to introduce new indirect taxes, the such as the retaU turnover tax and the value e VAT-tax . We are mindful that it has faded its pubUc relations exercise concerning a reduction of taxation with the Budget decision to increase direct taxes by 8 per cent. The Treasurer talks of introducing more indirect taxes in order to change the mix of tax in the community. The effects of last year's indirect tax slugs on beer, spirits and cigarettes have meant that consumers will pay an extra $500m a year. The excise on beer has gone up by 31.8 per cent, from 29.2c a bottle to 38.5c a botde. Of course that involves an extra tax on beer of $222m. The tax on whisky has increased by 83.5 per cent, from $2.91 to $5.34 a botde. The tax on brandy has increased from $3.06 to $5.63 a botde. The extra revenue collected from spirits is $139m. The tax on cigarettes was increased by 35 per cent, from 34.6c to 46.8c a packet. That means an extra take of $ 136m. The tax on petrol is up 6 per cent, from 4.9c to 5.2c a litre. In the last three years the cost of beer has increased from 54c to 77c a botde; the cost of cigarettes has increased from 74c to 89c a packet; and the cost of petrol has increased from 14.5c over 19c a htre. Pay-as-you-earn taxpayers and individual taxpayers pay for these increases from their take home pay. An introducuon of new direct taxes will increase the price of these goods and other goods even more significandy in the future. If the Government decides to introduce retail turnover tax the prices of all goods, ing food and clothing, are likely to rise. The burden on all Australians,regardlessof their abUity to pay, will rise uniformly. This means that a disproportionate tax those Australians who are least able to pay. It actually means a drop in the standard of living of the majority of Australians. It means that an intolerable burden would placed onretaUersand smaU shopkeepers who would become the tax gatherers of the nadon. would be a greattime-consuming,administraincreased tively costly and unwieldy process. It would be a most ridiculous arrangement which anyone who travels overseas finds to be most repugnant. Depending precisely on how this tax would collected, it could mean that shoppers would be pubUc. very seriously inconvenienced. It is no wonder that members of parUament have pouring into our electorate offices these letters of protest. wonder petitions are being circulated, quite jussharply. tifiably, by the retaU traders associations and cent other organisations. I sound this note of warning because the Fraser Government has faded to be effective in closing off tax avoidance schemes. has gained such unpopularity because of its broken promises in regard to giving remissions on direct taxation and is now going to move dexation, towards the surreptitious, the sneaky, tax. knows about the Australian hip pocket nerve and it will bring this new emphasis to bear where the unsuspecting Australian will have the Treasurer's hands sneaking into his pocket when he does not know much about it. This involves the abandonment of the principle of capacity to pay which has been inherent as the main philosophical cornerstone of our taxation system through the years. I warn the Austrahan people that the Fraser Government is intent on this process. If it goes unchecked, the Uving standards of aU Australians will be seriously impaired.",71
203,Mr BRADFIELD,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,"Much has been said by the Opposition about the Government's aUeged faUure in thefieldof taxation. It is rather surprising that members of the Opposition should talk about the so-caUed faUure of this Government when, during the Labor Party's term of office, from 1972 to 1975, it did nothmg for the Australian taxpayer except to increase the tax burden on them. Since 1975, when this to Government came to office, regardless of what has been said by the Opposition, the Austrahan taxpayer has benefited greatly from the tax reinforms put forward-ta x reforms that will continue. It would be wrong of me not to refer to tax indexation, which in the three years in which this a Government has been in power has saved the includAustralian public about $3,000m. That is tax $3,000m a year that the Australian pubhc would have had to pay had we continued with the taxation system left to us by our predecessors, now burden will faU on the Opposition. Members of the Opposition talk about the growth in taxation. That is quite incorrect. If one were to study the total pay-as-you-earn tax colbe lected as shown at page 213 of Budget Paper No. 1, and analyse thosefiguresand make adjustIt ments for the consumer price index and for the force, one would see an interesting pattern emerge. For example, in 1971-72 there was a general increase in PAYE tax of 11.4 per cent. In 1973-74, a general increase in PAYE tax of be 20.1 per cent was thrust upon the Australian In 1974-75, a simUarfigure,19.9 per cent, was involved. In December 1975 there was a change of government. Tax indexation came No onto the scene and the increases started to faU Thefigureof 20.1 per cent fell to 3.5 per in 1975-76. In 1976-77 it rose to 7.6 per cent, but in the year 1977-78 it feU to a mere 0.5 per cent. The estimate for this year, after allowIt ing for consumer price index adjustments, there will be a net fall in PAYE tax of 0.3 per cent. Of course, apart from the benefits of tax init is important to remind the Australian It people and the Opposition of what this Government has done with tax avoidance during the last 12 months. We have taken steps to outlaw the so called Curran scheme. We have taken steps against current year losses. We have taken away the abuse of the averaging provisions. We have stopped dividend stripping and we have rectified and altered the trust laws to stop trust stripping. We have altered laws to cut out the tax avoidance schemes that people have been able to maintain through pre-paid rent and interest We have stopped the abuse of the gift provisions. We have stopped the avoidance through share trading in loss compames. Tonight we will introduce legisladon to stop malpractices in sales tax. Tax indexation and all these measures against tax avoidance have been introduced because we care for people. We want the people of Australia to share fairly the tax burden they should bear. We want to continue tax reform. I shall refer briefly to some of the things that the Labor Government did not do when in power between 1972 and 1975. Today members of the Opposition are talking about all the things which we should do and which we are not doing. All of a sudden they have become educated in tax laws; they have become experts. Let me remind members of the Opposition of what their Government did not do during the 1972 to 1975 period. First of all, it refused to bring in tax indexation. It needed the money; it could not afford indexation. While Labor was in power it increased the receipts from personal income tax by 89 per cent. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), who has just left the chamber, talked about increases in indirect tax. The Labor Government increased indirect taxes by $602m. So I fail to understand how members of the Opposition can talk about what we have not done when their Government failed to do so much during its term of office. However, I do respect some parts of the speech made by the honourable member for Hughes. He was the only member of the Opposition who acknowledged the fact that this Government had made attacks upon those people engaged in tax avoidance schemes. But I was surprised to hear him say that the Opposition puts a priority on tax reform and tax equity. I had not heard of this before; I did not realise that the Labor Party had a policy of tax reform and tax equity. That is exactly what our pohcy is, and that is the policy that we will pursue. I turn now to the Bills that are before this House. I want to mention one of them in particuof lar, and that is the Income Tax Assessment for Amendment Bill (No. 3). This Bill rectifies the situation that was brought about by the NUsen Development Laboratories case in the Victorian Supreme Court. A judgment was handed down in favour of that company to the effect that business enterprises are able to make a tax deduction for hoUday pay and long service leave not yet paid to the recipients. This practice had not been accepted as normal business practice in industry. Had the situation not been rectified, some $600m-that is the figure mentioned by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), although I do not put it so high-woul d have been lost to revenue. Other provisions in the legislation have been mentioned already. Some deal with the lump sum payments on retirement Previously, only 5 per cent of such sums attracted tax. Still only 5 per cent of lump sum payments for superannuation attracts tax. Unfortunately an adjustment has been made which stops people accumulating hohday pay and long service leave pay and paying tax on only 5 per cent on the payment they take in heu. I have some sympathy for the many people who have come into my office and made representations about this adjustment. I know that some people have been disadvantaged by this legislation. Nevertheless, the system as it stood only created a situation in which people tended to terminate their employment on a continuing basis. This is bad for industry and it is bad for people. Long service leave is provided to reward a person for long service in his job. Holiday leave is provided to enable people to take an annual hohday and to have a rest from their normal occupation. I have had representations about this matter from people in the Local Government Association, from people employed in the transport industry and from people employed in the buUding industry. Nevertheless, I support the Government on this legislation. Other provisions in the Bill alter the tax averaging provisions for primary producers. As I represent a metropoUtan seat, I am afraid that I know very Uttle about such provisions although you, Mr Deputy Speaker, may know a little more. There are also penalties for anyone who wilfully underestimates provisional taxation. They are there to stop people doing sUly things and getting themselves into a situation where they cannot meet their taxation commitment. There are also in this legislation alterations to rebates for concessional tax deductions exceeding $1,590, and a lot of other minor adjustments to the Act. There are alterations to rebates for dependants residing overseas. One necessary part the legislation says that the 2Vi per cent levy health insurance need be collected no longer. With regard to that matter, people are doing all sorts of funny calculations to work out increases in the tax scale as from 1 November as a result of an alteration in the surcharge. They are not taking into consideration the fact that no longer is the 2V2 per cent levy payable. Removal of the levy tends to help people reach a reduced tax situation. The final part of this legislation to which I want to refer deals with the alteration to the tax scale, the unfortunate IVi cents in the dollar charge which this Government has had to refer impose- a temporary surcharge-is embodied the legislation and automatically cuts out on June 1979. That is proof that this Government intends that surcharge to be a temporary situinstitute. ation. However, along with that surcharge, the increase of 1 Vi cents in the dollar, there are generous measures which help to reduce tax commitments. The amount of income exempt from taxation has now been increased from $3,750 to $3,893-that helps people tax considerably-and the rebate for a dependant wife has been increased from $555 to $597. I move now to some of the percentage adjustdecisions ments that these alterations make to people's comes. I have been concerned at recent reports the Press where all sorts of speculation have octainly curred. Calculations have been made to show that the change which came into operation from 1 November increased people's taxation to figures as high as lOVj per cent. That I say of rubbish. I have some calculations here and I wish to tell the people what the 1 Vi cents in the dollar increase means. Firstly, it was never the intention of this Government to indicate to people that the increase was only \Vi per cent. When the previous standard rate of 32 cents in the dollar was increased to 33.5 cents in the lar, it amounted to an increase of 4.075 per People are miscalculating in that they are not calculating on a per annum basis but rather calbefore culating for a period of eight months. Even just though this increase in the surcharge is effective over a 12-months period, the Taxation Office only commenced to collect it from 1 November. A 4.075 per cent increase in an eight months period works out at 7 per cent. Anyone who gets afigurebeyond 7 per cent is not being honest with the system. I have done calculations for comes of $10,000 per annum without dependturnover tax. ants, $10,000 per annum with a wife, $15,000 per annum without dependants and $15,000 per annum with a wife, and the result is a similar centage just mentioned. The Government is continuing its pohcy taxation reform. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) mentioned that we are grappling with section 260 of the Act which, legally, has not been very successful over years. It is important that we grapple with this section-as we are doing at the moment-that cuts out particular schemes devised for tax avoidance. It is this Government's intention to continue with section 260 and to try to strengthen it so that legaUy it can achieve that purpose. The honourable member for Hughes also surmentioned retail turnover tax. I would like to to this matter because, like him, I have had in 400 or 500 letters in my office from people 30 complaining about this terrible retail turnover tax that the Government is supposedly going to This is not so. This Government does not intend to bring in a retail turnover tax. It has other made no statement to that effect. Contrary to speculative suggestions in the Press and those made by some retati organisations, the Government has made no decision on whether such a should be introduced. It has decided that there should be an inquiry into the practicalities of various forms of taxation because it wants to continue with taxation reform. It wants to make about whether the method of tax colinlection at the moment is the correct one or in whether there is a better and fairer method. Certhere is no intention to collect more tax. Of course, retati turnover tax may well be within the scope of such an inquiry but any decision would not be taken before ample opportunity had been is a lotgiven to assess the community response. The Government is looking continually at ways of trying to vary the form of taxation and is committed to tax reform. It cannot be committed to tax reform if it cannot look at all avenues of tax that are avaUable. I say to those people who dolare getting letters when they go to the local cent. supermarket- I daresay many people probably do not even consider what is in those lettersyou sign a roneoed letter and send it in, give some thought to what it says. I feel that many of the people who have shown concern or have sent these letters in have not taken a great deal of notice of what they are doing. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) has made statement after statement in the House about this matter. In answers to questions he has clearly shown that inthere has been no decision to impose a retaU The concern for taxation, for people and for pertax equity will be continued by this Government. I am sure that the people of Australia will receive, now and in the future, a far better tax deal of than they received during the dreadful years 1972 to 1975, a period when taxation ran rampant simply because inflation ran rampant. Now we have stabUity in the economy. Taxation is the gready reduced and is going to be reduced further. The Government is getting close to the situation where the people will be able to receive than a much fairer deal regarding taxadon commitAustralian ments. I fully support the Bills that we fore us at present and I believe that the people of Australia will benefit greatly as a result of them. saying:",74
204,Mr WEST,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,"This package of bills implements a variety of measures which include several attempts to close tax avoidance, such as acdon against shady compames which use the dividend stripping cedure to achieve double taxadon benefits. legisladon also imposes a branch profits tax on branches of an overseas company resident Australia. Apparently at present it is not possible to impose a dividend withholding tax profits remitted overseas by such branches. . The BUls also include measures to make tal investment in the Austrahan film industry more attracdve to investors. The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3) closes off the anomaly regarding taxadon deductions for the cost to employers of their employees' long service leave and annual leave arising from recent decision in the Supreme Court in Victoria concerning the NUsen Development Laboraplanation. tories Pty Ltd case. The Bill provides that ployers will be entitled only to deductions for purpose for leave payments in the year in which the actual payment is made to the employees. The Opposition is of the opinion that the branch profits tax ought to be not less than 8 per cent the taxable income of compames. I will return this issue later. In the main we support the legislation counter the NUsen case decision if for no other reason than that the $600m which the Treasurer says is involved in this matter could be far used to stimulate capital expenditure left with those employers who can fiddle this particular tax lurk. Before criticising the detaUs of these most complicated BUls I refer to one very important matter that the Treasurer promised his second reading speech of 8 June of this year to rectify. I refer to his promise adequately Australian individuals and companies on earnhave ings and dividends accruing from overseas. In second reading speech the Treasurer quite luing cidly explained why this was necessary. He said: The position is hotchpotch . . . because the rebate on inter-corporate dividends applies to dividends from seas as well as to dividends from within Australia, foreign dividends received by Australian companies are tax-free Australia, and this is so even out of which they are paid are not taxed in the country of source. He went on to say: The credit system of relief applies also to income, other salaries and wages, from Papua-New Guinea. All other foreign source income of Australianresidentsis exempt from tax if it is subject to tax, no matter how negligible, have bein the countiy from which it is derived. I remind the Treasurer that he concluded by The Government considers that such outdated and incontaxadon sistent rules cannot be retained. But events moved very quickly. The Treasurer proimmediately drew the crows from the large The companies resident in Australia which have overseas operations. Firstly, there were leaks in in the Australian Financial Review that the legaUy Treasurer was in trouble on the issue. The on Government back benchers then began to get restive. Of course, the compames involved were ropable. Their precious overseas tax havens, capiaided and nurtured by members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, were under chaUenge, and from a Liberal Treasurer, too. So, shamefully, on 25 October the Treasurer informed the House that the leaks were once the again right on Une. He dropped his daring proposal. What is more, he gave no satisfactory exHe covered his retreat with the emabsurdly obvious statement that many Austbis trahan companies see, as a direct consequence of a foreign tax system, an erosion of the competitive position of Australian compames overseas. He said that he was worried and concerned that of such taxes might have an adverse effect on the to level of Australian involvement in countries in the ASEAN region. He was worried about investment in the ASEAN region. What about into vestment in Australia? What about the investment by Australian companies being retained in Australia to create the jobs that are needed for better the army of unemployed created by the Prime rather than Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)? It is certain that unemployment in Australia will be officially over 500,000 early next year. As in the shadow Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations pointed out yesterday this does to tax not take into account the 305,000 people who dropped out of the official labour force of his civilian employees. Already in the manufacturindustry 67,000 jobs have been lost in the last two years. Employment in the clothing and footwear industries is down by 13,000 in the last year. In thetimberprocessing industry it is down over-by 7,000. Some 13,000 jobs have been lost in the in electrical appUances industry. Even 2,500 fewer people are engaged in mining. From where will if the dividends and the profits overseas the jobs come to provide employment for the 230,000 school leavers who will annually join the labour market in the foreseeable future? WUl they come from the rural sector? Hardly. Will they come from the mining sector? No, not on your life. That industry is the most capital intensive of all. Will the jobs be provided in the services sector? It seems that computers and word-processing machines will hit the tertiary sector very hard. No wonder bank employees are worried. It is said that technological change will revolutionise banking and finance and result in a reduction of staff numbers by at least one third of those now currendy employed. So it is of litde use for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer ghbly to argue that, as automation increases, Uving standards will rise and thus produce more growth and extra jobs in the tertiary sector. The plain fact is that we have reUed increasingly on this sector to take up the slack in employment since the Second World War. The tertiary sector will no longer take up that slack. So we must go back to the manufacturing base. It is of vital importance to ensure that jobs remain in manufacturing and that the Federal Government is intimately involved in assessing just where the potential for future growth in manufacturing Ues. I wtil not argue that we should simply rely on the buttons and levers approach, that is, by adjusting tariffs, offering extra incentives, domestic subsidies, implementing investment aUowances and so on. Any or aU of these things may be important in the future but they will not be any substitute for planned industry and manpower pohcies. So, given all these facts, how can this Government drop its proposals to tax the earnings of Australian companies which have transferred operations to South East Asia? The Government ought to befightingto retain jobs and not cravenly backing off from the struggle with those companies which reaUy, in a national sense, disloyaUy wish to move overseas to take advantage of cheap labour conditions and benign tax consideration. Recently I was requested to make approaches to the Minister for Trade and Commerce (Mr Lynch) on behalf of a company which imported from Malaysia some 40 per cent of its total Australian sales of children's apparel. The company argued that unless it could continue to do so the jobs of those who manufactured the 60 per cent Australian component would be at risk. I asked the company manager what he would do if he were able to make a choice in the event of a heavy reduction in tariffs. He said that in those circumstances his company would transfer aU its operations to Malaysia. The Minister must rethink his position on this matter. We should not be encouraging Australian companies to relocate overseas. Let me examine the proposals to implement a branch profits tax. The Government says that this is necessary because branches of overseas companies resident in Australia, whUst being liable for the 46 per cent Australian company tax paid on taxable income, are not Uable to be taxed, as are subsidiaries from overseas companies which remit dividends overseas. Obviously we support the branch profits tax, but why is it set at only 5 per cent? Apparendy the Government has assessed that 5 per cent will cover the amount that would have been raised by a dividend withholding tax at the current rate of 15 per cent that was imposed on an average of 60 per cent of after tax distributable income remitted abroad. A branch profits tax of 8 or 10 per cent not only would raise more revenue but also would certainly encourage companies to establish Austrahan subsidiaries rather than a branch operation which is far less subject to Australian governmental control. At any rate, a branch profits tax is a totaUy inefficient and ineffective method of raising revenue from the gross profits of companies such as ESSO-BHP in oU and Utah Development Company in coal. This Government will give to ESSO-BHP by 1980 a $700m handout from its new oU pohcies. Of course as everyone knows, when the 1977 import parity policy is phased in, government revenue from the oU industry will rapidly decline. SimUarly, in coal the Government is phasing out the coal export levy and refusing to replace it with a resources tax. A branch profits tax on Utah at the proposed rate would probably raise only $8m or $9m but a resources rent tax at a proposed threshold rate of, say, 15 per cent on invested capital and imposed at a rate of 70 per cent thereafter would have produced $95m last year in federal revenue. I believe that there also ought to be a resources tax implemented on the profits made from the extraction of our nonrenewable energy resources, particularly on overseas exports and I of course include coal and natural gas as logical areas for a Labor Government's resources rent tax. Yesterday in answer to a question on income tax avoidance the Treasurer said: . . . if one is to keep to a tolerable minimum the level of discretions which are available to the Commissioner of Taxation under the legislation it is very difficult to restrain the size or the rate of growth . . . of the Act when . . . legislating against individual practices . . . Quite clearly we do have a complicated taxation Act in this country. The Treasurer went on to say that it was necessary to reconsider the Federal taxation options open to the Government before attempting to simpUfy the whole of the taxation system. He then spoke of the much publicised inquiry into a retail turnover tax or a value added tax. Most overseas countries which have imposed the broadly based consumer taxes have opted for the VAT rather than the retail turnover tax. I beheve that both these taxes are undesirable in Australia. The value added tax is, of course, really a tax on final consumption of goods and services. It is strongly argued that it should be neutral which is really a euphemism for making it as broad as possible. I am opposed to the expansion of indirect taxation for a variety of reasons. Firstly, it should the last thing to be implemented in a country which is in the depths of a recession because really a tax on spending and it must be inflasit tionary. It would probably induce people to crease their savings, which are already at an torically high level, rather than to spend. It cumulative, and appUes at all stages of protroduce duction. All suppUers and producers pay the tax in the production process but each recoups ouday. The final total value added tax, which the end amounts to fixed percentage of the final cost, is of course paid for by the poor old coninitial sumer. He cannot pass it on; nor does he receive any tax credits. Furthermore, I think we ought to guments of the Prime Minister that a value added tax leaves a choice to the consumer of whether or not to purchase-bu t no one, he says, can escape an income tax. What nonsense. How Ulogical. He is reaUy inciting people not to purthe chase, which of course is impracticable. Obvimoved ously, broadly based consumer taxes would inBUls clude taxes on food and clothing, housing, rent, perhaps even second hand goods; public should transport and even services such as the tourist and entertainment industry would not escape. Many of the Government back benchers say they are most concerned about those industries. How can they support extra taxes on them! The argument that we should tax by means value added taxes the wealthy people who conthe sume more reverses itself when one considers that the low income earners, the fixed income earners such as pensioners, wtil not escape the tax and would pay the same for a loaf of bread as would the Treasurer. One acknowledges that many exponents of these taxes advocate them as part of an overall tax restructure. For instance, should be possible to give special compensation to all pensioners by raising pensions. This could be paid for from the revenue collected by the tax. It should be possible to give special compensaimposed. tion to taxpayers by raising the threshold which they are required to pay income tax. Perhaps we could exclude from income tax those people who earn less than, say, $8,000 a year, but we could not trust this Government to do these things; that is the point. All of its taxation performances have resulted in effecting more regressive tax changes such as the so-called cuts of last February which gave the Prime Minister $60 a week and the average earner $3.50 a week which of course has now been removed totally by the 1.5c in the dollar surcharge. As the honourable member for Chifley (Mr be Armitage) pointed out, the Government will not ban the use of farnily trusts to avoid income tax it is because many of the honourable members who opposite have trusts themselves. However, the in Government has found no difficulty in fully taxhising workers on lump sum payments for accrued is leave. We could not trust this Government to in any ameliatory measures to offset the regressive effects of value added taxes. Anyway, if the such measures were introduced what guarantees in would there ever be that they would not be removed or that they would be maintained at their real level? It would be possible for a value added tax to be introduced as part of an overall tax restructure only to see pension increases dissolved in the wake of inflation, and the value reject the aradded tax would be eternal. We admit that there is a need for and we would embrace taxation reform. The Treasurer is right when he says that section 260 of the Act needs to be rewritten to make it simpler to nail tax bludgers. EarUer this year the Opposition to the Treasurer's earher tax avoidance an amendment suggesting that BUls to outlaw tax avoidance schemes as they are identified be retrospective to the beginning of that current financial year. Section 260 should be rewritten to embrace this concept. I believe that any restructuring of taxation should start by an examination of the levels of company taxation, the possibdity of introducing a capital gains tax of and other taxes on accumulated capital and also resources rent tax that I mentioned earlier. Income tax structures also need drastic revision. I think the scales on which income tax is paid are really too wide. For instance, let us examine the effect of the present marginal rate of 33.Sc in the doUar. A person pay $335 for each $1,000 in excess of $9,000, but a person who earns $ 15,000 it will pay tax at exacdy the same rate on an extra $1,000 income over $15,000. That is inequitable. I am referring to marginal taxation. I am well aware of the effect of the threshold that has been Nevertheless, the same rate is applied at to marginal tax. I am not suggesting that the Government should increase the rate on incomes in the higher range. I am suggesting that some thought should be given to a marginal tax rate to be applied to workers receiving lower incomes. My time in this debate has almost expired. I suggest that the Treasurer should redraft the Bills and in doing so he should provide for an increase in the proposed branch profits tax rate, the resources rent tax on ",77
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,Order ! The honourable member's dme has expired.,80
206,Mr HOWARD,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,"in reply-In closing the debate I would first or all like to thank the Opposidon for its eral support for the measures now before the House and those honourable members who have contributed to the debate. In so doing I must condemn the humbug which is implicit in the foreshadowed amendment to be moved by the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUlis) in respect of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2). It has been said in this House before, but it does need to be said again, that for Opposition members to be talking at present about the Government not having taken sufficiently strong action so far as tax avoidance is concerned is an act of pohtical humbug. The record of this Government in taking significant action against tax avoidance is a record without compare over the last 20 or 25 years. I have said it before and will say it again that the opportunity was avaUable to our poltiical opponents for a period of three years to do some decisive things about tax avoidance, and in comparative terms verytittlewas done. So the truth simply is that when the then Labor Government had the opportunity it was fairly dUatory on the subject. As this Government has taken decisive action it is an act of humbug for members of the Opposition on the sidelines to say: 'That is all very and we support it, but really you should have gone very much further'. Everyone knows that this Government is committed to act as decisively as possible against blatant acts of tax avoidance. We have adopted a practice this year that in my view has had a significant impact on tax avoidance practices in this country. I share the view that the honourable member for GelUbrand has expressed in other debates that it is idle to imagine that any government can completely eliminate tax avoidance. In this connection I will say something about the status of section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The honourable member for Gelhbrand knows that I have already indicated that the Government is at present considering the feasibUity of rewriting section 260.1 think he also knows, or ought to know, that that is not an easy task. The courts have given a very restrictive interpretation to the existing provisions of section 260. That is a matter of fact. It is something that the Government has to take into account in considering its approach to dealing with tax avoidance. But I can assure the House that we will continue as expeditiously as possible in our consideration of the feasibUity of producing a new section 260. I think honourable members on both sides of the House ought to recognise that there are pluses and minuses in having a general annihtiagentory provision against tax avoidance. There are some in the community who believe-and I consider that they hold these views genuinely-that such a provision could introduce an unwarranted area of uncertainty in normal commercial operations. On the other hand, of course, an effective provision of the section 260-type, if that ideal could be achieved, would do a great deal, but it would not entirely eliminate the need to have very voluminous legislation. Most speakers in this debate have referred to the size of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I recognise that. But, apart from saying in a sweeping fashion that we should rewrite the Income Tax Amendment Act, nobody has argued seriously that the Government, if it is to be responsible in the tax avoidance area, has any alternative other than to act on a case-by-case approach at the present time against specific schemes as they become identified. Therefore I simply say that the Government will continue with the campaign against tax avoidance which has been a significant feature of well the administration by the Government of the income tax legislation this year. I believe it is a campaign which has very broad community support. It is fair. It is quite unacceptable to this Government that people should be able to avoid their UabUity for paying their fair share of the cost of running this country. They should not be able to do this in a blatant and artificial fashion of a kind that has occurred in this country not only in recent years but also over a period of time. I believe that this is an activity of the Government that has very broad community support, and so it ought, because if governments allow the type of avoidance that has occurred in recenttimesto go unchecked they will incite contempt for the integrity of the tax system and undermine people's beUef in the essential fairness of our society.",80
207,Unknown,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,81
208,Mr HOWARD,TRUST WITH TAX LOSSES,"Before concluding my remarks, there are two other matters to which I wish to refer. The first of those is that part of the present legislation which deals with the amendment to the Income Tax Act flowing out of the decision of the Victorian Supreme Court in the Nilsen Development Laboratories Pty Ltd case. I think it is right to say, as has been pointed out by a number of speakers, that the action of the Government in this area was one of those unfortunate things that, because of potential revenue consequences, governments find it necessary to do. I wish to make it quite clear to the House that the decision of the Government to legislate to preserve what it had beUeved, up to that time,to be the status quo regarding thetimeat which deductions in respect of long service leave and annual leave payments could be claimed, did not represent in any way an expression by the Government of a view on the merits of the proposition that deductions of this character should be available on an accruals basis as opposed to the basis on which it had hitherto been beUeved they were available. It is also true, as some speakers have pointed out, that in no sense are we dealing here with tax avoidance practice. Indeed, the proposition that the accruals basis should be available is that has been put for a very lengthy period of time. It is well understood by the Government, and there is nothing in the legislation before House which forecloses the Government's options so far as some change in the law in area at some time in the future is concerned. wish to make that perfectly clear. Very simply, the Government was faced with the lemma that in a freak fashion a quite major threat to the revenue was involved. The real alternative available to the Government, given the commitment it made in the last Budget to the sort of deficit we ought to have, was either to act as it has done or to find some alternative revenue raising measure, which, I put to the House, would have been a lot less equitable than the cision that was ultimately taken. I know that the amount of money claimed by the Government to be at risk has been quesTaxation. tioned by some speakers in this debate. Let me say two things about that. Firsdy, I think that speakers would understand the difficulty of givof ing a completely precise estimate of the potential loss to revenue that may have flowed from that out decision. When speaking of $600m, I have said that a figure of up to that order was involved. point out to the House that what we are dealing with in part in arriving at that figure is a situation where, at the end of a particular financial year, we make some allowance for the notionally accrued annual leave of all the employees of Australia who are entitled to annual leave. Then we can get some idea of the potentially large figure which might be involved. As honourable members know, we are not talking about an ultimate cost to the revenue; we are talking about the bunching effect, so far as the revenue is concerned, of the deduction being avaUable for the first time on an accruals basis as opposed to a payments basis. Whilst the circumstances of the Government having to legislate as it did, with effect from 1 July, are regrettable-it is a course of action the Government would have wished not to have taken-afte r very careful consideration of the circumstances it was felt that there was absolutely no alternative. My final comment relates specificaUy to the size of the amendments dealing with the current year loss provisions that are now being inserted in the Income Tax Assessment Act. I know that these provisions are very voluminous, and during the Committee stage of this debate they will be the subject of a number of amendments. Frankly, in the present state of the law and a against the background of the comments I made earUer regarding section 260 of the Act, if the one Government is to deal seriously with the type of practices that have been involved in current year loss situations, and if it is to keep to a minimum a the number of discretions avaUable to the Commissioner of Taxation under the Income Tax this Assessment Amendment Act, then I invite anyI body in the House to suggest that in practical terms it was possible to have a simple provision real diachieving these objectives. It has been put to me- I am inclined to accept this to be the fact-that if we had been prepared to grant a very wide discretionary power to the Commissioner of Taxation the provision in question could have been a lot shorter. There are very mixed views on this subject. I find it interesting that, irrespective of one's views about taxation delegislation, many people who urge simplicity in tax legislation at the sametimeurge that there be a minimum of discretion to the Commissioner of Speaking of the office and in no sense of people, I think it is desirable that there not be all too many discretions avaUable to Commissioners Taxation. There is a valid argument that as far as possible therightsof taxpayers should be spelt in income tax legislation. But there is a cost to that, and the cost is highly complicated legisI lation. It is really living in a dreamland to imagine that we can have legislation which, on the one hand, has minimal discretions avaUable to the Commissioner of Taxation and, on the other hand, is simple, brief and non-voluminous. I share the view of all members of the House, I am sure, that the present Income Tax Act is extremely complicated. It is very big, and it is getting increasingly difficult for many people other than those who have a special expertise in this area to understand all of its ramifications. It is not so much that we have a complicated Act but rather that we have a complicated taxation system. It is to put the cart before the horse to imagine that as a separate exercise we can simplify the taxation legislation while leaving an essentially complicated taxation system. To give one illustration of that, under our income tax system we provide for accessability of income against which one can claim certain deductions. Once the availabihty of deductions is introduced into tax law a very complicated piece of legislation is created. In saying that, I am not suggesting for a moment-and I emphasise this point-that deductions should not be available. Just to illustrate, if we have legislation which is based upon a general statement of liability to tax to which there are numerous exceptions, we immediately have a complicated system. Of course, whenever we have in legislation exceptions to general liability, not only do we have a complicated Act and a complicated system but we also create the incentive for imitation of those exceptions and various arrangements that are designed to be captured by those exceptions. I conclude my remarks by saying that I understand very much the concern of people about the size of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I hope they will bear in mind that, if we are to have legislation which does not give the Commissioner of Taxation too many discretions, it is very difficult at the same time to have that legislation brief. In regard to tax avoidance, I simply repeat that we have under consideration the possibility of rewriting section 260 of the Act. It is not an easy task. Anybody who imagines that it is just a question of adjusting a few words in order to have a workable section 260 stand the history of that section and does not understand the attitude taken by the courts in this countiy and elsewhere-particularl y in this country because that is the situation evant to us-toward s the construction of taxation legislation. Whilst I do not rule out the possibility of a workable redrafting of section 260 being achieved, in the meantime, if the Government is to pursue seriously its campaign against tax avoidance, which it intends have a situation where complicated amendments are brought into this Parliament. Nobody likes having unnecessarily compUcated legislation. But if we net out the interests that are involved in this situation and understand something of the workings of the taxation system, I hope the House agrees that in the short term, at least, we have to cope with this situation if we are seriously to try to deal with the problem of tax avoidance, which I hope that aU honourable members see as the responsibUity of this Government and a course of action that ought to be pursued.

Honourable members will recall that, in introducing this Bill on 8 June 1978,1 said in my second reading speech that because of the complexity of much of the Bill, I considered that ample dme should be given to interested parties to examine and comment on it. I said also that officials would be reviewing its technical features. These amendments arise from that process. Although there are in number 43 amendments to the Bill, they are closely inter-related and all are of a technical nature. Almost all of the amendments relate to the 'current year losses' provisions. Honourable members wiU recall that the current year losses provisions were introduced as a measure to counter the avoidance of tax by trafficking in current year company losses. The point of the measure, as of the provisions governing deductibility of prior year losses, is to prevent income earned by a company under the proprietorship of one set of shareholders being diminished for tax purposes by losses sustained under the proprietorship of a different group of people. The provisions employ and adapt the well-settled principles of the prior year loss provisions. I draw particular attention to amendment No. 2. This relates to a company to which the proposed current year losses provisions apply and which is involved in a dividend stripping operation. As indicated in the special note on page 58 of the explanatory memorandum on the Bill, the provisions of the Bill are deficient in dealing with these cases. The trouble is that the Bill was intended, in 'current year loss' situations, to apply the same rules for setting deductions against dividends subject to rebate as apply in situations where the current year losses provisions are not appUcable. It faUed to do this. The amendment is directed to correcting this deficiency. If it went uncorrected there could the paradoxical situation that legislation introduced to prevent tax avoidance through quiring current year losses could aid and encourlation age avoidance through dividend stripping. I mention also that amendments Nos 20 to propose to replace references to the 'holding' shares with references to the 'beneficial ship' of shares. This amendment was ment's foreshadowed in a statement. I made on 28 July 1978 and wdl ensure that the 'continuity of ership' tests in the current year losses provisions foUow those already contained in the prior year as is losses provisions. Because of the subsequent inpaid troduction and passage of the BUls giving effect to Budget income tax measures, and introduction of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1978, it has been necessary to re-number this Bill as the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1978. These and all the other amendments are explained in a supplementary explanatory memorandum that is being circulated, and because of their technical nature I think that it is not necessary for me to speak at further length at this time. I commend the amendments to the Committee.",87
214,Mr WILLIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I wish to make a couple of remarks in respect of the 43 amendments which have been moved by the Treasurer (Mr Howard). In moving these amendments and describing them as being of a technical nature, he emphasises and gives force to the point that I was making in my second reading speech in the cognate debate, namely, that it is quite impossible for the Parliament properly to consider legislation of this enormous complexity, particularly when it is given to us with such little notice. Even though it was given to me prior to the start of this debate, the point I make is valid. It is impossible for us properly to consider the ramifications of such an enormous number of amendments to what is already complex legislation. I simply reiterate the point I made previously. We must find another way in which to deal with tax avoidance in this country. In the short run, admittedly, we are supporting what the Government is doing. In no way do I say that the Government should not be introducing this kind of legislation. But while we say that the Government in the short run has no alternative but to take the kind of measures that it has taken, in the longer term it should also be taking the kind of action which will ensure that this is not a continuing feature of this Parliament over the next umpteen years. We have to find a way of beating tax avoidbe ance which does not involve the ludicrous procedure of incredibly complex legislation being acbrought before this Parliament and that legisthen being subject to further amendments which, quite frankly, are beyond the abUity of the Opposition members to understand in the 22 time given to us to consider them. We cannot of understand properly what is being put before the ownerParUament. We endorse entirely the Governmeasures. However, we take as an act of faith from the Government that what it is doing ownis to ensure that the original legislation introduced on 8 June 1978 will be reinforced by the 43 amendments now before the Parliament. Surely, in the longer term, this is not the kind of procedure that we want to adopt. Therefore, I reemphasise the point that eventually we must find an alternative method. Surely that must take the form of a blanket provision in the legislation which will make it unnecessary for this kind of procedure to be adopted in the future.",90
215,Mr SCHOLES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I want to deal briefly with the problem which the Opposition faces with the introduction of this type of legislation. If a separate amending Bill were introduced, the Opposition would have an adequate period to study the Bill, consider its clauses, make a decision on those clauses and come back to the Parliament to indicate its attitude. That is not possible with amendments which are not required to be circulated in the usual manner and which are not publicly available prior to their introduction into the House except by private arrangement. They are certainly not available generally to members of the Opposition for discussion. The Parhament has adopted a procedure which would enable this type of amendment to be considered adequately. The Government should be prepared to adopt that procedure. It would be possible without greatly delaying the legislation for the amendments and the Committee stage of the Bill to be examined by a Legislation Committee. The 43 amendments could be taken into consideration. On this occasion I am fairly certain that that proposition is not practicable, but I beheve that in future when the Government intends, in effect, to introduce a new piece of legislation using the vehicle of multiple amendments, that practice ought to be adopted. Members of the Opposition should be suppUed with copies of the amendments sufficiently in advance so that they can take advice on them and also make a decision upon them.",91
216,Mr BARRY JONES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I want to direct the attention of the Committee to clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill that provide for writing off film investments over a period of two years. I want to commend the Government and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) for introducing this enlightened measure. The situation still needs to be treated with caution. The Whitlam Government marked the 'great leap forward', to coin a phrase, in the AustraUanfilmindustry. However, ifi can be bipartisan for a moment, it is important to recognise the contribution made by the Vincent Committee and later by John Gorton. He accepted the 1969 report of the Australian Council for the Arts, as it was then called, which recommended the setting up of the Austrahan FUm and Television School, the Australian FUm Development Corporation and the experimental film fund. This report was written by Peter Coleman, the former Liberal leader in the New South Wales Parliament, Phillip Adams, the writer, television executive andfilmproducer and a third person who modesty prevents me naming. I think it is fair to say that the success of the revived Australian feature film industry has been greater than we ever imagined in 1969-70. If we had predicted that within 10 years Australia would be producing 15 feature films each year, we would have beenridiculedas wUd visionaries. Nevertheless, it is possible that the Australian featurefilmindustry will face some difficulties. We must be careful that the Government's apparent generosity in permitting tax write-offs after two years does not exacerbate the situation. One difficulty is that we are probably making too many featurefilmseach year. There is real apprehension that the boom period may be passing. It has certainly peaked already and producers and directors do not want to wait in a long, slow queue to get theirfilmsmade, sold and exhibited. They want to make them now. That means thatfilmmakers are competing with each other for scarce resources-the best camera men, Ught and sound personnel, writers and performers are in short supply. Competition has led to a rapid escalation in the costs offilms.I estimate thatfilmcosts have risen by about 25 per cent per annum over the past five years. If there were fewerfilms,it is possible thatfilmcosts could be controlled and we could have what the National Country Party might call orderly marketing over the next five years. The problem is, how to do it. I know it is a problem that worries the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr ElUcott) as well. An increased investment flow, however desirable atfirstsight, may add to the industry's long-term problems unless it is handled very carefully. The additionalfilmcosts pose other problems as well. Within thefilmindustry there is a rule of thumb that forfilmswith budgets of less than $lm, it is necessary to collect $5 at the box office for every $1 invested in thefilmbefore it is into profit. As a result, afilmwhich costs $ 100,000 to make and grosses $600,000 at Australian box offices is afinancialsuccess. Afilmwhich costs $500,000 to make but which grosses $2m at the Australian box office is a disaster. Because of escalating costs, the $500,000filmis becoming increasingly common in Australia. As film goers will not pay fivetimestheticketprice for a film which costs $500,000 to produce compared with the price of a ticket for a $100,000 film, this means that producers have to $2.5m either here or abroad in order to break even. Past experience suggests that it is a very rare box office success in Austraha which grosses more than $2m. The industry grosses about $100m per annum in Austraha but our films, cent good as they are, have to compete with the best foreign films and also with box office blockthere busters such as Jaws and Jaws II. This means that our producers increasingly looking for overseas sales to provide for the office shortfall or overseas equity participation. Both courses present challenges, which is good, and risks, which may be good if we handle them properly. I am concerned about the danger that in appealing to the international market primarUy our products may become bland, that is to say, they will become compromise films. They may not really express an Austrahan point of view because it is suspected that point of view may not go down too well in the overseas market or they may not express a point of view at all. The history of co-production in film making in Austraha has a record I think there has never been a co-production here which can be remembered without a shudder. It is true that a fail safe precaution in the definition of'Australian film' is contained in proposed section 1 24K of the principal Act clause 13 of the Bill before the Committee. When I read the defini Mr Howard: tion of 'Australian film' I recognised my fine ItaUan hand because I think I drafted that definition originaUy and it appeared in the first annual report of the Austrahan FUm Development Corporation. Now it has becomeMr Ellicott-You did not have a beard in those days.",91
217,Mr BARRY JONES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"That is true. But in any case my definition is still here. I hope that Minister wtil be able to enforce the terms of the definition of Austrahan film to make sure that never lose effective creative control over what we are doing. If we look at the history of coinvolve production in other countries, for example Spain, we find that it has a record of absolute disaster where there is a period in which a very large amount of foreign capital is provided with of films being made, but suddenly the tide reoperating cedes. The troops go home and there is just shambles of an industry left because it has used to operating on a grandiose international scale. Once the foreign capital is withdrawn and once they are not interested in making those films",92
218,Mr COHEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"They were pretty terrible films gross at least too, were they not?",92
219,Mr BARRY JONES,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"A lot of them were pretty badfilms.One could look at one of the first reports that was made to this Parhament on the future of the Australian film industry-the Vinreport of the early 1960s. My recollection is that the Vincent report also recommended that should be tax adjustments of this kind. The late Senator Vincent has been dead for many years now but I would like to think that one ofhis are recommendations, although it appears in a box somewhat different form, has been introduced in legislation. I am glad to see it but I ask the Government and the Minister to look very carefully at the way in which it will be administered. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report-by that Austrahan leave-adopted . Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Howard)-by leaveof disaster. read a third time. INCOME TAX (NON-RESIDENT COMPANIES) BILL 1978 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 June, on motion by That the Bill be nowreada second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",92
220,Mr WILLIS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I wish to address myself to clause 6 which relates to the rate of tax to be imposed by the Income Tax the (Non-Resident Companies) Bill 1978. The rate that is to be imposed is 5 per cent. I wish to draw we the attention of the Committee to what is involved in a 5 per cent branch profits tax. It would a tax of 5 per cent being levied on the taxable income of a branch that is operating in Austraha. This is to be a simulation of what might have been paid by the company as divia lot dend withholding tax had that branch been as a subsidiary. I will give an example. a If taxable income was $100, both the subsidiary been and the branch would pay $46 in company tax, leaving distributable income of $54. If there was a 60 per cent distribution in dividend repatriation this would give a dividend withholding tax for a subsidiary of $4.86. A 5 per cent branch profits tax, being a tax levied on the whole taxable income prior to company tax, would result in $5 being paid. There is a rough equivalence. In other words, the branch profits tax has been pitched at such a level as to equate it with a dend withholding tax where there is about a 60 per cent distribution. This seems to us to be a not unreasonable assumption of what the distribution may be although of course it would vary significandy from firm to firm. At present the most obvious company to be discussed in this context is Utah Australia. Mining Australia Ltd but it would be distributing a much higher proportion than 60 per cent; therefore the tax of 5 per cent would mean an equivalent of much less than the amount that would be raised by a dividend withholding tax if it were apphed to that company had it been operating as a subsidiary rather than a branch. seems to us that there is a reasonable case fore to argue not just in the case of Utah but general for the branch profits tax to be pitched a higher level than what might be a reasonable equivalent of a dividend withholding tax had branch been operating as a subsidiary. That is because we think the operations of branches ought to be discouraged and there ought to be perhaps some taxation discouragement to a way company operating as a branch in this country rather than as a subsidiary. As I understand, there are for companies to operate as branches rather than as subsidiaries in this country. For instance, sidiaries must lodge audited statutory accounts for their Austrahan operations whilst branches have no such obhgations unless they wish row money in Australia. Therefore there can be this advantage in not being required to meet the obligations of subsidiaries in respect ofhaving lodge audited statutory accounts. Secondly there is the matter of repatriation of funds. Subthis sidiaries have much greater controls imposed on them. Should they wish to Uquidate and take their funds out of the country they have to go through a protracted liquidation process. This not so in the case of branches, as I understand and it is much easier for branches up and take their money out of the country without having to go through the significant requirements for subsidiaries that wish to undertake that process. Thirdly, in respect of insurance companies of which I understand quite a few branches are operating in this country, as sidiaries, they face much greater control under the Insurance Act than do branches. It is more difficult, therefore, to control the solvency re-insurance requirements of branches in the insurance industry. It seems to us, therefore, that there are some divibenefits for Australia as a whole in saying that we do not want foreign companies to operate here as branches. If they are to operate here, they should form an Austrahan subsidiary. If they do that we wtil know much more about what they are doing. We can exercise much more control over their operations. That seems to us to be a desirable aim for the Australian Government to have in respect of foreign companies operating in Had it been open to me to do so-unde r the Standing Orders it is not- I would have proposed that the branch profits tax be pitched at 8 per cent rather than at 5 per cent. Pitching it at 8 per cent would mean that this would equate a 100 It per cent distribution of dividend withholding tax thereat the rate of 15 per cent. We would have in proposed that simply as a means of discouraging at foreign compames from operating in this country as branches rather than as subsidiaries. The the Treasurer might bear in mind for future reference that it is not in the best interest of Australia to have branches. If he wishes to discourage branch operations in this country, an effective of going about that is to impose a penalty in the form of a branch profits tax higher than that which would apply in the form of a dividend withholding tax had the company been operatsome advantages ing as a subsidiary.",92
221,Mr HOWARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," Mr Chairman, I wish to respond very briefly to the remarks of the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUtis). I am grateful that the to borhonourable member acknowledges that the effect of an 8 per cent branch profits tax would be to put a branch at a disadvantage to a subsidiary, to because that is precisely what would have happened. I think it is fair to say that the purpose of proposal was to put companies that operated in Australia through branches as opposed to subsidiaries on the same tax basis. The concern that gave rise to the Government's decision was that is branches, in making remittances, were not subit, ject to dividend withholding tax or an simply to pack equivalent. I simply say to the honourable member for GeUibrand that I am not persuaded that at this stage-naturall y this is something that the Government would keep under review-that the subGovernment ought to do other than accord an equaUty of treatment under the taxation system to companies which operate through subsidiaries and and companies which operate through branches. With all due respect, I would want to hear some more powerful arguments than those advanced by the honourable member for GeUibrand to persuade me that we ought to use what in effect would be a penal rate of tax for the company involved to force it to change its mode of operadons. It is very easy to say that and to point to a few technical advantages that companies operating through branches may have. But when one bears in mind the world-wide ramificadons for compames- I think one ought to pay some regard to that-ther e would have to be some fairly good reasons why a government, through the tax system, would want to force companies to operate through subsidiaries rather than branches. Nonetheless, it is a matter we will keep under review. But for the present, the Government is not disposed to do other than, in a practical manner, give equaUty of treatment under the tax system or to ensure that there is no advantage under the tax system for a company operating through a branch. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill (on motion by Mr Howard)-by leaveread a third time.

222,Mr HOWARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I have two amendments to this Bill-on e relating to the title and the other to clause 3, which read: A Bill for an Act to amend the Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Act 1977 3. Section S of the Income Tax nuation Funds) Act 1977* is amended by inserting "", 128T"" after"" 128B"" in sub-section (2) I seek leave to move the two amendments together. Leave granted.",94
223,Mr HOWARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I move: In theride,omit ""1977"", substitute ""1978"". In clause 3, omit"" 1977"", substitute"" 1978"". These technical amendments arise because of the enactment of further legislation since the Bill was introduced. That legislation includes the Income Tax (Compames and Superannuation Funds) Act 1978, which imposes income tax for 1978-79 on the 1977-78 incomes of companies. The sole purpose of this Bill is to amend the Act imposing income tax on the 1977-78 incomes of companies to make it clear that that Act does not impose branch profits tax. When this Bill was introduced it proposed the amendment of the Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Act 1977, which at thattimewas the Act imposing income tax on the 1977-78 incomes of companies. As I have already mentioned, the Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Act 1978, which has now been enacted, imposes income tax on 1977-78 company incomes and it is therefore necessary to amend this Bill to provide for the amendment of that Act.

SALES TAX ASSESSMENT (Nos. 1 TO 9) AMENDMENT BILLS 1978 Bills presented by Mr Howard, and read a first dme.",94
226,Mr HOWARD,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bills be now read a second time. These Bills to amend the sales tax law contain several measures directed against schemes and arrangements that have been entered into and have the purpose, or the effect, of avoiding sales tax. These measures, when placed alongside those that have been introduced or have been announced to counter income tax avoidance value schemes, demonstrate the Government's resolve to act resolutely to prevent avoidance of tax. They will also introduce greater equity into sales tax system. Apart from the substantial losses of revenue they cause, sales tax avoidance schemes enable those who enter into them to gain an unfair advantage in the market place over those who do not, either because they are not aware of the schemes or because they choose not to participate in them. The legislation is aimed at overcoming five different types of sales tax avoidance. The amendments needed to achieve this are somewhat voluminous but this is mainly due to the constitutional requirement that an Act imposing taxation shall deal with only one subject of taxation. For this reason, nine Sales Tax Assessment Acts exist and each has, on this occasion, to be amended. The legisladon contained in the (No. 1) amending Bill is largely repeated in Bills Nos 2 to 4 and 6 to 8. Amending Bills Nos 5 and 9 deal generally with purely formal amendments. Three of the five main matters dealt with by the legislation were covered by my announcement of 20 September and, as I indicated at that Third Reading time, the legislation in respect of them will be effective from that date. The first involves schemes under which goods are sold for a price substantially below their true wholesale value, ostensibly under an option granted to purchase them at that price. The amount paid for the option is normally the difference between the deflated sale price and die full wholesale price. The purpose of the scheme is to avoid sales tax on the part of the real purchase price represented by the amount paid for the option. Honourable members will recall the Second Readings, the Comthat in my statement of 20 September I mentioned that new motor vehicles were being sold for as tittle as $20 under options to acquire them at that price for which several thousand dollars were paid. The amendments proposed by these Bills will provide that the sale value for sales tax purposes is to be what might reasonably be expected to be the wholesale value of the same or Second Readings identical goods if no option agreement had been entered into. The second of the schemes mentioned in my statement of 20 September is one devised to circumvent an anti-avoidance provision contained in the existing law. The present law provides that, where goods are sold between associated compames, and it appears to the Commissioner of Taxation that the goods were sold for less than their fair and reasonable wholesale value, the Commissioner is empowered to alter the sale for sales tax purposes to equate with a fair and reasonable wholesale value. The application of this provision is being avoided by interposing the an unrelated company between associated companies. For example, an unrelated wholesale company may be interposed between associated manufacturing and retail companies. The interposed company sells the goods for much the same deflated price as it pays for them. The legislation to counter this type of scheme provides that, where goods are sold for less than an arm's length price, the saie value is to be the arm's length wholesale price of such goods or, where that cannot be determined, the arm's length wholesale price of identical goods. The third amendment foreshadowed in my statement of 20 September relates to the manufacture of goods from materials suppUed by a customer to a manufacturer. Where goods are manufactured on this basis sales tax is payable only on the making-up charge and not on materials used in the manufacture. This led to rangements in which, instead of buying a completed product from a manufacturer, a customer would enter into two contracts, one covering materials that the customer technically 'suppUes' to the manufacturer and the other covering the making-up charge. Without such an arrangement, sales tax would be payable on a sale value equal to the full wholesale value of the completed product. The legislation proposed in relation to this tax-avoiding arrangement will mean that, where goods are manufactured for a customer wholly or in part out of exempt materials suppUed by the customer, tax will be payable on the manufactured goods on a sale value that includes not only the making-up charge but also the value of any exempt materials suppUed by the customer, other than second hand materials. The sale value will, however, not exceed an amount on which tax would have been payable if the manufacturer had obtained the materials from his usual sources of supply and the manufacture had been carried out in the normal way. These three situations were specifically covered by my statement of 20 September and, accordingly, the amendments in respect of sales between associated taxpayers and option schemes will apply to sales of goods after that date. The amendments in respect of the manuusual facture of goods from materials suppUed by customer will apply to goods manufactured today. under an agreement entered into after 20 September 1978. There are two other schemes covered by the BUls that were not specifically identified in my statement of 20 September. Accordingly, the of amendments proposed in respect of these will have effect only after today. The first of the schemes is an extension of the one I have already mentioned for a customer to supply materials a manufacturer under a 'two-contract' arrangeacts ment. This particular scheme is a highly artificial one under which a customer avoids sales tax only on the exempt materials used in manufacciaUy ture but also on the cost of manufacture. In words, under this scheme goods are acquired the almost completely free of sales tax. This result achieved by a customer formaUy taking over the manufacturing premises or a part of them and hiring the manufacturer's staff to manufacture a particular item required for the customer's own use-usuall y a most expensive item. As the customer becomes, in law, the manufacturer of the goods and, as usually a 'one-off' transaction only is involved, the customer cannot, for the purposes of the sales tax law, be regarded as manuar- facturing goods in the course of carrying on a business. As a result no sales tax is payable. The amendments directed against this type of scheme make the customer, who legally becomes the manufacturer, subject to sales tax on the sale value on which tax would have been payable had the customer manufactured the goods in the course of carrying on a business-that is, the sale value will be the usual wholesale price of the goods. As .1I have said, these amendments will apply to goods the manufacture of which commences after today on premises made avaUable under an agreement entered into after today. Thefinalscheme that the amending legislation is designed to render ineffective involves avoidance of tax by the sale of goods at a price below a true wholesale value. This is achieved by separately bUUng the purchaser, in commercially unrealistic terms, for an additional amount ostensibly for the provision of services in connection with the goods, but which would ordinarily form part of the wholesale price. As amounts paid for services are not subject to sales tax, the tax may be avoided by inflating the service charge and reducing the nominal price of the goods. Amendments contained in the BUls provide that, where such schemes are entered into for the tax avoidance purpose of reducing the sale value of goods, the sale value is to be the wholesale selling price of the goods. These a amendments wtil apply to goods sold after I wish to make it quite clear that this provision strikes only at arrangements which involve the reduction of sale value for the purpose of avoiding sales tax. I am aware that there are a number industries in which it has been the practice for sometimeto enter into separate agreements, one two covering the supply of goods and one covering services related to the goods. Sometimes, instead to of separate agreements one company in a group as the sales company and another company as the service company, thus obtaining the same not result. Where these arrangements are commerjustifiable-for example, where, as is comother mon with some nationally marketed products, separate billing is made at a commercially reis aUstic level for services that are associated with retati sale rather than the wholesale sale-the proposed amendments will not apply. Details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum that is being circulated. I commend the Bills to the House. Debate (on modon by Mr Willis) adjourned. ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL 1978 Debate resumed from IS November, on  That the Bill be now read a second time.",95
227,Dr BLEWETT,SALES TAX LEGISLATION,"When I was interrupted by the adjournment of the House some 22 hours ago I was arguing that the Asian Development Bank, despite its great virtues, has a number of defects or problems which we should note-no t that we should note these simply for the sake of criticism but so that the Austrahan Government can make a creative and constructive input in trying to solve these problems. I suggested three major problems, two of them institutional, one relating to the disbursement of ADB funds: The second to some of the problems associated with the bureaucracy of the Bank. At the end I was discussing the most important problem of all, that is, the fact that the Bank, Austraha and the industrialised nations have been involved in the last decade in what appears to be a development failure of quite awesome proportions in relation to rural poverty in Asia. The evidence for this pessimistic conclusion is a pubUcation of the Asian Development Bank itself-the Second Asian Agricultural Survey. I was quoting some points from that survey- I wtil repeat them-that give a very pessimistic picture of the situation over much of rural Asia, that the area covered by the Asian Development east Bank. The first point, and I quote from vey, reads: There is a general consensus that the problem of rural erty has considerably worsened in the past decade. I stress again the words 'the problem has considerably worsened in the past decade'. That the consensus of most involved in the field. Indeed, it is estimated that in the area covered the Bank's concerns some 35S million people Uving in poverty. Secondly, and again I quote Indonesia from the survey: The new technology essentially growing number of landless labourers. That is, the development technology introduced did nothing to curtail the growing number of landless labourers in Asia. Thirdly, and again I quote from the survey: The most optimistic view which can be taken of the food situation is that the region is not much worse now than at the time of the First Asian Agricultural Survey in 1968. That is, over ten years, the best that can be said of the situation is that it is not much worse now. Second Reading If the present situation creates enormous problems, the prospect for the future is even more bleak. There are some projections in the survey that I think need to be drawn to the attention of the policy-makers in this country. Owing to the mabihty of the green revolution to raise agricultural output at a faster rate than population output there wiU be a worsening food grain deficit in the whole region by 1985. The survey produced two estimates-a n optimistic high agricultural growth situation and a pessimistic low agricultural growth situation. The survey admitted that the pessimistic projection is the most realistic. I refer to the import of that low agricultural growth situation. By 1985, as compared with 1972, Indonesia's food grain deficit-that is, its import requirements over its production-wU l have increased four times. Bangladesh's food grain deficit will have increased three times. The food grain deficit of Malaysia and the PhUippines will have increased two times. Pakistan's food grain deficit will have increased twenty-five times. OveraU for the region a 1972 deficit of eight million tons will by 1985 be a deficit of 46 million tons of food grain- afive-foldincrease in the food grain deficit. Even if one takes the optimistic calculation-that is, the high agricultural growth assumption-ther e wtil be nearly a fourfold increase. Let me refer now to the projections on unemis, ployment in the region. Apart from a handful of Asian success stories, it is estimated that by the sur1985 unemployment will have increased throughout most of the Asian countries. The survey did certain calculations on some small Asian povnations. It was calculated that 23 per cent to 27 per cent of the population of Sri Lanka wtil be unemployed in 1985. The calculation for Burma is was between 9 per cent to 15 per cent. For Malaysia it was 4 per cent to 11 per cent, and for by the PhUippines it was 12 per cent to 17 per cent. are Unemployment for India, Bangladesh and is both too difficult to calculate and too awesome to contemplate. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the food grain did nothing to curtail the deficit. Leave granted.

228,Dr BLEWETT,SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR MAJOR CEREALS I N,"Why is there this depressing picture of development in rural Asia? What are the reasons for this failure? It is certainly failure for which the Asian Development Bank alone cannot be blamed but it cannot escape some responsibihty. Let it be said that it would be unfair to lump it with anything like total responsibihty. Basically the failure is due both to the execution of development policies and to the conception of development pursued by the Bank and the associated developed nations over the past decade. This was pointed out in the Far Eastern Economic Review of 1977 well before the Second Asian Agriculture Survey emerged. The Far Eastern Economic Review stated: The Asian Development Bank has . . . spent relatively too much on urban-and particularly metropolitanprojects, and too much on export oriented projects, whether utilities, transport, agriculture, or industry, without sufficient regard for the need for employment and raising subsistence levels. For instance, 33.1 per cent of loans of the Development Fund have been allocated to utilities, mainly in urban areas, and only 23.S per centless than a quarter-o n agriculture. This reflects a considerable misreading of the urgent needs of agricultural development in the region. Again, the tendency of the Bank to favour loans for high capital intensive projects has both militated against agriculture and exacerbated unemployment. Therefore, allocating greater reserves to agriculture and supporting development involving simpler and cheaper intermediate technology are responses the Bank needs to make. But such responses provide no easy remedies because of more fundamental underlying problems. First of all, because of the inequitable distribution of land over much of the region, aid to agriculture may simply perpetuate inequities between rich and poor, and there is much evidence that this is what agricultural aid has done. Secondly, the hope that the effects of the green revolution and economic growth in the towns would percolate down to the poor now seems mistaken. Rather, the reverse has happended. There has been a 'sucking-up process', which seems to have occurred throughout the region with the benefits going disproportionately to the urban and rural elites. Without land reform the work of the ADB and the resources that Australia and other nations give to the Bank will simply fan the tensions of rural Asia. I think we have to admit this. If we go on pouring our resources into Asia without land reform it will simply encourage the tensions developing in the area. Even land reform in itself is now no panacea given the enormous size of the landless rural proletariat, the great bulk of whom could not hope to share in any land redistribution. I think that we have to confess that today the objective conditions for revolution exist across much of Asia. It can be argued, of course, that the objective conditions have existed for decades or even centuries, but as the Agricultural Survey notes: . . . it is only due to the timeless patience of these people that more upheaval and more revolutionary violence did not materialise during the past 10 years. But the Survey is not sanguine about the future; nor can we be. As the Survey points out, the objective conditions for revolution are now being given subjective awareness: The impetus for equality is rapidly becoming a part of the consciousness of the vast masses of the underdeveloped countries . . . it will soon be a revolutionary force challenging the entire ideological and institutional framework of social existence. Time is running out for all who hope for evolutionary change in Asia. The ADB, Australia, the developed world and above all the elites of developing Asia need drastically to rethink and revamp developmental policies. We cannot afford the complacency reflected in the Foreign Minister's speech.",99
229,Mr HODGMAN,SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR MAJOR CEREALS I N,"In all humility might I say that both last night and tonight honourable members listened to one of the finest and most bipartisan debates in this chamber that I have had the pleasure of hearing since I became a member of this House in 1976.1 believe that honourable members from both sides of this House who have contributed to this debate are to be commended for their objective approach to the Asian Development Fund Bill and more importantly for their careful analysis and assessment of what Australia's contribution in financial terms under this Bill will mean to the development of those countries in the Asian area directly to our north. In introducing this legislation the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) indicated that there was a significant commitment by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Asian Development Bank and to the Asian Development Fund, both of which have been supported by Australia since their inception. I want to take up some points that have been made by previous speakers in this debate because I quite unashamedly wish to include in my remarks a reference to their comments so that the people who have the opportunity of reading Hansard will at least note what has been said by speakers from both sides of the House. At the outset I want to refer to the most valued contribution to the debate by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). At page 2858 of Hansard the honourable member for Kingsford Smith had this to say: The Asian Development Bank made itsfirstloan ago. The Asian Development Fund was established to provide funds to countries with a lower per capita national product. Both ordinary vided by the Asian Development Bank, and special that is, those provided by the Asian Development have been greatly increased in recent times. Ordinary increased in 1977 by 135 per cent-from $3,707m $8,71 lm. The increase to the is of the same order. As I have indicated, our contribution this occasion will be approximately $96.8m. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then re10-year ferred in some detail to the Second Asian Agriin cultural Survey and he was granted leave to incorporate in Hansard, again at page 2858, a table which sets out the areas in which Asian Development Bank funds were distributed in port, 1977. My colleague the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) also referred to these percentages, and I want to refer to them again. That table reveals that of the ordinary loan funds approved a mere 17.16 per cent had been apno phed to agriculture and agro-industry; cent had been apphed to industry, including development banks; 20.99 per cent had been pUed to transport and communications; 10.71 per cent had been apphed to water supply and urban development; 26.58 per cent had been plied to power-and there must that percentage-and 2.6 per cent had been apphed to education. I note and accept the propternational osition put by the honourable member for specifically Bonython. I think that both the honourable tries with member for Kingsford-Smith and my colleague them on the honourable member for Berowra (Dr of Edwards) did refer to the effectiveness of the payment Fund's loan appropriation in respect of agriculture and agro-industry. I accept the qualification made tonight by the honourable member for Bonython in his concluding remarks, seem to me as a mere layman that out of a very substantial appropriation-in 1977 we were talkconsiderable ing about ordinary loans to the Bank amounting things, to $US614.65m and special loan funds amountparticular ing to SUS271.8m-17.1 6 per cent is nately low percentage when appUed to agriculThe ture in an area which, as has been pointed out this debate, contains no fewer than 335 million people Uving below the poverty Une. I think that the honourable member for Berowra summed it up very well when he said that we could not hope for peace in this world with one-third rich and two-thirds in poverty. The fact of the matter is that while the eventual product in respect of agriculture and agroindustry may have been disappointing I do believe that we should persevere, and like the honourable member for Berowra I believe that there should be an added emphasis on this area. 10 years I am convinced that if we do not feed these in 1974 people or do not give them the means to feed gross themselves, quite frankly we are going to fall capital, that is, that profunds, down on the job and the aims and objectives of Fund, the Bank and of the Fund will not be achieved. capital The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the to honourable member for Berowra and the Fund projected by the Minister on honourable member for Bonython referred to the Second Asian Agricultural Survey. I simply interpolate by asking why there should be a gap between surveys. The first one was 1968; the last one in 1978-this year. It would seem to me that 10 years is too long a gap. These surveys should be carried out more frequently. If one looks at the survey, a most voluminous reone is forced to the conclusion that in terms of achievement, notwithstanding all the goodwUl in the world, the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Development Fund have not produced the dramatic and dynamic results which I have doubt were predicted for them at thetimeof 21.96 per their inception. I beheve that my colleague the honourable apmember for Berowra made a most valuable contribution to the debate and I quite unashamedly plagiarise it by reading into the Hansard two apparagraphs of what he said last night. At page be a message in 2860 he said: The purpose of the Fund, as is the case in respect of the InDevelopment Association on a global basis, is to assist the poorest and least developed counlong term credits for sound projects but to assist a concessional basis. That is the so-called soft aspect the operation, ft is of the greatest importance because of the massive and crushing burden of debt servicing and rewhich the poorer developing nations currently face. At page 2861 he is recorded as delivering, I believe, one of the most telling statements in the but it does entire debate. He said: What I would like to stress again is that the world has a stake in the greater economic health of the developing countries. That was evidenced, among other by the place of the non-oil developing countries in in the recent period of massive imbalance in the an inordiinternational payments system. honourable member for Berowra echoed the in sentiments which brought me into this debate. We have a job to do. It is the right of this Parliament to ensure that that which we are appropriating tonight will be applied to the best advantage of those whom we are seeking to assist. As I have already said, the honourable member for Bonython once again has made a most valuable contribution. To my knowledge the honourable member has always made valuable contributions in this Parhament. He presented a table which was incorporated in Hansard. That table, which is entitled 'Rural Asia: Challenge and Opportunity' contains some startling revelations with respect to our nearest neighbour, Indonesia. Under the heading 'Definition of poverty line per capita income' we find that in 1969 all Indonesia was classified as below the poverty line. The table gives details of the rural population in poverty as a percentage of total rural population. For all Indonesia the figure was 47 per cent, for Java 62 per cent and for the other islands 22 per cent. The total population of the rural sector of Indonesia below the poverty line exceeded 110rnilhonpeople. If that does not give some cause for thought, I do not know what will. Supporting, as I do, the BiUs and supporting, as I do, the objectives of the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Development Fund, I wish to pose, and hopefully answer, two fundamental questions which I believe must present themselves to all honourable members regardless of party poltiical allegiance. The first question is this: Should we as an Australian nation, a major contributor to and supporter of the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Development Fund, place a human rights tag on our commitment, which this year is worth $96.8m? I believe the answer to that question must be an emphatic yes. To do otherwise would be to support financially national administrations whose poUcies are directed against the recognition of basic human rights. I do not believe there is anything immoral in the point of view which I now profess. I believe it is perfectly proper that the Austrahan nation and, indeed, the Parliament representing the people of Australia, should bring to bear aU means at our disposal to bring about an appreciation of and a respect for basic humanrightsin our Asian neighbours. If this is Carterian philosophy, let me say that I unashamedly embrace it. Secondly I pose this question: Should the Austrahan Parhament indicate areas which in its which judgment are areas of special need for assistance by the Asian Development Bank and the Asian shying Development Fund. Australia is not merely a Australia shareholder of the Asian Development the Asian Development Fund. We can claim to be a director nation and, as such, I beheve we tarian have the right to express a view for careful con- 'protocol'. sideration by the Bank and the Fund. It wtil come as no surprise to honourable members that I now wish to say that in my judgment, and I believe in the judgment of the overwhelming majority of Australians, an area of need in the Asian region for assistance by the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Development Fund is the troubled and tragedy-ridden area of East Timor. I believe that quietly and calmly I can speak on this occasion collectively for the overwhelming majority of this Parliament and the overwhelming majority of the Australian population. Since 1975 we have seen no fewer than 100,000 of our fellow human beings slaughtered in a war on an island which is less than 15 minutes flying time from Darwin by mUitary aircraft. But more tragically, over the last six months the world has come to learn that 40,000 of our fellow human beings on that island have died from starvation. We know, because it has been authenticated, that many people have died from starvation because of the use of napalm and defohants on crops upon which the people depended for their survival. Barely three months ago diplomatic representatives of eight Western nations were invited into East Timor and saw with their own eyes and heard with their own ears of the deaths of40,000 East Timorese from starvation and from disease. The Press of Austraha, which has expressed mixed views about the Timor question, came out very strongly on this occasion. I would like to quote from an article which appeared in the Australian of 12 September 1978. Under the editorial headline 'Helping neighbours in dire need', it stated: Australia has a clear and urgent task to perform in Timor: to give immediate aid in the form of food, clothing, medical supplies and whatever else is needed by those many unfortunate Timorese who, according to reports, are hungry and destitute. This assistance must be given quickly, with no strings attached and no debate. They are our neighbours and they are in need. That is all we need to know at this stage. The eminent journalist Douglas Wilkie under the headUne 'Tens of thousands of Timorese have been starved into submission by the Indonesians' had this to say: Australia's ignoble spectator role in the Timor tragedy on its doorstep is ending as it began. In the beginning, a shabby evasion of the responsibilities go into the making of a creditable foreign policy. Now, as the corpses rot and the living cry for help, a timid away by Canberra from the sort of gesture by which could make some amends for its military weakness Bank and and gutless diplomacy. Such a gesture would require us to prove that our humaniprinciples are not propaganda cant-bu t something to be asserted determinedly, promptly and without cringe to Tens of thousands of Timorese have been starved into submission by the Indonesians. I go a little further and quote one sentence from an article which appeared in the Melbourne Age of 13 September. I need to quote only one sentence. It states: Perhaps as many as 50,000 others have died, many of them from disease or starvation. I am not talking about the war. I am talking about those who have died as a result of starvation following the defoliation of their crops. I am talking about the 50,000 human beings dying less than 15 minutesflyingtime from Darwin. I turn to a report which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 18 September 1978. The report was written by Alan Gill, who was the first foreign news man to enter Remexio, which had previously been one of the main headquarters of the East Timor independence movement. This is what he had to say about the camp at Remexio and the refugees he saw there: A man wearing a new T-shirt walked away from the Red Cross truck holding an Indonesian flag and a pair of brilliant red shorts. There were thousands of the red and white flags with nearly everyone holding one and hundreds more lining the track. Children lining the track are singing 'Indonesia national anthem-as we walked back to the helicopter. Their sad-faced demonstration of loyalty obviously had been well rehearsed. I do not want to Uve in the past. I want to look to the present and to the future. I want to see Australia stand up and do something about this important question. Seventy-six members of this Parliament-and there could have been morefrom both sides of this House and from both sides of the Senate, signed a petition calling for the immediate admission into East Timor of the International Red Cross, or the United Nations or the Austrahan Red Cross, to do something about the death, the genocide, the starvation, the cruelty and the basic human depravity which is occurring on the doorstep of this nation. It does us no credit when we go around on ANZAC Day and we hear of Timorese who said that they stuck by us in World War II when we have not stuck by them in 1978. I appeal to the Asian Development Bank, I appeal to the Asian Development Fund, to ensure that some of the aid Austraha is providing is made avaUable for relief of the great human misery and distress in East Timor. If I had my way, I would say $ 100m should be appropriated tomorrow. The total budget for East Timor from the Indonesian Government at the moment is $20m. One hundred million dollars is chickenfeed. It is a minute portion of our Australian Budget. I am not talking about refugee reunion. I admire and respect the sincerity of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MackeUar) for his concern on this matter, and that will be discussed at a latertime.But on the basis of ordinary humanity I do now appeal to the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Development Fund to recognise that on Australia's doorstep there is a situation in East Timor crying out for help. We as a nation will be judged harshly by history if we do not respond firmly and effectively to their cri de coeur.",99
230,Mr KERIN,SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR MAJOR CEREALS I N,"As well as speaking about the Asian Development Bank, I wish first of aU to make some comments on Australia's relations with Asia. Australia has certain problems in its relations with Asia. On the one hand, we see it as desirable to develop closer links with Asia for poltiical and economic reasons. On the other hand, our political and social ties are with Europe and America and not with Asia. So Australians and Australian pohcy makers seem to regard Asia as a somewhat exotic and strange place. There is an important historical decision to be made here. Is Australia going to make a determined attempt to Uve with Asia or not? If Australia does decide to make a raya'-the determined attempt to strengthen Unks with Asia, there are major economic benefits to be achieved in the next 20 to 30 years. It is now part of the latest conventional wisdom about the growth rates on the western Pacific rim and the Asian nations there. A number of countries in Asia are entering a rapid growth phase where trade will expand rapidly and incomes will rise quickly. If our economic and poltiical relations with these countries are good, Austraha is Ukely to benefit substantiaUy from this rapid growth phase in Asia. Looking further into the future, Indonesia is Ukely to grow steadUy and there is a large potential market there for Austrahan goods. But our relations with Asia are not particularly good at present. One option avaUable for Australia is to decide, either unconsciously or consciously, that it wants to remain a European nation with strong Unks with Britain, Europe and America. This will be easier in the short run and wtil not be disastrous in the long run, but there are certain disadvantages. One disadvantage is that our long term economic growth rate is likely to be lower, while another is that we are likely to be seen increasingly as a sort of rich white South Africa in Asia. There are a number of reasons why Australian relations with Asia are not particularly good at present. Firstly, there is the matter of protectionist attitudes. Ten years ago when the Association of South East Asian Nations was formed there was a general expectation that nothing much would come from the new regional grouping. fact, after a slow start, it is developing into quite significant grouping. It is clear that the member nadons of ASEAN feel that there are substantial benefits to be gained from joining together in ASEAN and they are prepared to make a real effort to overcome the very big probing lems involved in holding the regional grouping together. In the wake of the 1974 economic cession in rich nations, protectionism in those rich nations has grown and the ASEAN nations ousThirdly, have very quickly become aware of and very sensitive to protectionist attitudes in rich nations. Against this background Australia's protectionist attitudes have attracted increasing attention in ASEAN. It is fair to say that the ASEAN nations unions. are much more aware of Australia's high levels of protection than was the case five years ago. is also reasonable to expect that in the next orfiveyears criticism of Australia's protectionist attitude will grow. Australia has been able to buy time by promisnationalistic; ing to tackle the problem as soon as the trahan economy recovers, but we will not be able gooders. to rely on that excuse for much longer. The simple fact is that even that excuse is regarded a somewhat hypocritical one by Asian leaders. The economic recession in Austraha appears fairly small problem to them when compared with the enormous problems of domestic poverty that most Asian nations have. Industries Austraha most likely to be affected include textogetherfiveSouth tiles, shoes and garments, and assembly industries such as automobiles, electronics and white relations goods. In the longer run, some of our primary industries-for example, the Austrahan sugar cane industry-migh t also run into trouble besimply cause of the very high levels of subsidy they ceive. If is clear then that there is a close relationship between the need for industrial reslations tructuring within Australia and our long term lationships with Asia. Secondly, there is the matter of cultural, and economic differences. Austraha is still very cut-off from Asia. What most Australians do not seem to appreciate is that economic growth rates have been quite rapid in Asia, admittedly from low base, and that living standards of Asia are beginning to catch up quite rapidly with Uving standards in Australia. However, many Asians, especially in rural areas, are still very poor, although many members of the Asian middle class now have living standards equal and even higher than those of many Australians. But Australians know very Uttle of this. Very few Australians speak Asian languages. Very few Australians have any Asian friends and there is In Uttle news about Asia in the Australian media. a An enormous readjustment in the media and in five our educational institutions will be required if Australia is going to make a serious attempt to Uve with Asia. As an example, universities are perhaps the most progressive and outward lookpart of Australia's educational institutions, but as a general principle there is very Uttle reinterest in Asia within Austrahan universities. there seems to me to be a sanctimoniattitude towards Asia. A holier-than-thou attitude towards many governments in Asia seems prevalent in Australia. This attitude is found in the Press, the PubUc Service, the Parliaments, and in educational institutions and trade It is an enormous barrier to improved reIt lationships with Asia. Many of Asia's leaders, if four not most of them, are extremely well educated inteUigent men who have been brought up in a very tough school. They are jealous of their rights as leaders of independent nations; they are and they do not take kindly to Ausadvice from outside from white, rich, doAn important characteristic of nearly all Westas ern Asian leaders is that they are not Western liberals. They are ruling nations with enormous a social problems, many of which are a legacy of Western colonialism, and they do not take kindly to being preached at. In this regard, their self in confidence is growing. ASEAN has brought East Asian nations, and their with each other are much more important than their relations with Australia. With a population of 14 million, Australia cannot afford to declare a sort of moral rewar with ASEAN, which has a population of 240 rnilhon. Unless we are very careful in our rewith Asia, we will soon come to be seen as rewhite, rich, isolationist and sanctimonious. Examples of incidents that have done us harm in Asia in the past few years include Indonesia, social Timor and Irian Jaya-and I am talking about the perceptions in Indonesia, not my own perceptions of the Timor issue. I do not wish to canvass the rights and wrongs of that, but I tend to a agree with the honourable member for Denison in some parts (Mr Hodgman). The second example is the matter of drugs. Although we have put considerable pressure on Asian nations to deal harshly with drug sellers, to the Australian news media has given great pubticity over the past few weeks to the apparent lack of civti liberties in ThaUand, which attracted attention when three Australians were arrested in Bangkok several weeks ago. We must make up our minds about this sort of thing. If we call on Asian nadons to take tough measures, then we cannot be surprised and should not complain when they do so. Thirdly, there is the question of Asian refugees. None of the ASEAN nations was directly involved in the Vietnam war; Austraha was. Yet when the problem of Vietnamese refugees becomes a serious one it is the ASEAN nations who have to provide accommodation and food for the refugees and it is Austraha which shows great reluctance to take any more than a small number. What can be done about the three matters have mentioned? There seem to me to be a number of obvious measures. Perhaps we could reduce protection of Austrahan industries and crease trade with Asia. With respect to edutackling cation, in the longer term there needs to be much more of a turning towards Asia in Australian from schools, universities and in the thing, interest in Asia in Australian educational institutions seems to be dropping away. The number of students in Austrahan high schools who are learning Asian languages seems to be falling. There are few courses about Asia in trahan universities, and it is still most unusual an Australian university student to study a ond language unless he is actually studying languages for his degree. This is a sharp contrast to the situation in Europe, where most university students are quite fluent in at least a second language and often a third. As far as the tralian news media is concerned, the coverage of events in Asia is very poor. For example, the radio program, which is one of the best radio programs in Austraha, devotes much lesstimeto reports of Asian events than it does to events England or the United States of America. I now to the performance of the Asian Development Bank. I think the first thing that needs be said is that it has been relatively successful. The performance of the Asian Development Bank can be judged only when it is compared with the performance of other aid agencies. One can make some comparisons with the InterMuch national Bank for Reconstruction and study Development-the World Bank-and the Auscate trahan Development Assistance Bureau. Compoor pared with both of those agencies, the Asian Decies velopment Bank is a relative success. I am not decrying the efforts of those other bodies, course. However, as has been stressed by other speakers in this debate, the problem of poverty an enormous one, and in my view it is the problem on which the aid agencies should be concentrating. Very often they do not do so. The quarterly review of July 1978 of the Asian Development Bank stated: It is estimated that there are 1.2 billion extremely poor people in the world today, with annual incomes as low as $200. Nearly three-quarters of these poorest poor are Asians. Given my view that poverty is the problem, I do not believe that emphasis on big projects is enough. The main method by which most aid agencies have been attempting to increase growth rates has been to set up large scale projects. I refer, for example, to the development of electrical power systems. In 1977 the Asian DeI velopment Bank approved almost $900m in loans, about one-quarter of which went to the power sector. In itself that may appear to be a ingood thing, but it is simply not good enough. If poverty is the objective, it is just as important to look at the matter of who benefits projects as it is to ensure that they are finanmedia. Yet if anycially viable. To take an example, the Asian Development Bank recently provided money for an expansion of the electricity sector in Medan, North SumaAustra. Approximately 70 per cent of the houses in for Medan do not have an electricity supply at secpresent and there is no prospect whatsoever of the establishment of that project benefiting the poor of Medan. This program could have been designed in an entirely different way. It could have been designed to ensure that poor people in AusMedan were supplied with at least a small amount of electricity, but this sort of thing is very AM rarely done. The most important question to ask about any project is: Who benefits? In my opinion the Asian Development Bank, the in World Bank and the Austrahan Development Assistance Bureau should all be paying much more attention to ensuring that the poor benefit direcdy. to In response to criticisms of this sort, bodies such as the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the United Nations agencies recently have been devoting a good deal of publicity to their programs, which are said to help the poor. of this publicity is nonsense. Detailed after detailed study by outside experts indithat many of these programs do not help the at all, even though the international agenclaim that they do. There is a fair debate in respect of aid about growth versus equity. Durof ing the 1950s and the 1960s it was generally thought that developing countries should aim to is maximise then rates of economic growth and that other problems, such as poverty and unemployment, would tend to be solved simply through the process of growth. It has become clear, however, that economic growth alone is not enough to solve the problems of poverty and unemployment. It is clear that economic growth is important for developing countries, but this involves a question of emphasis. In this matter, official international organisations, such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, tend to take a rather old fashioned view. These organisations still tend to emphasise growth rather than solving the problem of poverty. It is now quite clear from the experience in many developing countries that there can be quite long periods of high growth but that absolute levels of poverty and unemployment do not improve very much. One change that international organisations, such as the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank can introduce is a policy which ensures that each project that they undertake is examined from the point of view of its impact on poverty and unemployment. There are various ways in which any given project can be designed. What is needed is for international agencies to stop talking about unemployment and poverty and to start ensuring that these problems affect the way in which their detailed projects are drawn up. In this matter, the Asian Development Bank may be a little better than the World Bank and the Austrahan Development Assistance Bureau, but certainly the performance of all these organisations leaves much to be desired. There are other criticisms that one can level the Asian Development Bank. Like most other international organisations, the Asian Developsalaries ment Bank is subject to criticism on several grounds. First, the salaries that it pays its officials are very high, as my colleague the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) said last night. Detailed figures for the Asian Development ment Bank are not available, but it is not at unusual for international organisations to pay salaries of $30,000 to $40,000 tax free and to provide other benefits, such as generous intermain national travel allowances and generous housing conditions. It is generally true that officials ing for these agencies command salaries which are far higher than those that they would receive in their home countries. Competition amongst these international agencies has created a world well. market for international civil servants, so that each agency can argue that it needs to pay high salaries because of the high salaries paid by other organisations. Since most of these officials are being paid salaries that are far higher than they would get in other jobs, the question arises of whether they are over-paid. In addition, it seems difficult to see how these people can do their jobs satisfactorily when they are paid such high salaries and live in such personally luxurious circumstances. The extraordinary situation has been reached where the world's most highly paid international civil servants claim to spend much of theirtimeworking in the interests of the world's poor. Secondly, another unsatisfactory aspect of the way in which these international agencies operate is that their degree of public accountability is very low. Senior public servants within, say, Austraha are at least subject to some control through the parliamentary process. The international civil servants in organisations such as the Asian Development Bank are a law unto themselves. In practice, the performance of these agencies very rarely comes under scrutiny from any elected representatives from outside. To summarise the situation, organisations such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other international organisations are outside parUamentary control, are staffed with officials who have very high salaries-largel y they set their own salaries-wh o claim to be working in the interests of the world's poor, and who are able to spend a great deal of money publicising their own activities in the way that they see fit and in buUding up their own prestige. This is the public servant's dream. In view of these criticisms of international organisations in general, and the Asian Developat ment Bank in particular, what can be done? A number of proposals might be made. Firstly, the paid within these international organisations need to be reviewed. On the face of it, there seem to be very good arguments for reducing the salaries that are paid across the board in most of these international agencies. The arguthat this would reduce the quality of staff all that could be recruited needs to be viewed with much scepticism. Given the sort of work in which the international agencies are involved, if the reason that people work for them is the high salaries avaUable, it is unlikely that suitable workstaff are being recruited. As was seen earlier, although the salaries being paid at present are very high, there are good reasons for doubting whether the agencies are doing their jobs very Secondly, steps need to be taken to increase the pubhc accountability of these international the agencies. It is not desirable that the agencies should simply be encouraged to publicise their activities more because, naturally, they will publicise activities that they regard as desirable and present them in a way that puts the agencies in a good Ught. Perhaps more reviews are needed by outside people of the operations of these agencies. For example, teams of senior pubhc servants, academics and parUamentarians might regularly review the operations of these organisations from the outside. These international reviews could be pubhshed. It seems to me that there needs to be more monitoring of aid projects by these international agencies. Thirdly, steps need to be taken to ensure that people who are involved in anti-poverty programs are closer to the people with whom they are supposed to be working. It is quite unsatisfactory for a team offiveor six people to fly from Washington or Mantia to some part of Asia for a week or so in order to evaluate the progress of a rural development program. In the same way that officials of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Australia need to have close contact with the people in the field if they are to be effecJapan tive, so do people from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. At present this is not done. We need to have recruited to these organisations people who can speak the languages spoken in the countries in which programs are being executed and who are prepared to live in the countries for quite long periods of time. Fourthly, there are even arguments for considering whether the size of these agencies should be substantiaUy reduced. The organisations are bureaucratic, inefficient and rather unsuccessful in achieving their goals, and it should not be taken for granted that the existence of these organisations is a good thing. Unless these organisations can do far better in the future, the poor of the world might be better served if the organisations were simply closed down and the resources that they use at present transferred to the poor countries in other ways. For example, if the staff of the Asian Development Bank did not work for the Bank, the governments of countries in South East Asia could hire the staff directly on medium term contracts. In this way, the staff would be more direcdy accountable to the governments of the countries in which they were working. Further, the funds that these agencies provide could be borrowed direcdy by developing countries on world capital markets. Even though the interest rates might be somewhat higher, this would not necessarily be a bad thing because it would be more Ukely that the borrowing countries would look more closely at the way the funds were being used. The remarks I have made tonight by way of criticism of these agencies have been more critical than those made by other speakers in the debate, but I believe that if we are not to adopt paternalistic and patronising attitudes to our Asian neighbours and if we are to look seriously at the real problems, the problems of poverty, we have to advance views which are critical of some of these holy cows in the international aid scene.",102
231,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR MAJOR CEREALS I N,"The Asian Development Fund Bill we are discussing tonight provides the mechanism for Australia's contribution to the 1979-82 program for the Asian Development Bank. The second reading speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) has attached to it a table which shows Australia's contribution as being the fourth largest of the nations that are contributing to the Asian Development Fund. Of course, the main contributor is Japan. I feel that that is a recognition by Japan of the part it can play in the Pacific and the Asian nations. During a trip to earUer this year, it was indicated to us that Japan is quickly reaUsing it has a major part to play in the development of the Asian area. No doubt its contribution to the Fund is recognition of that fact. Possibly Japan has felt for a long time that it has not been involved in the normal workings of Asian nations. Its contribution to this Fund, its friendship treaty with China and also the assistance it is rendering in Vietnam indicate that it wants to go further. The initial contribution by Australia to this program was $18m. The first replenishment was $30.7m. In this Bill, Australia is now committing itself to a further $96.9m contribution or 5.14 per cent of the total contribution. This in itself may not appear to be great, but as I mentioned earUer, the amount represents the fourth largest contribution of those nations which contribute to the Asian Development Fund. The contribution is recognition by the Government of Australia's responsibUity not only to look inward but also to look at the areas of influence where we can help. The projects of the Asian Development Bank undertaken from past contributions are mentioned in the Bank's annual report for 1977. The types of projects undertaken are those of a selfhelp nature and to improve argiculture and community Uving. In fact, the variety of programs shows an active involvement in the welfare of the people in the developing nations. I want to mention some of the projects that are Usted. They include road projects, forestry, agriculture and fishing, the provisioning of sea pons, fertiliser plants, jute factories, flood mitigation and irrigation, drinking water for the communities, transport facilities and industrial research. I understand that the Bank, in making these contributions, monitors the projects very carefully to make sure that the funds are properly apphed. There is a difficulty involved in any contribution that Australia makes overseas. When we contribute to South East Asian nations through funds such as the Asian Development Fund the amount contributed loses its identity. It directed is possible that Australia is not receiving any ticular recognition for many of the projects undertaken in these countries with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank. I think that Australia gets a lot more recognition from those programs which we administer ourselves and which the funds are delivered by Australia. For example, funds are given direcdy to Papua New Guinea through the Colombo Plan and recogJapan, nition is given of our contributions. In this ner, there is less chance of the donation being lost within the mire of a mass contribution. Amounts that have been allocated up to 31 December 1977 which are shown on page 55 inBank dicate that special fund allocation up to that time was $1,166 bUUon. This money is provided rather concessional rate of interest, an on-charge of three-quarters of one per cent to 1 per cent, to cover the maintenance of the account. Also the loans are made over a 40-year period. Therefore, once the amounts are given, although they are recycled, Austraha can never expect to see money back in its revenue. However, that is the intention. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) made a point which I want to pick up. said that the protectionist poUcies of Australia are detrimental in respect of trade and recogsituation, nition throughout South East Asian countries. Of course, Australia is not the only protectionist will nation. Japan, the greatest contributor to the Asian Development Bank, would protectionist nation of its agricultural and secondary industries. I believe that I heard the honourable member for Werriwa correctly when he referred to the subsidies paid to the Australian sugar industry. I would like to correct his statesufficiency ment quite substantially. The subsidy provided at the moment is to the Australian consumer and not to the Austrahan sugar producer. Whatever else might be said about the embargo, it has acted to discipline and advantage the Australian producer. It has also provided counteracting benefits to the Australian consumer. I hope that heard the honourable gentleman incorrectly. Perhaps he was referring to some subsidy to the long run. sugar industry in some other nation. If he is referring to the Austrahan sugar industry, the protection that he claimed to exist is certainly not there. There is a great deal of argument as to whether the $525m allocated this year to the Department of Foreign Affairs is giving us value for this money. Without a doubt, our involvement as an island in the South Pacific region is certainly to the Asian and Pacific nations. Our inparvolvement is attributed to our geography, the being distance of transportation, trade and also, I should mention, defence which I think is particularly important and mutual assistance. In fact, whtie we were in Japan earUer this year they for regarded Japan and Australia as being natural partners. They spoke in terms quite consistently of Australia being natural partners not only with but also with the whole South East Asian manregion and South Pacific region. The contributions of foreign aid that we make are certainly directed to this geographic area. The major contribution by the Asian Development is to Bangladesh, Pakistan and countries such as that whereas there were small recipients at a of amounts of, say, $2m to $3m. Not only do these nations get the benefit of those smaller amounts but also their people are also engaged in the commercial market to make sure that their economic needs can be fulfilled the from that end. For instance, I mentioned an not amount of $3m to Malaysia. I know that at the moment Malaysia is not only borrowing money but also is improving its technology in so many different ways with overseas assistance. The Malaysian beef industry is under the control of He Australians who developed a project there five years ago and are now bringing Malaysia into a certainly not of self sufficiency in beef, but at least of being able able to produce better strains of beef. Hopefully this pattern of progress continue into the future. That is the type of assistance that I feel our foreign aid program be the greatest should be giving. Without a doubt, the main feature that we are talking about in developing nations or in the under-developed nations is the aspect of of food. All other aspects such as the standard of living, quaUty of life, all come back to this basic ingredient of sufficiency of food. I believe that our foreign aid poticy allocates funds to the extent of $36m for food aid, but the major thrust of its work is in the contribution of funds which are diverted to these other major users in I order to make sure that the nations that are receiving the funds do become selfsufficient in the The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) in introducing this debate made quite a feature of the aspect of land usage or areas that are available to the South East Asian nations and compared them with our own situation. Any funds that are given must be seen to be giving a benefit to the people whom we ultimately want to assist-the peasants and the poorer people of those nations. We would not like to see the money wasted on the way. Small packages of land are a feature of the South East Asian nations. Certainly Japan, which is one of the richest countries in the area and one of the richest countries in the world today, survives on very small acreages. Hence the massive amount of subsidy and protection that is given by its government for land usage, in spite of the smallness of the areas, enables farmers to be probably some of the more well off citizens of Japan. I believe this is a feature of all the nations of that region. Certainly in China there is collective use land. When one considers the number of people in a commune who are able to make a living types from the area, certainly the land usage per son would be very small. This is a situation that we have to accept. Let us look at China also the point of view of our foreign aid. While it not a recipient offunds from the Asian Developthrough ment Bank, over the last 12 months it has posscies ibly expanded its philosophies in so many different ways, especially to the extent that would actively look outside its own nation for sistance and technology, it would and it certainly is expanding its programs to obtain credit for the borrowing of money. Perhaps in the future of the Asian Development Bank China might be a recipient of funds also. We are hoping to bring the South East Asian countries out of a fairly difficult past in which fairly old fashioned methods were used. Again I can only revert to the case of China but I think the situation would be the same in many of the other nations throughout South East Asia as far as their methods are concerned. First of all, discipline has been apphed for the proper use of land, varieties of seeds and artificial fertilisers. It portant that the Asian Development Bank, in making loans, monitors the situation very closely to ensure that the funds that are given are used in such a way that modern technology is available for use by the countries. Our assistance to Indonesia also is most vital as far as this Government is concerned not only in the giving of foreign aid to lift its development but also for defence purposes. An amount of $113m has been allocated to Indonesia up to tbistime.Also as a government we give quite a deal extra through the Colombo Plan. It is in projects such as this that I believe Australian technology should be made available if that is at all possible in order to identify Australians with the aid that is being given. In no other way can we identify these funds. If we put them into a pool and distribute them from it that cannot be done. In Indonesia road projects form some of the programs that we are offering. I beheve it is important in these respects, if it is at all possible, that Australian technology should be used in that way. Also, the Philippines is a recipient of not only aid from the Bank but also aid in other respects. That brings me to the point that has been made in this debate of how we see that the funds that we allocate through our programs eventually go to the people who deserve and require them. I use the Philippines as one example. I beheve that the amount of recognition that of Austraha gets through its efforts in the road programs there is minimal. Perhaps some other of projects that are related directly to the perpeople-perhap s a small health program-coul d be identified so that the people could see the from benefits and we could see how the funds were is being spent to make sure that they did not go the bureaucracy and government agenwhere the funds are adulterated to a great extent. Only by getting funds directly to the it people so that they can see the benefits, will asAustraha be recognised as the nation that is givwelcome trade ing the funds. Mr MCVeigh-We could have our own tuberculosis clinics there to help them overcome that problem.",106
232,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR MAJOR CEREALS I N,"Healt h programs are most important. That is one type of project at which we should look. It has already been mentioned that the Asian Development Bank should be made accountable for the funds that we make available. As I have said, we require an identification of the funds that are given. After all, it is not the amount of $500m that is allocated to is imthe Department of Foreign Affairs that is the major concern; it is how that amount is recognised by other countries and how it is spent to make sure that the countries derive the benefits that we would want them to derive. What are the benefits? Certainly they are in assisting developing nations but I think we have to look at the question from the point of view of our trade opportunities and certainly our present and future defence. These benefits will come about only if we are identified with the projects. It is important also that we have an assessment of the various projects that we undertake to make sure that the aid which we are giving and which is expressed in monetary terms in the Budget is used for the purpose for which we want it to be used. As I mendoned before, other projects may identify us more directly with the people. I beheve that a continuing assessment of these projects must be made and, if necessary, changes must be made to put us in a fluid posidon in order to give the funds as we should. It has been said that in the world of today in which travel between Australia and our near neighbours takes such a short dme we are not an island and we cannot afford to isolate ourselves from the pressures of the outside world. Our trade depends on markets being avaUable and the closer they are to us the better. Certainly the markets that have yet to be expanded and explored are those within the Asian region. The recent visit by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) to China would indicate that within that country there is a potendal for a great expansion of our trade. I beheve that Japan and China look to Australia not only as a friend but also as a potential trading partner. They regard Austraha as a country with which they can exchange technology mutually so that we can assist one another. Possibly this is what foreign aid is aU about. The Bank not only can help in the distribution of these funds to the needy nations but also should be able to assist as a permanent monitor of the development that is necessary and the progress that is being made by underdeveloped nations. I mention here not only industrial progress but also social progress because these funds have to be used to make sure that we lift the nation in total, not just one part at a time to the advantage of the few and to the disadvantage of the many. That is where I believe the Bank can play a very important role. In fact, I beheve its greatest responsibUity could be not so much in the distribution and management of these funds but, for aU intents and purposes, as an agency that monitors the progress of the nations that we are trying to help. With these comments I commend the Bill to honourable members as part of our contribution to the more needy nations of the world. This often a subject of vital contention. I say that cause I come from Queensland where the arguthe ment is often used that these funds should be used internally and not externally. Those people conveniently forget or do not want to recognise the fact that Australia's survival depends on rest of the world. Our survival inward looking poUcies. If we are to trade and have strong friendly relationships with other nations, I would suggest that of the nations that I visited earUer this year Japan and China could be of mutual assistance to Australia.

Bill (on motion by Mr MACKellar) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 November, on motion by Mr Sinclair: That the Bill be now read a second time.",108
233,Mr KERIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"At the outset I feel I should say that the Bill before the House relates to matters with which I have been most closely associated since August of last year when I commenced work in the crop marketing analysis section of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. This is the second time that I have come into this House after having worked in and researched an area closely associated with matters of government policy. In a previous period my work was related to the wool industry. At that time. I had to bite my tongue because much of the information in my head had been gained by virtue of my having been a public servant and thereby often gaining knowledge from private outside bodies which were co-operating with government. The same situation applies again tonight, but the ethical restrictions that I believe are on me not to say certain things are not now so great because the Industries Assistance Commission has taken pubUc evidence and IAC has reported on wheat stabUisation. But tonight is not the time to go into the recommendations and the possibilities of the next stabUisation scheme. It would be better to leave them until the scheme is introduced. Much of that report directly is covered matters that we are debating here. I do benot think either that we need to debate tonight recent High Court of Australia decision with respect to section 92 of the Constitution. But I would have thought that the introduction of this Bill gives some credence to the view that perhaps the the present scheme may be extended for one cannot result from more year. The Industries Assistance Commission has allowed a lot of debate to take place in this country, particularly on the rural industries and the measures of assistance going to them. I beheve that such assistance should be more fettered and not less fettered. We are not going to get better pohcies if secrecy prevails and if bodies and individuals are prevented from saying things that are not palatable to the Government. I believe that the Industries Assistance Commission regards itself as being under attack to some degree. I was particularly displeased to see that Hylda Rolfe was not reappointed to the Industries Assistance Commission. I would hope that that was not because she expressed some views on superphosphate that did not accord with those of this Government. What I am coming round to saying is that although I have some specific knowledge on the areas under debate tonight, I wiU try not to relate any matter on which I gained knowledge directly by having been a public servant. However, fortunately there is a lot of pubUc information now about wheat. This does not stop me from saying that I believe that many statutory authorities such as the Australian Wheat Board are still too secretive with respect to information given to NA Grade and class Recommended varieties"") Queensland Timgalen, Mendos, Gamut, Gatcher, Spica, New South Wales Winglen, Windebri, Tarsa, Gamut, Queensland Timgalen, Mendos, Gamut, Gatcher, Spica, NSW Northern Winglen, Windebri, Timgalen, Gamut, NSW Southern Falcon, Eagle Victorian Emblem Sth Australian Glaive, Gabo, Timgalen, Raven.

Neither does it not stop me from saying that bodies such as the Austrahan Wheat growers Federation should engage in more open debate on their views rather than relying on poltiical leverage to have their poUcies implemented by governments. The Bill mainly relates, firstly, to the provisions to establish a varietal control scheme for wheat by providing for the imposition of dockages on the varieties of wheat possessing undesirable characteristics deUvered to the Austrahan Wheat Board. Secondly, it provides for a change in the legal basis on which the Board makes payments to State bulk handling authorities and for a change in the basis of remuneration. The change in the legal basis was inserted as a result of a legal problem identified by the Auditor General. Varietal recommendations and the question of varietal control have been around for quite a long time. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table from a report on the wheat industry by Sir Alan Calaghan pubUshed quite sometimeago. Leave granted.

234,Mr KERIN,FOR A WHEAT CLASSIFICATION AND GRADING SYSTEM,"I should stress to honourable members that this table sets out an idea as to the way in which a classification of a varietal recommendation system would work, particularly with respect to protein and other characteristics or limiting factors. Some of the varieties recommended at that time are no longer recommended. I suppose the really big omissions are varieties such as Cook, Oxley and Kite. But as I said, it sets out the principles. In the past, and for the present year each State Department of Agriculture, not the Austrahan Wheat Board, has made and will make varietal recommendations by statistical division or by local government area or, in some cases, by silo. As an introduction to varietal control in the present year, for example, the New South Wales Government has recommended varieties by silo groupings which have been based on the performance of varieties in each location and on the history of the average percentage of protein in the wheat stored in the silo over the past 10 years. Such atimefor calculation is necessary because a protein level can be fixed by climatic as well as soil factors. There are many variations through the years. This means that the main criterion of quality is wheat protein. However, quality per se is not an objective factor unless it can be related to the market on which the wheat will be sold. Not only can one not produce all high protein wheat, but also one cannot sell it all necessarily. The quaUty of most market values to be associated with protein is the degree of hardness or softness of the wheat. In Protein content Other characteristics and (percentage*)) limiting factoist ) 2 3 In addition to the wheat from recommended Pinnacle, Falcon, Eagle. varieties, it contains wheat unacceptable for receival as NSW Southern Hard and NSW Soft.

Minimum weight-6 2 Ib per bushel. general, and I stress 'in general', it is best that there be a gradation of wheats from high protein hard through to low protein soft. But for some uses, inversions of this gradation are desirable. For example, for starch high protein, soft wheat is desired. Wheat has many qualities and these are being tested by variety and by grade by various State authorities. New varieties of wheat are being tested constantly and their qualities are being tested. For the Australian Wheat Board to possess a fuU catalogue of wheats, falling into the four major classifications in which wheat is sold on the international market, it is essential to be able to specify to some degree those varieties that have the most potential to perform well in certain areas and to pay a premium for them. For example, in Queensland and northern New South Wales, where prime hard wheat is able to be grown, it would be sUly to plant varieties that might yield a high protein, but which had a low yield or which had other characteristics such as poor baking quaUty. But even in this area there have been times when high yielding, but supposedly lower quaUty wheats would have given growers a greater return per hectare. It is this sort of equation that has caused most dissention. Before the Australian Wheat Board can specify varieties to grow on the basis of protein, hardness and baking qualities, as well as aU the usual parameters for acceptance of wheat, such as cleanness and shattering quality, it logically should be able to show two things. Firsdy, it should be able to show that there is a need for as much high protein hard wheat on the international market as it is possible to grow. That is, it should be able to show what the international market for wheat is. Secondly, it should be able to show that there is a real premium to be gained on the international market by providing this wheat. On the first point, it is problematical just what the international market for wheat is. Stocks affect it, climate here and abroad affect it and various institutional characteristics of exporting and importing countries affect it. We just do not know beforehand what the markets for particular qualities of wheat in any one year will be. On the second point, except in the boom period of wheat prices during the years of the Whitlam Labor Government's, there is little evidence of the premiums paid for wheat locally being related to the actual premiums received. On many occasions, better prices were received for wheats of supposedly lower quaUty. But I emphasise that quaUty is in the eyes of the buyer or the ultimate user. A buyer may not even be buying on objective grounds. For example, the buyer may be buying the wheat to blend it or for a freight advantage, that is, a price advantage, or he may be buying it on the grounds of price pure and simple or colour or tradition. I beheve that the Australian Wheat Board needs to give more information on the size of the various international markets in which it is competing. There is not just one international market. I sympathise with the Board for the problems it faces. It has to seU aU the wheat that is handed to it. While it may be possible for everyone to grow more stock feed wheat and maximise returns per hectare, the Board may not be able to sell it all. It is the same sort of argument against over-border trade. Those indulging in a practice of local optimum advantage may not be able to get away with it in the universal case. I think there needs to be a lot more openness and research into the international wheat markets, the premiums and the qualities before the Australian Wheat Board can say with certainty what and why it wants certain varieties grown, and how much it needs to pay premiums on a more direcdy market related basis. I would make another point The emphasis on high protein hard varieties, where possible, I agree with mainly because of the Board's marketing problem and also because of the vagaries of the weather which can always stick it with a lot of off-grade wheat. For example, this year there may be a problem with a massive amount of sprouted wheat. However, the converse can apply. I think that very often we may be selling high protein hard wheat as Australian Standard White because we have too much of it. Some of these wheat quality committees in the industry tend to be intellectually dominated by the millers and cereal chemists rather than the marketers. I believe this is another criticism. Australian millers and bread manufacturers can pick the eyes out of the market because they want only about 20 per cent of what we produce. Our market in Europe where this sort of quaUty wheat was needed for blending has gone. Our future markets may well be for wheat for noodles entirely, or for stock feed, for Middle Eastern breads, for chapattis et cetera, where milling machinery is non-existent or primitive. WhUe it may be true that sophistication in this regard is increasing in lesser developed countries, in times of shortage it is the rural poor that need grain, not the rising urban middle class. Another problem is that there has been evidence of interstate rivalries as far as the production of wheat varieties is concerned. I do not wish for breeders, testers and cereal chemists to be taken from out of the State domains, but I believe there is a need for a bit more co-operation at times. One could give examples of where varieties have been down-played by a State on less than objective grounds. Apart from these market aspects of varietal control I have been speaking on, there are some very practical advantages in the handling of wheat. At present all wheat is segregated on receival on the basis of pre-receival or point of receival subjective and objective testing. Although agronomic factors will determine to a large degree the protein of wheat, it is the variety which determines other quaUty characteristics. Some 60 per cent to 80 per cent of Australian wheat is Australian Standard White and thus fits into a fairly well defined slot on the international market. But without extensive and time consuming quaUty tests the wheat received at a single station or sUo may be of 30 varieties, all of which form into an aggregated average grade but which will contain some part of the bulk at extremes of various quaUty parameters-that is, the sUo may be full of wheat that is not homogenous. Variety is very difficult to define on entry. There has been a problem with low protein hard wheats-for example, within SW. Although Australia has some 23 to 27 segregations of wheat there wtil be on average only up to four or five segregations at a certain sUo collecting point. Each segregation will cost money as it costs storage space. If the number of varieties can be Umited and if these varieties are optimum agronomically for that area, they in turn become more optimal as a marketing proposition. It is better to have silos filled with more homogenous samples and less segregations than vice versa. I accept that in any area there may be an economic case to grow a high yielding stock feed wheat but if it is to be sold it must bear all the real costs of its segregated storage and handling and, as I have said before, not everyone can do this necessarily. I do not want to get down to cases but, as a result of the work I did in the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, I agree particularly with the Queensland and New South Wales recommendations on wheat varieties for this year and beheve that only a limited economic case can be made to say that growers have been led up the garden path with respect to the recommendations in previous years. There simply needs to be a lot more economic research on the excellent agronomic research that is being done by the States. I now move on to the other main proposal in the Bill with respect to wheat handUng. The Australian Wheat Board receives through its licenced receivers all wheat tendered to it by growers subject to rninimum specified standards. These Ucensed receivers are the bulk handUng authorities in each State. There are four Government authorities and two wheat growers cooperatives. It is also received by certain dour millers and stock feed suppliers who have been licensed to receive wheat. The bulk handling authority is the Grain Elevators Board in New Depredation Interest and Loan Expenses Interest on Tolls and Levies Operating Expenses HiringCharges Total Source: AWB.",111
235,Mr KERIN,FOR A WHEAT CLASSIFICATION AND GRADING SYSTEM,"Storag e and handUng costs are pooled and shared on a pro rata basis among all wheat growers throughout Australia. The Australian Wheat Board has proposed, and now the Government proposes, that this arrangement be altered so that wheat growers in any one State bear directly the costs of their bulk handling authority. On the basis that the current reimbursement system continued, then, between South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania; the Cooperative Bulk Handling Ltd in South Australia and Western Australia; and the State Wheat Board in Queensland. To quote the present Act, upon deUvery the wheat 'becomes the absolute property of the Board freed from aU mortgages, charges, Uens, pledges, interests and trusts'. Capital expenditure by the bulk handling authorities in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland is financed either through State Government loans or commercial loans, which in total form part of the State's loan allocation from the Australian Loan Council. In South Australia and Western Australia, capital expenditure is financed by tolls on deliveries from growers, which provide a rotating loan fund, and loans from commercial institutions. These receivers have costs on the following items reimbursed by the Australian Wheat Board: Depreciation on storages, buildings, and equipment; interest and associated expenses for the purchase of assets; interest on tolls in South Austraha; interest on tolls and levies in Western Australia and interest on levies in Queensland. Also reimbursed are operating expenses and hiring charges paid to the bulk handling authorities on the basis of 1 per cent of the original cost of the asset. The costs incurred by the bulk handling authorities in the handling of wheat are set out in a table which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The table reads asfollowsPAYMENTS TO BULK HANDLING AUTHORITIES: BY STATE: 1974-75 ($m) NSW Vic.

236,Mr KERIN,UNIT PAYMENTS TO BULK HANDLING,"I understand that likely charges wiU now reflect wider disparities in charges than that shown in the table. For example, the table shows that the charge in the most expensive State would be approximately $9.64c a tonne in 1976-77. The cheapest was Victoria at $4.85. I have heard that the New South Wales bulk handling authority wtil be charging something Uke $ 12 per tonne. The total storage capacity for wheat-excludin g stock feed and on-farm storage-in 1976-77 was 20.3 mUUon tonnes. The bulk handling authorities control nearly all this 3 Z l a 1 rnili^ZlTnt ? £ ^ f f - S"" TXnra^rL^^ The storage capacity of flour nulls was only 0.3 million tonnes. I have already mdicated that varteta control will act to mcrease storage but the £ S 3 n S n n K ^ ^ we gation S will l get ^ better mat in a moment. The Opposition supports the idea of State counting as the basis of costing of handUng and storage charges, mainly for reasons of economic efficiency and equity. The cost to individual procontrols ducers in an industry should reflect the real cost of the services provided. But one accepts there are institutional and administrative tages in the pooling of some costs and returns, and of course costs wtil still be pooled within the State under the new system. The question of handling, storage, and transport and their lated costs to growers is going to be the key area _, for concern to growers and government^ and authorities in the future. The percentage growers costs being taken by those items are increasing most rapidly. There is a sort of catch 22 situation here. Australia is one of the few countries where nearly aU wheat is delivered immediately on harvest. Debate interrupted.

All these Acts were passed between 1970 and 1977. These sorts of things have happened in Australia, too. It is often forgotten, particularly by the extreme conservationists in this country, just how much this country owes to the mining industry. The article in the Financial Review made it quite clear that, for example, 40 minerals are used in the manufacture of every telephone. I wonder whether the honourable members opposite who seem to go for the extremes of conservation and the people outside who use telephones so much in the cause of sabotaging Australian industry realise that 40 minerals are used in the construction of every telephone. In order to bring the country down they are quite prepared to use the things which the mining industry provides. I think that this is scandalous. I move from the situation in the United to the situation in Australia. I do not often mend any of the Ministers, but I would like the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is at the table, to convey to his friend and colleague the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Groom) my debate congratulations for the cuts that have been made to the grants for the Australian Conservation Foundation in particular. If i can ing to the House about this matter the situation will arise in which the Australian Conservation Foundation will not get a cracker. That is the situation that I want to bring about. That is I have been striving for ever since I have been here. The Foundation's funds in some respects, I have been successful. I hope that everyone else who feels the same as I do will say much the same thing. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Commumty Development made two important points in a recent news release. I will not ask leave to incorporate it in Hansard but I will a couple of sentences from it which I think significant. The news release stated: The Government had, however, decided that from year (1979-80) the matching grant would be made for$l basis. In other words, the conservationists do something for themselves and raise a few bob themselves to pay for the sabotage. The Minister went on to say: The protection of the National Estate is not the bility of government alone or of one group of people. something in which the whole community should be involved. I would tike to know how much of the community has been involved in the extreme conservation movements. It is quite obvious that it would not be a large percentage. If we took a survey of the members of this House we would find that very few of them are so involved. I know that there are one or two on our side who still pay their money, very foolishly I think, to the Victorian branch of the Australian Conservation Foundation. This is a complete waste of money. I hope that they take what the Minister has said seriously. I hope that they do not give it another cracker. I hope that, from now on, the Government will make it harder for these groups. I have said in this House before that all we seem to do is feed our enemies. They take the money that we give them and use it to propagandise against us. If these cuts are not made, we can expect to see some of the money from the Austrahan Conservation Foundation used to destroy the Yeppoon project in Queensland. This is absolutely disgraceful. I think that this action is a most refreshStates ing departure from what we have seen up to comdate. I hope that the Minister will continue with the good work that he has started and reduce the (Mr Viner), who funding to nil.",114
237,Mr INNES,UT Y, I rise in this to raise a matter that was so hypocritically put to the Parhament this morning by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He talked keep on speakabout civil liberties.,115

239,Mr INNES,UT Y,"He referred to the proposition passed at the weekend at the Victorian Australian Labor conference. He put this in a perspective that was completely erroneous. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) for straightened it out when he said that the resolquote ution condemned the onslaught against human are rights by any authoritarian or totalitarian government, whether based on the ideology of next the Left or the Right. One of the individuals on a $1 whom the Prime Minister named, Mr Hartley, in fact opposed the proposition but it was carried in will have to the terms quoted. The real issue here is the hypocrisy that is evident in the attitude of the Prime Minister. He talks about civil liberties. What were the civil responsiliberties involved in the expulsion, by kangaroo It is court mentods, of Jennings and Francis in Victoria. Honourable members do not need to rely on the view of the Labor Party only. I refer to the Canberra Times of 2 August. It says, amongst a number of things: Mr Doug Jennings, member for Westernport of the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, made the mistake of putting loyalty to the people of Victoria before loyalty to an eral Party. What the world has been deploring in the Soviet Union is happening in Australia: The Soviet Communist Party is putting in gaol people who have the honesty and courage to publicly criticise the party line. It seems Liberal Party of Victoria is now joining that distinguished company by disowning its ownSo called: traditional beliefs . . .",115

246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UT Y,Order! I warn the honourable member for Hotham. The honourable member for Melbourne will withdraw that remark.,116
247,Mr INNES,UT Y,"I withdraw it. The point here is that during the course of the lead-up to this kangaroo court action the Victorian State member concerned was given five minutes in which to defend himself. The honourable member for MCMUlan (Mr Simon) declared in a Press report that he was condemned before he went off. Before the trial took place, the honourable member for MCMUlan had indicated that he was going to be expelled. The Age of 26 July prior to the event reports: A Liberal MHR, Mr Simon, predicted yesterday rebel MP Mr Jennings, member expelled from the Liberal Party. Some time after that this feUow was in effect expelled. Some of the material that was has produced prior to the event states: The expulsion motion has been launched by Liberal Federal MP Mr Simon and nine other delegates to the council. The Federal Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Lynch, is expected to lead State and move to oust Mr Jennings. That is great! That is the pot calling the kettle black! This material continues: Mr Lynch is expected to be strongly supported by the Premier Mr Hamer and his Deputy Mr Thompson. Supporters of Mr Lynch are confident that they can obtain the necessary three-fifths of the votes cast to expel Mr Jennings. A number of prominent members of the Liberal erring LibParty resigned as a result and at least they showed some integrity, unlike the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Roger Johnston) and the other people who support the Prime Minister. that the They have not raised even one finger in protest about the way in which he is not prepared to do anything about the treatment of Jennings and Francis, despite his views on civil liberties. On the contrary the Prime Minister comes into this place as if butter would not melt in his mouth, criticising and misrepresenting what occurred at the Victorian Conference of the Labor Party when in actual fact the Liberal Party in Victoria was trying to bury what had happened. It is hypocrisy of the worse type, and the Prime Minister stands condemned. All he is concerned about is to red bait, attack unionists and attack the people in his own party. If they are not prepared to toe the line he will have them expelled.",116
248,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UT Y,Mr MILLAR Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Before I call another speaker I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that under the Standing Orders interjections are out of order. Under certain circumstances the Chair can extend its indulgence if interjections of a mild nature might be helpful to the course of the debate but they cannot be tolerated if they bring the House into total disarray as we have recently witnessed. I caution all honourable members that the Chair cannot be tolerant of the abuse of the latitude extended to them.,116

I do not wish to indulge myself in any persecution of the Leader of the Opposition but simply to give an objective assessment. It is now common knowledge within this Parliament that the Leader of the Opposition personally has been a bitter disappointment to his strongest supporters of only 12 months ago.

270,Mr STEWART,UT Y," Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be pleased to learn that after 25 years in Parhament I have learned a few more things than has the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman). When I was his age and first came to this House I thought that I could be aggressive, come into the House and take over on the adjournment debate, but after a few years I found out that it is much better to act normally than to act like a Sir Laurence Olivier. I raise a matter tonight which is not rect responsibiUty of the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) but which must be of vital concern to him. I refer to the double graduation this year of medical students from the universities of Sydney and New South Wales. In the early 1970s the administrators of the medical schools of the universities of Sydney and New South Wales decided to reduce the academic time of their medical courses from six years to five years. The proposed courses were approved by the General Medical Council of Great Britain. At thattimeaU the States and the Territories of Australia accepted the GMC medical standards. The first five-year medical students commenced their courses in New South Wales in 1974 which means that this year the last of the six-year graduates and the first of the five-year graduates wtil be looking for places in hospitals in New South Wales to complete their one-year compulsory internship which is required for their fuU registration by the Medical Board of New South Wales. The New South Wales Government has made arrangements for the 800 to 900 graduates this year to be placed in hospitals in New South Wales for their one-year internship. But it is the next year, in 1980, that the troubles of these young doctors wtil commence. Then sufficient internships wtil be avaUable in New South Wales hospitals for about only half of the 1979 graduates. One might say: 'So what. There are plenty of hospitals in Austraha and those graduates who cannot be placed in New South Wales hospitals should be able to find a place in a hospital in another State or in one of the territories if they wish to have two years hospital experience'. However, my information is that there are very few places in hospitals throughout Australia which are notfiUedby local graduates. If these inexperienced doctors decide to go into general practice they wtil be eUgible to practise only New South Wales and Western Australia, and perhaps Queensland, as the medical boards in those States are prepared to register the five-year graduates after one year's internship. The Northern Territory and Tasmanian medical boards have decided that five-year academic training plus a two-year internship is required before registration is allowed there. The Victorian and South Australian medical boards have not yet made a decision on registration quaUfications but they are expected to decide on a five-year academic plus two-year internship before they will aUow registration. WhUst these New South Wales doctors will be able to obtain registration in New South Wales, a di- Western Australia, perhaps Queensland and also in Great Britain, they will not be able to register in the Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria or South Australia. Has anyone ever heard of a more ludicrous situation? I emphasise that this situation has not been brought about by the decision of any government but by the unilateral action of university administrators and medical boards in various states. Surely, after the difficulties Australia has had in trying to solve the problems created by not having universal educational quaUfications, universal rati gauges, universal traffic signs and laws and in having an industrial movement which is confounded by State and Federal unions and State and Federal awards, we should have learnt that we are one nation with a common bond and",118
271,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UT Y,Mr M ill a r ) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,118
272,Mr CORBETT,UT Y,"Tonight I too want to refer to health insurance. I beheve that in the main health insurance wtil be successful and that costs in relation to the percentage of population participating in the insurance scheme will be lowered. Whilst there is no compulsion to insure, if people desire to have the doctor of their choice and to go to a private hospital for treatment it is necessary for them to take out hospital insurance to cover the extra cost that will be incurred. Many people would desire to do this. But if they do not insure there is no way in which they could afford to pay the very heavy medical and hospital costs which they could incur. Therefore if they are to avail themselves of those privileges they wtil have to take out hospital insurance. If people are encouraged not to insure and if such encouragement were successful it would be reasonable to assume that because of the lower numbers insuring the cost of insuring would bein come greater. The cost to those people who feel the need for the protection that insurance would give them would find the cost very heavy indeed. Another factor to be considered is the very high cost of conducting private hospitals. These costs are greatly influenced by the percentage of bed occupancy in these hospitals. It would almost certainly follow that if the number of people taking hospital insurance were reduced the number of people able to afford private hospital fees with the doctor of their choice would reduced, perhaps to the extent that hospitals would have difficulty in surviving. must be of very real concern to thinking people in the community. It is against this background that I deprecate the attitude of the Leader Opposition (Mr Hayden), as stated in the expired. Courier-Mail, that he will not take out private health insurance for himself and his family. course, if the Leader of the Opposition or member of his family required hospitalisation, he would, no doubt, be able to afford a doctor a hospital ofhis choice if this is what he chose do. This opportunity would not be available many people on a lower income. The Leader the Opposition is quoted as having said: Irealise,of course, there are people with chronic health, or families with a number constant medical attention, The Labor Party's health spokesman, Dr Klugthere man, has also been reported to have decided against private health insurance. I beheve that will not deny that he is in accord with what leader said in that regard. He too, probably even more so, would be able to afford any medical hospital costs he might be confronted with if wished to have the doctor of his choice in the hospital of his choice. On the other hand, Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) have said they are insuring to maintain the higher medical and hospital benefits. Some concern has been pressed to him about the attitude people might take following what the Leader of the Oppomember sition and the Labor Party's health spokesman have said with regard to their attitude towards hospital insurance. That concern was felt by number of people, particularly those associated with private hospitals which have served community for a longtimeand which are of high repute. They may not be able to continue operatout ing. This would deprive people, who really beceed Ueve that their money would be providing for a doctor of then choice in a private hospital, of a choice. I hope that the shadow Minister will agree that sometimes this is of value in medical treatment. However, I have been assured by the Minister for Health that the numbers of people insuring are satisfactory to him. It is fairly obvious that the community at large has not taken any notice of the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Minister for Health in relation to hospital insuranceI am pleased that the community at large is looking at the matter in this way so enabling those people to whom the also be Leader of the Opposition referred and many other people who require hospital insurance to This prospect obtain that cover.",118

Three hundred and seventeen courses were conducted during 1977-78 for employees of the organisations total of 3,178 employees took advantage of these cluding 1,138 women employees. Commonwealth support for the scheme is through the Adult Migrant Education Program. Participating employer organisations also contribute significandy to the scheme by providing classroom accommodation at the workplace and by allowing employees to attend classes wholly or partly during paid working hours. Commonwealth expenditure on the Courses-in-Industry scheme cannot be readily separated out in all cases because some staff and other resources are used in relation to the adult migrant educauon program generally as port of this particular scheme. Subject to estimated that $328,000 was spent on that 1977-78 program year from the funds provided migrant education program. $520,000 has Courses-in-Industry for the 1978-79 financial year.

J. Fitzsimons was a spokesman for my Depanment and not for the National Health and Medical Research Council. This answer clarified my reply to a question without notice on 8 May 1978 (Hansard, page 1959) in which, on the basis of preliminary advice I had referred to a spokesman from Council. Dr E. J.

Tertiary Education: Course Approvals Mr Hyde asked the Minister representing the Minister for Educauon, upon nodce, on 27 September 1978: (1) How many new courses were submitted by Western Australian tertiary institutions to the Western Australian Post-Secondary Education Commission for approval during the last 12 months. (2) What were the courses they submitted. (3) Which of these courses (a) were approved, (b) were refused, and on what grounds, and (c) are still under consideration. (4) Do the courses approved satisfy the Tertiary Education Commission's guidelines for such approvals and in particular are they being offered within available financial and academic resources as referred to in the Tertiary Education Commission's Repon for the 1979-81 Triennium, Vol. 1, paragraph 2.21.",129
288,Mr STALEY,PROHIBITED IMMIGRANTS DEPORTED,"The Minister for Educauon has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1), (2) and (3) The matters raised by the honourable member's question are the concern of the Western Australian Post-Secondary Education Commission. The Commonwealth has no information of the type sought as the responsibility for the anangements made and the decisions reached rest with the State. (4) In accordance with approved arrangements for consideration of new teaching activities and courses in universi(Question No. 2270) ties and colleges of advanced educadon, the Tertiary Education Commission considered a number of proposals placed before it in relation to Western Australian institutions. The Western Australian Post-Secondary Education Commission submitted four course proposals for approval for introduction in 1979, as follows: Western Australian Secondary Teachers College: Associate Diploma in Ans/Applied Science Western Australian Institute of Technology: Associate Diploma in Engineering; Masters Degree in Metallurgy; Masters Degree in Health Science. The three proposals at the Western Australian Institute of Technology were approved. The Associate Diploma in Arts/Applied Science at the Western Australian Secondary Teachers College was not approved. The Tertiary Education Commission felt that as this proposal had significant implications for the future development of teacher education institutions no decision should be made which might pre-empt a comprehensive consideration of appropriate developments. In addition, Murdoch University has submitted to the Tertiary Education Commission for approval a proposed new teaching activity in linguistics to begin in 1980. This submission is currendy being considered. Also, the University of Western Australia proposes in 1979 to extend its existing law course to include a diploma of legal practice as an alternative to articles of clerkship. As this diploma would be an extenSec- sion of existing studies rather than a new development, the Commission's agreement was not required.

(2) (a) Provision for a survey of household income and expenditure in respect of 1979-80 was omitted from the forward staff estimates of the Australian Bureau of Statistics because the substantial resources duct such a survey were not available. (b) and (c) The staff ceiling set for the Australian Bureau of Statistics for 1978-79 was less than that required by the Statistician to maintain ongoing statistical operations, develop and maintain statistical standards to meet the needs of users and undertake new high priority statistical work for 1978-79. As a result, it was necessaiy to review the planned ABS work program for 1978-79 to find ways of reducing the program to enable the ABS to stay within its allocated staff ceiling whilst causing the least possible impact on users of ABS output. The Statistician nominated a number of possible areas for program cuts. These were selected on the basis that they were not considered to be mainstream economic and social indicators, that they were as self-contained as possible so as not to have major repercussions on inter-related projects and that they were small to medium the whole impact on one sector of the economy.

296,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PROHIBITED IMMIGRANTS DEPORTED,"The answer to the work, honourable member's question is as follows: The Government's policy on nuclear safeguards was anin nounced by me on 24 May 1977, and remains unchanged. I funher to the question of reprocessing in my stateto contact the ment on 25 August 1977. Motor Vehicle Plan Mr Hurford asked the Prime Minister the following question, without notice, on 19 October (Question No. 2650) 1978: My question should be directed to the Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce, but in his absence I ask the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that the 30 per cent devaluation of the Australian dollar in relation to the Yen has meant a higher by Australian content requirement under the motor vehicle S plans than was the intention when the plans were formulated? Is it a fact that the adjustments announced by the Minister yesterday do not offset completely the effects of the 30 per cent devaluation and have left Chrysler Australia Limited and possibly other motor vehicle manufacturing companies paying large penalties for factors over which they had no control? Is it also a fact that these large penalties may result in a further disastrous loss of employment? Is it true that General Motors-Holden's Ltd and Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd can now reduce their local content from over 90 per cent to 85 per cent, thus creating more unemployment? Without wishing in any way to support or criticise the changes made yesterday but seeking information, I ask the Prime Minister why the Government has not aUowed a full adjustment for the 30 per cent devaluation and why he has allowed the abolition ofreversioncontrol procedures? Mr Lynch-The Prime Minister has referred the quesdon to me. The answer is as follows: The effect of appreciation of the Yen against the Australian dollar has caused difficulties for some companies meeting their local content hicle Plan, but it has not caused difficulties for others. Thus it is not a fact that the Yen appreciation has generally caused higher Australian contentrequirementas calculated under the Plan rules than when the Plan was formulated. Whilst appreciation of the Yen has caused componentry sourced from Japan to be less economic than at formulated, conversely it has improved the competitiveness of componentry sourced from Australia compared to imports from Japan. For some producers this will mean physically incorporating into their vehicles more local components they had originally envisaged. However the Motor Vehicle Plan contentrequirementsare not based on meeting specific requirements as to the actual componentry incorporated vehicles. Content is calculated on a value basis with the cision as to which componentry to source locally being a matter for commercial decision making. It should be noted that if there were to be a devaluation against the dollar in the currency of a countiy supplying components to an Australian car manufacturer, then that manufacturer would be able toreducehis local component sourcing and still meet the local content levels prescribed in the Plan. The adjustments announced by the Government on 18 October 1978recognisethe difficulties brought about for certain companies by the rapid appreciation of the Yen and the fact that resourcing of components cannot be achieved quickly because of the necessary leadtimesinvolved. The Government's action was in conformity with the Plan's provisions that circumstances beyond a company's control which have caused or contributed to its failure to comply with the Plan may be taken into account in considering whether or not penalties should be applied. Passenger motor vehicle manufacturers who were affected by major foreign currency appreciations will be allowed to adjust their local content calculation for the purpose of application of penalty duties under month lag in the application of exchange rates. The adjustment will have effect from 1 July 1978 and will expire on 31 December 1979 when all Plan manufacturers will berequiredto be at 85 per cent company average local content on the basis of exchange rates applicable at that time. This action is not intended to eliminate the need for penalty payment by these companies for failing to meet their local content commitments. Any penalty liability which companies may incur for failing to meet their commitments for reasons other than the Yen appreciation will not be affected. There is no basis in speculation in the media and elsewhere that employment m the industry will be affected by any penalties for which motor vehicle manufacturers may be Uable. The Government decided to abolish the reversion control because it has now served its intended purpose. This was to provide a means of avoiding major disruption in the component sector during the phasing period of the present Plan while the local content levels in certain vehicles entered in former plans was being reduced. The average local content levels of General MotorsHolden's Ltd and the Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd have already been significantly reduced towards 85 per cent and the opportunities forreversionto overseas sources of componentry have thus become very much limited. At the same time the component industry has been receiving substantial additional business from the new manufacturers as they increase the local content of their vehicles in in accordance with their commitments under the Plan. obligations under the Motor VeReversion control was never intended to be a permanent a feature of the Motoi Vehicle Plan. This was clearly indicated by the Government when the motor vehicle policy was announced in the Parliament on 30 March 1976 and again in a further statement by the then Minister for Industry and thetimethe Plan was Commerce on 9 June 1976. To introduce reversion control as an integral part of the Motor Vehicle Plan would constitute a major change to the Plan; and major investment decisions have been made in the than confident expectation that the rules will not be changed. The basic thrust of the Government's motor vehicle policy in is to facilitate the development of a more viable and comdepetitive industry by reducing Government intervention in commercial decision making and giving the vehicle builders more flexibility in making their own component sourcing arrangements within the overall 85 per cent company average local content requirement. Rural Exports: Union Bans (Question No. 1470) Mr Lusher asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 2 June 1978: (1) Which overseas markets for Australian rural products are currendy the subject of trade union bans or limitations. (2) Which Australian rural exports or potential exports are currently the subject of trade union bans or limitations. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (1) and (2) There is currently a ban placed by the Australasian Meat Industiy Employees Union (AMIEU) in 1974 on the export of live cattle to Japan, Canada, the United States of America and the Middle East. the Plan on the basis of a 12 The ban does not apply to other export markets such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and the near East. AMIEU policy, however, is that the expon of live cattle to these countries is subject to a limit on numbers of cattle exported. In addition, live sheep and merino rams are currently the subject of specific trade union bans or limitations. Earlier this year action taken by members of the AMIEU threatened expons of live sheep to Middle East countries and Iran. As from 19 April expons proceeded subject to an agreement between parties to the dispute and pending reports being received on the employment implications of live sheep exports and proposals for improving carcass meat exports to the Middle East. The AMIEU wrote to me in August advising that it would not regard itself as bound by the agreement as from 31 August 1978. The Federal Executive of the AMIEU is seeking the views of members of the Union as to the future policy on action to be taken by the Union with regard to live sheep exports. On the subject of merino rams, my colleague for Primary Industry, announced that the long standing embargo with regard to the export of merino rams would be partially lifted as from S July 1978. He indicated the intention was that up to 300 rams would be able to be exported a trial basis over a 12 month period. The ACTU Executive position, resolved on 6 July 1978, was to ask Union members who might be involved 'not cilitate the export of merino rams against the decision of growers expressed by way of referendum'. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industry have recently reaffirmed export of merino rams on a trial basis. Ranger Uranium Project Mr Uren asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 15 August 1978: (1) In view of his statement to the House on Thursday, 1 June 1978, concerning the marketing of uranium in which he said that at present only formal development approval has been granted to the Ranger Project, what form has development approval for the Ranger Project taken. (2) Has the Government specifically rejected the request of the Northern Land Councd that if uranium go ahead, that the smaller Nabarlek mine proceed first so that traditional Aboriginal land owners can access the effects of mining on their lands.",132
