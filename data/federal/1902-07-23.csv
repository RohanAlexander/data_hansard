2,Sir LANGDONBONYTHON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Acting Minister for Defence whether it is true that the federal military authorities are ignoring the claims of the South Australian drill instructors, and are sending to Adelaide men who have been retrenched in Now South Wales and Queensland. An officer in championing the cause of the non-commissioned officers - in South Australia saysThey have proved during a long course' of years to be thorough!}' competent to train the troops, and our representative corps to the Sydney Commonwealth celebrations and to Melbourne during the Royal visit compared more than favourably with any troops from the other States. Colonel Tauuton, who watched the recent Easter mameuvrei) here, also expressed great pleasure at the evidence of careful training and discipline which he observed. Our instructors have worked on with very little encouragement for years, and it is only reasonable that they should expect some consideration when it is decided to employ regular instructors. Some of the best non-coms, in the active forces have, expressed a determination to resign in consequence of their shabby treatment, and no wonder.",14
3,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I must ask the honourable member to give notice of the question. CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATIO NMr VL SOLOMON:- I wish to ask if the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs has been directed to the following telegram with reference to Customs administration in Adelaide, which appeared in this morning's Argus'i- Following ou the notification that the ""Victorian system of passing entries is to be adopted in this State, it seems that instructions have been issued, that officers are not to give information to importers regarding the correct rate of duty to be paid ou goods. This new and unpleasant instruction came into effect this morning. Importers who were in doubt regarding the correct rate of duty discovered that the approving officers could give no assistance as formerly. They must, therefore, in future use their best judgment and run the risk of the consequences should fchey commit an error of judgment, or go to the extra trouble of sighting the goods. This is exasperating, especially as ib is difficultfcosee where an injustice would be done to any officer, or how the revenue could possibly sutler by the extension of what after all is only ordinary business courtesy. If this telegram is correct, does not the Minister think that the action taken by the Customs authorities will lead to a multiplication of the vexatious prosecutions for trivial errors of various kinds in pass-' ing Customs entries that have been so much complained of in the past?",14
4,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"There would be some force in the remarks of the honourable member if the telegram were true, but it is not. The only new direction given has been issued for the purpose of preventing the public from being led into error, and in order to secure to them the best advice as to the way in which they should make their entries. I found that some of my officers who were not competent to do so had been advising the public with results which ought, if possible, to be avoided. I therefore wrote the following minute :Confusion evidently arises from the loose practice which frequently prevails of every officer essaying to replyfcoinquiries by the public as to Tariff questions, mid verbally. I desire that officers specially ' qualified be selected for this purpose, and that they will give their advice in writing in all cases, limiting it to declarations that in their opinion goods of certain descriptions - specifyin g them-ar e dutiable under specified Tariff items ab specified rates. They will not initial any invoice until entry is duly made. The result of this will be to secure to the public the best and most direct advice. Trouble has arisen in some cases, owing to the advice given, and it would be a great mistake to continue to allow every officer to give his opinion.",15
5,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,Surely every officer who is competent to receive an entry should be able to advise the public?,15
6,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"I think we have adopted the best course in placing our most competent officers at the disposal of the public, so that they may receive advice of a character that will admit of no doubt.",15
7,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask whether the answer given by the Minister for Trade and Customs to the question put by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Y . L . Solomon, does not indicate that the complaints which have been made are justified ? I have received similar complaints from Sydney, and I understood the Minister to say that correspondence has to be entered upon to obtain the advice mentioned.",15
8,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"Oh , no !",15
9,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"According to the Minister's statement the reply must be in writing, and doubtless it would have to be asked for in writing.",15
10,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Certainl y not.,15
11,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"Is the Minister aware that the system of obtaining from the party who has to check the customs duties, prior to entering them up, the rate which is chargeable upon a particular item is now being departed from, and that the party making the entries has to risk falling into error, with all its attendant consequences ? Will the right honourable gentleman inquire into the matter and see how his instructions are being carried out, so that any officer who has to check an entry-prio r to its presentation-ma y say what he will pass as the correct duty upon any particular article ?",15
12,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"There is no intention to require anything in the shape of correspondence, but for the security of the public and to prevent the department being misrepresented, instructions have been issued that the decision must be given in writing. The idea is that the public, when approaching the skilled officer whom we shall select, may mention a certain item, and ask the rate at which it is dutiable, and that the officer shall give his reply. The last portion of the minute which I read just now distinctly sets out that he is not to overhaul the invoice till the entry has been made. Some time ago, instead of being required to answer a simple question as to the duty chargeable upon a specific article, there was practically an invitation to Customs officers, by perusal of the invoice, to assume the responsibility of themselves deciding, the rate of duty upon goods, variously described, which they had not seen. The proper course is for the importer to make the entry. Afterwards the checking, as regards the accuracy of the invoice, is undertaken by the examining officer.",15
13,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"The same officer who has not seen"" the goods 1",16
14,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"If necessary he examines the goods. ""We are willing to undertake the responsibility of telling the importer what is the duty upon any particular item, but it is his duty to inform us of the nature of the goods which are contained in the invoice. When he does so he will get our decision. But we will not declare that in any particular invoice - there are goods of a particular description.",16
15,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"Will the Minister intimate to the public the. officer to whom they have to apply for such information 1 It is perfectly certain that if written answers are to be given, an officer must be appointed for that purpose.",16
16,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"It is of no use appointing.a special officer unless his services are made available to the public. We do not contemplate making a special appointment, but a special selection will be made from our most skilled officers, for the purpose of giving the public the advice indicated.",16
17,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister representing, the Prime^ Minister whether he has received any communication from the Western Australian Government in reference to the operation of the latter portion of section 95 of the Constitution, and whether the Government have given any further consideration to the recent decision of theCustoms authorities in connection with that matter ?",16
18,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I received a letter upon the subject from the Premier ofWestern Australia last Monday. That communication was at oncereferred to my honourable colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, who returned it to me this morning. A reply is now being drafted for signature.

20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLICWOR KS IN SOUTH,I wish to ask the Minister for Home Affairs if he can yet say when the experts who are to report upon the federal capital sites will be appointed 1,16
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLICWOR KS IN SOUTH,"It is quite impossible to fix a date. At the present time there are a great many important matters occupying m y attention, but I can assure 1 the honourable member that the subject to which he has referred will be dealt with - without any unnecessary delay. BORDER RAILWAY RATES.",16
22,Mr GLYNN,PUBLICWOR KS IN SOUTH,"Some time ago, after re-, ferring to the war of railway rates on the borders, particularly of Victoria, and South Australia, I asked whether the Minister for Home Affairs would request the Premiers of the various States to interfere, with the-view of securing an agreement between the Railways Commissioners, in order to overcome the difficulty. The honourable gentleman promised to do so, and I should like to know whether he has carried that promise into effect; if so, whether any pledge has been given, by'the Railways Commissioners in. reference to the matter 1",16
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PUBLICWOR KS IN SOUTH,"The question to which the honourable and learned member refers was brought forward some time ago. I communicated with the various Ministers for Works in the different States with regard to it, and I received replies which I think I gave to honourable members. Subsequently another question was asked upon the same subject, and I believe that I then wrote to the Department for External Affairs, asking that the States Premiers be communicated with. If the honourable and learned member will submit a question on the next day of sitting, I will give him a positive answer. ABSENCE OF SIR PHILIPFYSH .",16
24,Mr REID,PUBLICWOR KS IN SOUTH,"I should like to know whether in view of the great pressure which has devolved upon certain Ministers, owing to the absence of some of their colleagues in London, they will take into consideration the propriety of making greater use of the services of Sir Philip Fysh?",17
25,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLICWOR KS IN SOUTH,"Perhaps I ought to say, in response to my right honourable friend's humorous question, t'hat the Government' have not hesitated to take advantage of the services so generously given by my colleague, Sir Philip Fysh, upon every possible occasion.

28,Mr DEAKIN,ADDITIONS TO PARLIAMENT,"The paragraph referred to appears to have been based upon an King . entire misconception. In the first place, for no structural alterations whatever havewealth been made in this building. In the second place, no additions have been made, to the tion. Parliamentary buildings for the accommodation of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, who tion.. are accommodated in rooms formerlyoccupied by members and officers of the State Parliament. Partitions have been erected in some of these rooms, in. order to provide accommodation for the typewriters. There could have been no undue expenditure in that, respect, because the total cost of the alterations made since this building.' was taken over by the Commonwealth eighteen months ago amounts to only £336. The paragraph appears to have been, based upon a misunderstanding' of the cost of all the repairs; furniture,- fittings, and other outlays incurred in connection with Parliament House during the past eighteen months.

This is suggested in the interests of economy; but the clause provides that each polling booth shall be provided with "" a ballot-box,"" apparently not contemplating such a contingency as I have mentioned. This is an important point in connection with economy, and I ask the Minister to give it consideration, especially in view of the suggestion by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Poynton, that provision shall be made for the retirement of members of this House at the same time as the retirement of half the members of the Senate. Such a course, if adopted, would mean the saving of thousands of pounds.",18
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I will look into is the matter, but it seems to me that the meaning of the clause is that a ballot-box shall be provided for voters for each House. In order, however, that there may be confusion or doubt, I shall, if have words inserted to meet the view of the honourable member.",18

In the South Australian A ct it is prescribed that the scrutiny must commence without delay ; but it is obvious that the presiding officer turning cannot proceed with the counting of the votes for both Houses at one and the same time, and some special provision is required to cover the case. In South Australia they get over the difficulty by first counting absentee votes for both Houses, which alphabetically occupies only half-an-hour or three-quarters of an hour, and thus the Act is complied with.",19
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Clause 156 provides that the scrutiny shall commence ""as soon as practicable"" after the closing the poll, and I should say that it was not "" practicable"" to count the votes for both Houses at one and the same time, so that do not think any trouble may be anticipated.

Surely it is not intended that may appoint scrutineers for each of these compartments.",20
62,Mr REID,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The "" compartment"" referred to in clause 130 would be a very different thing from the compartment to which the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs refers.",20

67,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"If the word ""compartment"" is used, it may happen the that in a place like the Town-hall, Adelaide, a candidate ma,y be able to appoint only one scrutineer, while in other places he may be able to appoint a scrutineer for each but I of a series of tents or booths. Mr Reid,--Probably the word ""subdivision "" would do. In - Sydney the prac"" tice has been to subdivide a large hall when t has to be used as a voting place. Mr V.L.SOLOMON - That would over the candidate. come my objection.",20
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The New South or Wales practice has been to have in the country one polling booth, one place to vote in, and one ballot-box; and in the cities, where the voting is likely to be large, to have a number of ballot boxes, a number of poll clerks, and a number of compartments. The honourable and learned member for Darling wishes to allow candidates to appoint from a scrutineer - for each compartment. It is impossible for one scrutineer to scrutinize the electors who present themselves in a candidates dozen compartments.",20
69,Mr BATCHEL OR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"South Australia) It seems to me that the-proposal of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, if carried into effect, will not interfere with the - South Australian system, where there - has been only one room, and therefore only one scrutineer allowed. The clause is almost a literal copy of the South In-South' AusAustralian provision.",20
70,Mr GLYNX,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,I think that the returning officer in South Australia can allow more polling than one scrutineer.,20
71,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,Not more than one scrutineer for each candidate can be present in a booth at any one time.,20

73,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The ballot-papers is may be issued by several poll clerks, but box. they must all be signed by the returning officer. It is usual for candidates to appoint - two scrutineers, who may relieve each but who cannot both be present in the booth at the one time. There is no need . and for more than one scrutineer, because be directly an elector asks for a ballot paper his name and number on the elecroll are called out loudly by the andpoll - clerk who gives it to him, and the scrutineers then tick them off on their rolls. I have never heard candidates in South tralia suggest that they should be allowed to appoint more than one scrutineer.",20
74,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I hope that the Minister who carries out provisions of the measure will see that rangements similar to those which have been usual in New South Wales, and which have worked splendidly there, are adopted. Canperly didates will then be allowed to appoint scrutineer wherever a presiding officer charge. If half-a-dozen scrutineers' were allowed, candidates might be put to considerable expense.",21
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,That is their look out.,21
76,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,I think that we are bound to consider them in the matter.,21
77,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I not think that the clause will be improved by substituting the word "" compartment"" for the word "" place."" I remember a in which the point raised was whether "" apartment"" is the same thing as a "" partment.""",21
78,Mr BEID,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,Elector s do not. go into the compartments to poll their votes. The of voting is the placing of the ballot-paper in the ballot-box.,21
79,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I am afraid that if the word ""compartment"" is adopted, candiorable dates may be able to appoint as many as haps a dozen scrutineers at some places. South Australia, at the last election, public ' hall was divided into a polling booth for the Legislative Council and another for the Legislative Assembly, the clause would enable a candidate a case to appoint two scrutineers to represent him in the one room. Mr L . E. GBOOM (Darling Downs) Scrutineers are appointed so that they may, with the assistance of the electoral check the voting, and challenge any elector whom they think should not be allowed to record his vote. But under the clause as it stands, if there were one polling place six polling booths, only one scrutineer could be appointed by each candidate, he would be unable to check the the six booths. It would, therefore, be advisable to .adopt the Queensland system, and tention. allow one scrutineer for each polling booth. . Mr BAMFORD - If every Federal candithat date had a scrutineer the whole booth be filled up. Mr L . E. GBOOM - The political Ausorganizations will generally appoint one scrutineer to act for all the candidates representing their party when both senators and members of the House of Representathe tives are being elected on the same day. arExcept in certain cases, I do not consider it necessary to appoint scrutineers, but if the object is to allow scrutineers to properform their functions, opportunities a should be given to candidates to appoint is in them for each booth in a polling place. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) agreed toTliat the word "" written"" be omitted, and that after the word ""officer,"" line 6. the words, ""signed by the candidate"" be inserted.",21
80,Mr GLYNN,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I hope the Minister will reconsider the question of do substituting the word ""booth"" for the term ""compartment."" In clause 130 it is provided that the polling booth shall be case divided into several compartments conan structed so as to screen the voters from comobservation, and there may be a dozen of these compartments in one booth.",21
81,Mr REID,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"There could not be a dozen act polling compartments in one booth ; the meaning of the word "" compartment "" must be governed by the context.",21

84,Mr TUDO R,VICTORIANPERMANE NT, This clause probut vides that no candidate shall in any way take part in the conduct of an election. Is and it intended to prohibit the candidate from voting in even exercising his vote ?,21
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,That is not the in,21
86,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I suggest candidates, as well as the poll clerks, would doorkeepers, and scrutineers mentioned in the clause, should be permitted to enter the polling booths. There are times when it is absolutely necessary that the candidate should be present in order to prevent irregularities. Even when the candidate has a scrutineer safeguarding his interests that officer sometimes desires to refer to his principal.",21
87,Mr BATCHEL OR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"South Australia) It would be a great mistake to permit candidates to remain inside the polling booth. I remember one case in which the partners of a candidate stood outside the door of the booth and tried to influence electors. That was considered as something approaching a scandal, but if a candidate were permitted to exercise his influence upon voters in the booth, the position would be much worse.",22
88,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,Candidate s should not be permitted to remain in the neighbourhood of the booth.,22
89,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"There might be some advantage in permitting a scrutineer to consult a candidate, but as this would be done only in very few cases there is no great object to be gained by permitting the candidate to ' enter the booth. scrutineer can always come out of the booth and consult the members of his committee. Clause agreed to. Clause .13!)-The polling shall be conducted as follows :(i.) Before any vote is taken the presiding officer shall exhibit the ballot-box empty, aud shall then securely fasten and seal its inner cover so that nothing can be removed without breaking the seal: (II.) The poll shall open at eight o'clock in the morning, and shall uot close until all electors present in the polling booth at seven o'clock in the evening, and desiring to vote, have voted : (in.) At the close of the poll the presiding officer Shall publicly seal the outer cover and take charge of the ballot-box, and with the least possible delay forward it for the purpose of scrutiny; and it shall on no account be opened except as' allowed by this Act.",22
90,Mr MCDONALD,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," Subclause II . provides that the polling booth shall close at seven o'clock in the evening, and I desire to see the time extended to eight o'clock. In mining centres the miners change shifts at seven o'clock, and as they cannot always record their votes before they go into the mine in the morning, it is desirable that the time should be extended as I suggest.",22
91,Mr OMALLEY,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," In mining camps the men go on shift at eight o'clock, and if the booths are opened before that time they will have an opportunity of recording their votes before they commence work. I have suffered from the want of some such provision as this. I therefore move That the word ""eight,"" line 0, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""seven.""",22
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I hope the committee will not agree to the amendment. In the summer time seven o'clock might not be too early, but in winter it would scarcely be light at that hour, and, moreover, it would be difficult to have everything in readiness for conducting the poll. The various States have had a long experience with regard to the best hours to fix for polling purposes, and we should be guided by their practice. I find that in New South Wales the polling hours are from eight o'clock to six o'clock; in Victoria from eight o'clock to seven o'clock-in the metropolitan districts ; in Queensland from eight The o'clock to four o'clock-ihes e hours may be extended by proclamation ; in South Australia from eight o'clock to seven o'clock; in Western Australia from nine o'clock to seven o'clock ; and in Tasmania from eight o'clock to six o'clock. We are extending the hours in three of the States, but providing three additional hours in Queensland --excep t where a proclamation is issued extending the time-and an additional hour in Tasmania and New South Wales. Therefore I hope the committee will not agree to the amendment. Amendment negatived.

93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,For the reasons which I have just given as to the practice hitherto followed in the various States I cannot agree to the amendment.,22
94,Mr BATCHEL OR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"South Australia) In South Australia the practice has been to open the polling places from eight o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock in the evening, but all elections have been held ou Saturday. But what I wish to putbefore the committee is that in South Australia it has sot been found that the time allowed for voting is too long, although the elections there have always been held upon Saturday, wlien the bulk of the business men and workmen are disengaged. Under bhis Bill, however, the elections may be held upon any day, and as a great many people leave their homes ut seven a.m. and cannot return from work in time to enable them to change their attire and record their votes by seven p.m., I do not think that eight p.m. is too late an hour for polling.",22
95,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,What about the hours worked by the returning officers and poll clerks?,23
96,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The returning officer has to keep the booth open from eight a.m. till the hour fixed for closing the poll. He then has a hurried meal and begins to count the ballot-papers. At midnight he ceases counting. We have adopted extraordinary provisions to enable those who may be incapacitated to vote, but I hold that the closingof the polling booths at seven p.m. will disfranchise more electors than would be prevented from voting on account of serious illness and infirmity. Some men do not cease work until six or seven p.m. Take the case of hawkers.",23
97,Mr MADGKR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,They can vote at any time.,23
98,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The honourable member is assuming that they are engaged in. hawking in the vicinity of the polling booth, when, as a matter of fact, they may be several miles away. I trust the Minister will agree to extend the hours of polling eight p.m.",23
99,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I cannot agree with the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor.

100,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I think that the Minister will recognise the wisdom of omitting this clause. In the absence) of a voter's certificate, there is nothing to be gained by inserting a clause which compels a man to vote at the polling booth for which he is enrolled. .

102,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I quite understand what is aimed at. The desire is to obtain a distinct statement from the elector which will enable him to be identified as the person claiming, to. vote. At the same the phraseology employed seems peculiar.",23

The. point raised by the leader of. the Opposition last night was that a man. might move to another division and. the fact be looked that his name remained, on the register, there being no means-of reaching him in order to ascertain whether he had the same qualification. The suggested clause is concise, and will meet the point raised by the leader of the Opposition - 1  Under the South Australian Act a voter is asked-""Are you of. the full age of. 21 ? "" It may occur to the scrutineer that the voter is under age,, and power should be given to ask the question.",24

110,Mr KENNEDY,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I think there is some need ' for.the insertion of these words, inasmuch as a peculiar anomaly nowexists in Victoria, and, possibly, in some of the other States, owing to the fact that, while the State electoral law says that only permember' sons-who are 21 years-of age shall'be titled to vote, our land lawspermit persons to select land when eighteen years' of age, and their liames-often-get upon'municipal and parliamentary rolls-as-those of registered holders of land.

111,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I ' move That the following words be added- "" (V.) Do you now live within the division'for which you enrolled ?"" I desire the insertion of those words,-, because the question as to qualification vague one. An organized attempt might made to poll men i u a division from which they have removed; but if such asked directly if they still live within the division they will be less apt to give false answers than if a vaguer question them. Furthermore,- a man may believe that, although he has ceasedto reside within the division, he isstill qualified vote in it, and he might thereforeunshould' wittingly give a wrong answer if asked"" Are you still qualified to vote in this sion 1"" and' thus, render himself liable serious penalties, although he had no intent.

121,The CHAIRMAN,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The clause cannot be postponed, because it has been amended.",26
122,Mr TUDOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Then I hope that it will be recommitted. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney will have the effect of disfranchising a number of electors in the metropolitan constituencies, because changes of residence are frequent. Some provision should be made so that an elector may not be disqualified from recording his vote in one electorate during Jbhe period which must elapse before he can qualify to vote in another.",26
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,That provided for.,26
124,Mr HENRY WILLIS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Robertson) The course the Minister proposes to take ' will 'render it necessary that the returning officer shall be tolerably familiar with the provisions of the .Bill. My experience is that returning officers are not very well acquainted with the law relating to elections, and that very often when they ask - questions they do not. realise the true signifi-cance of the answers given, and find themselves in a dilemma. The question as to residence should be put in a definite form, in order to indicate the period of absence which would disqualify the elector. Then there could be no doubt in the mind of the returning officer as to whether the - elector was entitled to vote.",26
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,I will see that that matter is attended to. Amendment agreed to.,26
126,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT, I understand that the Minister is willing to allow sub-clause (4) to follow .the sub-clause just inserted.,26

129,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,The clause provides that the returning officer may put all or any of these questions. Supposing that the question to which the honourable member has referred were the only question put to the elector 1,26
130,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,The good sense of the returning officer would scarcely permit him to put the question in that form.,26
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I think we might allow the matter to stand as it is, in view of the point raised by the honourable aud learned member for Indi.",26
132,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,I am satisfied if other honourable members are content.,26
133,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I quite appreciate the desire of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Solomon, but I would point out that the insertion of the word ""otherwise"" might render the question ridiculous. In the first place, we should have to alter the provision that the returning* officer may put all or any of these questions. Supposing, for instance, he put the first question-"" Are you the person whose name appears on the roll for this division ? "" is specially and the elector replied-""Yes."" It would be absurd to then ask, "" Are you otherwise disqualified from voting 1"" Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 143 agreed to. Clause 144The voter's answer to the questions shall be conclusive, and the matter shall not be further inquired into during the polling.",26
134,Mr LE GROOM,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Darling Downs) Are we to understand that it is intended that the decision of the returning officer shall be conclusive, and that no question can be raised at the court of disputed returns ? There does not seem to be any provision in the Bill for afterwards dealing with any vote which may be willed in question. Supposing a returning officer were to improperly allow an elector to record his vote; what provision is there for dealing with the matter at a later stage? In Queensland, at the last election, the question of residence was raised, and a number of votes were challenged on the ground that the electors were not qualified at the time their votes were recorded. These cases could be brought before the elections tribunal, as. the votes were identifiable by the numbers placed on the ballot-papers. There is no such provision in this Bill, and apparently the question whether a person is entitled to vote rests entirely upon the decision of the returning officer. I admit-that in Queensland great objection is raised to the numbering of the ballot-papers, on the ground that the practice destroys to some extent the secrecy of the ballot. We might, however, make some provision for placing the votes questioned in a separate box, in order to permit of an investigation before the court of disputed returns.",26
135,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I think the ballot-papers should be numbered, because otherwise it will be difficult, if not impossible, in cases of impersonation to trace the votes given by those who violate the law. In some cases it is absolutely necessary for the purpose of inquiry to ascertain in which way the impersonator casts his vote, and it would be unfortunate if we adopted a system which would not permit of the votes being traced.",27
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"That would destroy the secrecy of the ballot. Mr - CROUCH - It need not do so, because the ballot-papers would not be seen by any persons other than the members of the court appointed to deal with them. As matters stand, there will be ample room for fraud.",27
137,Mr MAUGER,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I hope that the idea of numbering the ballot papers will not be entertained. That practice is followed in Victoria, aud, rightly or wrongly, there is an impression that, by means of thenumbers, the way in which nparticular vote is cast can be ascertained. We should not perpetuate any system which encourages that idea. Clause agreed to. Clause 145No omission of any Christian name, or entry of u wrong Christian name, and no mistake in the spelling of any surmome, shall warrant the rejection at any polling of any claim to vote if the voter is sufficiently identified in the opinion of the presiding officer, and no female elector shall be disqualified from voting under the name appearing on the roll because her surname has been changed by marriage.",27
138,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," It is provided that the omission of a Christian name, or a mistake in spelling a surname shall not warrant the rejection of a claim to vote. I think that we might also add that a mistake in an address, or in the description of a man's occupation, shall not invalidate his claim to vote. It very often happens that an address is wrongly given, or that an occupation is wrongly described.",27
139,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,We shall have to be very careful how we extend the provision.,27
140,Mr AVATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"As the presiding officer has to be satisfied that the voter is sufficiently identified, an elector should not be debarred from exercising the franchise by any mistake in his name or description.",27
141,Mr LE GROOM,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Darling Downs) I think that the suggestion of the honourable member for Bland is a very good one. We must - not forget that the details which are inserted in the rolls are supplied in the first instance, not by the applicant, but by the officers who are sent round to collect the information. It will thus be seen that it would be easy for an elector to be misdescribed.",27
142,Mr REID,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," ! think that this difficulty and a number of others would be overcome by the insertion of some genera] words, because we must not forget that the. presiding officer has upon all occasions to be satisfied that the voter is sufficiently identified. It would be extremely hard if, owing to some omission or error, an applicant were refused a vote, even though the presiding officer had thoroughly satisfied himself as to his identity. The insertion of some general words would, I think, cover every possible trivial error that could arise, because we always have the safeguard that the voter must be sufficiently identified in the opinion of the presiding officer.",27
143,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The only doubt < which presents itself to my mind is whether the adoption of the suggestion which has been made would not confer practically unlimited powers upon presiding officers. All the States Electoral Acts contain a somewhat similar provision to that under discussion. Before agreeing to the suggestion, I should like time to consider it in all its bearingSj in order to guard against possible abuses. If , upon consideration, I see that under its operation no difficulty is likely to arise, I shall be quite willing to adopt it. Therefore, I moveTliat the clause be postponed.",27
144,Mr BAMFORD,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I should like to know if the provision relating to the spelling of names is to have a general application. Paragraph (b) of clause 113 also contains a reference to the writing of the candidate's name by electors. If it be possible for a man to '\yrite his own name incorrectly, I am sure that the risk of error is greatly increased when he is called upon to write some one else's name. Only recently, in a North Queensland newspaper, I saw the Prime Minister referred to as Sir Edward Barton. Therefore I desire to know if the provision in reference to the spelling of names is to be general in its application *?",27
145,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The object of this clause is to prevent any elector being deprived of a vote through the commission of an error.

At any rate I ask - the Minister to .take a note of the point which I have raised, and to look into it very carefully. We certainly require a record to be kept by a properly authorized .orfioer of the whole of the voters to - whom ballot-slips are issued. If the Minister will agree to deal with this matter, I shall not press the amendment.",28
148,Mr ISAACS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I think there is a good deal in what has been said by the (honourable member for: South Australia, Mr . V.L.iSolomon.

To allow an elector to himself place the voting paper in the ballot-box seems a departure from the custom which prevails in some other places. In South Australia the paper is handed to the returning officer, who then has a means of seeing whether there is only a single paper, and of detecting any fraud, and the system has worked very well. The amendment also has the advantage of allowing the presiding officer to .exercise better control in the case of double elections which, in the futherance of economy, we hope may toe adopted for the Commonwealth Legislature. In South Australia cases have occurred in Which the ballot papers for the Legislative Assembly have found their way into the box.'for the Legislative Council, and vice versa, and it is desirable that such occurrences should be prevented. In my opinion there is an element of danger in allowing the electors to themselves place the ballot-papers in the ballot-boxes. Mr L . E. GBOOM (Darling Downs) I hope the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V . L . Solomon, will not proceed with ""the amendment, wdrich would prove most dangerous, especially in remote districts. The honourable member for Bland mu. 14595 has drawn attention to possible danger arising from voting before an official, but even in that Gase good care is taken that the ballokpaper is folded in such a way - that impossible to see the contents. In many places, especially in remote electorates, the'returning officer w i ll practically have control'of'the "".voting. In Queensland, - ballot-papers of such a 'texture have been used that toy looking at them closely one could see how they were marked, and there are various other ways in which the returning officer could detect how .an elector had vdted. There have been .returning officers who have abused their privileges. In one case, where there were only fifteen electors, 60 votes were recorded ; but the recurrence of that fraud was prevented by compelling returning officers'to initial each ballot-paper.",29

Clause, as amended, agreed to Clause 149, If any voter satisfies the presiding officer that his sight is so impaired or that he is so illiterate that he is unable to vote without assistance, the presiding officer shall-mark, fold, and deposit his ballot-paper for him, or, if required by the voter, shall permit any peison indicated by the voter to accompany him into the voting compartment, aud to mark, fold, and deposit his ballot-paper for him.",29

I think that the latter part of the clause, which provides that any blind or illiterate person may be accompanied to the polling booth by someone else, gives large possibilities for influence, compared with which those given by the postal voting provisions are insignificant. There is nothing to prevent persons from pretending to be illiterate, and I know that in one case 50 electors voted as illiterates at one polling booth, so that it should be known if any one went wrong.",30
158,Mr KINGSTON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,In South Australia only blind persons are allowed to have assistance in the booth.,30

Why should we load up the Bill with provisions intended to meet only fanciful difficulties, which as a matter of practical experience have been found not to exist'? This cumbrous provision may result in the elector having endorsed upon his voting-paper something contrary to his wish, and I see no object in allowing two or three men to accompany the voter, when he can do everything that is required by himself.",30

Unhappily, however, owing to the sparse settlement in many parts of the Commonwealth, schoolmasters cannot reach the whole of our people, and many children are now growing up as illiterates. This state of affairs will continue until the country is much, more thickty populated. There is no reason why we should add to the disabilities under which an illiterate ballotman labours by preventing him from exercising the right to vote which he may have earned by his good character and conduct.",30

My constituency is one in which there are a great number of people who have grown .up in ignorance because they were not within reach of a 'school. Many children are being brought up in the bush without any chance of going to school, or even of seeing a township. Some of the people in Western Queensland never saw a railway train until a few years ago, and to this day there are many who have not seen the sea. Surely people so situated should not be disfranchised because, owing to circumstances beyond their control, they cannot read and write.

On one occasion, when I was acting as scrutineer, an illiterate elector came in, and told the returning officer he desired to vote for a certain candidate. The returning officer thereupon struck out the wrong name, and proceeded to place the voting-paper in the ballot-box ; but I interfered, and demanded that the paper should be altered, and thus secured a vote for the candidate in whose interests I was working. On another occasion upon - which I was acting as scrutineer the returning officer gave an illiterate voter a paper, and told him to strike out the name at the bottom of the list. The desire of the elector being to support the candidate against whom I was working, I wished to secure the man's vote. I entered into conversawith him, and succeeded in turning the paper upside down. The elector then took the paper into the voting compartment, and struck out the words ""ballot paper,"" and the name of the candidate first on the list.",31

On another occasion, a man who was nearly blind would not permit the returning officer to mark the paper for him.

There will always be illiterate persons in every electorate, and I hope that the Minister will consent to insert some such provision as that suggested.",31
178,Mr GB EDWARDS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"South Sydney) The provision intended to permit any person indicated by the voter to iiccompany him to the voting compartment for the purpose of marking his ballot-paper is fraught with very great danger. If we were to leave it entirely to the returning officer, there might also be some danger, but the marking of the paper might be left to the presiding officer and two scrutineers. The marking of the voting-paper should not be left to any person indicated by the voter, because that would open the door to fraud. No doubt many electors are illiterate through no fault of their own, and there is no reason, or justice, or policy in denying them the right to exercise the franchise. We oughb, however, to provide such safeguards as will insure the carrying out of the intention of the voter without opening the door to fraud, and that can be done only by leaving it entirely to the returning officer, ""or to the tjjat returning officer and one or two of the scrutineers.",31

But "" half a loaf is 'better than no of bread,"" and to do away wibh plumping is, at any rate, one step nearer to the condition of affairs which those who advocate proportional representation are seeking to bring about. If we allow plumping it will mean plumping all round. Every section of the community-religious , political, and social-wil l plump for a particular candidate or candidates, and in that way we shall not get the expressed will of the people. The result will be those accidents of party warfare which are to be deprecated; and the only way to avoid them is to oblige the voters to vote for the total number of candidates to be elected. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has pointed out the difficulties under which electors will labour in having to vote for men in whose political views they have no confidence. remedy is' in the hands of the electors, who ought to see that candidates are nominated for whom they can vote. Unless the full number of members required are voted for, we shall, as I have said, get only sectional voting. The labour party will naturally vote for a 'certain restricted number, and the same with the free-trade and protectionist parties. And these parties will be split up on religious, temperance, or other questions. The only way in which we can provide against Such a disastrous state of affairs is to adopt the clause in the Bill. On the other point, I shall always claim that both 'Houses are equally free to deal with the machinery devised for carrying out the provisions of the Constitution.",33
192,Mr SKENE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," The Minister has lost sight of the fact that this is a different Bill from that introduced to the Senate, in which the Government proposed proportional representation. That system would have had the advantage that in both Houses the basis of representation would have been community of interests; nothing has been substituted for proportional representation, and, in my opinion, we have a perfect right to deal with the measure from any point of view.",34
193,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,I did not say we had no right to do so.,34
194,Mr SKENE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I know that die Minister put the question rather as a matter of propriety or courtesy. I presume the Government had good reasons for proposing the system of proportional representation, and, seeing that the Senate rejected that proposal,'! think that this House ought to have ' an opportunity of discussing the question and adopting such modifications as it may think fit. I will not strain the point raised by clause 24, although no doubt we have a precedent in the fact that the Senate made some proposals interfering in matters more particularly concerning the House of Representatives.",34
195,Mr BROWN,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," There is something for consideration in the view of the honourable member for the Grampians, that we are now asked to view this measure, not as it was originally formulated by the Government, but as it emerged after having been considered by the Senate. I question the stand taken by the Minister-that it is not advisable for this Chamber to express an opinion on this particular clause. It is the But the duty of . the House of Representatives, as well as that of the Senate, to voice within the walls of Parliament the public opinion which prevails outside. The fact that this clause happens to' relate particularly to the Senate is no reason why the desires of a large section of the people should not be expressed within this Chamber. A big principle underlies the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs. That proposal simply asserts the right of every voter to judge for himself as to how many or how few of those nominated shall receive his support, and we should be careful in limiting that right. At the senatorial elections in New South Wales there were what were known, as "" bunches"" run. There were "" bunches"" of six representing respectively the two big parties of free-traders and protectionists : there was a "" bunch "" in the labour interest, consisting of two nominees, and one in the socialist interest, while several nominees ran ""on their own."" There were something like 50 candidates nominated for the six vacancies, and the result of the election showed that a large number of the electors preferred one or two members short of the number required by law. The result was that these voters, in what I consider a legitimate and reasonable exercise of their right of choice, were disfranchised. This is sufficient evidence of a very strong feeling amongst the electors that they should not be compelled to vote for men of whom they do not approve. The honourable member for South Sydney says that the electors should see that such nominations are made as will permit them to exercise their votes ; but it is more in accordance with natural rights to give a choice of those who are nominated. I shall support the amendment, which I regard as fair and just.",34
196,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I do not think that we need have any doubt as to the propriety of this Chamber dealing with this clause. No restrictions are imposed upon us in this connection, and we have a perfect right to deal with this matter, just as the other Chamber has a right to express views as to the basis of the elections for the House of Representatives. .But I am absolutely against the proposal to allow plumping. If it is desired, under our system of Government, that sections should be represented, we have adaptations of the Hare-Spence system, and there is also the method of single-member constituencies. But I am absolutely against introducing into .this measure any proposal which would result in the state of affairs seen in threemember constituencies in New South Wales when plumping was allowed.",35
197,Sir WILLIAMLVNK,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,That will be the tesult of the amendment.,35
198,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I am satisfied that by such means we shall not obtain the representation of the will of the people. Sharp electioneering agents frequently managed under that system that men should be elected who would have had no chance of success had they contested the seat against some of the candidates who were .rejected. That is not a representation of the people. Under that system, while a proportion of the electors would give their votes for the full number of candidates to be elected, less scrupulous persons might be influenced by organizations to give all their votes to the one candidate, who would receive also the votes cast for him by electors who voted for the full number, and selected him as one of them. In that way a candidate might slip into the position of a representative without really representing the views of the majority. The objections to the system were made manifest in New South Wales at election after election, and it is not desirable to introduce it here in connection with Commonwealth elections. If it is considered desirable by the majority of the committee that we should have proportional representation, let us adopt that system ;. but if a simpler system than that is desired, but one which will give approximately similar results, let the senators for each State be returned individually by separate constituencies.",35
199,Mr SKUNK,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,Not with a preferential vote.,35
200,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"In my opinion, the preferential - voting system is unsuitable where there are single constituencies, bub, by having single constituencies, you can obtain roughly what is aimed at. The system of plumping is one which may be worked to the advantage of the sharp and unscrupulous, against the simple but more honourable and scrupulous. It has not worked in the direction of securing failrepresentation, and I therefore prefer the provisions of the clause. M!r. FOWLER (Perth) - I have no hesitation in recording my vote for an amendment of the clause, because I consider that I was sent here to represent my electors in regard «to the determination of the conditions which shall prevail in the election of senators as well as in regard to other matters. As I understand the meaning of the term ""plumping,"" it is something quite different from what certain honourable members have in their minds. In the old countiy, it is customary at certain elections to give the electors as many votes as there are candidates to be elected, and they can vote for the full number of candidates, or give the whole of their votes to one candidate, or dispose of them in any other way. But the system suggested by the honourable member for Darling Downs is. something quite different. It simply gives each elector the right to exercise his judgment in regard to the various candidates, and allows him to vote for one or more as he thinks right. Although I have heard many objections to this so-called plumping system, I have heard no satisfactory reason why it should not be adopted. There seems to be a good deal of objection to it in the minds of many honourable members and persons outside, because of the possibility it affords of allowing electors to cast all their influence for the return of certain candidates, and it is urged that it is likely to be exercised largely on behalf of labour representation. In my opinion, however, it is more likely to be used against labour representation than in favour of it . Amongst the working classes there are inbre electors prepared to give votes to other than labour candidates than there are electors among the other classes who are prepared to give votes to labour candidates. We are told that the system will prevent the verdict of the people being obtained upon, any definite issue, because electors - will be influenced, by consideranumber tions other than, those, actually placed before them. But. if a man wishesto practicandidatewho cally disfranchise himself, washould let him so. It might happen that an elector, whor called, upon to decide between the free-trade and the protectionist parties-might say-that he was a protectionist, but would, not. port a Catholic. He. might discover that, there were two or three candidates-who-were both Protestants and protectionists; and might then decide to still further l i m selection by saying that he-would, vote only for an ardent teetotaller. In that way, he: might cut down.his:privileges-, and even, franchise himself, and. if he chooses-to so, I do not suppose the countiy will much the worse; Parliament would, not 1 be justified in. compelling, any elector to. vote for candidatesof whom he did not approve. It ' would.'be immoral to. do so. ing away, votes. Instead, of ""getting: nearer to the ferential, system,, when we compel the electors, to vote for the full number of. didates required we are getting, further away from it, by preventing them from, exever, ercising. anyreasonablechoice, since if a man has to vote for six candidates he may have to vote forseveral to whom he hastriumphant, the strongest political and even' personal antipathy. Mr TUDOR, (Yarra) - I , trust, that' the amendment, will be carried; ! have-known, of electionsin Victoria in which the tors should not have been compelled to affords vote for any candidate,, but the B i l requires electorsto vote for the number of candidates to be elected, which is wholly opposed to. the principle of. proportional voting, which. was - originally proposed by the Government. The honourable member, for Flinders has given notice of his intention, to move that, an elector who fails to. vote shall be fined £ 5 for the. first offence, between JE10 and £20 for the second. Perhapshe would make the penalty foi"" the third offence hanging. If that motion carried it would be monstrous to compel an elector; to vote for the full, number of candidates to be elected. No elector-- should compelled to vote for personswhom he taking, does not think should be elected. I been, said that as in Victoria the protecvision tionists are in a majority, the free-traders this State will have no representation i u Senate, but I think that a minority, especithe ally if it is a substantial one, has a representation, if it can secure a sufficient of. votes, to return a candidate. No man should be compelled, to vote, for a would not adequately repredo sent his-views. At the last federal electionswasfour, out of the. six Statesallowed the electors to please themselves as to the number of candidates for whom they voted,, but suprin New. South Wales andi Victoria the blockr-vote system was adopted. It has-been urged that, the electors, are allowed; even he under, this system to practise plumping, it his because they throw away some of their votes upon> candidates-who have no possible chance of. election. This, however,, is not dislikely to be resorted to extensively, bedocause if a deposit, isrequired, there be will not be the number of candidates that there waspreviously, in States where no deposit, was required; and. there-* will not be the same opportunity for throwThe effect of the presystem proposed will betosecure therepresentation of; the political partywhich canmay be in the majority,.however, slight, a.ud to ignore: the rights of. the minority, howlarge.

Forty-nine pen conti of the electors-may. be in.favour of a certain candidate, and yet be eleounable to secure hisreturn. We should the electors every, opportunity of. del ciding, for-, whom theywill vote, and we need not fear; that plumping, will be very largely, resorted to. Some honourable members hold that we haye no right to decide the conditions-under.which the elections for the Senate shall take place, but I contend that we are perfectly, entitled. to amend the Bill in the direction proposed by-the honour and able and learned member for DarlingJDowns.",35

204,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Macquarie) I have listened with a good deal of interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Tasmania. Prom the way in which he has put the case one would think that under this clause, an attempt is being made to prevent electors from exercising the franchise and returning the best candidates. Nothing of the kind. There is absolutely nothing to prevent an elector from nominating any candidate he chooses, either for the Senate or the House ojl Representatives. Air. FOWLER - Why compel the electors to nominate candidates ? Air. SYDNEY SMITH - The law compels that. It provides that the candidate shall be nominated by so many electors. It is within the power of any voter to nominate one or more candidates, as the case may be. If he finds that there is only one candidate in the field whose views harmonize with his own, he has the right to nominate five others, and if their political opinions accord wibh. those held by a majority of the electors, the six candidates will be returned. Air. 'BATCHELOR - How can an tell what candidates will contest acertain constituency ?",37
205,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,I will undertake to say that the honourable member knows perfectly well beforehand what candidates intend contesting his particular electorate.,38
206,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,Because I make it my business to find out.,38
207,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,So do the various political organizations. I know very well that the Free-trade Association does. It is perfectly within the power of any body of men to ascertain what candidates intend going to the poll. The Senate desires that the electors in the various States shall have a fair opportunity of voting for the the six best candidates nominated.,38
208,Mr RONALD,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,Why not for one date? Air. SYDNEY SMITH - Because the Constitution provides that there shall be six candidates returned. I think that every elector should exercise his judgment and support the six candidates who will best represent the views of the people of the Commonwealth.,38
209,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,Suppos e that six good men are not available ?,38
210,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The honourable member credits the States with very little intelligence if he thinks that it is impossible to secure the services of six thoroughly qualified candidates. If any important question is likely to engage the attention of this Parliament, and if there be a sufficient number of electors in favour of one candidate to insure his return, the same body of voters can nominate and return five other candidates holding similar political opinions. What possible harm can accrue to the Commonwealth if the electors are required to choose the six most suitable candidates from their point of view "" If they find that there are not six candidates in accord with their views, there is nothing to prevent them from nominating six who are. I cannot understand the argument of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr. O'AIalley, who declares that under this clause a large number of the electors in each State may be disfranchised. It is evident that those electors must be in a minority, and the principle of democratic Government is that the majority shall rule. I intend to support the clause. elector Air. BATCHEL OR (South Australia). - I am very much surprised to hear honourable members who call themselves democrats advocating a tyrannous proposition under which the will of the people cannot find expression. Air. SYDNEY SMITH - We have proved ourselves more democratic than has the honourable member. Air. BATCHELOR - The honourable member proved himself a democrat just now by seeking to deny representation to those holding a different political faith from that of the majority. I ask the Government to adhere to the Bill as nearly as practicable in the form in which it was originally introduced. At that time it contained provisions for the adoption of proportional representation-provision s which have since been eliminated. I think it is candiincumbent upon the Government in such circumstances to adopt the next best scheme, instead of the other extreme, namely,. that of the block vote. Under a system of proportional representation, the idea is to secure a fair representation of the views held, by the people. The adoption of the system of the block vote will entirely defeat that object, and will ensure not only that the majority shall rule, but that the minority shall be absolutely unrepresented and unheard. Under the block-vote system, if in any one of the States the two opposing political parties were almost equal in numbers, nearly half the community would be entirely unrepresented in the Senate.",38
211,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,-The people have been taxed to the extent of hundreds ofthousands of pounds during the present session upon the casting vote of the Chairman.,39
212,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"What has that to do with the matter under discussion ? We know the fiscal views of most of the States. In Victoria there is believed to be a majority of protectionists, and in New South Wales a majority of free-traders. Is it suggested that in each case only the majority shall be represented independently of their numerical strength? That would be a scandalous position to assume.",39
213,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,The honourable member is speaking against majority rule.,39
214,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Majorit y rule is one thing and representation is another. While the majority must rule in this House, the members returned are able to submit divergent views; this is something more than the mere recording place for the views of the majority. AVe do always receive the proposition from the Chair with our minds fully made up ; there is always the opportunity of conminority verting a minority into a majority. Our recent political history has shown that the free system of voting has returned members of no less ability than those candidates, returned under the block system. In South Australia the people were allowed to vote difficulty. as they liked, and that State has' in the Senate today an absolutely fair representation, of which as a South Australian I proud. On the other hand, three or four years ago, at the time of the elections to the Federal Convention, not a single labour representative was returned, except Mr organizations. Trenwith of Victoria, and he was "" run on a ticket."" I do not say that labour repreWales sentatives would have been superior, or even equal, in mental calibre and statesmanlike ability to the gentlemen who were elected to that Convention, but that fact remains that, owing to the enforcement of the block system, no such representative was returned, notwithstanding that so large a proof portion of the population belongs to the labouring classes. That is an illustration of the absolute tyranny of the majority. Ten members had, in South Australia, to be elected to that Convention, and 11 M amongst the candidates were three representatives of labour, the object being to secure a fair representation. The position was similar in every State except New South Wales. Most of our party voted for the three men and for liberals, bringing the number up to six or seven ; but the same electors had to vote for men whom they did not desire to see at the Convention, dud to whose political views they were utterly opposed. The Adelaide press, and every fair-minded man, recognised this as a most unfortunate result of the block vote. Is the honourable member for Macquarie a party to a movement to prevent any labourrepresentative obtaining a seat ?",39
215,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I represent a larger labour constituency than does the honourable member. Mr BATCHELOR,-Is the honourable member a party, or would he be a party, to a scheme to absolutely annihilate labour representation in the Senate?",39

217,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"In that I am with the honourable member, and the best way to not achieve that object is by a system of proportional representation. Butwe have nob that system, and the only way in which a can obtain justice is by allowing the electors to .vote for men of the same political faith as themselves. The honourable member for Macquarie suggested ""dummy"" or, at any rate, said that enough candidates could be found to meet the",39

233,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The system which then I am opposing will result in nothing but voting mob rule, and will prevent the minority from being represented at all.

It has In my been said that each party can put forward as many candidates as it likes, bu t no party would gain any particular advantage by doing that. Besides, we do not want every little section of the community to put for the full number of candidates, so that may not be compelled to vote for candidates whom it does not want to see elected.

241,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Unde r the blockvote system, if there were a majority of protectionists in each of the three smaller States, the protectionist party could control the Senate, and in that way the political policy of the Commonwealth, even though the large majority of the peopleof Australia were free-traders.",41

243,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I had no voice in the framing of that provision of the Constitution which provides for the equal representation of States. Personally, I think the Commonwealth will ultimately work in the direction of unification, because of the great difficulty in governing small separate communities. I do not think that any real damage can be done where plumping is resorted to, because unless a majority vote for some one candidate he cannot be returned, notwithstanding the plumping. The plumping system gives proportional representation to an extent which is impossible under the biock-vote system. Mr G..B. EDWAKDS - Plumpin g gives an accidental result.",41
244,Mr BATCHELOR,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Yes , but in a haphazard way it secures something which is equivalent to propoitional representation. At the federal elections in South Australia there was practically no plumping, and that practise is not very likely to be largely resorted to in the future. As a rule the electors voted for as many candidates as represented their political views. Ib is not 41 M 2 our business to dicbate to the electors as to the men for whom they shall vote. They have a right to return just such men as they desire to see in the House and no others. Some electors may not know enough of any six of the candidates to justify them in voting for the full number, and I would point out that every vote that an elector gives to a candidate with whose views he does not agree nullifies the support he accords to those whom he desires to see returned. In South Australia four pror tectionists only offered themselves as candidates for election, and it would have been most unfair in that case to compel the electors to support men who were opposed to their way of thinking. The proposition is a preposterous one, and only needs to be fairly stated in order to secure its general condemnation. The Government proposal would to an even greater extent than the single electorate system perpetuate the tyranny of the majoritv.",41
245,Mr HENRY WILLIS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Robertson) The honourable member for South Australia apparently wishes to put back the clock, and revert to the plumping system. Some of the States have been divided into single electorates in order that the majority of the people may be properly represented, but the honourable member is not in favour of proportional representation. The honourable member made a strong point of the fact that if any particular party were to put forward any two or three candidates, and had to vote for six, they would be practically disfranchised ; but in such a case the party would be only reaping the reward of its own neglect. Under the system proposed by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs the labour party would nominate a certain number of candidates, and the free-traders and protectionists would do likewise. The prohibitionists, the supporters of "" Tattersall's,"" the licensed victuallers, and the socialists would also put forward one or more members of their respective parties, and the supporters in each case would plump for their own particular candidates. This would probably result in the return of representatives of a number of small parties. The representation of small parties is not to be desired in the general interest, and if strong parties are to be returned, majority representation must'be provided for. Therefore, I am in favour of the Government proposal. I should prefer to see only two parties. third party is generally impotent in itself, and it is only by alliance with another that it is able to accomplish anything. Generally the result is more harmful than otherwise. I am as democratic is any honourable member, and I have supported every democratic measure that been brought forward. It would be imposmajority sible for the members of the labour party do anything without the co-operation of democrats on this side of the Chamber.",41

That was a sneaking way of ing, I admit; but we had to resort to that subterfuge in order to overcome the effects of the iniquitous system of compelling men to vote for those whom they do not regard as fit to legislate. We have no right to sist upon the electors voting for a given number of men any more than we are titled to compel every man in the community to record his vote. If the block vote insisted upon, the electors will, in many cases, be compelled to support candidates whom they do not approve. the position in which the electors of Victoria were placed at the last fedewhich ral election, and the Bill proposes perpetuate a most unfair system. shall actually be forced to vote for men who, upon moral, intellectual, or political grounds, may be absolutely objectionable the community. I sincerely hope that the Government will hearken to wisdom. There is no need to discuss the question of freewhich trade, democracy, or protection in connection with this clause. The greatest authority democracy at the present time is Lecky, who, although a free-trader, declares democracy is frankly and avowedly protecsquares tionist all the world over. That is a suffithus cient answer to anything that has been said preference. A in that direction. I hope that the Government will see the error of their ways, and not impose upon a large section of the community a condition which is immoral in its end, irrespective of whether or not its as intention is immoral. Sir EDWARD BRADDON has - We have heard a good deal about representation and majority rule, to but I scarcely think that those who talk so the glibly about majority rule grasp the full significance of that term. Does it mean that the whole representation of a country, elecof every interest and of every class, shall the be monopolized by just a bare majority of At the the electors ? Could anything be worse in labour the interests of a State than that it to should be represented by persons who and were hostile to a"" good deal more than half of its people ? Let us assume that in Australia four-tenths of the electors are free-traders, three-tenths protectionists, and that three-tenths are in sympathy with It the labour party. Under the block-vote for system it is almost certain that the great bulk of the representation would be divided amongst the free-traders and pro"" tectionists, whilst the labour party would plumpbe entirely unrepresented. We have seen what proportional representation has done in Belgium. Prior to the adoption of that system, the clericals had it entirely their own way, but since its adoption in the liberals have obtained . a fair share of the representation. Is not that what enwe all want to see 1 Do we not wish the interests of every section of the community is to be voiced in our councils 1 Do we not desire that Parliament shall be a reflex of of the true feelings of the nation ? Surely That is the only way in which that result can be attained is by the adoption of the system was originally contained in this. Bill to - that of proportional representationWe which, even at this late hour, I should like to see the Government make an endeavour to force through. If , however, they decline to to do so, by all means let us amend the clause under discussion so as to make it approach as nearly as possible the result would have been obtained under their . original proposal. I intend to move to on add to the clause the words-""bu t may make the votes preferential by placing that the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ifcc., in' the opposite the candidates' names,"" indicating the order of the electors'",42
247,Mr BROWN,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," To my mind, the principle of majority rule does not enter into the consideration of this tion, which is one of legal tyranny. Under this clause the electors are asked to select those who shall represent them in the Senate. The Constitution requires that six senators shall be returned for each State, and because of that provision the Government propose to compel every elector to record six votes, irrespective of whether or not he can conscientiously approve of six candidates. If there are not six candidates who commend themselves to his conscience aud good judgment, he is either compelled to become a hypocrite by casting his vote in favour of the return of men in whom he does not believe, or to disfranchise himself. I therefore support the amendment.",43
248,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I should not have addressed myself to this matter a second time but for the remarks which have been made by certain honourable members. Those who support the clause in the Bill have been accused of advocating a hypocritical and immoral proposal. I think the.confusion of ideas which prompted such a statement ought easily to have been seen by those honourable members who made that assertion. Do they mean to suggest that it is immoral that the majority should rule? Do they not recognise that two or three votes in this House are sufficient to determine the policy of the country ? If it is absolutely immoral that a small majority should possess that power, why do they support. the institution of which they are members ?",43
249,Mr BHOWN,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,Why should I be compelled to vote for a man in whom I do not believe ?,43
250,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Has the honourable member had no connection with associations which compel men either to vote for a particular individual of whom they may not approve or to abstain from voting? Has he never been connected with any organization which has chosen one particular individual as its representative and which has prevented any other candidate from coming forward in that interest? Has no vote been decided in meetings of different parties by a majority of one? Have not governments been supported in power by a majority so obtained? Whilst an honourable member may have what he thinks good reason to object to this provision, and to favour giving the elector the right to vote for a less number of candidates than there are vacancies ques- to fill, I do not think it becomes him to accuse supporters of the clause of hypocrisy, and of advocating an immoral proposition. I should like to know whether the Government are in earnest in their support of this clause, and therefore I shall watch the division with very keen interest.",43
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,I have supported .the Bill as it came from the Senate.,43
252,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"The Minister supported it upon two grounds; first, because the original proposal has been altered by the Senate to which Chamber this clause applies; and secondly, because he is opposed to plumping. Sir WILLIAM. LYNE - I said that personally I was opposed to plumping.",43
253,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I quite agree that two opinions may very well be entertained on this question. I do not impute motives to those who hold a different opinion from that held by myself, and motives should not have been imputed to those who support the clause as it stands. In a single electorate it may be that 49 per cent, of the people are not represented by the person who is elected. All that is held is that in a number of constituencies that effect is balanced : and that is the reason for the democratic support of single electorates. So with State electorates. It is not true that, if there is a majority of free-trade voters throughout the Commonwealth, every State will be held by free-traders. One State may return all free-traders, and another all protectionists, and the same balancing influence is felt as with single electorates. Of course, there may be an objection to equal representation in the Senate which gives the same effective vote to the smaller State as to the larger State : but that is part of the Constitution. * Mr WATSON (Bland) - I should be the last to impute motives to honourable members because of the attitude they assume. I am much obliged to the honourable member for Robertson for his assurance that ""Codlin is our friend, not Short,"" but I do not know that the remarks of the honourable member have any particular bearing on the subject at issue. Democrats exist in both fiscal camps, and I hope that will continue to the end. As to compelling men in organizations, of whatever political complexion, to vote for particular men to the exclusion of others, the honourable member for North Sydney must, on reflection, see that most of the candidates within an organization, whether it be in a free trade, protection, or labour organization, hold exactly the same set of opinions as those which govern the members. There is, therefore, no sacrifice in their agreeing to sink individual liking of the candidates, and voting for those selected by the majority. That applies to organizations formed for the purpose of carrying out certain sets of political principles, but it does not apply to the case of a number of candidates at a general election. In that case there are a .number of men with whom the electors agree on one point, but with whom they disagree on every other; and there is, therefore, a much wider range for the expression of different opinions than is the case in an organization. The two cases are not parallel, and the argument is hardly fair.",43
254,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,The organization selects the three as well as the one.,44
255,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"It is outside the organization of which we are speaking in this connection. There are two aspects of the matter which have not been referred to. There are four States out of the six whose representatives in the Senate were elected under the plumping system, and the result in the States where the block system prevailed was the absolute obliteration of the country vote. That was the case in both Victoria and New South Wales.",44
256,Mr HENRY WILLIS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,The honourable member does not believe in majority rule.,44
257,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I do; but I do not necessarily disbelieve in minority repre-sentation. I allow the minority to have its voice, but the majority must rule if we are to have any progress.",44
258,Mr HENRY WILLIS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Then why not support the Bill ""}",44
259,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Because even if the majority is to rule, the minority is entitled to have its voice 'heard.",44
260,Mr HENRY WILLIS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"We are considering the representation of the States, not of one State",44
261,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,From my point of view that makes the position all the worse.,44
262,Mr HENRY WILLIS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,In Victoria there was one free-trader out of the six senators returned.,44
263,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I did not know there were any free-traders returned in Victoria, judging from election promises; but I believe since then one or two senators have been moving in a halting fashion in the direction of that policy. I do not share to the fullest extent the fear of some honourable members that if the clause is carried the! labour party will be wiped out in the Senate. That may be the result in some States, but at any rate, the Bill will be the means of enabling the labour party "" to wipe the board "" in Queensland.",44
264,Mr HENRY WILLIS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,The labour party would be represented in that way.,44
265,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"That would be good as a compensation, but it would not be a result which we could hail with any degree of delight. It would be much better to have a reasonable degree of representation in each of the States. Whether the matter particularly concerns this Chamber or the Senate, I do not see why we, as a Parliament, should not have a voice in deciding the question of how the Commonwealth is to be represented. The Constitution allows us full power, and it would be foolish to divest ourselves of that power, and let the senators look after their affairs and we after ours. Each' Chamber should be consulted, and have a voice in the election of Parliament. I trust the committee will see the necessity of giving minorities some degree of representation, and preventing unfair compulsion on electors to either vote for men they do not want, or to run "" dummy"" candidates.",44
266,Mr HENRY WILLIS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Robertson) The honourable member for Bland has proved to the hilt the contention of the Government. All the honourable member's followers were, I think, unanimous in saying that under the clause there would be no representation of 'the minority, but the honourable member for Bland expressed the opinion that the labour party would "" wipe the board "" in Queensland. The honourable member showed that in New South Wales there were returned five free-traders to one protectionist, and in Victoria five protectionist to one free-trader while, according to the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, the representation of the two parties was equal in his State. It would appear, therefore, that the paities are equally represented, and that the proposal of the Government is one which the committee should adopt.",44
267,Mr BROWN,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," The honourable member for North Sydney made some special reference to myself, and seemed to claim that there had been some inconsistency on my part. I fail, however, to see that the analogy which that honourable member drew proves any inconsistency. ""Under the Bill, a man who claims his right of choice is disfranchised: No one can see what a man does in the ballot-box, and the organizations are simply a combination of voters of like political views, who desire the return of candidates in favour of those views. Such organizations are common to all parties, and if a traitor be found in any he is simply "" passed o u t "" of the camp. There is no .analogy between disfranchising a man because he exercises his right of choice, and the action of an organization in removing a man with whose political views it is not in sympathy.",44
268,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"South Australia). - So many arguments have been used on both sides that it is necessary for me to plain the vote which I intend to give on this important question, jl have experienced both modes of voting in contesting elections in South Australia. At the first election for the Federal Convention in South Australia the voting was on the block system. The result was that a large and powerful section of the community*-the labour party - wa s virtually unrepresented. Personally I had no reason for complaint, as I was one of the ten who were chosen. But upon the occasion of the elections for the House of' Representatives and the Senate, when the people of South Australia had the right to vote for the whole number of candidates required, or any smaller number they thought fit, the result was that the Senate was represented in each House by free traders, revenue-tariflistS) labour representatives, aud protectionists. Therefore, I feel that we should trust the good sense of the people in this matter. I have no sympathy with the proposals to provide for contingent voting. So long as the ballot is conducted as it is now, the electors should have the freest opportunity to combine, if they think fit, to obtain increased representation. I shall vote against the clause as it stands, and for the election of both senators and members of the House of Representatives in the manner in - which they were elected by the people of South Australia on the last occasion.",45
269,Mr FOWLER,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I have listened very carefully to the whole debate, and have not heard any one say that the system clause. of block voting is anything more than an expedient. No one has r&ttenipted to refute the argument that to compel an elector to ticket ? vote for candidates whom he does not wish to be elected is immoral. The labour party will be able to play the block vote game as well as any other party can do so. I have not been asking for a concession in the in terests of that party. I have been protesting against the provisions of the clause as immoral and inequitable. But if they are carried into law, it will be found that the labour party, instead of, as in the past in South Australia, putting forward only one or two candidates in a timid, hesitating way, will put forward the full number of candidates required, and in view of the position which we have taken up upon this question, both hereand in the Senate, we shall have everv justification in asking the electors to supex- port them. If the clause is carried as it stands, both sides will have reason to rue the day when they put aside principle for the sake of a mere temporary expedient.",45
270,Mr MCCOLL,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I do not think that the , honourable member for Perth should attempt to threaten the committee by telling us that in future the labour party will put forward the full number of candidates at every election. If at the last election they put forward in South Australia only one or two men in a hesitating fashion, I presume it was because they thought that no more than two had any chance of election. If they had believed that they could carry the election of six candidates, they would have put six men into the field, and in future, whether the clause is passed or not, they will put into the field as many candidates as they think will be elected. In Victoria we have always looked upon proportional representation as .something essentially conservative, and it has always been supported by the conservative press. I have strongly .opposed it, beoause I consider that it makes for the representation of sections instead of majorities, and one of the fundamental principles of democracy is majority representation. This is the first time, indeed, that I have heard the members of the labour party put forward any other principle. We have been told that the adoption of the block vote will bring the machine system into politics; but the only party that has done I that is the party which is opposing the",45

282,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I should like to know what attitude the Government into assume with regard to this clause. I believe there is a very strong feeling against the contingent vote, and I , for one, am opposed to the introduction of any of these fancy systems of voting. As it is probable that at the nexb federal election he the two Houses will go to the country at the same time, the introduction of the contingent voting system would lead to a great 1 deal of confusion. I do not know that the aimed at is of sufficient importance to justify us in unsettling the minds of the electors, and thus, perhaps, disfranchising a very large proportion of them. In certain cases the contingent vote might not attain the object aimed at. On ... 16 rare occasions, in New South Wales, a ... 19 candidate has been returned by the votes of a minority; but this has happened to every party in the State, and it is not at all certain that the results would have been altered by the operation of the contingent vote. As personal considerations enter so largely into the selection of candidatesespecially in single electorates, such as are provided for in connection with the election of representatives to this House-it is very difficult to say which candidate would be returned upon the second ballot. Further than that, in Queensland both parties counsel their supporters not to use the contingent, vote.",46
283,Mr GB EDWARDS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,Ji t might be made mandatory.,47
284,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Ye s ; but that might result in still greater confusion. I am informed that the Queensland Ministry, which introduced the provision for the contingent vote, immediately after it had been passed counselled all their supporters not to use it - The clause might be eliminated altogether or amended by providing that a cross should be placed in a square . opposite the name of the candidate for whom it is desired to vote. This method proved very successful in New South Wales at the Convention election in 1897. Although ten candidates-in o more and no less-ha d to be voted foij, the election resulted in the smallest percentage of informal votes ever recorded. In 1901 the elections for the Senate under the old system of crossing out the names of the candidates for whom the electors did not desire to vote resulted in the largest percentage of informal votes ever recorded-betwee n 30,000 and 40,000.",47
285,Mr THOMSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,That was because so many names had to be struck out.,47
286,Mr WATSON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"That may be so; but the practice of placing a cross against the name of the candidate for whom it is desired to vote is simple and easily understood, and should be adopted in connection with the election of representatives to both Houses of this Parliament. M.'. THOMSON (North Sydney) - If the Government do not intend to press this proposal, I need not waste time in discussing it . I am quite sure that a considerable majority of honourable members are opposed to it, otherwise I could show that it would not accomplish the object aimed ab. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - In theory the contingent vote appears; sound, but the method proposed here is not quite the same as that adopted in Queensland. In that State, after the first vote, the names of all but the first and second candidates are struck out, and the votes are divided between the two remaining. That is in the case of single electorates. The proposal in the Bill is that if there are four or five candidates, only the last one shall be struck out in the first instance, the votes belonging to the rejected candidate being distributed amongst the others. Then the lowest on the next count is struck out, and so on until only one remains. The system is somewhat complicated, and I took the trouble a day or two ago to work it out, with rather astonishing results. I found that it was possible for the candidate who obbained the largest proportion of number three votes to secure an advantage over his opponent who received the largest proportion of number one votes, and consequently my faith was very much shaken in the scheme contained in this Bill. I think that I accurately gauge the feeling of the committee when I say that we ought nob to persist in the proposal for the adoption of the contingent vote. Therefore, I purpose altering the clause under consideration- a course which will necessitate amendments in a number of other clauses. I m o v e That the words ""placing the number .1,"". line 3, be omitted, with a, view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""making u cross,"" and that all the words after the word "" votes,"" line i , be omitted.",47

It seems to me that at every stage, upon the slightest opposition to their proposals being evidenced, they have either welcomed amendments or openly courted defeat. No doubt we shall witness the same sort of conduct in regard to the Tariff suggestions. Ministers had it in their power to make this Bill confer upon the-people true representation at any rate so far as the' Senate was concerned. They have grievously failed to do so, and in the humiliation that ought to follow I leave them. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 153 agreed to.

288,Mr BAMEORD,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I trust that die Minister will extend the period of adjournment provided for in this clause. Seven days is altogether too short. At the last election in Queensland it was a very difficult matter indeed for the presiding officers to reach some of the outlying polling places. Hitherto the elections in that State have taken place in the wet season, and if the clause in its present form adhered to, it will disfranchise a very large number of electors.

299,Mr MCDONA LD,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," This is not a matter for regulation, but one which ought to be definitely settled now. There should be some definite provision in the Bill, as to the course to be followed. If we allow the matter to be provided for by regulation, it may happen that in a number of places where only a few votes are recorded the electors may be influenced. Most of the difficulties which have arisen under our electoral laws, have been due to the fact that matters which should have been definitely provided for have been left to regulations, and have been dealt with differentlv by different returning officers.",49
300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I should be willing to insert a definite provision in the Bill if I knew how to meet the difficulty ; but in the. States this matter has been dealt with by regulation and proclamation, and as that system has worked fairly well, I think we might adopt it in connection with Commonwealth elections. Howevei', if the honourable member can suggest am amendment which will meet the case, without making the measure cumbersome and unwieldy, I shall be glad to accept it .",49
301,Mr VL SOLOMON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"South Australia). - We have had in South Australia some experience of the' cases to which the honourable member for Kennedy refers, and in the northern territory, where, at many of the polling places only a few people come to vote,, the ballot-boxes, except upon the telegraph lines, are sent into the chief polling place, supposing that to be within a fair distance. It is almost impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule in the Bill as to the number of electors who must vote at a polling place to enable the votes to be counted there, but it might be provided that where a polling place is within reach of the central polling place within a reasonable time-sa y seven or fourteen days-the ballot box should be sent there unopened, but that otherwise the assistant returning officer should count the ballot papers on the spot.  insertion of the following provision :But no assistant returning officer shall open any box tit any booth where there are less than .100 electors on the roll.",49

308,Mr BROWN,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," So far as I understand the position, the honourable member for Maranoa, and other Queensland representatives, desire to have the ballotdidate papers counted atsome central polling excess place. The New South Wales practice has been for the presiding officer at each polling place to count the ballot-papers at the clusion of the poll, in the presence of the scrutineers. He then fills in a form stating how the votes have-been cast, and; enclosing it with the ballot-papers, forwards the ""or ballot-box to the returning officer for electorate, by whom the papers are again counted. By this system the people each centre are enabled to quickly ascertain how the voting has gone. It has been obelection jected that at small polling places i allow employers to know how their employees have voted ; but I cannot see any great tion to it . However, the difficulty will met by requiring the ballot-boxes to be sent unopened to the divisional officer. Of dates. course, if they had to be sent to the chief electoral officer it returns considerably, and a large amount of work which is now performed by the counclause try officers would devolve upon the central moveoffice. Clause agreed to. Clauses 164 and 165 amended consequentially, and agreed to. Clauses 166, 167, and 168 negatived. Clause 169 agreed to. Clause 170 (Return of writ).. Mr V. L . SOLOMON (South Australia). - This clause provides for the return the writ by the divisional returning through the Commonwealth electoral officer for the State in which the election is held. There does not seem to be any provision with regard to the person from whom the divisional returning officer isfcoreceive writ, and I should like the Minister to make the polla note of the point.",50
309,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,I shall be glad to do so. Clause agreed to. Clauses 171 and 172 agreed to. Clause 173No electoral expense shall be incurred by a candidate in respect of: any candidaMinister ture- . (a.) In elections.for the Senate in excess of two hundred and fifty pounds : (J) In elections for the House of Representatives in excess of one hundred pounds.,50
310,Mr GB EDWARDS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I foresee some.trouble in connection with this clause. It is provided that no electoral expense shall be incurred by a canfor the House of Representatives in of £ 1 0 0 . Clause 175 provides that ""electoral expense"" shall include all expenses ""incurred by or.on behalf or in the coninterests of any candidate,"" and in order to make this clause consistent it will be necessary to amend it by providing that no expense shall be incurred by a candidate, on his behalf or in his interests,"" in exthe cess of £100. I am decidedly in favour of this clause, although I regard it as a at triumph of hope over experience, because I do not think we shall succeed in reducing expenses to .any great extent. We t may should, however, make our attempt as effective as possible, and the clause in its objecpresent form would not prevent political be organizations from incurring very heavy expenditure in the interest of certain candi",50
311,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,Does not clause 175 would delay the govern this one 1,50
312,Mr GB EDWARDS,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Yes , but this might be made much more clear. I That the w.ords "" or on behalf or in the interest"" bp inserted after the word "" by.""",50
313,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"I should like the honourable member to carefully read clause 175, which was inserted for the special purpose of accomplishing what he now desires. That provision was intended toand I believe does-gover n clauses 173 and of 174, and any other clause in which the officer words "" electoral expense "" occur.",50
314,Mr CROUCH,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I think that the honourable member for South Sydney is quite right in his contention. Unless we adopt the amendment submitted, the clause will the provide that no candidate for this House shall himself incur electoral expenses exceeding £100, but will contain nu limitation as to expenditure incurred !on his behalf or in his interests.",50
315,Sir EDWARDBRADD ON,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"Tasmania). - I think that we should ibest meet the necessities of the occasion hy inserting in this clause the words "" on his behalf, or in his interests,"" and omitting them from clause 175. That will maket the position very much clearer than it .is at the present moment.",51
316,Mr LE GROOM,VICTORIANPERMANE NT," I desire to ask the Minister if this clause is intended to meet two particular cases, namely, expenditure by a candidate and expenditure on behalf of or in the interests of a candidate? Under paragraph (c) of clause 185, if a candidate l o t this House' spent more than £ 1 00 lie would he guilty of an illegal practice, and would be liable to prosecution. Is it also the intention of the Government to provide that if the expenses incurred by electioneering agents'on behalf of a candidate, or in his' interests, in conjunction with those of the candidate himself, exceed the amounts prescribed in this clause, such agents shall be liable to additional penalties 1",51
317,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,That is the intention.,51
318,Mr LE GROOM,VICTORIANPERMANE NT,"[Then it seems to me that there is some reason for keeping the matters quite distinct. At the. some time. I desire to point out that expenditure may be incurred on behalf and in the interests of a candidate without his knowledge, and under such circumstances it would be extremely hard to render him liable to prosecution Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.56 p.m.",51
