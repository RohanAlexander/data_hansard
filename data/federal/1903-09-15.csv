However, this is what he did in the following words:-"" I do not say there ore not good workers on the field, but, afc the same time, there is a large percentage of bad ; and until these are superseded no alteration of oxisting circumstances can accrue. There is no doubt the climate is against the white workerwho is simply a piece of languid animation under tropical sun and beat-and probably be cannot be blamed for being unable to bear the intense heat also in the underground workings, owing to the decomposition of the sulphide matter in the lodes. This portion of Australia could never have heen intended for the European, else the climate would have been more suitable and moderate, wad while the nonsensical idea of keeping the whole continent of Australia for the white man alone is maintained, this portion, which contains vast wealth in mineral andagricultural lands, will continue to a great extent to waste ' its sweetness on the desert air.' Had we the same conditions as apply to mining in South Africa with regard to labour, I venture to aay a great success would soon be made of our undertaking.""  he has expressed represent the "" general feeling of the community.""

EDWABDS - I wish to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs a question, without notice, in reference to the charges which have been made against Mr. MCDowall, the Queensland Electoral Com-' missioner. To make my meaning clear, I desire to read the following letter :1I have the honour to contradict some very g rossly incorrect statements that are reported to ave been made in the Parliamentary debates of the Commonwealth of Australia. On page 3851, Mr Bamford is reported thus"" I wish to tell the HOURO what I have heard upon very good authority, although my authority is not a Minister. Fortunately, there ore other avenues of information open to honourable members, otherwise we might sometimes be kept completely in the dark upon most important matters. I have boon informed upon good authority that on the morning after the original map was published the Premier of Queensland and the Minister for Railways visited Mr MCDowall's office and actually bounced him into withdrawing it and substituting for it the electoral boundaries which he now proposes."" I wish now most solemnly to assure you that there is not the slightest foundation for this statement by Mr Bamford. If he did receive any - such information, it is absolutely false. I think, sir, as I cannot do so myself, that you, as ray Ministerial head, will only be doing me justice . by contradicting this statement in the House of Representatives, so that the contradiction will also appear in ffamard. If you ore not prepared to contradict this wicked statement, at least I hope you will institute an inquiry before a Judge of Supreme or District Court.'to sift matters thoroughly. Evidently some person entirely Dereft of veracity has been promulgating these gross falsehoods, for 1 .am sorry to notice on page 3849 you, air, are reported to have said",12

NA ALLOWANCES.",13
6,Mr MAHON,PUBLIC SERVICE RELIEVING,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that inordinate delays occur in paying their allowances to officers performingrelieving duties, especially in Western Australia? 2. Will he inquire whether it is a fact that three relieving ofBcers on the eastern gold-fields of Western Australia have recently had unliquidated claims for £40, £25, and £lo"" respectively ? 3. If such is found to be the case, will he reprimand the official responsible for delaying thege> payments, and direct that cla'ms be more promptly met in future? 4. Has his attention been called to the practice .of a gold-fields inspector of sending married men long distances on protracted relieving duty, although unmarried officers, fully competent for the work, are available at more adjacent branches.",13
7,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PUBLIC SERVICE RELIEVING,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:-1. It is reported that only one or two such coses have been known, und in those instances redundant officers were sent on relieving 'duty, and their claims for allowances were submitted to the Public Service Commissioner. In somo ensea minor delays have been oaused by officers making claims under wrong Public Service regulations, and some time boa been occupied in adjusting them. 2. The responsible officer in Perth has no knowI do not ledge of such claims or of liabilities for such, amounts unliquidated. 3. If any case of neglect, such as alleged, i» substantiated, the responsible officer will be suitably dealt with, and action will be taken to insure more prompt payment. 4. It has been reported that it is not the practice on the gold-fields for the inspector to send married men on long distances on protracted rclioving duty. Not even one such case is known, and the rule is to relieve from the nearest station possible. NA LEGISLATION.",13

Does the fixed policy of Ministers include, appropriate legislation for early next session extending the provisions of the Arbitration Bill introduced by the Government, and relating to certain British shipping, to all shipping, to whatever country belonging and whether oversea or otherwise, trading in Australia, further than for carrying mails and also, q u i r y for landing and discharging ID Australia passengers or cargo from aoroad and for shipping in Australia passengers or cargo for abroad ? 2.

10,Mr KIRWAN,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"the Postmaster General, upon noticeIn view of the following facts :- (a) The new South Australian telegraph line (Adelaide to Eucla) is reported to be working good qnadruplex daily ; (6) The Eucla-Coolgardie line works good quadruplex daily; (c) Tliere is a wire from Perth to Coolgardie which is used to connect with the Coolgardie-Euela quadruplex, and is worked to advantage daily as a direct Perth to Eucla circuit ; (d) In a recent issue of the Telegraph Age, a paper printed for and circulating almost exclusively amongst American telegraph operators, the following appears :- "" New York to San Francisco is 3,400 miles. Some dozens of direct circuits are worked quadruplex between the two places. On some new specially prepared wires (.thick copper) there are four sets of automatic repeaters. On wires of the ordinary sort there are six sets of these repeaters, and it is no uncommon-thing for a New York merchant to receive a reply to a telegram to San Francisco within fourteen minutes"".1. What is the hindrance to direct working between Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie or Perth and Adelaide, or even Melbourne, with automatic repeating stations between Adelaide and Perth at Yardea, Eucla, Balladonia, and Kalgoorlie or Coolgai-die, the same number as between New York and San Francisco (four stations) ? 2. Whether Australian instruments are not exactly the same as those used in America? 3. Whether direct working would not be productive of accuracy and a great saving in the time of transit of telegraphic messages between Western Australia and the eastern States of the Commonwealth, and also a considerable reduction of the present expenditure? Sir PHILIP FY^SH - The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: The Postmaster-General is not prepared to a categorical reply to this question. It is entirely a matter for experts, and it. is proposed to refer and all kindred questions relating to better methods of working lines, including that referred to, to a departmental board which is shortly meet in Melbourne for the purpose of considering and reporting upon electrical subjects affecting Postmaster-General's Department.

12,Sir JOHNFORREST,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as. follows :Regulations under the Commonwealth Electoral Act are now under consideration, and will be laid! upon the table of the House shortly.

The names of the four candidates appointed are-Hooper , George Patrick ; Orton, Arthur ; Muir, Frank Patterson; MeCahon, Albert T., who occupied first, third, seventh and thirteenth, places respectively on the list of successful candidates. All vacancies are filled in order of merit, but where a successful candidate will only accept appointment at certain towns specified by him his name must necessarily be passed over until a vacancy occurs at one of such places.

15,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I desire to ask ask the Treasurer why increases of salary are proposed for several officers of the Senate ? Are the increases simply mechanix cal ? I see that the Clerk of Papers, Shorthand-writer and Typist, the Housekeeper, and Doorkeeper, and the President's Messenger are to have increases, and, as they have occupied their present positions only for a year .or two, I do not see any reason, on the face of it , why their salaries should be increased.",15
16,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," If honourable members will look at the salaries set down for officers performing, similar duties on this side, they will find that the object of the increases now proposed is to give to the officers of the Senate the same salaries as are provided for officers performing corresponding duties in connection with this Chamber.",15
17,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,There cannot be as much work to do with thirty-six members of the Senate as with seventy-five members of the mum salary at once. House of Representatives.,15
18,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Some of the officers of the Senate received previously in order to bring their salaries nearer to those paid to the Chamber. It was felt by the President and by a large number of the members of the messenger. Senate that it wa3 hardly fair that their officers should be paid at a lower rate than ours. I do not know that that is a very strong reason for these increases; but i order to avoid friction I waived my objections. Although some of the mesof his. sengers of the Senate have not been in the service so long as have some of messengers, it has been thought wise to put them on a similar footing. These were the reasons which induced me, after conferring with the Prime Minister, to provide for increases. I hope that no objection will raised, because the amounts are not large, and if the increases are not granted some friction may arise.",15
19,Mr TUDOR,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I do not think that is quite fair that officers who have in. the service only two or three years be placed on the same footing as those have long service to their credit. If position of a senior messenger became SUPPLY. vacant it would scarcely be desirable or fair to appoint a junior to his position, and give him the maximum salary at the outset. Whilst I do not object to the increases as such, I think that some better reason tlian that mentioned by the Treasurer should be given.  proposed increases for very much the same reasons as those mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra. The President's messenger had increases on two prior occasions, and his salary now stands at £188. It is now proposed to increase it to £204. My idea is that a messenger should be paid to some extent in accordance with his length of service. I understand that the President's messenger has been in the service for only three years. He was formerly a temporary messenger in South Australia. I take the same view as the honourable member for Yarra with regard to the salaries to be paid to junior messengers who fill vacancies caused by the retirement of senior messengers.",15
20,Sir GEOKGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"In such a case the messenger would be appointed as a junior, and would not necessarily receive the maxi,",15
21,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,The messenger to whom it is proposed to give this higher salary is a increases junior messenger.,15
22,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,That is the Presiofficers of this dent's messenger.,15
23,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,Bu the is not the senior,15
24,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Of course my honourable friend will recollect that, under the  n appointment of his own officers in the same way that Mr Speaker has the appointment  our Regarding the wisdom, or otherwise, of increasing the emoluments of officers of Parliament, I would point out that in Queensland during the past two or three years, the the whole of the civil servants have not only be been denied increments, but have actually suffered a reduction of salary I do not think it would be fair to the public servants of that State that we should increase the salaries of any Commonwealth officers during been this year. I do not care who this particular should officer may be- I have nothing to say who against bim-bu t I am opposed to any in the creases of salary being granted during the current year. I think that the payment of increments might very well be allowed to stand over until times improve.",15
25,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I m o v e That the item, "" Clerk of the Papers and Accountant, -£420,"" be reduced by £40. It seems to me that the idea that officers of the two Houses of the Legislature should necessarily be placed upon the same footing has very little to recommend it . In the Senate the work can scarcely be as heavy as it is in this Chamber. The other branch of the legislature does not sit the same number of hours that this House does, and for reasons which we can quite understand. The fact that it contains fewer members necessarily means that there is not the same volume of work to be performed that there is in this House, even if the hours which the two Chambers sat were similar. Most of the salaries paid are upon a fairly reasonable scale, considering that when Parliament is in recess-as we hope it will be more regularly in the future-the officers in question can be granted extended  Mr Speaker. I certainly object to any increments being granted at the present time. In these Estimates I find that the .salaries of messengers, typists, &c. are being increased, whilst others who perform more responsible duties and who occasionally are compelled to work overtime, are given no encouragement whatever in that direction. If we cannot find funds to mete out fairer treatment to those who are charged with responsibility, we should not fritter away money in attempting to bring about a parity between the salaries of officers in the other Chamber and those in this. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I think there is a very great deal to be said in opposition to the increase from £ 3 8 0 to £420, which is proposed in this instance. Certainly, the Committee ought to be given more information in respect of the length of service of the officer who performs the duties of Clerk of the Papers and Accountant. In the absence, of any better reason than that which has been advanced by the Treasurer, I am of opinion that the increase should not be granted.

27,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,I feel that I musb accept the wish of the Committee.,16
28,Mr GLYNN,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I presumethat this is a new appointment which was rendered necessary by Eederation. I do not know whether the Treasurer is ignoring that fact. The Clerk of the Papers and Accountant is a transferred officer who probably came here under a promise that his salary would be increased; but the shorthand writer and typewriter, who has. been recently appointed, comes within, an altogether different category.",16
29,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I have no information upon that point. Amendment agreed to.

35,Mr TUDOR,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I desire to ask the Treasurer the reason for the inclusion of the last item in subdivision No. 1, "" To provide for increments and adjustment of salaries, £ 6 0 . """,17
36,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I should like to ask the Treasurer the reason for the proposal to increase the housekeeper's salary from £ 2 2 5 to £235. ' Sir GEORGE TURNER - We cannot avoid granting this increase. The housekeeper was appointed on the-1st January, ,1902, at a salary of £225 per annum, "" with yearly increments of £ 1 0 , "" to be proposed to Parliament, up to £250, with quarters, fuel, light, and water. His predecessor's salary amounted to £ 2 7 5 per annum, with anallowanceof £ 2 5 per annum with quarters, fuel, light and water. This increase was one of the conditions of the housekeeper's appointment. As to the point mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra, it will be found that throughout the Estimates I have allowed for increments in the lowest classes, which will practically be given as a matter of course. Increments to officers in other classes in the service must be dealt with by the Commissioner. That officer has to inquire whether any of them should receive increments, and under the Public Service A ct they become entitled to them upon receipt of his certificate. I - have, therefore, provided throughout the Estimates sums estimated to be sufficient to cover such increments as the Public Service Commissioner may think fit to grant. Under the Public Service Act, an officer in the higher classes does not become entitled to an increment until he obtains the certificate of the Commissioner, and no increase can be granted without that certificate.",17
37,Mr TUDOR,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," The Public Service Commissioner has power to grant increments to any of the officers mentioned in this Estimate. Are not all these officers under the Commissioner 1 I notice, for example, that provision is made for an increase of £ 1 0 increases per annum in the salary of a junior clerk. As far as I am aware the whole of the other salaries are fixed, and I can therefore see no necessity for this item. I do not think it will be spent while the present Treasurer remains in office.",17
38,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"The salaries of other officers may be increased under the classification of the Commissioner, and this item is to meet such a contingency.",17
39,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," Following the rule laid down by the Committee in dealing with officers of the Senate, it seems to me that no increase should be granted in this division to other than junior officers. I notice that provision is made for increasing the salary of a junior clerk from £ 7 0 to £80. That is a very proper proposal; but all the other officers are receiving fair salaries, and I do not think there is any necessity to provide for this item of £60.",17
40,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Unde r the Public Service Act, the officers have to be classified by the Commissioner. That rule applies throughout the service. If oflicers in the higher classes are dealt with in that way by the Public Service Commissioner, they will become entitled to increments.",17
41,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"We have still to vote the money. It seems to me that we need not pass this item until we see whether there is any necessity for it . I could well understand a proposal to increase the t salaries of clerks after they had been five or six years in the service of the Commonwealth, and had doii'e good work ; but I fail to see any necessity for automatic increases after two or three years' service. Mri?MAHON (Coolgardie) - As we are now Scraping a few pounds off the salaries of poorly-paid officers, I should"" like to draw the attention of the Treasurer to the enormous' sum which he is still paying by way of banking exchange. I have roughly gone through the Estimates, and I ' find that provision is made for an expenditure of no Jess than £3700 in this direction.",17
42,Sir GEOBGE TUBNEK,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,That is a big duction on last year's Estimates.,18
43,Mr MAHON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I have not carefully exnised. amined the Estimates of every .Department, but I find that these payments in - Western Australia amount to about £1200, in Tasescaped mania to £300, Queensland £250, Yictoria £950 and New South Wales £1,000. There may be other items, for I have not yet perused the Treasury and Defence Estihonorable mates.",18
44,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,This expenditure is chiefly iucurred in the.Postal Departto ment.,18
45,Mr MAHON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I have directed attention to this matter on two or three occasions, and if my memory serves me rightly, the Treasurer promised on each of those occasions that he would look into the question, with a view to effect a saving this very heavy charge.",18
46,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"On the last occasion the honourable member showed that this item amounted to some £7,000.",18
47,Mr MAHON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I believe that is so, but it does not redound to the credit of the Government that they should pay £7,000 are very great. per annum for a service which is practically tj.il. Does the Treasurer pretend the various banks which receive these payments transmit the coin from one State the other] They merely write a letter, for example, from the Perth branch to the head-office in Melbourne, directing that Government be debited or credited with such and such a sum. It is purely a bookdistributed keeping process, and the Treasurer must know that no real service is rendered for this outlay. I read a statement in the press a few days ago that the Treasurer had made arrangements to save this enormous sum but, accordingfcothe ex-Minisfcer for Trade and Customs, we cannot now rely on the truth of semi-official statements appearing the Melbourne press.",18
48,Mr KINGSTON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,Or anything which mental accounts. appears in a good many other newspapers.,18
49,Mr MAHON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"How is it that with branch offices throughout the States the Government find it necessary to incur this heavy expenditure in banking exchange? There is no necessity whatever for sendto ing the money to and fro. I am aware that the Treasurer desires to effect savings wherever possible, and whilst we are practising economy in relation to the salaries of poorly paid officers, we should take care rethat these large sums, extending into thousands of pounds, are rigidly scruti",18
50,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"The question of banking exchange is one that has not my attention. I have been making reductions in this direction ever since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, and the item has been very largely reduced. The member last year directed attention to the fact that the proposed expenditure, by way of banking exchange, amounted over £7,000. That outlay has been materially cut down. The Treasury does everything in its power, in dealing with Inter-State adjustments, to prevent any unnecessary transfer of moneys from one part of the Commonwealth to another. We debit and credit States, and in that way on make considerable savings. We are also using the money order account as far as possible to prevent either the sending of money or of instructions for the payment of money from one part of a State to another, or from one State to another. It must' not be forgotten that our banking transactions",18
51,Mr MAHON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,How much money passes that from one State to another 1,18
52,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I believe that to we have reduced the total to £200,000 or £300,000 per annum. If we did as we thought of doing atfcheoutset-and as the the banks believed we should do-and called in all moneys to the central Treasury and rethem again, the exchange would represent an enormous sum. But we do not follow that practice, and we have kept this amount as low as possible. Negotiations are pending between myself and the ; Banks, but a definite arrangement has not yet been arrived at. We must not overlook the fact that we receive a sum of in about £12,000,000 per annum and pay it away again, and that we have large depart",18
53,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,This amount also includes remittances to England.,18
54,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"No . We have a separate system in relation fco any remittances to London. If the individual States have money in London, and I have make a payment there, I arrange as far as I can for a payment to be made to them here, and for the States to make our payments from their accounts in Engduring land. By this means we' save the exchange. Every effort is made to save this exchange, and I hope that the result of negotiations which are proceeding between myself the banks will be that when the next year's Estimates are brought forward the amount will be very largely reduced. In fact, hope that during this year, if I can make the upon it. arrangements I contemplate, weshallnot have to expend anything like the amount"" named. We do not pay the banks the half-yearly item. charge which they make for keeping accounts. If the banks were to charge us 10s. year on all our accounts throughout the Commonwealth, the sum we should have to I pay would be a very large one indeed. course *he banks have to incur expenditure in keeping our accounts, and it costs them considerable sum. But I hope not to have to spend the sum set down, or even a portion of it , during the year; and next year if this vote appears on the Estimates at all, I trust that it will be a very small su.ro. More than that I do not think I at libertyfcostate afc the present time.",18
55,Mr MAHON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,What about interest on current accounts 1,19
56,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"W it h regard to interest on current accounts, I may say that, as a rule, we have practically nothing with the banks, because we pay over the money due to the States every week. We collect the money, and nearly every week we pay the States the amount that is due to them, and they place it to their own accounts in the banks. They have their own arrangements with the banks, by which they receive a small amount of interest. The banks did desire to make an arrangement with us that they should pay us interest on the minimum monthly balances, but on the first of the month we have practically nothing in the banks, because, as I have said, we pay to the States every shilling that is due to them in the course of the preceding month.  the votes for subh requisites as postage and telegrams, writing paper, envelopes, record and other books, and so on, I find that the allowance made fco the Senate is nearly identical with that made fco the House of Representatives. I am at a loss to understand this. We have in the House of Representatives double the number of members that there are in the Senate, and we do much more work, sitting many more days the'session.. I think there ought to be some relation to these facts in the sums allotted. I have observed that the note-. paper used in the Senate is very mucb and superior to that used in the House of Representatives, which is of a very rubbishy quality. It is very hard to pick up a sheetI of note-paper which has not some blemish",19
57,The CHAIRMAN,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I would remind the honourable member that we have passed that a a comparison between the House of Representatives and the Senate in this respectf £ 2 5 is allowed to the Senate for postageOf and telegrams, and £125 for writing paper and envelopes, there ought to be a consider a able increase of those sums for the House of Representatives; or else the Senate is large spending more money in proportion.",19
58,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,This does notapply to the postage and telegrams for members ; it is the mere departmental expendiam ture. The postage for members is provided for later on.,19
59,Mr FOWLER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,Is not this vote for the paper used 1,19
60,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"For paper, but not for the postage.",19
61,Mr FOWLER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,There should .be somedifferentiation .,19
62,Mr GLYNN,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," There is a foot-note on page S referritig to Mr. Speaker. Honourable members will noticethat there is an asterisk opposite the line""The Speaker,"" and then at the foot of the page the note readsI f returned again to Parliament salary to continue notwithstanding the dissolution, until the meeting of the new Parliament. I hold that that is unconstitutional. If it isfcobe' done it should be done by Acfc of Parliament. Even then I doubt whether an Act can override the Constitution. Under section 35 of the Constitution provision is made for the House of Representatives to elect a Speaker j and in the second paragraph it is stated that the Speaker shall cease to hold office if he ceases to be a member. Y e t here is a provision that if the same member who happens to be Speaker is again returned to Parliament after a dissolution the salary will be payable to him during the whole time when tliere was no House of Representatives in existence. I - hold that that is unconstitutional,, whatevermay be the policy of it . I am not going to-discuss the expediency of paying the money, but honourable members will notice that there is no such provision in the President.",19
63,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,The President not necessarily cease to be a senator at time of a dissolution; his the 31st December.,20
64,Mr GLYNN,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,I think the right honorfrom able gentleman is alluding to the Standing Orders of the Senate.,20
65,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,The Constitution provides for that.,20
66,Mr GLYNN,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Of course the right honourable gentleman is quite right. I was ing of the new standing order of the Senate, - under which, I think, the President's - of office has been fixed for a term. real reason, as the. Treasurer says, that there is no break ; but it seems to that the Constitution does not allow us pay a salary to Mr Speaker for the period when he does not hold his office.",20
67,Mr WILKS,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I think the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, has raised a very portant point, which ought to elicit some information from the Government. Apparsident ently the object of the footnote referred to is to place Mr Speaker on an equal footing not. with the President of the Senate. The footlose note says-""If returned again to Parliament salary to continue."" Why should Mr Speaker be placed in a different position from other member of the House of Representatives 1 It simply means that, if a dissolution takes place, during the period occupied by the general election, Mr Speaker will conceives tinue to draw his salary. There is no member of the House who will be placed that position. Other members will draw their salaries from the time when elected. That should be sufficient for Speaker. I cannot see why he should a different position from the Chairman Committees. We - might as well place an asterisk alongside the line which contains the salary of the Chairman of Committees, and say that he shall draw his salary during the period occupied by a general election. It does not follow that because a certain gentleman may hold the office of Speaker one Parliament, he will be re elected after the general election. We may sometimes have a Speaker who will not be re-elected though I hope that our present Speaker will be.",20
68,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,I suppose the meaning of it is that we must have some - officer at the case of the head of the Department?,20
69,Mr WILKS,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"It has not been the cusdoes tom, I think, in the States, to pay the the Speaker during the interregnum caused by term runs to a general election.",20
70,Sir EDMUND BARTON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Yes , in the State which the honourable member comes.",20
71,Mr WILKS,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I never knew that. In New South Wales the Speaker's salary was, I believe, £1,100 per annum, but I understood it was drawn only while Parliament was in existence.",20
72,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"In regard to thinktbe item mentioned by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr . tenure Glynn, I would point out that there is The nothing in the Constitution which prois hibits the payment of his salary to Mr. me Speaker during a general election. It is to quite competent for Parliament to vote t h n amount if it thinks that it is a fair, reason- . able, and proper thing to do. I have been actuated in placing the item upon the Estimates by the fact that the difference in imthe case of the President and Mr Speaker would otherwise be very marked. The Prewould be entitled to receive his salary for the full period, while Mr Speaker would It is said that honourable members their salaries during a general election. So does Mr Speaker. He loses his ordinary salary as a member, but we propose that he any shall not also lose his salary as Speaker.",20
73,Mr A MCLEAN,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,As Speaker he does not receive his ordinary member's salary.,20
74,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Ye s ; he re£ 4 0 0 a year as a member and £1,100 other a year as Speaker. It was first proin posed that the Speaker's salary should be £1,500 a year in addition to the £ 4 0 0 they are received by him as a member, but Mr ultimately it was decided to pay £1,500 be in altogether - that is, £1,100 for the of Speakership and £400 for membership. Of course the salaries of Ministers are paid after a dissolution of Parliament vfntil the meeting of the new Parliament, because they must continue to carry on their administrative work. In the same way it will be necessary for the Speaker, during the interi n val between the dissolution of one Parliament and the meeting of the next, to attend to his share of the business connected with ; the Departments of Parliament.",20
75,Mr HUGHES,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Is the suggestion to drop the salary of £1,100, or that of £400 1",20
76,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"The proposal is to drop only the salary at the rate of £400, which the Speaker receives as a member of the House of Representatives. Mr Wilks.'--The proposal is a peculiar one, when we are cutting down the salaries of messengers by £ 1 6 a year.",21
77,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"That action has been taken for a particular reason - Parliament. Honourable members have considered that the reasons given for the increases proposed have not been sufficiently strong. In this case wearedealing with anentirelydifferentmatter. We are here proposing to establish a precedent, and it is on that account that I have had a footnote introduced to direct thespecial attention of honourable members to the fact. What the practice in other States has been I do not know, but I am informed that it has been usual to allow the salary to continue if the Speaker is re-elected. I recollect that that was done in my time in Victoria on one occasion when the Speaker was returned and re-elected to his office. He was allowed salary for the period during which the House was not in session.",21
78,Mr WILKS,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Why not pay him for the work done during the interval between the dissolution and the election of the new Parliament, whether he is re-elected as Speaker or not? Mr HUGHES , - I also think that course should be adopted.",21
79,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"That is open for consideration. We think it is not desirable that invidious distinctions should be drawn between the presiding officers of the two Chambers. As Ministers continue to draw their salaries it seems only fair that the Speaker should be entitled to draw his salary during a dissolution when he has to do the work of his office. The additional point taken that whether he is re-elected or not he ought to be paid if he does the work is a good one, and is deserving of consideration. I ma)' say that I hope that aspect of the case will not come before us.",21
80,Mr THOMSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I agree with the Treasurer that we are here establishing a precedent, and we are free to deal with the matter without being bound b} any previous custom, as are the States r Parliaments. They have established precedents in the past, but we are quite free to deal with this matter without any previous custom binding us to adopt a certain course. Whether the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is or is not right as to the constitutional aspect of the question, it would be an undesirable precedent to set up that we should make a continuance of the salary of the Speaker dependent upon his re-election to Parliament and to the office of Speaker.",21
81,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,We could hardly pay the salary to a man who was not a Member of,21
82,Mr THOMSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"His position as Speaker depends on his being a Member of Parliament, and it is here proposed to pay him a salary when he is actually not a Member of Parliament at all. That is something to which, I think, we should take objection. It is not a personal matter with any of us. We have no objection to the Speaker receiving the salary stated; but it is a question whether he should receive it when he ceases to be a Member of Parliament. I do not think we have been furnished with any good reason why he should. As regards the comparison between the Senate and the House of Representatives it might as well be said that as honourable senators will be receiving salary although the Senate will not be sitting, whilst members of the House of Representatives, when standing for re-election, will not receive salary",21
83,Mr VL SOLOMON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"They will be sacrificing, in this instance, four or five months' salary, to which they are entitled under the Constitution.",21
84,Mr THOMSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"The members of this House ought to be placed upon the same footing as members of the Senate. I think it is undesirable in this case that the continuance of the salary should depend upon whether a member of the House is re-elected to the House or to the Speakership ; and it is also undesirable that the Speaker, who cannot be Speaker unless he is a Member of Parliament, should .be recognised as entitled to receive salary during the period when he is not a Member of Parliament. W i th every good wish for the present Speaker, I oppose the provision now sought to be made. I think we should establish another, and a much better precedent, than we shall have established if we adopt the terms of the footnote to this vote. Amendment (by Mr Glynn) proposed - That the footnote to the item, "" Mr Speaker, £1,100."" "" If returned again to Parliament salary to continue, notwithstanding the dissolution, until the meeting of the new Parliament"" be omitted.  novice at this game, and I should like to hear what the Treasurer has to say upon the motion.",21

My vote depends upon his explanation, and not having heard the explanation I must vote against the proposal in the foottypists note. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I quite agree with the remarks made by the honourable member for Sydney. I remind honourable members that we may also in this case be creating a precedent so far as the position of the President of the Senate is concerned. It might happen that he will be up for re-election during the period between the dissolution of one Parliament and the meeting of the next.",22

89,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,Of course if the amendment is carried I shall accept that as a direction. Amendment agreed to.,22
90,Mr TUDOR,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I do not know the matter. whether I am in order in reverting to the travelling expenses in connection with Senate, but I should like the Treasurer explain what tbese travelling expenses sist of. Are they the travelling expenses officers or of members 1",22

The salary for the senior messenger is; in my opinion, fair, and it must be admitted that both officers work long hours; but it would be only reasonable if the steward were paid a salary a little higher than that of the messenger.",22
97,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"The amount set down for the steward is that asked for by the House Committee as being reasonable. Honourable members surely do not expect me to increase the amounts which I am asked to pay.

This is a matter which conshould be taken into consideration, not by of the House Committee, but by this Committee.

The steward ought certainly to rank higher than a messenger.",22

He kept here until late hours when Parliament is sitting, and has also to be in attendance at other times. A little while ago this attendant in going home one night, after late sitting, met with-an accident, and had his arm broken. That has nothing specially to do with his position; but still we keep late here every night, and I think that some little addition might be made to his salary.",23
108,Sir GEORGE TURNER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"The salary of the lift attendant was originally £52, but, at the suggestion of the Committee, it increased last year to £65.

111,Mr TUDOR,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I should like to hear from the Prime Minister some explanation of the item of £ 2 0 0 for the purchase of a bust of the first Governor General. If I do not receive a satisfactory explanation I shall move that the item be struck out. Sir EDMUNDBARTON (Hunter Minister for External Affairs) - The proposed purchase of this bust--becaus e it is subject to Parliamentary approval-of the first Governor General arose in this way: large Before Lord Hopetoun left Australia he gave sittings to Mr IUingworth, whom, I dare say, honourable members who are residents of Sydney know very well by repute only as a sculptor of great talent. A fte r Lord Hopetoun had gone away, I was asked, when I returned to Australia, to inspect this bust the in plaster. I saw the bust and some photographs of it which had been prepared, and I thought that the work would be excellent when executed in marble.. The artist fixed price at £ 2 0 0 ; and I suggested that some of the photographs should be sent to Lord Hopetoun, under whose eye the work divihad, to a certain extent, progressed. This was done, and Lord Hopetoun replied to the effect that the artist had succeeded beyond expectations. That was a private letter, but it was shown to me. Under the circum5 per stances, I came to the conclusion that there ought to be some permanent record of every Governor General of the Commonwealth, is either in sculpture or in painting-that there ought to be placed on record the lineaments of those who have held the position. The present proposal ought not to be a complicated by the question as to whether there ought to be records of future Governor General. A record of our first Governorhim General ought, at any rate, to be provided. I think that a good bust of Lord Hopetoun, made before he left England, and before he suffered in health as he did afterwards, would be a more faithfu l record than a paintwas ing done in England after his return. obTherefore, as the work seemed to me to be a good one, I , having inquired its price, told a the artist that I would ask Parliament to buy it . I informed him that that promise did not amount to a contract with him by which the Government was bound; but that if Parliament would vote the money the purchase of the bust would be completed by the Government.",23
112,Mr MAUGER,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,It is an Australian production.,24
113,Sir EDMUND BARTON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"It rests entirely with honourable members as to whether the transaction -.vill be completed. I have not tied their hands in any way. I would suggest, however, that we ought to make a record of this kind in the case of every Governor General, and that we should not miss the present opportunity to obtain a presentation of Lord Hopetoun's lineaments which, so far as my judgment goes, is a faithfu l and true one, for which the price asked is not extraordinary.",24
114,Mr R EDWARDS,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I shall not oppose the item. I rise to point out that we are labouring under a mistake when we describe Lord Hopetoun as the first Governor General. In this connection I would draw the attention of the Committee to the following extract from a book compiled for presentation to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, entitled Twentieth Century Impressions of Western Australia:When the Australian Government Act was passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1850, the idea of an ultimate Federation was even then engaging the attention of British statesmen, and particularly those responsible for the control of the Queensland Colonial Office. At that time, of course, we had no separate polibical existence, and the detachment of Victoria from New South Wales was not completed till the following year, although South Australia had, under charter, attained the dignity of a separate province some fifteen years previously. Western Australia was, geographically, too remote to be specially included in the Imperial plans, but provision was nevertheless made by the Australian Government Act for the establishment of thab colony on the same footing as her sisters, whenever the proper time should arrive for the carrying out of that project. In furtherance of the Imperial idea of Federation, Sir Charles A. Fitzroy, Governor of New Soubh Wales, received a commission as Governor General of Australia, the Governors of the other colonies all holding the official rank of Lieutenant Governor. Any Lieutenanb-Governor was to be superseded in his office during the bemporary residence in his colony of the Governor General. Ib was, however, objected by the residents of Melbourne and Adelaide that bheir distance from the Federal capital (Sydney) was boo greab to make the Imperial proposals accepbable. The matter was, therefore, not$ pressed; and, on the retirement of Sir Charles A. Fitzroy in 1855, the bible of Governor was bestowed upon He» Majesty's representative in each of the other colonies. And though the distinction of Governor General was retained by the Governor of New South Wales until 1861 the bitle carried no real power. So complete indeed has been the effacement of this incident from recollection that today Lord Hopetoun is generally described as the first Governor General of Australia ; whereas, in fact, two of his predecessors held that title in succession over forty years ago.",24
115,Sir EDMUND BARTON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"No doubt Sir Will liam Denison held the title of Governor General, but Lord Hopetoun was the first Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia. If honourable members wish it , I will move the insertion of those words in the item.",24
116,Mr R EDWARDS,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Whateve r inscription is placed upon the bust, it should be a correct one.",24
117,Mr TUDOR,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I m o v e That the item ""For the purchase of a bust of the first Governor General, £200,"" be omitted.",24
118,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,Is not Lord Hopetoun's reputation enough to make his memory live?,24
119,Mr TUDOR,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"If the reputation he has left behind is not sufficient to keep his memory green, I do not think that a bust will do so.",24
120,Mr MCDONA LD,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I hope that the Committee will strike out the item. Thef actfchatsome artist asked Lord Hopetoun to sit for him while he fashioned a model of his bust, and that Lord Hopetoun said that the bust when made was a faithfu l one, is, to my mind, no reason why we should buy it , although the artist who executed the work deserves every credit for the talent which he has displayed.",24
121,Sir EDMUND BARTON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,The facts wbicb the honourable member has mentioned do not in themselves constitute a sufficient reason why Parliament should buy the bust. My main argument was that we should have some record of each Governor-Geueral.,24
122,Mr MCDONALD,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I think that we have a very good record of Lord Hopetoun, because he cost the Commonwealth £40,000 during the eighteen months he was here. If that is not an impression which will live long in the memory of the people, I do not know what more lasting one they want. If the bust is such a faithful representation of Lord Hopetoun, I think he might do us the honour to present it to us, in which case we might use it to adorn Parliament House in the Federal Capital.' If , on the other hand, the people of Australia, are anxious to have a memorial of Lord Hopetoun, why should there not be a national, testimonial, and a full-sized statue subscribed for? It seems a paltry thing to 'vote ±'200 for a bust to perpetuate the memory of a man in connection with whom the Commonwealth has already spent £40,000 upon a ""bust"" of a different char' acter. . Mr WINTER COOKE (Wannon). - I think it is very much to be regretted that the propriety of voting this money is being disputed, but, as it is being disputed, it would be better for the Government to withdraw the item. I am sure that Lord Hopetoun, than whom no higher minded gentleman ever came to Australia- a gentleman as high minded, if not higher minded, than any meinber of the party which is now criticising this proposal",24
123,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,-What right has the honourable member to make reflections upon any member of the party which criticises this expenditure ? I object to such reflections.,25
124,Mr WINTER COOKE,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"If the honprable member thinks I made any reflection upon him, I withdraw what I said.",25
125,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,To compare us to our disadvantage with Lord Hopetoun is a reflection.,25
126,Mr WINTER COOKE,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I said that his ideas were as high minded, if not higher minded, than those of any member of the Labour Party. I see nothing in that remark to withdraw. I am satisfied, however, that he will deeply regret any division in regard te> a proposal of this kind.",25
127,Sir EDMUND BARTON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"The item has been placed on the Estimates, not out of compliment to Lord Hopetoun, but in pursuance of the design that the Commonwealth shall have a record of each successive Governor General.",25
128,Mr WINTER COOKE,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I think that the bust should be secured as an historical record of the first Governor General of Australia, but, inasmuch as objection is taken to the proposal because some honourable members think that there is no need for such a record, the item should be withdrawn.",25
129,Sir EDMUND BARTON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"If the item were of apersonal character, I would willingly accept the honourable member's advice in regard to it , rather than have any dispute about it . But there is something approaching a principle involved in it, and that is that as a people we should be mindf u l that we are makers of history. The early days of the Commonwealth will be the subject of historical examination and research, and records should be kept of the main events of our history, and the actors connected with them. That being so, it is for honourable members to consider whether we should, on the very threshold of that history, deny that there is any advantage to be gained in keeping, either upon canvas or in marble, a record of each of the distinguished men who come here.",25
130,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,Le t the grateful people subscribe.,25
131,Sir EDMUND BARTON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"I could understand that we should not make a record of distinguished men if we had come to the conclusion that we ought notfcohave them, but as we have not comefcothafc conclusion, and as the Constitution provides for successive representatives of theKing, it seems to me that, while we should do no harm or spite to any Governor General by refusing this memorial, we should do ourselves despite if we refused to obtain a record which it is of advantage to the Commonwealth to have.",25
132,Mr WILKS,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," The Prime Minister has tried to raise an ideal in regard to this matter, but while I think that the Commonwealth at times needs ideals, I do not think that his proposal is a good one. If we are to have an historical record of our Governors-General which will be something like Madam Tussaud's exhibition, it may happen that interim Governor-Generals or - their friends will want to have their features preserved there; but the right honourable gentleman has made mention of no such proposal. It seems to me that if records such as he speaks of are to be kept, names like those of Sir Henry Parkes and the late Honourable James Service, which stand out pre-eminently in connection with the historical side of Federation, should be commemorated in marble or on canvas. But, so far, no such proposal has been made. Although I appreciate high ideals, and love the artistic side of life, I think that the Australian public are too utilitarian to spend money in the manner proposed. If it is intended to preserve the bust of every Governor General, the proposal now before us is no great compliment to Lord Hopetoun. To use the vernacular, in our expenditure upon his account we have already had a sufficient bust. I shall oppose the item.",25
133,Mr LE GROOM,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Darling Downs) It is my intention fco vote for the item. We have to consider, as the Prime Minister has said, the advisability of preserving historical records of the Federation. Parliament very properly votes a large sum annually to preserve for the information of future ages a record of what is said and done here and in the Senate.",25
134,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"It is rather for the information of the present age, so that the people may know what we are doing.",26
135,Mr LE GROOM,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Hansard is intended for something more than a record for the information of the present generation. We have taken very great care that everything done by Parliament shall be faithfully and honestly placed on record, and I am in sympathy with any movement having that object. I think we should also have some portraiture of the first Governor General of the Commonwealth as an historical record. This Parliament has functions to perform beyond those relating to purely utilitarian matters. Surely, at the outset of our career as a nation we should take some interest in science, literature and art, and show that, as a people, we have some appreciation of all that is noblest and best in life.",26
136,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,That is not the idea behind the proposed purchase.,26
137,Mr LE GROOM,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"The Prime Minister describes the bust as a work of art, and as a correct delineation of the features of the late Governor General; and I think that he has enunciated a sound principle in connection witli this matter. When we establish the Federal capital we shall have to do something to beautify it. Do honourable members propose that we, as a Parliament, should confine our attention to purely utilitarian matters ? A bust of the Governor General should be included amongst the works of art used, not only to beautify the Federal capital, but to remind the people of the makers of the Commonwealth, and of those associated with them.",26
138,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,Why not collect a shilling subscription for the purpose 1,26
139,Mr LE GROOM,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"A sufficient sum for the purpose might be raised by public subscription ; but, apart from that, surely we have our duty as ,a Parliament to discharge.  Governor General very well for what he did. Mr L\ E. GROOM - Honourable members participated in the benefits arising from the expenditure incurred by the late Governor General in celebrations worthy of the occasion, and we know that not one penny of the money voted by this Parliament went into Lord Hopetoun's pocket. However, that is quite apart from the question now before us. The Prime Minister very properly urges that we should preserve as a matter of historical record a representation of our first Governor General, and in this regard we cannot escape our responsibility to tliose who may come after us. The people of other nations would have been glad if their predecessors had taken care to preserve the records of their time by means of statues and other representations of the great characters who have taken a leading part in making history. If that had been done, a benefit would have been conferred, not only upon the nation itself, but upon the whole civilized world. History ought to be our guide, and the Prime Minister was perfectly right when he emphasised the need which we as the first Australian Parliament should supply. I have great pleasure in supporting the proposal.",26
140,Mr SPENCE,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I think that the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs was somewhat mixed, because he confused the subject of the encouragement of art with the present proposal. I should be quite prepared to vote more than £ 2 0 0 for the encouragement of art, and I hope veiy liberal provision will be made in that direction when we have our own art gallery. At the same time, I fail to see why we should spend £ 2 00 upou a bust of the late Governor General, and I admire the courage of the Government in making the proposal in the face of the Kyabram cry for economy. Our system of government does not afford any opportunity for the exercise of special capabilities by the gentleman who may hold the position ofGovernor-General, if we arranged to have busts of all our Governor General, some phrenologist of the future might, on examining the outlines of their heads, say, "" Tliere is the head of a wonderfully brainy man. He ought to have figured prominently in the history of the Commonwealth."" The phrenologist, bowever, on searching the records, would find that that brainy man had done nothing, for the simple reason _ that he had had no opportunity. We do not want our Governor General to do anything beyond making himself genial and presiding over society functions. There is no room for a strong man in that position, because we look after the government of the Commonwealth for ourselves. The actions of men count most in history, and we do not need a bust of the late - Governor General unless it be intended to make a "" joss "" of it . I believe in having - complete historical records, but I fail that the value of such records would be - added to if they included representations of the heads and shoulders of our Governor General. They would afford no indication - of the work performed by the men whom they represented. We are endeavouring to save all the money we can, and I think we may defer the purchase of works of art until we have an art gallery in which we can place them. If we decided to have a bust. -«f the first Governor General we should arrange for busts of all his successors. In such a case trouble might arise in the future - as to where we should put them, and they might eventually be stored in a lumber joom.  member for Wannon need not vent his indignation upon honourable members who venture to criticise the late Governorgeneral. Some objectors were taken to task for criticisms passed on Lord Hopetoun in connection with the special vote of £10,Q00 which was given to him : but in spite of all the hard things which were said - of him, that distinguished gentleman did not hesitate to take the money.",26
141,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"But consider the enormous expense to which he was put.  When the honourable member is installed the High Commissioner of the Commonwith wealth in London he will have to incur much greater expense than will be - covered by the salary he receives. should very much like to see the in honourable member appointed, because no one could more fitly occupy the position. Honourable members must be held perfectly free to criticise the Estimates as they think fit, even though references to the late Governor General may be involved. Honorbetter able members may not know of the fate which has overtaken some of the monuments erected in London. I can remember, AS a boy, seeing the Queen Anne monuand eleven busts. ment, at the top of Ludgate Hill , in St. Paul's Church-yard. The weather and time - played havoc with that monument, and the last time. I saw it, her late Majesty was lacking a nose. Later on, when I saw - a leper at Friday Island, I was irresistibly reminded of the Queen Anne monument, 'which has since been removed and broken up for road metal. A similar fate might await a statue of our first Governor General. to see The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs thought it was necessary that we should adopt this proposal in order that the people who come after us may know who we were and what we were; but my experience is that the only history which will live is that which is to be found in books. The amount of £ 2 0 0 is of no importance, but if the present proposal were agreed to, it would establish an objectionable precedent. A bust of the Prime Minister finds a place in the Sydney A r t Gallery, and it looks very well. I have admired it very much, because it is a good representation of the right honourable gentleman. I never beard, however, that the public were asked to contribute towards the cost of that bust. The memory of the right honourable gentleman and also that of Lord Hopetoun. will live for ever, and they need no busts to remind the people of their connection with the early days of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Government will withdraw the item,' because I should be very sorry to see them defeated. I sbould like to know whether the fate of the Government will depend upon the vote. If the carrying of this vote will involve their fate I shall support them, but if not I shall vote against them.",27
142,Mr CROUCH,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I sball oppose the item. If honourable members are anxious to have a bust of the Governor General as they should initiate a public subscription that end in view. A number of citizens of Melbourne desired to have a portrait of the Governor General, and we I subscribed for a painting which is now hung the Melbourne Town Hall. The present discussion has emphasized the fact that the people of the Commonwealth have nothing to do with the appointment of the Governor General. If we wished to encourage art by purchasing abust, it would be infinitely for us to purchasefchebust of the first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth.",27
143,Mr WATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Le t us have a hundred Mr CROUCH.T-At any rate, the Prime Minister has been elected and sustained in his office by the people. On the other hand, the Governer-General is appointed, not to represent the people, but to represent something which is a check and constant drag and veto upon the wishes of the people, namely, the Colonial Oflice. I fear that by agreeing to this item we shall he establishing a very bad precedent, under which it will be necessary to purchase a bust of each succeeding Governor General. One does not care about saying anything derogatory to the first Governor General, because he was a very popular, worthy, and able man indeed. At the same time, I believe that the best method to adopt in regard to this item is to apply the system which is followed in connection with the .canonization of saints by the Roman Church. I understand that under that system no person can be suggested as a saint until he has been dead about a hundred years. I think it would be wise to eliminate this item, and to see if the reputation of 'our first Governor General wears for ' a hundred years. Otherwise I hold that we should be wasting the people's money in perpetuating the memory of a distinguished oflicial who did not represent the people.

I understand that a very artistic bust of the leader of the Opposition is being placed upon, the market. These can be bought for ls. 3d. each.

149,Mr OMALLEY,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," As the honourable and learned member for South NOES. Australia has made a suggestion in reference; to the late Chief Justice Marshall, I heartily support it .",28
150,Mr MCDONA LD,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," In this matter I think that the Government havecommitted a very grave error. In my judgment there is another gentleman who wasconnected with the inauguration of the Commonwealth, and who is more entitled toa bust than is anyone else.",28

152,Mr MCDONALD,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"No , I do not refer of to the late Sir Henry Parkes, although I freely acknowledge his great services to tliecause of Federation. I desire to know why the first Clerk of this House has been ignored 1 I refer to Mr George Jenkins",28
153,Mr VVATSON,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,He had a bust.,29
154,Mr MCDONALD,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Seeing that he was the first Clerk of this House, I think that the Government should have proposed to immortalize him in bust. Let honourable members reflect what he did for us in connection with the opening of this Parliament. Let them remember the great entertainments which he arranged for us in the early history of the Commonwealth. Y e t the Government have entirely ignored his claims merely for the sake of .purchasing a bust of Lord Hopetoun.",29

156,Mr MCDONALD,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H,"Yes , and I under, stand that it cost us £11,000.",29
157,Mr SPENCE,D IRECTWORKING OP TELEGRAP H," I think the Government, ought to definitely state whether they intend to retain the services of a sculptor to undertake this work in the future, aud whether they contemplate that it shall be done by contract or day labour 1 Proposed vote agreed to. NA AFFAIRS. Division 11 (Administrative)-£8,820 . Sir EDMUNDBARTON (Hunter Minister for External Affairs*) - I desire to make a short explanation in reference to this division. Upon looking at the Estimates honourable members will see that the salary of the Chief Clerk in"" this Department has been saved. Reference to the item relating to the clerks, however, will show that the first clerk, Mr Lewis, who was at Government House uncier the previous official Secretary, and who received a salary of ±'325, is - now to receive £350. Seeing that he has been removed to a position of very much greater responsibility, aud will be called upon to do increased work, the addition to his salary of £ 2 5 per annum is a small one. On the other hand,"" whereas Mr Lewis formerly received £325 as clerk to the official Secretary at Government House, we have now appointed in his place a clerk at £ 1 2 0 per annum, thus effecting a saving of £ 2 0 5. The salary of the Secretary to the Federal Executive Council remains the same, namely, £ 6 0 0 ; but the duties of Secretary to the Federal Executive Council and official Secretary to the Governor General are now being discharged under the one heading and title. Therefore the saving, which has been effected in that respect-if I may refer to division 12 - is £ 2 0 5 as against an increase of £ 2 5 in Mr Lewis' salary upon his transfer.",29
158,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But there are two extra,29
159,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"At the bottom of that list honourable members will find that provision is made for one clerk at £100 per annum, and another at £ 4 0 . These amounts, which will now be paid out of the salary vote, were previously paid out of the vote for. temporary assistance. If honourable members will refer to item 11, ""contingencies,"" they will see that whereas the amount thus spent last year was £240, it has been reduced this year to £ 1 0 0 . The increases relating to the remaining salaries between the first and the two last mentioned in this that item are the ordinary annual increments granted under the Public Service Act. But for any item which I may have overlooked, I have explained the whole of these alterations. At a later stage I shall move to reduce the item, "" Travelling expenses, £400,"" by £120, as I find that the amount may be reduced to that extent.",29
160,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," To what does the item "" Grant to Jenner Institute, £ 3 3 5 ,"" relate? . Sir GEORGE TURNER - That amount was paid last year.",29
161,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"It was paid, but it was not voted last year. ' Sir EDMUND BARTON - The item, I believe, relates to some anti-plague serum, which the individual States would otherwise have bad to purchase. It bas been more advantageously obtained by the Commonwealth for distribution among them.",29
162,Mr HUME COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I desire to call the attention of the Minister to an advertisement which appeared in the Age a few days ago in the following terms :SOUTH. AFRICAN RAILWAYS - Goo d positions secured for railway employees. Remunerative appointments, with splendid future prospects, now available for limited number of .traffic branch clerks under thirty years of age. For personal interview, write-""Capetown, "" care of Gordon and Gotch, Melbourne. Two or three men-mos t of them members of the railway service-hav e interviewed me in reference to this matter. It appears that the advertiser is seeking to engage some 200 or 300 men for employment in South Africa. He demands from every man who agrees to go there in accordance with the terms of the advertisement, a deposit of £ 4 , and an undertaking to pay him a further sum of £ 4 upon arrival in South Africa.",29
163,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Will they pay it 1,30
164,Mr HUME COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Some are doing so.  their money.,30
165,Mr HUME COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I have-no desire to do an injustice to any one, but from what I can learn the advertiser appears to be acting under some authority, or, at all events, is sufficiently plausible to make some men believe that he is. The possibility of 200 or 300 reputable men being, first of all, deprived of a certain sum of money, and then stranded in a distant country is so serious that the Prime Minister should cause inquiry to be made into the matter.",30
166,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The member mentioned - this matteito me this afternoon, and I have given instructions for a cable to be sent to the Governor of Cape Colony, with a view to ascertain whether the advertiser is authorized to engage these men. I think that the matter is deserving of inquiry, «.nd I shall take care to publish the reply to my message.",30
167,Mr HUME COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I informed the Prime Minister early this afternoon that I intended to bring this question forward, and I was going to suggest that he should do what he has done. I trust that he will publish the reply to his message as soon as it is received.",30
168,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Certainly .,30
169,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," On e would at first believe from the remarks of the Prime Minister that he had displayed admirable qualities in the administration of his Department and effected considerable economies. At the first blush it would appear that he had got rid of a clerk who was in receipt of a sjilary of £ 6 0 0 per annum, but it appears that the amount has been saved in one item and applied to others.",30
170,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I did not say that there had been an absolute saving of £600. I said that portion of that .amount had been distributed in other ways.,30
171,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We find that the £60 0 has practically been distributed by way of increase to various clerks, for whom a sum of £1,790 is now provided, as against £1,210 voted last year.",30
172,Sir GEOKGE TUBNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But the' other clerks were employed during only a portion of last year.,30
173,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"In view of the spirit of economy that is abroad, I think we should have some explanation in regard to this matter. It appears that there has been no .rash economy practised in the Department.  membered that when the Attorney-General was dealing with last year's Estimates relating to the Executive Council he emphatically told the Committee that there would be only one clerk employed, and that he would receive £ 1 2 0 per annum.",30
174,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Tlia t is so.  provision for another clerk at £ 1 4 0 per annum.,30
175,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"That item honourable relates to the salary of a typewriter and messenger. If the honourable member looks at the items under the heading-of "" Federal Executive Council"" he will find that last year a sum of £ 1 2 0 was voted for tem_ porary assistance. That amount, plus a sum of £ 2 0 , which the oflicer seems to have well earned, is now applied fco the salary of a clerk in the Public Service, acting as type writer and messenger.",30
176,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I desire to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a question rslating to the Philippines, which is already beginning to affect Australian trade. The right honourable gentleman is perhaps unaware of the fact that Australian manufacturers of reaper and binder twine, and various other classes of cordage, find it absolutely necessary to import a certain class of Manilla twine. As the result of the establishment of this industry in Australia the price of reaper and binder twine has been materially reduced; but, owing to certain action taken by the United States authorities, the manufacturers are now placed at a serious disadvantage. When the Philippines were taken over by the United States of America, a promise was made that in accordance with an arrangement which the Spanisli Government had previously carried out, the best favoured nation treatment should be extended to the British Government. But the United States of America authorities at the Philippines now impose an export duty of £ 1 10s. per ton on Manilla twine exported to countries other than the United States. Thus, Messrs. Donaghy and Co., of Geelong, Miller's Twine Factory,Melbourne, and other manufactories in the Commonwealth, of which I bave no personal knowledge, have to pay for this material £ 1 10s. per ton in excess of the price at which the United States manufacturers are able to obtain it . ' I think that the Minister should endeavour to see that the treaty entered into by the .Unites States Government is carried out.",30
177,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Am I to stand that bhere are treaty obligations 1,31
178,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"An arrangement was made that the Spanish Tariff should not be raised against other nations prior to the assumption of sovereignty by the United States of America, but that arrangement is now being evaded by the imposition of the export duty' which I have named. There is another matter which I desire to bring under the attention of the Minister. It seems to me that we should help the Australians in South Africa to fight against-the employment of Hindoo and Chinese coolie labour there. Unfortunately many Australians are still going to South Africa.",31
179,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,There is beginning to be a set back.,31
180,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We expended our money and the life's blood of many of our citizens i u helping the British Government to conquer the Transvaal and Orange Free State; but with a desire to increase their dividends the mine-owners there are carrying on an agitation which is steadily growing-and which will be successful unless we as a Parliament make some protest against it-for the introduction of some' 380,000 Hindoo and Chinese labourers. Under the new administration, natives in British South Africa, as well as in Portuguese territory who are able to live without working for white mpn, are being compelled to pay a hut tax of £ 1 or £ 2 per head, that impost being levied in order to force them to work in the mines.",31
181,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,What has that matter to do with us 1,31
182,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"It has much to do with us. We owe a responsibility to the many Australians who have gone to South Africa in search of work, and many' of whom are now stranded, because of the fact that a great deal of work is carried on by inferior races. When I brought forward this question last year, the answer made by the Acting Prime Minister was that it was a matter which did not affect Australia. Bub we are responsible for our own acts of war and aggression. If this is a question which does not affect us, how is it that when the Prime Minister was attending the recentImperial Conference, he did not hesitate to ask that legal practitioners in Australia should have a right to practice in the newly conquered British territory in South Africa ?",31
183,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The request applied under- not solely to legal practitioners, but generally to skilled and learned professions.",31
184,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"If we are able to interfere in these matters in one direction we should be able to do so in another. I should Uke the Prime Minister to take steps to support the rights of Australians, and of white men generally, in South Africa. We should use what influence we have as a. Parliament in this direction. We should not allow our desires in this respect to bo set aside too easily by the suggestion that we have no right to interfere with the otherparts of the Empire. We have interfered and are responsible for the result of such intervention. If we had taken up that attitude in the past it might have been better for us. It seems to me that we ought to do what we can to support the cause of the white races in British South Africa.",31
185,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I m o v e That the item "" Travelling expenses, £400,"" b& reduced by £120.",31
186,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Why 1,31
187,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Because on inquiry as to the way in which our businessis being carried on I am led to the conclusion that we can make this reduction.,31
188,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"A very satisfactory explanation. Amendment agreed to. Reduced vote, £8,700, agreed to. Division 12 (Federal Executive Council)£2,635, agreed to. Division 13 (Administration oj Hfew Guinea)-£20,000 .",31
189,Mr KIRWAN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," Perhaps this is the best time to refer to the action of the Government concerning the Papua. (British New Guinea) Bill. So far as weknow at present, the Bill is to be abandoned because of certain amendments that were carried in it in Committee. In one of thoseamendments I was particularly interested. It had reference to the alienation of land in British New Guinea. An amendment to prevent the further alienation of land was carried by a very substantial majority. There were thirty-three votes in favour of that amendment and only nineteen against it. Six other votes were accounted for by pairs, three on each side, making fifty-eight votes out of a total house of seventy-five. Allowing for Mr Speaker and the - Chairman of Committees, neither of whom voted, there were only fifteen votes unaccounted for. I have spoken to several of those honourable members wbo did not vote, and know that some of them were in favour of the amendment for the non-ulienation of land in New Guinea. That shows that there is a clear majority of the .seventy-five members of the House who are in favour of the land of New Guinea being retained by the Crown. Under those circumstances I wish to ask the Prime Minister what the intentions of the Government may be concerning the band of New - Guinea pending the election of a new Parliament. As the opinion of this House has been very clearly expressed, I wish to ask whether, until the next Parliament is elected, and has an opportunity of expressing its views upon the subject the Prime Minister will give us an assurance that land will not be alienated ? The Government should recognise the opinions of the majority of honourable members, as so - clearly expressed, and should do nothing in opposition to those views until the new Parliament has an opportunity of expressing itself.",31
190,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"It will be within the recollection of honourable members that I have stated that I propose, before proceeding further with the Papua (British New Guinea)-Bill fco make some inquiries. I am row taking steps to that end. My object will be to inquire into several matters affecting British New Guinea upon which further information would be desirable. include in those inquiries both the question - of land alienation fco which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has referred, and the question of the liquor traffic; as to both of which I desire to obtain further facts before - comingfcoa decision. I may tell the honourable member that nothing that I am doing now will involve my pledging the responsibility - of the Government to the alienation of masses of land. I do not propose to settle that question without further consultation with Parliament.",32
191,Mr HIGGINS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,May I take it that there will be no alienation of land in the meantime 1,32
192,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I am answering the question of the honourable member for' Kalgoorlie with that object. It may be very undesirable to stay altogether any settlement in New Guinea. What I will do is this : I will take care that no large blocks are alienated-that no alienations take place except of small areas adapted for agricultural settlement, so that the soil of British New Guinea will not be permanently affected by any disposals made in the meantime, except to an infinitesimal extent.",32
193,Mr KINGSTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,On condition of settlement?,32
194,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I shall communicate with the Acting-Administrator of Britisb New Guinea to endeavour to see that any land alienated is alienated for the purpose of occupation and for the purpose of use, not for the purpose of being held up, so to say.",32
195,Mr KINGSTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Shepherded .,32
196,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Yes . I have no sympathy whatever with any landgrab alienation, but I think that in the case of settlers wanting to go to British New Guinea to obtain small areas, permission may be granted to them to select, in order that we may not cause stagnation. In the meantime, my mind will be perfectly open to be influenced by the result of the inquiries which I shall make.  able gentleman call small areas 1",32
197,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"In a place like New Guinea, something not exceeding 640 acres.",32
198,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L, I think that the statement of the Prime Minister is unsatisfactory. He states thut he will see that no large areas in British New Guinea I are alienated in the meantime. The law provides that no very large areas shall be alienated at any time.,32
199,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Oh , no it does not.",32
200,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I venture to say that the right honourable gentleman is in error.,32
201,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Ver y large blocks were alienated some time ago-larg e even accordingfcothe opinion of some people who have been running syndicates. Thafc was before British New Guinea came under the control of the Commonwealth.,32
202,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I venture to say that the action of this Parliament should put further restrictions upon the alienation of land there. This Parliament was elected by the people of Australia, and it emphatically stated that no further alienations should take place. But because the Prime Minister does not agree with the action of the majority of this House he says that he is going to hang up the Bill until he obtains further information. There has been grave, and I venture to say well-founded complaint, against government by Cabinet. Here we have a clear declaration by the representatives of the people, who are responsible to their constituents, of what they wish, and the Government take an action that is diametrically opposed to the wish of the majority. I venture to say that the action of the Government is quite unsound. The right honourable gentleman also wishes to make inquiries regarding the sale of liquor. It seems that he is ready to put on one side the wishes of the majority of the House on the point in consequence of predilections of his owu. If these matters were, in the opinion of the Prime Minister, vital to the Papua Bill, he should have said so at the time the measure was in Committee. That was the time for him to make a declaration, and not after the people, by their associations and representative men, have endorsed our action, and have forwarded petitions thanking the House for what they have done. It is not at all satisfactory that the Government should drop the Bill at this stage, and I submit respectfully that their action is unsatisfactory. I shall watch with a great deal of interest the position assumed by the right honourable gentleman when he is before the people appealing for support in his references to this particular subject.",32
203,Mr MCDONA LD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I think that this matter is very serious. The position taken up by the Government with regard to the Papua (British New Guinea) Bill is not only unsound, but is based upon a frivolous objection. The right honourable gentleman told us when he inbroduced the Bill that ib was so necessary to have it passed that it should be taken through Committee at the earliest possible moment. But because cerbain amendments were made in ib the right honourable gentleman quietly drops the measure. It had been passed Committee, and remained for a considerable time awaiting its third reading. What are the intentions of the Government 1 If the Prime Minister returns, after the general elections, with a majority at his back-and it is very problematical whether he will do so-h e will, I presume, test the feeling of the House again with regard to the nonalienation of land and the liquor traffic in British New Guinea. He is treating Parliament with contempt. Heknows that owing to the unsatisfactory state of the electoral rolls, and the position we are in with regard to the elections, no one will take any action to turn his Governmenb oub of office at the present time. He is merely relying upon that. Practically, he is insulting the wishes of the House on every possible occasion. The right honourable gentleman himself urged thab there was a great necessity for the passage of the Bill, but he has dropped it merely because two amendments were put in with which he does not agree. Who are the people who have come,to the right honourable gentleman and urged him to obtain further information 1 They are the representatives of one of the biggest firms connecbed with the trade of Britisli New Guinea-the firm that is likely to do the biggest trade there in the future. I allude to Burns, Philp and Co. They are the people who waited on the right honourable gentleman, in the form of a deputation, to urge upon him what action he should take. Because these people have' interviewed him, the desires of Parliament are practically placed on one side and its wishes are disregarded.",33
204,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The honourable member is quite under a mistake. . An y conclusion that I have come to was arrived at before any deputation waited upon me; and those upon the deputation who spoke were not the representatives of Burns, Philp and Co., but were gentlemen from New Guinea.",33
205,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We know all about how the deputation was worked up. Even suppose that certain members of it did come fiom New Guinea that is no reason why the wishes of this House should be placed on one side. If the Prime Minister made ib a vital principle of his Bill, and a vital plank in the policy of his Government, that amendments prohibiting the alienation of land and the introduction of liquor should nob be made in the Bill, be through should have informed the Committee to that effect. But the right honourable gentleman did not do so. I feel sure that had it not been for the peculiar position we are placed in owing to the coming elections, the right honourable gentleman would not have taken the course bhat he has done.",33
206,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I think that this is a very important matter. The Prime speak of. Minister admits that the two great reforms which have been carried with reference Britisli New Guinea-namely , land reform and liquor reform-hav e induced him to drop the Papua Bill. Those reforms were carried by very substantial majorities. amendment in favour of the non-alienation of the land was carried by thirty-three votes to nineteen. The Prime Minister, however, has abandoned the Bill, and has given a pledge that he will suspend all matters cerning the alienation of land until ceives reports in answer to his inquiries. So far as the liquor traffic also is concerned, the granting of any further licences is a matter of interest to a majority of honorfuller able members ",34
207,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I undertake to say that I shall recommend that no further licences be issued pending the settlement that question.,34
208,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"It is an important mission from the right honourable gentleman that he will recommend that no further licences shall be granted pending the settleland ment of the question. Could be the same course with regard to the alienation of land ? The arguments used by the right honourable gentleman today were arguments he used when we were considertheir ing the Bill, and the answer given then the answer given now, that we know there after are speculators in the field, and that appliand cations haye been made for an enormous area of land in New Guinea. Hundreds of thousands of acres are in process of tion,' and applications have been made for dangerous, but unwarranted. enormous leases.",34
209,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Nothin g of the to kind is being done, or is likely to be Senate done.  up there is in liquidation at the present time.",34
210,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"They have 200,000 acres of land which they are unable to rid of.",34
211,Mr AVILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The danger is that if the Prime Minister does not stay his hand in this matter some persons may be given opportunity of "" peacocking"" the Terriber tory.",34
212,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,There is no depossession mand for land.,34
213,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,There may be a demand for some small agricultural areas. 10 N,34
214,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,There is none to,34
215,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"If there is no demand for to land, it should only be more easy for the right honourable gentleman to carry out the wish of honourable members of this House and prevent any further alienation of land The in New Guinea until Parliament has an opportunity to again consider the matter. It is clear that honourable members of this House believe that land and liquor reform should be tested in this Territory, where the conconditions are almost primeval. I hope that he rethe Prime Minister will adopt the same course in connection with land alienation in New Guinea that he is prepared to adopt with respect to the liquor traffic there, until the information which is desired can be obtained for the benefit of honourable members in the new Parliament, which must meet within four or five months from today. of The right honourable gentleman has dropped the Bill in opposition to a powerful expresadsion of opinion by members of this House on the question of land reform, and he ought to prevent any further alienation of in New Guinea until the matter has not adopt been again considered.",34
216,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I join in the protest against the action of the the Government in this matter. In my view action is exceedingly unsatisfactory. is This House arrived at a certain decision careful consideration of the two courses, so far as we can judge, the decision to which we came is backed up by public opinion. I believe the course proposed to be alienaadopted by the Government is not only I hope they will reconsider their decision, and endeavour secure the passage of the Bill through the in its present form. If it is subsequently found to be an impracticable measure, there will be time enough to come back to Parliament for a i econsideration of the subject. The action of the Government in the matter in flouting the decision of a get majority of the members of this House is altogether unwarranted.  the advice of so staunch a supporter of the the Barton Government as the honourable memfor Melbourne Ports will be taken into consideration. From knowledge in my I am able to say that the Primo Minister may safely give an assurance that he will alienate no more land. Several companies possess land in New Guinea, and I know of one or two who are very anxious to get rid of the land they hold. They must continue to hold it under the terms of their agreement. There is not very much in the Prime Minister's assurance with respect to the liquor traffic, that no more licences will be issued. Fi'om what I know of New Guinea, Burns, Philp, and Company have the whole of the liquor traffic in their own hands.",34
217,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I did that, but would the honourable member desire me to say that no more licences should be issued because Burns, Philp, and Company have control of the traffic 1  House has said that liquor should be prohibited in New Guinea, and as a good democrat I bow to the will of the majority. I voted with the Government on that question because I know that a drop of grog has saved the lives of many men in the Territory. If settlers there are to be forbidden the use of a drop of whisky, brandy or rum, many of them may be driven to commit suicide. I point out that the assurance of the Prime Minister that no more licences for the sale of liquor will be granted goes for nothing wben it is remembered that one firm has control of the whole of the liquor traffic in the Territory. If the trade warranted it I have no doubt that other firms would have cut into it long ago. No doubt some did cut in and failed, and they have left the field to Burns, Philp and Company. In connection with the administration of New Guinea I saw it stated in a newspaper a few days ago that the Prime Minister had some idea of arranging for mail communication with New Guinea, and I should like to know if there is any truth in that statement. The establishment of steam communication with New Guinea would be one of the best ways of settling the Territory. Many people from Queensland would go there, and particularly from the portion of Queensland I represent, if there were ready means of communication provided. I hope the statement to which I have referred is true, because a few thousands spent in improving the means of communication between the mainland New Guinea would be money well spent.",35
218,Mr GLYNN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I with other honourable members in expressing regret thafcfcheMinistry have not been guided the decision of a considerable majority this House as to the non-alienation of land in New Guinea. If the Bill had been considered by the Senate, and honourable senators had taken a different view, I could understand the desirability of our waiting for some little time in expectation'of both Houses coming fco some agreement upon points in difference. But the Bill has not been gone on with in the Senate, and it is an extraordinary course for the Ministry to take on their own responsibility, to absolutely nullify the effective voice of this not know House. The Prime Minister has said that there will be no alienation of land in larger areas than 640 acres ; but I do not think this a sufficient assurance for honourable members. The evil of alienation is being continued, and there is nothing to prevent a man securing any area of land by dummying. I think there should be some conditional grant system instituted until the next Parliament deals with the question. There should be some provision, for instance, that any grant in fee-simple should be subject to the legislation that may be passed next year, . so that, if the principle of alienation is destroyed, there will be a right of resumption given in respect of any land alienated in the meantime. There should certainly be some provision against dummying. There is nothing to prevent a man getting -640 acres, and inducing fifty other persons to do the same thing. What is to prevent him purchasing from those persons subsequently? If there is to be no provision against that kind of thing the promise of the Prime Minister, that there will be.no alienation of land to any one person of an area greater than 640 acres, amounts to nothing. We know that, in the past, dummying has often frustrated the best intentions of land reform. Stringent provisions have been incorporated in the Land Acts of the States to prevent it, and unless we have something more than a mere promise that there will be no alienation in areas greater than 640 acres, I am afraid that, by the time the Papua (New Guinea) Bill is passed, a very large area of the best agricultural land will have been finally disposed of in fee simple.",35
219,Mr KIRWAN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," The reply and of the Prime Minister to the questions which I put to him is very disappointing indeed. The principle of non-alienation of join Crown lands in New Guinea is not the only principle involved. We have also to consider whether the voice of the majority in in this House, formally expressed by reso lution, is not to be given effect to. The Prime Minister has stated that no land will be alienated except in very small areas, but, when speaking before, I explained that the amendment to which I referred had been carried by a majority of thirty-three to nineteen, with six pairs, and that number of honourable members, counting also the Chairman of Committees and the Speaker, accounts for sixty votes, so thab there was a majority of fourteen votes in a House of six by. I am aware that several honourable members who did nob vote were strongly in favour of the principle of my amendment upon clause 19. That clause providedThe Lieutenant-Governor may make and execute, under the Public Seal of the Territory, in the name and on behalf of the King, grants and dispositionsofany hind within the Territory may be lawfully granted or disposed of in the name of the King. This addition to the clause was agreed to by the majority I have mentionedProvided that no grant of Crown land shall be made for uny freehold estate. That clearly expressed the wish majority of honourable members, and I am sorry to learn that ib is the intention of the Prime Minister to act contrary to that expressed wish. ' A further amendment was carried, of a character that would prevent any possibility of the land of New Guinea, that might be temporarily acquired, being locked up from use. It was to this effectThe rent of any leasehold land shall praised on the unimproved value, and the amount of such rental shall be subject to periodical revaluation to be fixed by Ordinance. Pending the expression of the wish of the new Parliament upon this question, the least that the Prime Minister can do, oub respect to the wish of the majority of honorwho, able members of this House, is tu refuse alienate or dispose of any land except, way in which honourable members consider it ought to be disposed of. It is not at present necessary that any honourable member should enter upon the merits of the question-. House has expressed its views by an overwhelming majority, and the least the Governthere ment can do is to adopt the course recomWilliam mended by the House.",35
220,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Robertson) I have been surprised to hear the honorpean able and learned member for South Auswith tralia, Mr Glynn, and the honourable the member for Kalgoorlie, objecting stand which the Government have taken. It seems to me very proper that the 10 Jf 2 Government should not regard the views expressed by this House as being the final views of Parliament upon this measure. They have gone, I think, as far as honourable members of this House could expect them to go in limiting to a square mile the area to be alienated to any one person. That, I tliink, is a very great concession indeed to the wish of the majority in this House. The final decision of Parliament has not been given upon this measure, and, until it has, blie Government are justified in taking the stand tliey have taken. There is no cause for complaint at this stage, when ib is remembered bhat the Bill will again be brought before Parliament when we have fuller information upon the subjects wibh which it deals. When the which Bill was being discussed we were not in possession of full information. When the fuller information desired is secured, and the final decision of Parliament is expressed upon the measure, the Government must act upon that decision. But, up to the present time, the decision of Parliament upon of the this Bill has not been given.",36
221,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," It is interesting to hear from the honourable member for Robertson that the decision of this House is not the decision of Parliament. We all admit that to be true; but the Government, who are in charge of the business of, practically, both Houses, haye it in their power to pass this measure and forward it be apto another place. Supposing the Government declined to pass the Estimates on to the Senabe, would the honourable member for Robertson say that we had arrived at no conclusion ? I venture to say that there is not a single honourable member who has read of half the reports of Sir William MCGregor, when Queensland was supervising that to part of our berribory, dealt with nearly in the every phase of the question. .",36
222,Mr HENKY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But it is not shown on what conditions the land is leased. There This may be the right of purchase.,36
223,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The reports show that is leasing as well as sale. But Sir MCGregor, rightly or wrongly, was in favour of alienating large portions of the territory, desiring to give facilities to Eurosyndicates to develop the country native labour. That, however, is not desire of the great majority of honourable to the members of bhis House.",36
224,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I have given my guarantee against anything of that sort.,36
225,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I quite think that the Prime Minister does not agree with a policy of alienation ; but if we accept the reports to which I have alluded we shall be bound to clo that in which this Parliament does not believe. Notwithstanding that various Governors and Lieutenant-Governors of New Guinea have advocated the alienation of land to syndicates and private persons, this House, with its eyes open and by an absolute majority, declared against such a policy.",37
226,Mr HENKY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But we should like companies. to know the conditions of the leases.,37
227,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Le t there be as much light as possible thrown on the question. The Government have nothing to offer in support of their action, exceptthat they introduced a measure before they were possessed of sufficient information to enable them to lay all the facts before the House. The Government are now asking for time.",37
228,Mr HENKY WILLIS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The Government are granting almost everything which the honourable member asks.,37
229,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I do not deny that the Government are granting something; but they are granting it on lines which tend to the destruction of government by representative Ministers, and to the substitution of Cabinet government. If ' the Cabinet cannot flout the House by threatening to resign, they can lay this important measure on one side, and carry on the administration in a manner adverse to the wishes of the majority of honourable members ; and that is not sound government. As the honourable member for Kennedy has said, the Government practically have the House at their mercy, and honourable members can do nothing but wait. But it is only fair that the country should know the reason that this Bill has been laid aside. What about the great temperance bod ies-thoseabl e and intelligent electors who have been complimenting the Government and honourable members on the proposal which they thought there would be no difficulty in carrying into effect? Although only New Guinea is affected, the principles at stake are so important that all the facts should be clearly laid before the electors at the general election. What has to be decided is whether there shall or shall not be any sale of liquor or any alienation of land in the territory, and these questions should be decided by the electors. I appeal to the Prime Minister, who will probably issue a Government manifesto to the electors, to put this matter in such a way that there shall be no mistaking the issue.",37
230,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," This is a question of great importance, which the Senate ought to have an opportunity of considering. In many of the States the law is that only a certain area of land shall be granted to one individual; but we know that, as a matter of fact, owing to a vast system of dummying, hundreds of thousands of acres have, in cases, been handed over to",37
231,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"In order to prevent any misapprehension, it is just as well that I should inform the House what course it is intended to pursue. I propose to send to New Guinea some properly-qualified person to make the inquiries which I have previously indicated. To assist him there will be appointed the Chief Justice, who is now the Acting Administrator, and a magistrate of experience in New Guinea. I shall not attempt to influence the inquiry in any way, and I shall be largely guided by the result. In themeantirae, the limitation which I have put, or which I hope to put, on the alienation, is the best course I can think of as compatible with any progress in the community, and with the desire and satisfaction of those who desire to take up land. Under the present regulations land on lease Gan be obtained ; if it could not, I should make provision in that direction. In the meantime no harm can be done, whatever system is adopted, because the 97,000 square miles of New Guinea cannot be affected by the disposal of a few acres. As regards the sale of liquor a similar course of inquiry will be adopted, and if the result be a recommendation to apply something like the Gothenburg system, of which I have read somethiug, and of which we have heard a good deal, I shall not hesitate to put it in force. If there be a recommendation by such a. commission as I shall appoint, in favour of leasing the land, that system ought, at any rate, to be tried.",37
232,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But what if the Commission report in favour of prohibition ?,37
233,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I shall give the recommendation serious consideration ; but I cannot say at once that I would agree to adopt it . In the Possession there have already been passed such completely drastic laws with regard to the prevention of the undue sale of liquor, that one is almost at a loss to see why there should be substituted prohibition, which, in case of illness, would absolutely prevent the missionaries from plying stimulants necessary to save the lives of the sick in the hospitals. W it h regard to the mails, I have already mentioned .matter to the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer, and I hope before long to arrange - for a regular service.",37
234,Mr MCDONA LD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," The Prime Minister ought to give some inment formation as to the nature of the inquiry - he proposes to have made. We desire to know what instructions the right honourable gentleman has given, considering the extraordinary attitude which the Government has assumed. If the Government consent to hold over any alienation until the New Parliament meets, the revenue cannot suffer a loss of more than £ 1 0 0 or £200, seeing that last year only £694 was obtained from the sale and lease of land.",38
235,Sir EDMUND BAIITOJJ,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I . may mention that the last Government of New Guinea, in discussing the question with me a long - time ago, expressed the opinion that if the system were changed from alienation to leasing, it would put a stop entirely to agriGuinea, cultural settlement in New Guinea. was an opinion formed from experience.",38
236,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The same argument was advanced in regard to the laud of tralia in our early history.,38
237,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The only difference is that the opinion I have quoted came from one who knew.,38
238,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"That is quite posyear, sible. But is there finer land in any part of Australia than can be found on Darling Downs 1 Yet hundreds of thousands of acres of that land were sold at practically 2s. 6d. per acre, and are now being bought - back by the Government at prices ranging from £ 3 to £ 7 an acre. In my own time certain land in New South Wales was said to be totally unfitted for agricultural purwith the Bill. poses ; and yet, on that land at the present time one may travel for days through - upon which agriculture of every description is carried on. If New Guinea can be settled only by alienating the lands, we may come to the conclusion that a few peopleGothenberg w i ll monopolise a large portion of the Territory. The Government, after taking that the extraordinary 3tep ""of dropping measure, when a certain amendment had been submitted, ought to give an assurance that during the three or four months between now and the meeting of the new berg system. Parliament no more land will be alienated. supI f the Government are prepared to allow areas up to 640 acres to be alienated during that time, what will be the result ? It is the not probable that between now and the meeting of the new Parliament the opinion of the House in this connection will change very materially. The probability is that if the Bill be re-introduced a similar amend will be submitted ; and speculators, knowing that, will rush in and secure the land before the measure becomes law. The honourable member for Melbourne may laugh.",38
239,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHABN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I did not laugh ; I merely shook my head.,38
240,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The honourable member knows that there was plenty of land in Australia in much the same position as that of the New Guinea lands today. There is another feature of the question which has to be considered. On various gold-fields in Queensland the mining industry has been seriously hampered, owing to the fact that large areas known to be gold-bearing cannot be worked, simply because of the alienation of the land. We do not yet know the capabilities of New and it is quite possible that alienThat ated lands may be found to contain valuable metals. Then, in regard to the drink traffic, if the Government hold their hand between Ausnow and the next Parliament, the revenue cannot be effected to any large extent. Last year only £114 was collected in connection with the traffic, and considering that the Government intend to introduce a Bill next it is reasonable to suppose that only a small portion of that amount would be lost. Therefore the course suggested would not affect the finances of New Guinea to any large extent - The Prime Minister has practically told us that in the event of the Commission which is to be appointed reporting adversely to the ideas of the Government he will consider whether he will go on",38
241,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I did not say that, farms or anything like it .",38
242,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The right honourable gentleman told us, by an interjection, that if the Commission reported in favour of the system the Government would favourably consider its recommendations, but if it reported in favour of prohibition the the position would be regarded as serious. Sir n EDMUND BABTON - My statement meant that I shall be slower to favour prohibition than the adoption of the Gothen",38
243,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,No doubt the right honourable gentleman would be slow to favour prohibition-as slow as he is in proceeding with the Bill.,39
244,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The member should be slow in imputing bad motives.,39
245,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I do not attribute bad motives, but I say that the manner in which the Government have treated the Bill is a deliberate insult to honourable members. Although it was carried by a large majority, the Government have thrown it on one side, and now we are told that if certain amendments had not been made it would have been proceeded with, although the information which the Prime Minister says he desires is not available. He has not told us the nature of the proposed inquiry. In iny opinion, we have been shamefully treated, and those who desire that the dignity and the honour of the House shall be maintained, should make the strongest protest against the action of the Government. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I gather from the speech of the honourable meinber for Kennedy that he blames the Government because, through their delay in connection with the Papua Bill, numbers of men may go to New Guinea and take - up large areas of land there, between now and the making of the inquiry which is promised. I think that I can show him that his fears are groundless. I am one of those unfortunate individuals who are connected with the Hall Sound Company. Although we have spent a considerable amount of money upon the laud which we have acquired in New G uinea, the company is at present in liquidation. We have land there which we should be only too pleased to let people have at even more reasonable rates than the Government are asking.",39
246,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Will them have it at the rates which they paid for it,39
247,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Eo r found to be ill . less than those rates, and be glad to get rid of it: If the honourable member thinks that other men will be as big fools as we were, he is mistaken.",39
248,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Then why object ? Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN . , - I do not think that the matter is of great portance, but the Government certainly have the right to make inquiries before theyfinally commit themselves, and the? trend of legislation foreshadowed by amendments carried in the Bill is such that it would be better for us not fco havehonorable the Territory, since, if that legislation is. passed, we shall have to spend £20,000 a year upon it with the certainty'of getting no development, because there, is no likelihood of any land being acquired under it . We do not know yet what promises have been given in regard to the mission stationsin New Guinea. Ifc has hitherto been thecustom to grant the mission authorities small areas of land upon which to build their mission houses. Are we going to put an end to that in New Guinea, and require that the houses shall be built on leased land? In my opinion such an arrangement would be an extremely unfair one. I think that the Government are taking the right step.",39
249,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," To my mind the position of the Prime Minister' is inexplicable. He tells us that he is going to appoint a Commission, and that if it reports in one way he will act, while if it reports in another way he will merely "" consider."" I would point out to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that the amendment carried in Committee in regard to the liquor traffic in New Guinea was not a "" 66 Bourke street affair,"" but was carried by a largemajority. I am sure that honourable members do not wish to attempt to do anything impracticable.",39
250,Mr VL SOLOMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We might as well try to regulate the tides in New Guinea, as attempt to prohibit the importation of liquor there.",39
251,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Surely honourable members who voted for the amendment have as much judgment as the honourable member.,39
252,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But we cannot changehuman nature by passing amendments.,39
253,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I have no desire toprohibit the importation of spirits for medithe company let cinal purposes.,39
254,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"If that isallowed, every white man there will soon be",39
255,Mr MAUGER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,All I desire is to prevent liquor from being given to the natives;.,39
256,Mr MCCAY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," When during the last week or two I have seen paragraphs in the newspapcl-s to the effect that the Government propose to drop the Papua Bill, imI have regarded them as probable instances of the misrepresentation about which wet I have heard complaints in this Chamber of late. I recognise the right of every Government to act as it chooses in regard to important legislation of which it has charge, and, ;if necessary, to drop it if amendments of which it does not approve are carried. That was the course they took the other day in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. But they accepted without demur the amendments carried against them in the Papua Bill, and allowed the Bil l to be reported from Committee. I was under - the impression that the third reading was not proceeded with, merely because of the - ordinary causes which create delay. I do not know that at the time the amendments were carried the Government had any intention to drop the Bill. There was a great - deal of discussion last week as to whether ""the Government gave fair notice to honourable members as to what would happen if the - amendment proposed in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and afterwards agreed to, were carried. Personally, I foresaw the probable fate of the Bill if the amendments were carried, and I consider that I had ample warning of the intentions of the Government regarding it . But it is one thing to treat honourable members as they were treated in regard to this Bill, and another thing to treat them as they have been treated in regard to the Papua Bill. The' .argument of the Prime Minister in regard to the land alienation question is one which may be applied against him. He says that no harm can be done by not carrying into' law the anti-alienation provisions in the Bill, because no alienation is going on. But the fact is an equally good reason for enacting those provisions, because they can do no harm if no alienation is taking place. W it h - regard to the inquiries of the Commission, whose recommendations are to be adopted if the Prime Minister likes them, and to Toe "" considered "" if he does not, surely it is more proper that the House should decide upon such an important question than that it should be left to the Prime Minister. It may be asked- "" Why do not those who disapprove ol the action of the Ministry in this matter take steps to make them feel their responsibility?"" I do not believe in - cutting off a man's head to cure the toothache. The Papua Bill is not one of those measures in which the fate of a Ministry is usually involved, and under the circumstances we .are practically helpless. I regret that the Ministry have taken a course which is opposed to the principles of responsible government. If the Government had told the Committee that if the amendments to which they objected were carried they would not proceed with the Bill, they would have been justified in the course which they have since taken. But it was not proper or courteous to allow the amendments to be carried, and then, when no one was looking, to take the Bill out of the back-door and drop it on the dust heap. Such an action is not calculated to endear any Government even to its well-wishers.",39
257,Mr SPENCE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," The situation in regard to the Papua Bill is, to say the least of it , a very peculiar one. It must be assumed that the Government before framing the Bill had before them all the information available regarding the situation of affairs in Papua, and, therefore, I fail to see what more information they wish to ask for. We have not been told what information they seek to get. The Bill having been altered in Committee, the Government hung it up upon the excuse that they desire further information. What information do they desire? There has not been much said in regard to the liquor question, and I do not know what information they can get in regard to it . We are told that prohibition exists already so far as the natives are concerned, and we are perfectly capable of judging as to the effects of extending that principle to the white population. Therefore no Commission could afford us any additional information. It seems extraordinary also to send to Papua for special information with regard to the adaptability of the selling or leasing system to the lands of the Possession. Only a few white people live in Papua, but perhaps the Government intend to ascertain the views of the natives as to the respective merits offcheselling and leasing systems. It is just possible that they may know of some system better than any within our knowledge, despite our boasted civilization. The Government are perfectly entitled to drop a Bill if they do not approve of some of the principles insisted upon by honourable members; but, at the same time, we are justified in asking for information regarding the system of administration to be followed in the absence of legislation on the subject. The Bill would have given the people of New Guinea a Constitution which would have enabled them fco manage their own affairs to a very large extent; but now the sole control will rest in the hands of the Prime Minister. The right honourable gentleman has indicated that he is prepared to alienate land, and if he does so he will act in direct opposition to the wish expressed by a majority of honourable members. He has not even told us whether he will administer the affairs of the Territory under the regulations or ordinances already in force, or according to his own sweet will. We are entitled to a distinct assurance that it is not intended to alienate any land in the Possession. Attempts have previously been made to obtain control of large areas, aud, although I have, no doubt that the Prime Minister will exercise great care, I think he should make his intentions clear. We should also be informed whether the administration is to carried on in Papua, or whether the Prime Minister will exercise sole control over the land. Honourable members have every reason to be dissatisfied with the statement which has been made. I should not complain of delay if we could rest assured that nothing would be done contrary to the expressed wishes of honourable members.",40
258,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I have already stated that no larger area than 640 acres will be .alienated, and that the land administration will be carried on under existing ordinances.",41
259,Mr SPENCE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"If there should be a rush for land, and each applicant were granted 640 acres, the whole of the area available for settlement would soon be absorbed.",41
260,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I shall take every care to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth in that respect.,41
261,Mr SPENCE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"In spite of all that has been said to the contrary, we are justified in assuming that a country which is capable of supporting such a large native population embraces a large area of valuable land. A great deal of land has been practically given away in the past, but when better means of communication are provided a sudden rush may take place, and the Minister may be called upon to discharge a very heavy responsibility. Honourable members are entitled to a clear and definite statement as to the Minister's intentions.",41
262,Mr VL SOLOMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"South Australia). - When the Bill was under discussion, I spoke at some length with regard to the absurdity of prohibiting the sale of liquor, and of declining to sell land in Papua. I am glad that the Prime Minister had the good sense to seek for further information, with regard to both matters, before proceedingfurther with the Bill. If honourable members imagine that when a Bill has been read a second time it virtually becomes law, they make a great mistake. The third readingof the Papua Bill has not yet been passed.. If honourable members think that the Government have acted in an unconstitutional or improper manner in holding back, the measure, they have a remedy ready to their hands. Surely the other branch of the Legislature, whose special function it is to protect the States rights, will havesomething to say with regard to proposals which would have the effect of absolutely putting a stop to settlement. It is all very well for honourable members who have had little or no experience of tropical countries, and of the difficulties of settlement in. such countries, to pass experimental legislation. If honourable members knew of the difficulties of settlement in tropical countries arising from their distance from the markets, and other circumstances, they would hesitate to agree to such stringent, provisions as those now contained in thePapua Bill. We are aware of the difficultiesexperienced in connection with the settlement of the Northern Territory of South Australia and of Northern Queensland. Is the land in Papua so much richer than thatto be found in those portions of the continent, because it lies sixty or seventy miles distant from our coast ? Distant fields were ever thegreenest. Many men have gone from; the Northern Territory to New Guinea, and very few have returned. The majority of those who came back died soon afterwards, owing to the mischief which malarial feverhad worked upon them.",41
263,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Was it not the same in the early days of Northern Queensland t,41
264,Mr VL SOLOMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Not to anythinglike the same extent as in the case of Papua ; otherwise that Territory, which I believe to be rich in gold and other minerals, would have been settled years ago. Ample opportunities have been afforded to take up land in the Possession, and yet the whole of the revenue from land and everything else last year amounted to only £ 6 0 0 or £700. What a wonderful rush there must have been for land which, during the last twenty years, might have been obtained for a m'ere song ?",41
265,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,How much land is available?,41
266,Mr VL SOLOMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We know there are over 90,000 square miles in Papua. Tliere is also a very large area of land open ior settlement in Dutch New Guinea. The Queensland Government would have welcomed settlement in Papua. I am familiar with the conditions, very similar to those prevailing in New Guinea, under which Melville. Island was settled in the first instance, and I know also of the difficulties whioh were experienced in establishing the first settlement at Port Essinprton. At the present time those who desire to take up land can pick and choose for themselves in - the Northern Territory, which has a climate very similar to that of Papua. The annual - rainfall there amounts to fifty or sixty inches, which is ample for the purpose of agriculture, .and there are plenty of magnificent blocks of land along the rivers fit for almost any purpose, although they are somewhat distant from the markets. That land can be taken up without survey for ls. 3d. per acre, five years being allowed for completion of . the purchase. Yet, notwithstanding these liberal conditions, not one pound's worth .of land has been sold there during the last ten years. Papua reeks with tropical diseases, - and it is far distant from the 'ordinary markets; and if it is decreed that the land there shall not be alienated, and that the liquor traffic shall be prohibited, we cannot .Tiope that settlement will progress. Is it not sufficient to prohibit the liquor traffic with the natives, as in the case of the Northern Territory, or do teetotal faddists desire to make an experiment? If the Billwere passed in its present form, it would perpetuate the liability of the States to contribute towards the cost of administration. Liquor would be introduced to the island in spite of all prohibitory laws, and that which reached there would probably be of the vilest description.",42
267,Mr SALMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,That argument is always used by those who believe in legalizing - vice. Mr V. L . SOLOMON - Does not the honourable member believe in regulating the liquor traffic? Does he suppose for a moment that if prohibition were applied to the city of Melbourne it would have the - effect of putting a stop to the drink traffic ?,42
268,Mr SALMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We have a chance of doing - so in New Guinea.,42
269,Mr VL SOLOMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"There are no people in New Guinea to drink, except the .natives and the Dutchmen.",42
270,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Why , then, does the honourable member object to prohibition ?",42
271,Mr VL SOLOMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Because ' i "" object to saddling the people of Australia with a perpetual liabilty of £20,000 a year. I object to farcical and experimental provisions of this character, which can exercise no good effect in regard to the settlement of New Guinea, and which must react upon the taxpayers of Australia.",42
272,Mr KINGSTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Would the honourable member introduce the liquor traffic amongst the blacks ?,42
273,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The blacks are not drinking intoxicating liquor.,42
274,Mr VL SOLOMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Does not the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, know that the experience of every newly discovered mineral field is that, so long as licences are refused, every second tent is a sly-grog shop, in which the very worse of grog is sold ? But when once licences are granted under proper supervision, the people become more sober, and certainly their health becomes very much improved. That is really the position.",42
275,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I will take the honourable member upon a 200 or 500 miles ride, and let him see for himself.",42
276,Mr VL SOLOMON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I think that during the fifteen years in which I knocked about the northern part of Australia. I did quite as much riding as the honourable member has done. I have ridden and walked a good many hundreds of miles. I merely rise to suggest that in view of the insertion in the Bill of these two absurd provisions the Government are perfectly right in staying their hands for a little time with a view to making further inquiries. If the Ministry desired to wreck the measure, I would recommend them to adopt one course only. I would advise them to put it through its third reading with these and as many more absurd provisions included in it. as the various sections of this House who are possessed of particular fads chose to insert. Then it should be sent up to the Senate, with a view to see if that branch of the Legislature would pass it with the penalty of £20,000 a year attached to it .",42
277,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," Whils t I should have preferred the Prime Minister to give the House an assurance that, pending the reconsideration of this matter by a new Parliament, no absolute alienation of land would be permitted in New Guinea, I can scarcely blame the Ministry for dropping the Papua Bill, seeing that it contains an absolutely impracticable provision, one which if it could be carried out, would inflict the grossest injustice upon the worthiest class in any new country-the pioneers. In a new territory like New Guinea it is nothing short of an outrage to prevent a man from having access to that which many find to be a preventive against disease. If there were nothing else",42
278,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Then why do we enact a law which will allow people to take any poison they choose?,43
279,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I do not intend to follow the honourable member along all the by-paths over which he is disposed to roam. Whenever I find a man who is possessed by a fad - whethe r it be that of temperance or anything else,43
280,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,O r whisky ?,43
281,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I am prepared to defend a certain amount of indulgence in whisky. I object to any person who allows his intemperance upon the matter of temperance to run aVay with his discretion. I do not blame the Government for having dropped a Bill which contained a provision of that kind. I hold that it would not work satisfactorily in any new country. In this connection I could quote the testimony of a man who has lived for many years in New Guinea- I think he is a clergyman-whos e remarks recently appeared in the Melboune press. In that interview he pointed out that there had been no abuse of liquor whatever in New Guinea, and that it had never been accessible to 'the natives. He declared that no damage had been done; and that, so far as he could judge, there was no justification whatever for this attempted prohibition. Had I thought that this matter would have been raised again during the present session, I should have kept the extract; but any honourable member who cares to look up the files of the Age newspaper during the past three or four weeks will find the interview to which I refer. That is all that I care to say in regard to the action of the Government. A few days ago I noticed in the press a statement to the effect that the magistrates of New Guinea, who are Imperial officers, are indisposed to continue in their present positions, and to come under the Commonwealth, fearing that by so doing they may lose their rights to Imperial promotion and pensions.",43
282,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"It is not a facb that there were any rights to Imperial pensions in New Guinea, so that they cannot have been actuated by that consideration. One officer asked me for a pension, and I referred him to the Imperial Government.",43
283,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"At any rate they are at present Imperial officers, and as such would be open to promotion. If they are not prepared to come under the Commonwealth, I should be the last to force them to do so. I not believe that in Australia we have bushmen who are quite capable of performing the duties of magistrates in New Guinea-no t one, but hundreds of them-me n who arewell fitted for the work, who understand thenative races, and who are well qualified to withstand the climate and administer thelaw. Consequently, I hope the Government. ' will not hesitate to accept the resignationsof these gentlemen, and to appoint othersfrom Australia in their stead.",43
284,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," The remarks of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V . L . Solomon, would have been fittinghad the third reading of the Papna Bill been under consideration. However, we are notdealing with that question. The members of the Committee have merely asked the Prime Minister for an assurance that the decision of this Chamber, that the sale of intoxicating liquor in New Guinea shall be prohibited, and that the lands of the Territory shall not be alienated, will be respected. We simply ask that, until, the new Parliament has had an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon the matter, and until, according to the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V . L . Solomon, all the faddists have been removed from this Chamber, there shall be no alienation of land and no deluge of liquor in New Guinea.",43
285,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Upon what authority does the honourable member say that there ever was a deluge of liquor in Now Guinea?,43
286,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"All the arguments which have been advanced by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V . L . Solomon, were presented during the discussion upon this Bill.",43
287,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Has the honourable member ever seen any intimation, either in official papers or in the press, that there is an undue consumption of liquor amongst the natives of New Guinea ?",43
288,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I do not intend to beside tracked on this matter. Its various phases""were discussed during the passage of Bill through Committee, and, by a majority - of fourteen in a House of sixty members, - affirmed that there should be no further alienaspeak. tion of Crown lands. If the Prime Minisber ter thought that that decision represented - only a catch vote he had an opportunity reversing it . He has made no attempt in that direction. Apparently he has the temper of the Senate to be similar that of this House. Of course I am aware that there is a way in which - effectively protest against the action of the Government in abandoning the measure. The - remedy would be to move an amendment to reduce this item of £20,000 by £ 2 . If such an. amendment were submitted, and those who believed in the non-alienation of land, and the prohibition of the sale of intoxicants, - voted in favour of it , it would be carried. But the adoption of that amendment would mean the defeat of the Government, and we - are not prepared for that. Honourable bers, therefore, are really manacled.",43
289,Mr MAUGEK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Do not forget that the leaders on the other side of the House fought just as hard against the proposal - did the Government.,44
290,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Upon every conceivable - occasion we are met in that way. Personthe ally I am prepared to vote for a reduction - of the item. I am annoyed that the Governof ment have abandoned the Bill, and so - others. Even the honourable and learned meinber for Corinella, who, for two and - a-half years has given the Government an Papua. unqualified support, has condemned their - action in throwing the measure aside. Prime Minister has declared that rush for land in New Guinea. But those who desire to traffic in land are now aware - of the temper of this House, and, anticiand pating that a similar opinion will be held thenextParliament, they will naturallysay"" Now is our opportunity to rush the settleheres ment andfcoacquire territory."" For that reason I ask the Prime Minister to stay his hand. He will find that in the Territory - even his idea of agricultural areas-h did not say whether with or without occupaby tion",44
291,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I explicitly said "" with occupation,"" and that more than - once.",44
292,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I should not have used the expression had I heard that statement. I have now received from the Prime Minister two important admissions. the Sir EDMUND BARTON - That is not an admission, because I made the statement we twice before the honourable - member rose to The fact is.fcliafcthe honourable memhas got nothing in the way of admissions.",44
293,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I do not think that the of people of Australia have obtained anything.,44

295,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Surely the right honourable gentleman does not consider that I am so foolish as to believe that this admission has been made as a personal compliment to myself ?,44
296,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,There appears to be something of which the honourable member's mind ought to be disabused.,44
297,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,l a m simply speaking from memthe stand-point of the Committee.,44
298,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Then we agree.,44
299,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Why should not the Prime Minister go further and say that he as will not allow any of the lands of Papua to be alienated until the House has had a further opportunity to declare its mind on subject? I do not intend to canvass this matter, bnt you know, Mr Chairman, the old game of peacocking that was are played in New South Wales. The eyes of the country were picked out by speculators, and that is what we fear will be done in",44
300,Sir EDMUND BARTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"If the honourable The member knew anything about Papua, he there is no would have no such fear.",44
301,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"No vested interests of any moment have to be overcome in Papua, it seems to me that there is an opporby tunity for land speculators there. I fai2 to understand why the Prime Minister adso firmly fco the stand which he has taken. It would be very easy for him to say- "" We have abandoned the Papua Bill ; we think the new Parliament will express e an opinion different from that expressed this House in regard to these matters, but pending the election of the new Parliament we.will grant the request of the Gommittee."" I have no desire to move that the item be reduced. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who. was instrumental in bringing about the more important reform in relation to New Guinea lands, is entitled to do so.",44
302,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,What position does the honourable member desire to bring about by such a-reduction ?,45
303,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The right honourable gentleman knows,45
304,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We know where ville the honourable member sits, and the views he generally expresses. What consequence does he wish to bring about?",45
305,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I have no desire to bring about anything,45
306,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We know what the honourable member wishes to do. He has let the cat out of the bag.""",45
307,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We have seen the honourable member play the same game in the State Parliament.,45
308,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"If a game is to be played reports. in regard to the proposed land and liquor reforms in Papua, it will be played the expense of the people. The honourable rivers. member for Melbourne Ports is a staunch supporter of the Government ; but, in of their action in seeking to disregard the ment t reform in the liquor traffic of Papua, for which we have declared, he would be compelled to vote for the reduction this item by the sum of £ 2 . The portion of theTerritory has yet been acquired Ministry are simply flouting the decision from them. of the House. Are we prepared to allow Cabinets to override such expressions of ' opinion. I am ""of the opinion posed liquor reform movement is a right one. The House has said that there shall be prohibition in Papua, and has also declared against the alienation of the lands of that Territory. All that is asked the decision of the Parliament the Government shall hold in abeyance dation or ordinance made by the local authorities in regard to the alienation Papuan lands.",45
309,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I do not think it would be wise to allow the ments repeatedly made by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V . L Solomon, with regard to' the tropical tions of Queensland, to go uncontradicted. The honourable member never makes a speech without attacking those who believe that white people are able to cultivate the land in that part of Australia. In disputing assertion he invariably relies upon his perience in the Northern Territory. One would think that no other person had lived the nortliern part of Australia, He is eviabundance dently one of those who would applaud the  the Chillagoe Company's meeting, that white men are simply useless in that part of Queensland. The whole of Northern Queensland has practically been developed by white labour, and the country lying north of Townsis now, perhaps, the most prosperous part 1 of Australia. All the great mining enterprises at Croydon, Charters Towers,. Ravenswood, and other places in Northern Queensland are entirely carried on by white labour, and it is absurd to suggest that white men cannot work in that climate. Queenslanders do not thank the honourable member for these repeated insinuations. The statement made by him that there are 90,000; square miles available for settlement in Papua is not in accordance with the official",45
310,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Allowanc e must at be made for mountainous country and.,45

315,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Eve n if there were 1,000any recommensquare miles available",45
316,Sir EDMUND BABTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Two hundred, of the thousand acres would be about 300 square miles.",45
317,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"But assuming that everystateavailable piece of land which has been properly acquired from the natives com. prised an area of 1,000 square miles, that, porwould not be anything like the area which the honourable member for South Australia,. Mr V . L . Solomon, declares to be available. Any enactment which would lead to the land held by the natives being seized by usour would not meet with my approval. The exsettlement of the country should be de veloped in a proper way. I for one protesti n against the suggestion that there is an of good land in Papua which would be taken - up only under the freehold sysat tem. Some sixty years ago Queensland was but very sparsely settled, and as one travels north of Brisbane he finds that settlement takes place rapidly only upon the discovery of gold. The same arguments are being used in regard to the alienation of the lands of Papua, that were used from time to time in the Queensland Parliament in reference to the lands of that State. I have heard it said by those who were interested that they would not give ls. 9d. per acre for land that is now considered to be Worth £ 2 and £ 3 per acre. Of course they would not give ls. 9d. per acre for it if they could obtain it for ls. per acre.",45
318,Mr MCDONALD,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Some of the land in the neighbourhood of Cairns is worth £ 1 5 acre..,46
319,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I am quoting the miniwould mum price. The honourable member for settlers Moreton has heard prominent politicians in Queensland declare that the Darling Downs were worth little or nothing; that they would not grow a cabbage.,46
320,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,If early settlers had not taken up the landleasehold should we have had any settlement there,46
321,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,If some one had settled on the land it would still be overAustralia. run by natives. That is no argument against the contention that we should not allow the lands of Papua to be sold for practically nothing-that we should vide againsfc the acquirement of land there by men who might or might not develop it. Does the honourable member for Melbourne will contend that those wbo originally took land in the Darling Downs developed it'(,46
322,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,If there had been no settlement in the first instance the land would not have been of any value for agriculture.,46
323,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,If the credit of the people of Queensland had not been pledged in order to raise money to make roads other improvements that land would not have acquired its present day value. The same remark applies to all parts of the monwealth.,46
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,What argument the honourable member found on that asserParliament tion 1,46
325,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"An argument against the contention raised by the honourable memwhether ber for South Australia, Mr V . L . Solomon, that unless we part wifchfchefreehold of the Papuan lands no development will take place. If in additionfcomaking a grant £20,000 per annum, the Commonwealth Government were prepared to initiate a proper public works policy in Papua, they 'would obtain an ample return for their money. Why should they be afraid 1",46
326,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Public works of whafc description 1,46
327,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The development of the harbors of the Territory, the making of roads, and if necessary, the construction of railways suitable for the country. Surely the honourable member for North Sydney will admit that in such a mountainous country there must be possibilities of which we know nothing ? It may prove to be the sanatorium of Australia. The carrying out per of our determination that the lands of Papua shall not be alienated should not and not deter settlement. The bond fide would consider the system of perpetual leasehold just as satisfactory as is the freehold system, and under it land would jusfc as readily be taken up by mining prospectors. If the land can be worked profitthose ably it will be quickly taken up under the system. The chief surveyor of 1 Papua states in his report that the land not there is better than the average land in",46
328,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Some of it is very good.,46
329,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"He asserts that great tracts of it are excellent, The development proof Papua is admittedly slow, but with the advancement of inventions relatingfcomeat preserving, dairying, and cane growing, there be ample scope for tliedevelopmen t of those up industries in this new land. My desire is that we shall not part with the freehold of large tracts of land in Papua. The Government have no right to flout the wil] of Parliament. A great principle-the principle of leasehold as against the freehold systemis at stake. The leasehold system is repugnant to many people, but that is no reason and why the Government should seek to alter the course which Parliament wishes to follow. This House has said, "" We desire the Comadoption of a certain system,"" and the Government say "" Y o u shall not have does it."" The time will come when the will have to assert itself. I have this further statement to make: I desire to know from the Prime Minister he has put his view in the form of a minute to the ofBcers whom he desires to prepare the report which he states he intends to lay before Parliament 1 Every one will of admit that it is not so much what is inquired into, as the form of the question submitted to the persons who are to make the inquiries, that is important. J wish to know what kind of questions the Prime Minister is going to submit to the omcers ? It would not be very difficult to put such questions as would almost compel the officers answering them to support the views of the questioner. I hope that the right honourable gentleman will lay upon the table the terms of the minute to be submitted to the officers. That is only a fair thing. Within a few months we shall all be before our constituents, and we should be able to explain to them fully what our views are. It is also mandatory upon the Government that they should show whafc their position is regarding this question.",46
330,Mr WILKINSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," An - interjection made by the honourable member for Melbourne just now, might lead people to think that the development of the Darling Downs, and of other parts of Queensland, had been affected by the alienation of land. I take the opposite view. I contend that settlement on those rich plains has been retarded by the alienation of land. In the first place, those who occupied lands on the Darling Downs leased them from the New South Wales Government-Queenslan d being then known as the Moreton Bay District of New South Wales. In order to keep settlers from going to those districts, it was industriously stated that it was of no use for a small man fco try to make a living there. The Darling Downs, which has now become the garden of Australia, was described as a place where it was impossible to grow a cabbage. But we had an example of what that country can produce the other day in the form of the produce exhibited afc the Victorian Royal Agricultural Show. What bas been the result of the alienation of land there? When the Queensland Government wanted to cut up the large properties that were held in pastoral leases, and passed an Act-calculated to have the effect of cutting them up, and' of settling yeomanry on the land, there was wholesale dummying, as a result of which the large estates were still held together. The consequence of sucli aggregations of land is seen in Yictoria as well as in Queensland. What is being done today 1 The Governments of those States are purchasing large estates for the purpose of settling the population and making the railways pay. The problem that is before the Railways Commissioners in Victoria, and in all the other States, is to make the railways pay. That can only be done by settling the people on the laud, so that they may have produce to send over the lines. Land that was dummied in some instances at 2s. 6d. an acre is now being purchased by the Governments of the States at £ 4 or £ 5 per acre. My memory carries me back to the early days of settlement in Queensland, before separation from New South Wales, and I am able to speak wibh a certain amount of knowledge. I repeat that the problem that now faces the States, particularly in connection with their railways, has been rendered acute by the alienation of land which has not always been acquired honestly. I do not knowfchafcwe can expect that a different state of things will obtain in New Guinea than has obtained in the States, if we adhere to the old policy. This House, by a wise decision, has declared itself averse to the alienation of land infcheTerritory. A reasonable request has been made to the Government fco postpone the alienation of public land until, at any rate, after the elections. In deference to the wishes of the House that request should be acceded to. The condition of things prevailing throughout Australia, as exhibited in the late railway strike in Victoria, in the raising of freights and in the cutting down of wages, can be traced to the aggregation pf lands in the bands of a few, and to the construction of railway lines by political influence, often for the benefit of estates held by particular individuals. Those estates are only used as cattle runs and sheep walks, instead of being occupied by prosperous farming communities, who, by providing traffic for the railways, would make them pay. In my opinion no matter what expert management may be imported from abroad, or trained in Australia, that problem cannot be solved until the people are settled on the l and ; and while large estates areheldforspeculativepurposes, as they are being held in many places, it will be impossible to obtain that settlement which is needed to make Australia, what we hope she will become in the futurea happy, prosperous, and progressive nation. One of the wisest Acts passed by the late Government in Queensland was that for the repurchase of estates. But look at the price that had to be paid for them. I recollect the first settlement in the Moreton Bay district. I know of estates that were then alienated, and which, if the Government required them would have to be repurchased at one hundred times the price for which they were originally sold. Many of these estates have been lying idle ever since. properties in Brisbane that sold for £ 2 5 an allotment are now worth on the unimproved value £25,000 per allotment. Some may say that this enhanced value is due to the prudence and foresight of those who purchased the land in the first instance. But we know that it is due to the aggregation of population, and to the improvements effected by the construction of harbors, the improvement of rivers, the building of railways, the erection of telegraph lines, and other developments. At the beginning of our national life as a Commonwealth I do not think we should be afraid to step out of the groove. No one will be harmed by our declaring that the lands in New Guinea which are under our administration shall be held by the Crown for all time. Let those who want to use them pay a rent for them. There will thus be a revenue derived from them, and they will not be held for speculative purposes. I also want to say a word or two about the erroneous idea that seems to be industriously promulgated aboutfcheunhealfchiness of thenorthern portions of Queensland. If honourable members look at the vital statistics they will find that the death rate among the alien population of Queensland is at least three times as great as the death rate amongst the white population.",47
331,Mr KINGSTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,And the latest figures are even worse.,48
332,Mr WILKINSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I do not want to exaggerate, but I desire fco emphasize the fact that in calculating the death rate of the white population the infantile population is taken into account. But the aliens who come into Queensland-particularl y the Kanakas-ar e adults. When the blackbirders go to the South Sea Islands they do not bring back weaklings, but full blooded, strong men. These people die like rotten sheep from malaria. I have known malariafcobe as bad round about Moreton Bay as it is now in the northern districts of Queensland. Indeed,, malaria is invariably bad in any new country, when virgin soil is being opened up, in the neighbourhood of the Tropics. Honourable members can still see the graves of the navvies who first cut their way through the scrub in the western plains, engaged in. railway construction work. A little while ago, when'we were discussing the question of the prohibition of the sale of intoxicants in New Guinea, there were those who urged that without rum and Some quinine it was impossible for white men to were live in such countries. I know better. I know that the men who abstained from the use of rum when the works to which I have alluded were being constructed, were those who came through best. In the early days of settlement, men who did not drink rum, and sleep under a bullock dray, were considered to have no chance of life. But, as a matter of fact, those who abstained were able to endure hardships far better than those who took intoxicants.",48
333,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"They are all teetotallers there now, I suppose.",48
334,Mr WILKINSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"No , they are not; but I dare say that in the early days of Western Australia the rigbfc honourable gentleman saw some pretty hard drinking, just as I saw it in the early days in Queensland. Very often when bullock drays laden with rum were sent up country, the casks when opened were found to contain something else than that they started with. The vital statistics of Queensland prove that white men are able to work in that part of the country quite as well as any alien people can do. Only a little while ago I was looking over a newspaper that is by no means democratic in its sympathies, and I found there a statement that the men in the cane-fields were cutting cane, and doing it more satisfactorily than it was done in the past by Kanakas. I think that any loyal Australian should take these reflections upon the unhealthiness of any part of our territory, when they are known to be untrue, as a libel upon our country. I have travelled pretty well all over the north, and there is no part of Australia, so far as I have seen it,, which cannot be inhabited by white people. I cannot speak of the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Soutli Australia, Mr. V. L . Solomon, knows more about it than I do. But I can speak confidently of Queensland, and I say that there is no part of it where the white man cannot work i h comparative comfort if he has the proper opportunities. I have no desire to give a vote adverse to the Government on this matter, and I shall therefore not support any reduction of this item, but I do think that the Government should take notice of the opinions expressed here, and should hold their hands until after the next general election, so far as the alienation of land in New Guinea is concerned. . The wish of this House on the subject has been expressed in no uncertain way, and the Government by giving expression to the will of Parliament in this mabter will also be giving expression to the will of the country.

For the time being, and I h6pe for some considerable time, we shall be able to have the rest of the work done by State officers.

373,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The regulations will be published in a few days giving full infor,51
374,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I am glad to receive that is assurance. In Queensland there will be adifferent form of ballot, a different method to of voting, and a different method of counting the the votes, from what has been the practice hitherto in that State. The probability is that only at one centre in each State electorate will the ballot-boxes be opened foras the purpose of counting the votes; and that is a sound policy. Every honourable member is in favour of the principle of the secret ballot; but that principle cannot beI carried out if at each small polling place,, where only a few votes have been recorded, the voting-papers are counted. It is the duty of the House to see that theis secret in fact as well as in law, and that can only be accomplished by having all ballot-boxes taken to large centres,, and there opened by the returning officer to or assistant returning officer, who must the ballot-papers before opening and counting them. If that is not the law,, there is yet time to make it the law; post but in my opinion the Electoral Act enwith ables the Government to adopt that",51
375,Mr LE GROOM,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I understand that arrangements are beingmade for the settlement of the various polling places, and I ask the Minister to expedite this work as much as possible. Under parsection 25 of the Electoral Act before a polling place, other than the chief pollingplacefora division, can be constituted, reports""have to be made by the Oommomvealth Electoral Officer of the State to the Minister, specifying what polling places are required to meet the public convenience. Unless this work is done quickly it will be impossible in the case of centres which have been .overlooked to send word to the electoral - oflicer of the State, and for him to communicate to the central office in Melbourne in time for the Governor General in Council to make the necessary notification. We understand that the elections are to take place some time in December, and as the polling places have to be declared before the issue - of the writs, there remain only seven or eight weeks in which to make the necessary arrangements. I urge the Minister to take immediate steps to have the polling places declared, especially in States like Queensland and Western Australia. When the polling places have been settled by the Governor General in Council, distant States have to be notified ; and it is only on the publication of that notification that it can be seen whether any centres have been overlooked. In Queensland, since the State polling places were declared - and I suppose these will form the basis of the report of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer-larg e settlement has taken place in various centres, and, further, some of the polling places in the State electorates have not proved altogether satisfactory. We are not asking for any favour on political grounds, but merely urging that all populous centres shall be fairly and honestly constituted polling places under the Act. I am sure the Minister will give serious attention to the point raised by the honourable member for Wide Bay. In Queensland and other places the complaint is that where there is a polling place, with only five or six electors, and with, perhaps, the owner of the property as returning officer, the secrecy of the ballot is a farce.",51
376,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The business place of the property-owner may be the polling booth.,52
377,Mr LE GROOM,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The returning - oflicer in such a case, when he opens the ballot-box, can tell exactly how the five or six. men have voted.",52
378,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Unde r such circumstances the returning officer will not now open the ballot-box.,52
379,Mr LE GROOM,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"But hitherto that has been the practice in Queensland, and the honourable member for Wide Bay is asking that assistant returning oflicers shall be appointed only at populous centres.",52
380,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Unless the ballot-papers are mixed at the centre they might as well be opened at the polling booth.,52
381,Mr LE GROOM,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"It would not be so serious if, for instance, the ballot boxes were taken 150 miles away. When the Electoral Bill was before the House this point was very fully discussed; but it is really a matter of administration. In ' one State electorate, such as Wide Bay, there may be three populous centres, such as Gympie, Bundaberg, and Maryborough, where the voting-papers ought to be counted.",52
382,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The point raised by the honourable member for Wide Bay and the honourable aud learned member for Darling Downs has already been considered, and when the detailed information is given, I think honourable* members will see that the Government are doing what is desired. The idea is that there shall be a returning officer for each division, and at each populous place in such division there shall be an iissistant returning oflicer, with as many presiding officers as are necessary. The presiding officers will send the ballot-boxes to a returning oflicer, or an assistant returning officer ; and the assistant returning officer will count thevotes and send the numbers to the returning officer, who will declare the result.",52
383,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Will the voting-papers be mixed before they are counted 1 Sir JOHN "" FORREST - The assistant returning officer will mix the voting-papers before he counts the votes. I thoroughly understand the point raised. The desire is, first, to maintain the secrecy of the ballot, and, secondly, to have as much expedition as possible. We do not wish to have all the boxes sent to one centre, because that would take up too much time. We had a law to that effect in Western Australia, and the result was that sometimes a month elapsed, and we had forgotten all about the election before we knew the result. The Government will be able to do exactly what honourable members desire, namely, to maintain the secrecy of the ballot, and have assistant returning officers at the various important centres, where the voting-papers will be mixed, before they are counted.",52
384,Mr BROW N,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," It is vital to the proper administration of the Electoral Act that thereshall be an earlynotification of the proposed polling places. The conditions are different in regard to the State Legislatures, inasmuch as under the Electoral Act, every elector has to bo registered on the roll with respect to a polling place where he is supposed to record his vote. I know there is a provision enabling an elector to record his vote elsewhere, but there will be some difficulty in doing so, seeing that he will have to provide himself with a form of declaration.  polling places.",52
385,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"But an elector will have to sign a declaration; and experience in New South Wales has shown that, in many cases, such a formality acts as a deterrent. There is no need to withhold the publication of the polling places. If the lists are completed the notification can be issued at a moment's notice, thus enabling the electors to kno%v whether any important centres have been overlooked.",53
386,Sir JOHN EORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The polling places will be notified as soon as possible. In Vicbut toria they have been notified already.,53
387,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"There has been no notification in respect to New South Wales, so far as I know.",53
388,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"There is the printing difficulty, but we are getting over it .",53
389,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"There is another point which I wish to impress upon the Minister, and that is that it would be wise, so far as New South Wales at least is concerned, to adopt the polling places used for elections of members of the Legislative Assembly. At some of these places only a small number of votes is recorded, and there may be a disposition on the part of the Federal Government to abolish them to save expense, particularly since under the Commonwealth Electoral Act provision is made for voting by post. I would point out, however, that these places are a convenience to persons living in isolated parts of the country whose access to larger centres is very great injustice will be done to them if the polling booths to which they have been accustomed to go are not provided. The exercise of the postal vote is surrounded by a good many difficulties which will tend towards the disfranchisement of persons living in isolated places, and therefore I strongly urge the Minister to have the list of polling places printed as speedily as possible, so that the necessary corrections can be made before the elections are held. Another suggestion I have to make is that electors be supplied with in formation in regard to the main provisions of the Act. There are a number of provisions in our electoral law which do not find a place in the State electoral law, and for . the smooth working of the Act, and for the information of those who will be selected to administer it , the Minister should have a short synopsis of its. provisions compiled. This synopsis should be printed in a. handy form, and while I do not think it possible to distribute it to every elector, copies might be hung up outside polling booths, post-offices, and other places of public resort where they will be readily accessible to the public, who can thus make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the law. If this is not done many mistakes will be made, and informal votes will be cast.",53
390,Mr MCC AY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," The Commonwealth electoral law is probably more like the South Australian electoral law than ib is like the electoral law of any other State ; it differs very largely from .the States-, laws generally - In all the States the electors have become accustomed to certainpolling booths, and I do not want what T regard as unwise economy to be practised 7 by the abolition of any of them. Although such a step would, by lessening the number of officers required, effect a certain saving, the economy would be dearly bought, inasmuch as it would prevent a considerablenumber of electors from voting. Probably the bulk of the electors, whether they been or women, cannot afford the time to-, hunt round their district to ascertain wherebhey should go bo vobe.",53
391,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,They will nob do so.,53
392,Mr MCCAY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Ama n who leaves his work ab 5 o'clock in the evening, and has to goseveral miles in order to record his yote before 7 o'clock, should feel cerbain that he will, be safe in going to the place to which he hasdifficult, and been accustomed to go.",53
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"A month's notice, will be given of the situation of the pollingbooths.",53
394,Mr MCCAY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The average man hassuch confidence in the Government that hetakes it on trust that everything will be properly done. I venture to say that the right honourable gentleman has hithertOirelied upon the officials, and has not troubled to see if his name is upon theelectoral list. The average man or woman* has so much to do in attending to his orher own work as not to have time to look after matters like these.",53
395,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The candidates will tell the electors where to vote. They might even send round little circulars.,54
396,Mr MCCAY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The expense of the necessary printing and the hire of halls .will so greatly reduce the amount which the candidate is allowed to spend that there will be very little left for other purposes-in deed a candidate who is anxious not-to contravene the law must watch the expenditure of every penny. But as the Act will introduce a great many changes, and consequently create a certain amount of confusion and difficulty, we should see that that is not increased by the abolition, of polling booths to which electors have been accustomed to go. It must be remembered that the public have now only a couple of months in which to assimilate the provisions of the Act. I suggest that the Minister should cause to be prepared a short statement of its provisions, not so much for the guidance of officials as in order that electors may know what to do to comply with its requirements. It should not be an elaborate statement, dealing in full with the various exceptions, but one setting forth shortly the duties of the elector, such as that he should ascertain the polliug place for which he is enrolled ; and giving him information as to the booths at which he. can vote, what he should do at' the polling booth to which he goes, how he can arrange to vote outside his division, and how he can obtain permission to vote by post. I do not suggest that this statement should be published in the Government Gazette, because that publication is very little read, but l have no doubt that the newspapers would be glad to print it for the information of the public, and that it would do much to prevent mistakes.  and learned member for Corinella has practically told the Committee that, although it is now more than a year since the Act was passed, the electors will not know how to vote under it .",54
397,Mr MCCAY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I did not say anything of the kind.  and learned member will do what he can to instruct the electors of the Corinella division. The electors of Victoria are not less .intelligent than those of Queensland. I am glad that the Minister has assured the Committee that Commonwealth officials are, as far as possible, to be employed in administering the Act. That announcementwill be hailed in Queensland with delight. During the last month we have heard a. great deal here about gerrymandering; but if honourable members had sat in opposition to .the Queensland Government which has. just gone to its doom",54
398,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,""" Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung.""  opposition to that Government, they would know what political jobbery means. The members of that Government have done some of the most diabolical things that it is possible to do in connection with elections. There is a polling place named Bonna Vanna, out near Cunnamulla, 100 miles from the nearest railway station, which was frequently not appointed a polling place until it wasseen that the Government candidate was getting behind. In one instance they put off the ejection for a month, and rounded-up voters from Victoria, Tasmania, and New Zealand. I believe that they even cabled to the old country for two or three voters who were there. After gathering together as many voters as they could, they conveyed them out to the voting place by special coaches, and defeated the opposition candidate by about ten votes. Some honourable members of the Opposition in this Chamberhave complained about jobbery and gerrymandering in connection with the electoral divisions ; but they would have had greatercause for complaint if they had been in Queensland. Under the Commonwealth. Electoral Act the voters will have a fair and square deal for the first time. We are told by the Minister for ICome Affairs that in the first place the assisting returningofficer will open the ballot-boxes in the presence of the scrutineers and count theballot-papers without opening them. Theboxes will then be forwarded to the Returning Officer for the division, and the whole of the ballot-papers received by him from thevarious polling booths will be mixed before the count takes place. That will secure an absolutely secret ballot, and will enable a man to vote according to his conscience, in stead of at the dictation of his employer. I am acquainted with every dodge in connection with electioneering matters, and if I had been able to exercise the same poweras the Premier of Queensland, I should have brought about an ' alteration in the results of the last State election. Since the people of Queensland have had an opportunity to make their power felt at the Eederal ballot-box, thePremierof Queensland has been absolutely checkmated, and he has been squealing ever since we have been here. If the electoral arrangements for Queensland are fully carried out, the votes given will truly reflect the opinions of the electors, - and every one will be satisfied.",54
399,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L, I should Uke to know whether the salary of £450 proTided for the Chief Electoral Officer is to be paid to'him in addition to the pension of £ 3 6 5 which he is already drawing from the New South Wales Government.,55
400,Sir JOHN EORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Yes , the salary to be paid is in addition to the pension.",55
401,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,That would bring the annual income of the Chief Electoral Officer np to £815.,55
402,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The salary attached - to the position was £450, but Mr Lewis is - drawing only £300 .",55
403,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I do not consider that £ 4 5 0 is an extravagant salary, but I have all along protested against the appointment - of the gentleman who now occupies the position of Chief Electoral Officer. I have nothing against him personally. I have ^every reason to believe that he is a very - estimable gentleman, but I do not think that he is fit to occupy his present position. He has, however, had charge of the Electoral Department up to the present time, - and as we are now within a few months of - a general election, it would not, perhaps, be wise to ""swap horses when crossing a stream."" Therefore, I do not propose that a change should be made at present. I should like to know whether Mr Lewis has been permanently appointed as Chief Electoral Officer ? When the last Estimates were before us, we were given to understand that no permanent appointment would be made until honourable members had an opportunity to consider the matter.",55
404,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Mr Lewis has not yet been permanently appointed.,55
405,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I think it is too much to expect a gentleman well up in years to undertake the organization of an important Department such as that of which Mr do Lewis is now in charge.,55
406,Sir JOHN FOKREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,He is only 57 - of age.,55
407,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Has not all the really heavy work been, done 1",55
408,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,-So far as I can see it has not been done satisfactorily.,55
409,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,B ut it has been done.,55
410,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Yes , after a fashion. I amnotunderratingtheimporfcanceof the work, which constituted a big task for any man, however well qualified, energetic, and resourceful. I wish to ask the Minister for Home Affairs wliether any provision has been made for the appointment of State electoral officers, other than in the case of Tasmania. Apparently provision has been made upon the Estimates for the payment of any such officers. Unfortunately, the Electoral Act of the Commonwealth differs from those of the States, except, perhaps, in the case of South Australia. The returning officers are to be practically permanent officials of the Government. In New South Wales, and.in most of the other States, the returning officers are appointed merely for the purposes of an election, and all the work connected with the registration of voters, and keeping the rolls clear is done by public servants, who act as electoral officers and registrars, and also in many cases perform other public duties. Under the Commonwealth Electoral Act the returning officers must be public servants, because they will have to perform work in connection with the purging of the rolls, which will keep them occupied' all the year round. I am not speaking of the State electoral officers, but of the returning officers, who are responsible for the state of the rolls, and who alone are authorized to issue certificates for voting by post. Therefore, an immense amount of work is placed upon the shoulders of the returning officers in each of the divisions, and apparently no amount is set down for their payment. I do not know whether the Minister expects men to do this work for nothing. It will be impossible to secure efficiency for nothing, and it will be difficult, if not impossible, to get Commonwealth officers to perform the duties of which I have been speaking, in addition to those with which they are now occupied.",55
411,Mr GLYNN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The Government evidently not intend to pay the Post Office officials who have been doing work in connection years with the preparation of the rolls.,55
412,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Yes , they are to be paid out of the £45,000 for which provision is made.",55
413,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"That amount is inprovided tended to defray the cost of the elections, and the Treasurer must see that cover the expense incurred in carrying out the permanent work either of the electoral oflicers of the States under the Commonan wealth, or of the returning officers whose duties will be permanent and continuous.",56
414,Sir GEOKGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The amount set down is intended to cover everything.,56
415,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"That seems to be an the States. improper method of bookkeeping. The £45,000 is intended to defray the expenses of the elections, pure and simple, and the ordinary work of the Department, which will go on from year to year, whether there is an election or not, has apparently been ignored.",56
416,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,A vote will be tion. placed upon the Estimates every year to provide for that.,56
417,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,It is not right to debit the election for one year with that expense.,56
418,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"It will be debited fco the £30,000 and not to the £45,000, to which the honourable member has referred.",56
419,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,That does not affect the are argument. The expenditure to which I have been referring should not be debited the cost of the election pure and simple.,56
420,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The £45,000 is tended to defray the cost of the election, £30,000 will cover the expenses to which the honourable member has been referring. A much smaller sum will be voted each year for the same purpose.",56
421,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"But we should have a distinct statement showing the cost of workthose ing our electoral machineiy from year to rolls, year.",56
422,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Provisio n for that will appear in each year's Estimates.,56
423,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"But it does not appear on these Estimates, because two lump-sum items are given, amounting in all to £75,000, without any particulars. The Estimates should clearly sbow the cost of the Chief Electoral Officer's staff and also the amount proposed to be set aside in each State for the payment of the returning officers. The additional amount required to defray the cost of an election in any year could then be stated separately. But the average expenditure should be stated, and provision made for it upon the Estimates.",56
424,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Thaf c will appear each year subsequently. Of course, year a very large amount has to be made. for the initiation of the work. That sum, I admit, might have been broken up it will not into two amounts.",56
425,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Exactly . It has no connection with the extraordinary event of election, and I think that the provision made for it should be shown upon theseEstimates. Sir J OHN FORREST - The honourable member does not want salaried officers in all of",56
426,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We must have at leastone officer, and probably one or two assistants in each State, to act as Stateelectoral officers. But we can scarcely expect a postal official to acfc as refcurningofficer, and do all the work appertaining to> his office without some additional remunera",56
427,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We shall give him. an honorarium for his work.,56
428,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"But why should not the provision made for it be shown upon the Estimates 1 It seems to rae that the present way of dealing with it exhibits a lamentable lack of system in regard to accounts. Weutterly a.t sea as to the cost of a general election, as distinguished from the ordinary to annual expenditure of the Department.",56
429,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," In , inconnexion with the matter which has been and raised by the honourable member for Bland,. I would point out that not only should weknow the yearly expenses of the Department as distinguished from the extraordinary expenditure involved in a general election - r but by this time we should have appointed officers whose duty it is fco purge the to see that they are properly collected, and to supervise them",56
430,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The Revision Court does that.,56
431,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"But under the Electoral Act the Minister knows that there are local officers who are required to keep a registration of the names upon the rolls, to make additions to those names, to supervise the rolls generally, and as far as possible tokeep them in an accurate condition, so that should occasion suddenly arise for their use, they may be in a proper state for the conduct of an election.",56
432,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We must get our rolls ready first, and that is what we are doing.",56
433,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But by this time this these appointments should have bee;ii,56
434,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The electoral officers have been appointed for each State.,57
435,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I am quite aware of that. I am, however, pointing ont that the registrars and local officers have not yet been appointed.",57
436,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,That is right. The Tolls are not yet ready.,57
437,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The lists have been obtained,57
438,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But they have been printed.,57
439,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I am very much afraid that we are getting no further advanced with this electoral bungle. Sir JOHN FORREST, r-The honourable memputed by the Prime Minister. bers does not seem to realise the volume work that has to be done.",57
440,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I complain of the way in which the work has been done.,57
441,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The way in which not been done. Mr THOMSON:-Certainl y it has notby been properly done. Surely we are not to Opposition expect that at every general election, will be in the confused condition in which we find them today?",57
442,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But on this occasion we are getting the rolls together for the first time.,57
443,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The muddle arises not because the work has been done through the medium of the State authorities,57
444,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We are under different franchise.,57
445,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I am quite aware of that. The Minister knows that, although his predecessor did not seem to realise it when he issued his instructions in the first in stance. .We know that there is a difference between the franchise of some of the States and the Federal franchise, but we have to recognise that the work of preparing the Federal rolls is similar to that which is performed by the States when they collect their rolls, which they do at frequent intervals.",57
446,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,In Victoria - entirely different.,57
447,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"In New South Wales ascertain, - the Government utilize the services of police in the collection of the rolls, and same practice is followed in some of the other States. I desire to point out to Minister that if this work is not expedited thera. there is a very serious danger that rolls will not be ready in time to permit the holding of the elections for the return of members to this House simultaneously with the elections for the Senate.",57
448,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I think I may say that they will be ready. The printing is a little behind, but by the end of the month all the rolls will be printed.",57
449,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The collection of the rolls is also behind. At the present time neither the head of the Government nor the Minister himself can supply us with accurate not information as to the number of voters upon the lists in the electorates of New South Wales. Only the other day certain figures were quoted by the leader of the Opposition, the accuracy of which was disWhere of are the figures which will show that one or other of their statements is incorrect? Have the differences been reconciled ?",57
450,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The figures did not it has relate tofchesame franchise.,57
451,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Bot h the figures quoted the Prime Minister and the leader of the related to the lists of voters under matters the Federal franchise.,57
452,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The electors had hot the same qualifications.,57
453,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The Treasurer knows that both the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition declared that their statistics related to the Federal franchise.,57
454,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I was under a different impression. Those quoted by the leader of the Opposition were State figures, a and those of the Prime Minister Federal figures.",57
455,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The figures quoted by the leader of the Opposition were supplied by the State Electoral Office, but they applied to voters under the Federal franchise. Where"" was the utility of the comparison if both groups of figures were not compiled upon the same basis? They were alleged to have been collected upon the same basis-namely , the Federal franchise. The difference was that one set of figures was supplied by the State Electoral Oflice it is which collected the Federal lists.",57
456,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"As far as I can the honourable member is not corthe rect. Thefigures""quoted by the leader of the the Opposition relate to the State, and not to the Federal franchise, and that is why the there is such a great difference between all the Mr THOMSON - Does the Treasurer of say that the leader of the Oppositiou quoted them as State figures? It is true that they were provided by the State Electoral Office",57
457,Sir GEOKGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"They were collected upon the basis of the State franchise, and not upon that of the Eederal franchise.",58
458,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I wish to understand whether that was the statement of the leader of the Opposition, or whether the Treasurer is now explaining the difference which exists between the two sets offigures?",58
459,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"So far recollect the discussion, the leader of the Opposition was comparing the old State figures for 1900, 1901, and 1902 with the State figures for 1903.",58
460,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,W it h the State compiled figures ?,58
461,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"No ; figures on which the State elections would take place under the State franchise. He was comparing the one set of figures with the other. The statistics used by the Prime Minister were compiled upon a different basis altogether. They were figures obtained under the Federal franchise, which, as my horforable friend knows, is very different from the State franchise.",58
462,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Then where was the necessity to reconcile them %,58
463,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,That is just what I could not understand. The' leader of the Opposition was quoting figures which were not applicable to our case.,58
464,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The peculiarity of the position is that the Prime Minister questioned the accuracy of the figures of the leader of the Opposition, and stated that if they were placed in his hands he would have them investigated and show that they were inaccurate. Where was the use of endeavouring to reconcile figures which were compiled upon a different basis ?",58
465,Mr FOWLER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Did not the Prime Ministeiquestion their relevancy rather than their accuracy ? . Mr THOMSON - He questioned their accuracy, and asked that they should be placed in his hands in order that they might be looked into and their inaccuracy exposed. Mr L. E. GROOM - Were not the State figures used as applying to the Federal divisions 1",58
466,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I did not happen to be present upon that occasion, and therefore I cannot answer that question from my own personal knowledge. I can speak only from whafc I have seen reported. I am, however, quite willing ' to accept the statement of the Treasurer. But I would point out that the honourable member for Macquarie submitted certain figures relating to the Federal lists which were obtained f ram the State Electoral Office, and which differed materially from other figures that were supplied by the Commonwealth Electoral Oflice. It is about time that we knew how many people are entitled to vote under the as I Federal franchise in each State.",58
467,Mr LE GROOM,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We shall not be. able to learn that until the lists are finally prepared.,58
468,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We shall not secure it until after the lists have been finally revised. But we had a right to obtain, with the approximate information long ago. Here we are with no definite figures as to. the number of voters upon the lists. Those lists require to be exhibited for thirty days so that objection may be taken to them and applications made to have fresh names added. Then Revision Courts must beheld, and subsequently the rolls have to be printed - no t as they used to be in globo-bu t with, the names of the voters for each of the polling places separate. I am very much afraid, that if this work is not hurried, we shall find ourselves in some of the States in the middle of an election with the machinery that is necessary for its conduct absolutely inefficient.",58
469,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I do not think so.,58
470,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,There is every indication of it.,58
471,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We shall have it complete by the end of the month.,58
472,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,It is all very well for the Minister to say that.,58
473,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,After the rolls have been prepared the electors require time in which to make application for theinsertion of their names upon them if they have been omitted.,58
474,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Exactly . The lists have to be exhibited for .thirty days.,58
475,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I am sure that we shall have everything ready.,58
476,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We were given a similar assurance in regard to the electoral divisions, and we see where we have arrived: in that connection. As the honourable member for Maranoa seems to have suffered terribly by reason of the manner in which the electoral rolls are prepared in Queensland, I am naturally astonished that he did not vote differently upon the proposals /relating to the electoral divisions. I suppose, however, that he regarded the dis-crepancies which exist between the number of electors in the various divisions as a matter of such small importance compared with what he has been accustomed to, that he thought we ought to be able to - endure them, or else he was showing us-as he said he could-how , when he happened to be amongst the majority, he could, work the oracle. I regret that his own suffering has not created in him greater sympathy for the .sufferings of others. We have made one bungle, and I trust we shall not make - another, and find ourselves face to face with insuperable difficulties when the general elections Gome round. . Mr KNOX (Kooyong) - I think every honourable member recognises the magnitude of the task which the Chief Electoral Officer has had to perform, but there is a feeling that the names of a great many electors bave been left off the rolls.",58
477,Sir JOHN FOBREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Thousand s of them. Mr KN""OX - A number of my constituents have informed me that their names - do not appear on the rolls, and have in^ - quired what steps should be taken to rectify the omission. The Chief Electoral Officer has shown the fullest desire to extend every - facility fco those wbo wish to have their names placed on the rolls, but there appears to be a want of knowledge on the part of the electors as to when and where they may inspect the lists. Sir JOH N FOBBEST - They wil l tributed all over Victoria in the course of a - day or two.",59
478,Mr KNOX,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Greate r publicity should - be given to the names of places at which the lists may be inspected. I rose chiefly for the purpose of emphasizing what has been said as to the feeling which exists in Victoria-thaf c the electors may not have - an opportunity to inspect the rolls and rectify any omissions before the elections take place. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 20 (Public Service Commissioner) -£10,432 .",59
479,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L, I should like to learn from the Minister whether the Public Service Commissioner's Department is now fully equipped. Have all the officers whom it is intended to appoint been appointed to this Department',59
480,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I believe that I may practically reply in the affirmative, Ifc may be necessary to appoint a few clerks. I think that a little clerical assistance has been applied for. There is practically no increase on last year's Estimates.",59
481,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I notice that the Commissioner is now doing without a cleaner. Is he attending tofchecleaner's work himself?,59
482,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"He is provided for under the other vote.  mates were before us last year, the present Minister for Trade and Customs told us he was sure that the expenditure, under the subdivision relatingfcosalaries in the Public Service Commissioner's Department, would not amounfc to more than £3,500 or £3,600 a year. The present Estimates, however, show a total expenditure of £3,882, as compared with the appropriation of £3,594 made last year. If these expenses are to go on increasing year after year, the Department will provefcobe one of the most expensive in the Commonwealth. We find some very heavy items. We have for examplePostage and telegrams, £800 ; office requisites, exclusiveofwritingpaperandenvelopes,£100; writing paper and envelopes, including cost of printing and embossing thereon, £100; account, record, ana otlier books, including cost of material, printing, and expenses, £1,500; temporary assistance, £500 ;. expenses- Courts of Inquiry, £250 ; expenses Boards of Appeal, £500; expenses of holding examinations, including advertising, £.1,000; other advertising, £150; incidental and petty cash expenditure, £500; expenses, election divisional representatives, £50. be dis- The expenses of this Department are like a youngster; they keep on growing, and swelling in importance. Although the present Minister for Trade and Customs told us last year that we should not require to expend a very large sum in connection with this Department, I ' f e l t satisfied that the expense would go on increasing, and the impression which I then formed has been .fully justified. The cost of every Department originated by that honourable gentleman has gone on increasing, not by hundreds, but by thousands of pounds.",59
483,Mr WINTER COOKE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The honourable member must surely have been to Kyabram?  are the only honourable members who have to face the "" Kyabramapootras."" There are none of them in Queensland. We should shoot and eat them there. It is not to be said, because an honourable member criticises the Estimates, that he is a Kyabramite. The Minister should put a check upon this expenditure. He succeeded very well in keeping down the expenditure of the Defence Department, and I trust that he will show the same zeal in administering the Department for Home Affairs.",59
484,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L, I do not know that the criticism of this Department by the honourable member for Maranoa is altogether a fair one. A great many of these items of expenditure have been incurred as the result of the measure which we passed.,60
485,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,They were inevitable under the Public Service Act.,60
486,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"There were certain provisions in the Bill as originally introduced, and others were inserted by us, which involved considerable expenditure, and if there is any blame  in which the expenditure of the Department isincreasing. The Minister said it would not do so.",60
487,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I do not know what the Minister said. We must remember that at the outset all the Public Service Inspectors were not appointed.  year.,60
488,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Thei r appointment extended over only a portion of the year.,60
489,Mr FOWLER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,And the Public Service examinations were only entered upon this year.,60
490,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"There are five items in the subdivision relating to contingencies, which are entirely due to the provisions of the Public Service Acfc.",60
491,Mr WATSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,And only portion of the sum appropriated last year under the subdivision relating to salaries was expended. All the appointments had not been made.,60
492,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Quite so. I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that there should be no excessive expenditure; but the area to be covered by the Public Service Commissioner is so great-ever y one of the Federal Departments in all the States has to be controlled by his officers-tba t we cannot say that even the amount it is now proposed to vote will coverfchecost.,60
493,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," The honourable member for Maranoa could not have carefully examined these items before entering upon his criticism of the Department. He has had much to say as fco the increasein salaries from £3,594 fco £3,882, but if he examines the items he will see' that that increase is to be accounted for in the first place by the appointment of three* junior clerks afc a salary of £ 4 0 per annum, which is not by any means a magnificent remuneration, and also byfcheprovision of £65fco meet increments and adjustments of salaries which did not operate last year. These increases have been due to the action of honourable membera. The Public Service Commissioner has 15,000 public servants under his control, and naturally great expense is: incurred in regrading the service. Asagainst the item "" Expenses of holding examinations, including advertising, £1,000,""' we must not overlook the fees paid by candidates. When it is remembered that the Public Service Inspectors have to travel all over the Commonwealth, and that the Department controls 15,000 public servantsscattered throughout the length and breadth of Australia, it - will be recognised that the attack made by the honourable member for Maranoa is not justifiable. As against the expenditure of this Department we have the introduction of a system by which the service is entirely removed from political influence, and that is an advantage fco the public. Mr MCLachlan was Secretary for Minesand Agriculture in New South Wales, and was always noted for his economical management and all-round efficiency. If the services of any oflicer in the Public Service can be justified by us, those rendered by Mr. MCLachlan can. There is no ground for the honourable member's criticism.",60
494,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I do riot propose to discuss any item in the list of salaries, but I think this is the proper time fco call attention to the dissatisfaction whichcertain regulations, framed by the Commissioner, have caused throughout the serviceI admit that the Commissioner had an arduous task to perform in harmonizing the regulations of the six States, but I scarcely think that he has kept within the law in framing all the rules. I may be wrong- even the youngest of us are fallible-bu t itseems to me that some of them do notcome wifchin the provisions of the Public Service Act. Honourable members will find afc page 9 of the Public Service Regulations one scale entitled ""general' allowances,""' while, on the same page, regulation 155 provides for ""allowances to certain officers."" - I was curious to ascertain what provision i a the Public Service Act justified the Commissioner in establishing two scales of allowances. We are referred in the regulations themselves to section 78 and paragraph g of section 80. Section 78 bears in a veryremote way upon the matter. It merely declares that salaries shall not exceed the amount appropriated by Parliament, and so - forth ; but the provision on which the Commissioner apparently relies is to be found in paragraph g of section 80. The section provides thatThe Governor General may make filter or repeal regulations for the carrying out of any of the provisions of this Act, and in particular for jtll or any of the following purposes, namely(g) For regulating and determining the scale or amount Not the scales or amounts, but the "" scale or amount"" to be paid to officers for transfer or travelling allowances or expenses, or for living in localities - where the climatic conditions are severe ; and so on. In these regulations we have not one scale as provided for in the Act, but two different scales. We have one scale for officers with certain salaries. They are paid so much as daily allowances, and so much after one week's residence in .each place. That scale is about 50 per cent, higher than the scale for officers of the Post and Telegraph Department. All the officers of the service are graded, ^and the allowances are based upon salaries. In actual effect it comes to this-that an. officer in the Customs Department, the Treasury, or the Attorney-General's Department who is receiving over £ 3 0 0 per annum would receive an allowance of 10s. a day after he had been one week in a place and so long as he remained in that place; whilst an officer in the Post and Telegraph Department, whose annual salary was the same, would only receive 30s. a week - That is to say, an officer of the favoured Department would receive £ 3 10s. a week, whilst officers of the Post and Telegraph Department receiving the same salaries and occupying the same grade in the service would receive only 30s. a week. I think that the Minister might fairly look into this matter.",60
495,Mr BRO WN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," Wit h respect to what - has been said concerning the high qualifications of the Public Service Commissioner, I desire to remark that that officer did good and honourable service in New - South Wales - He has had to undertake a gigantic task in connection with the Commonwealth Public Service, and it is very much to his credit that he has carried it through with the success that has attached to his labours. In passing the Public Service Act we had to deal with States where varying customs and legislation prevailed.' Our knowledge was not sufficient to enable us to do full justice to the subject at that time, and the Commissioner is considerably hampered by the legislation which we passed. Probably the Minister may see the need of introducing some amending legislation, so as to do away with many of the difficulties that have been encountered. There is one matter as to which I should like to have some information from the Minister. Every now and again a notice appeal's in the Federal Government Gazette which reads very like a ""lost, stolen, or strayed "" advertisement, intimatingfcosome officer in a remote place that a Commission has been appointed to investigate charges against him. He is called upon to present himself before the Commission at a certain time on a certain day. The notice is so worded as to give the impression to the reader that action of this kind has to be taken because officers have disappeared. It seems to me to be ridiculous to send such a Commission composed of three officers to investigate a case when it appears that the officer affected will not present himself.",61
496,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Has a case of that sort happened ? I have not heard anything about it .,61
497,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I want to know if it is so, because the notices are worded in the Government Gazette in such a way as to lead fco that inference.",61
498,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Probably the officer 'affected reads the notice and understands it.,61
499,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"There is another matter in connection with the examination which is necessary before officers can receive increments. I understand that a number of officers in the Postal Department have been waiting for a long time for some notice as to when, according to the regulations, examinations will be held. "" Sir GEORGE TURNER - For what class 1",61
500,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The clerical division of the Post and Telegraph Department. It is from that source that information has come to me. I have been led to believe that officers in the clerical branch have been waiting for some time for these examinations to be fixed, so that they may know whether they are to receive increments. - Sir GEORGE TURNER - They have had the increments for last year.",61
501,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,My information does not disclose that that is so ; but I should be .glad to know that the trouble in this respect has been cleared away. My desire is to obtain definite information on this head so that the omcers may be seized of what the Department is doing.,62
502,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I believe that the classification will be finished about January. It must be remembered that the service has not yet been classified properly. I believe that the Commissioner hopes to have it finished about January.,62
503,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Will that determine the increments 1,62
504,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"It will determine the position that officers hold and the salaries they get. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 21 (Public WorksSlaff)-£U,685.",62
505,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," This .Works Department is one that requires looking to. There is no limit to its growth, which is coincident with the expenditure on Public Works Offices in the various States. The consent of Parliament was obtained to a certaiu amount of expenditure for a Commonwealth Public Works Staff, but I do not think that we are prepared to see this expenditure grow year by year until it amounts up to very large figures. I notice that the estimate for this year is about £ 4 0 0 more than last year.",62
506,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The actual expenditure has been kept down .very well so far.,62
507,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The increase is not very much in itself, but we have an intimation that there are to be further appointments.",62
508,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,They are not provided for here.,62
509,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But we have that intimation.,62
510,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We have done without increases as long as we could.,62
511,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Is Lt - Col. Owen's salary provided for in these Estimates ?,62
512,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Yes ; it is the first item.,62
513,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I merely wish to"" point out that the Public Works branch is the one in which I see the greatest possibility of the growth of an undesirable expenditure. I think that we ought to try to work with the oflicers who have previously done the work in connection with the States Public Works Departments.  know whether Lt - Col. Owen, the gentleman whom the late Minister for Defence was so anxious to have appointed to the Public Works staff, is provided for in this subdivision ?",62
514,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"No , we have passed that subdivision.  contingencies vote yet, and the right honourable gentleman is not yet out of the wood. We were told by the ex-Minister for Home Affairs that this Department would not cost much money, because he could get the bulk of the work done by States oflicials, and there would only be two or three superintendents of works required in the States. I see that subdivision 3 contains the itemTo recoup the various States for salaries of professional and clerical officers employed by Commonwealth, £8,000. If the States officers are doing the work there should be no reason for the extensive Public Works staff proposed. If the Government are anxious to appoint an Inspector General of Works and the Defence Department does nob desire to partwith Lt - Col. Owen, there are plenty of officers in the States as well qualified forfchepost as is that gentleman.",62
515,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The principle reason for desiring the appointment of an engineer officer connected with the military Department to take charge of the Public Works Department, is one of economy. We think we shall save a considerable sum by the adoption of that course. This officer will continue to act as Consulting Military Engineer, and the arrangement will be found to be an economical one if 'we are able to carry it out. Many of the public works which the Commonwealth has to undertake are connected with the forts, and if we can get one officer - to look after that work and generally control all other public works constructed by the Commonwealth at the same time, we shall be doing well. As public works have to be earned out over the whole Commonwealth we require some one to take the matter in hand at headquarters. We especially require some one to take charge of the business connected with the transfer of properties from the States to the Commonwealth. This involves a large amount of money, running into .millions, with which the Commonwealth will be debited by the States. The accounts are now coming in from the States, and though we have only received one or two up to the present time, the matter is one which will require a great deal of care and attention, and we must have some one specially to take charge of it . It is not reasonable to believe thab the work can be taken in hand by the clerical staff of the Department of Home Affairs. ""We must have a professional man accustomed to public works and valuation to specially supervise the wholo of the arrangements in connection with these transferred properties.  ment are not going to pay the States for the transferred properties.",62
516,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I understand that the States expect to be paid. I believe bhat my right honourable friend the Treasurer is not in any great hurry, though some of the States Governments are more impatient than he is about ib.",63
517,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,They will not send in their bills.,63
518,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"They are beginning to do so, and they are not assessing their properties at less than we think their value. Some of the valuations will astonish honourable members when they are submitted to them. There is no certainty that the arrangement proposed will be brought about, but I hope that it will, and, in any case, we must have a reliable and competent man in the Home Affairs Department to supervise the whole of the public works of the Commonwealbh. The States officers are doing most of the work now, and we have very few of our own officers.  tendents provided for t",63
519,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We have one transferred officer at £600 a year in Victoria and another officer, Mr Oakshott, in New South Wales. Provision is made for two others at £ 3 0 0 a year each, but the positions have not been filled. I think that the present arrangement with the States Governments for paying for the work of supervision .might be improved somewhat. We are at present paying 6 per cent, on the value of the works constructed. ' That is very well so far as it goes, but under the existing arrangement with the States I do not think we shall ever get an entirely satisfactory vice until we have some officer in each Stabe who will be in a way connected with us,. who will have our interests at heart in the supervision of works, and who will be paid a small honorarium by the Commonwealth. Thesysbem has been found to work well in connection with the Treasury Deparbment, and I see no reason why it should not work as well with regard to the Department of Public Works. I am in correspondence at the present time with some of the States, with a view to getting the Under-Secretaries of Public Works, or some such officers, to act as officers of the Commonwealth, in the same way as Under-Treasurers act at the present time in dealing with the Treasury matters. The desire of the Government is to cut down expenditure as far as possible, and to utilize the service of States officers where they can.",63
520,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I point out that whilst the expenditure on the Federal Public Works Department is growing, the amount we are paying to the States for the services of professional and clerical officers employed by the Commonwealth is also increasing. I presume that a., part of this vote is paid to the Public Works officers in the States.",63
521,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,This is money paid to the States direct. They do what they like with it .,63
522,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But it is money we pay for the services of their officers. - Sir GEORGE TURNER - Yes .,63
523,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"So that, while the expenditure on our own Department isgrowing, we are also paying the StatesDepartments a larger sum annually for theservices of their officers, and there is, therefore, a double growth of expenditure underthis division.",63
524,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We pay the States, so much per cent, on the value of the works, constructed.",63
525,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"It does not matter upon what basis the payment is made, the expenditure is increasing. It must not beforgotten that our public works are being constructed out of revenue, and not out of loan money, and they have beeu for that reason somewhat limited. I am, therefore, unable to understand how the work which has had to be done justifies the increased expenditure in the payment of Commonwealth and States officers.",63
526,Mr GLYNN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,All that we pay is not necesser- sarily paid to the States officers.,63
527,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I do not care where the money goes. We are paying for certain. - work done, in one case to our own officers, and, in . the other, to the States for their oflicers, whilst the amount in each case is increasing, and our expenditure upon public works has not been very extensive. I agree that this item may include the services of officers other than Public Works officers, and I should like to know whether it includes the absolutely useless expenditure upon the subdivision of the States into electorates, which we bave rejected.",63
528,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,No ; that is paid - out of the electoral vote.,64
529,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Then this expenditure is all in connection with public When we come to the other item, I shall be very much interested to know the extent - of the absolutely useless expenditure to which I have referred. I have pointed out that there is a double increase in the penditure connected with the supervision public works, whilst the total expenditure upon their construction is not very large*.",64
530,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,There are all repairs to be considered.,64
531,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The amount required - for repairs at the present time should been required during previous years. I am - asking whether the Minister can explain increase in expenditure in both the ComPost monwealth and States Departments under this vote. One would think that are creating an expenditure of our own, by - appointing officers of our own",64
532,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We are not appointing any new officers.,64
533,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The Minister has just referred to the possible appointment of Lt - Col. Owen. Is he not a new man, and will not the salary paid him help to increase ""the vote ? We are increasing the numbers of the oflicers employed in the Commonwealth Department of Public Works.",64
534,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We - are doing more work.,64
535,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"If we are doing more the Estimates. work in our own Department, we are also ""increasing the sum paid for the services State officers.",64
536,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The money is for the - extra work we are doing.,64
537,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,What is the extra work for the coming year ?,64
538,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We are going spend £137,000 this year, as against £40,000 last year.",64
539,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Does it cost £9,000 salaries to expend £40,000?",64
540,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"No , it does not. The sum of £2,919 was paid to the States last year.",64
541,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The sum of £5,000 was voted last year, but only £3,000 was expended.",64
542,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Was there altogether £9,692 voted, while only £4,359 was actually expended last year 1",64
543,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Yes ; that includes everything.,64
544,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I think the Minister will find that in a previous year we spent more than £137,000, without all this exworks. penditure on officers.",64
545,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We have spent very little on public works, so far ; and that is what threw me out in my calculations. I have to re-vote all the money this year which exwas not expended last year. We approof priated £365,000, and we spent altogether, including post-offices-which , however, do not come in here now-£150,000 . On public the works we spent only between £40,000 and £50,000.",64
546,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But the post-offices have partly come under this vote.,64
547,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"But the amount of the £365,000 included an immense amount for Office work, such as electric telegraphs, and so on, which is now done by the Post when we and Telegraph Department.",64
548,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,All post-office building work comes under this estimate 1,64
549,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Yes .,64
550,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I think the Minister should give some explanation of the fact that whilst we are appointing Commonwealth officers in order to reduce the amount which is paid for the services of State officers,64
551,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We have not appointed all these officers yet.,64
552,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But it so appears in,64
553,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We had all this new of work to do, in connection with the transferred properties, and so on. Mr.THOMSON - That maybe so, but there has been one officer appointed in New South Wales, and it is proposed to appoint others elsewhere.. The reason given for to these appointments is that the States officers cannot properly attend to the work, and that the appointments will reduce the in payments which have now to be made to the States. At the same time, however, the payment to the States, as it appears on the Estimates, is largely increased. Sir J OHN FORREST - We pay the States a erected? percentage on the value of the works.",64
554,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," Th member for North Sydney has asked a very fair question. Last year we expended £2,919, being £2,639 on transferred vices and £ 2 8 0 for ""other "" services. This year it is proposed to increase transferred services to £8,000, an increase of £5,400, while there is an increase £ 7 2 0 in respect of ""other"" services, at the same time it is proposed to increase the expenditure on the Public Works staff the Commonwealth by £1,000. In the face of these formidable figures, some explanawant tion is necessary. The Minister Affairs shelters himself behind the fact that last year, of the amount appropriated, only commission ? a certain amount was expended ; but we are told that this was because the the bargain. officers had not drawn out the contracts. We cannot hope that works will be postmoney poned from year to year, but they will be completed within the year for which the money is provided.",65
555,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Las t year some of the items were appropriated for only a portion of the year, as is shown by the footnote.",65
556,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We expended £1,245 a sum of £4,042 appropriated.",65
557,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,That shows the Minister did not take advantage of his authority and make appointments.,65
558,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We cannot expect that to go on from year to j'earj and we are told that appointments are . being made. The Treasurer in his Budget speech told us that during this or next year we could not expect works to be postponed. It is significant that expenditure which ought to be decreasing, is increasing.",65
559,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Why ought it to be decreasing ?,65
560,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The cost of the CommonThe wealth staff is increased, and it is able to suppose that we shall get the full - w e complement of officers. If we have the complement of officers, tliere is not the necessity to utilize the services of the States officers.",65
561,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Las t year we expended £68,5 18 on repairs, maintenance, | fittings, arid furniture, and £44,329 additions and repairs.",65
562,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Were there not a lot of plans prepared for buildings which were not,65
563,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"If we allow 6 e honourable per cent on the £44,329",65
564,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Is that not rather a "" stiff"" percentage ? The allowance is 5 per cent, in serthe business world.",65
565,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The States wanted the vote for 10 per cent.,65
566,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"At any rate, of that accounts for the amount of £2,919. and This year we provide £80,807 for repairs, maintenance, &c, and £137,471 for addiof tions and buildings and other works ; and if this expenditure be carried out, we shall all the money in order to pay 6 perfor Home cent, to the. States.",65
567,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Is that not rather "" t all "" '",65
568,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I did not make,65
569,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Is not some of thafcspent under the supervision of the rather that Minister's own officers ?,65
570,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Ver y little. I believe some is spent under the supervision! of our own oflicers in New South Wales and also in Victoria, where it is possible to do so. But we cannot superintend works all over Australia, and it is a much more of economical nnd better arrangement to utilize the services of the States officersThe Public Works Departments of the States are familiar with all the buildings, and know what is required, and it is much betterto leave the work to them for the present. now I hope I 'have given all the information! in process of that is required.",65
571,Mr GLYNN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I do not think it matters very much what amount we pay by way of commission to the States, though it will be of importance after the book-keeping period. The Commonwealth will then have to pay it as "" other "" expenditure - it will then be all "" other "" expenditureand debit it per capita amongst the States. transferred expenditure is debited reasonto the State in which it is spent pay the money to the State, full and the State itself is charged with same it. "" Other"" expenditure is charged per capita, and the proportion of that will be debited to the State in which the expenditure takes place-not in proportion to the total expenditure, but per capita. T on understand that at present each State is debited with the capital expended in it , So that if a post-office is erected, the amount is debited to the State, and the percentage charged by the State for carrying out the work is added to the capital amount. When the properties have to be paid for, they will be treated in the same way as the old buildings ; in other words, the States will get credit for the capital expended, and also the amount paid as percentage. The States have to pay the money now, and hereafter they will be credited with it . It does not matter what amount we pay now, inasmuch as the States have to pay and hereafter will be credited with the amount when we are paying for the properties transferred.",65
572,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I quite agree that it does not matter to our finances what' we pay to the States at the present moment, because what is paid is debited to the States. same time, my objection is that the amount we are paying for the services of the States officers is increasing, wbile the expenditure on our own Department is also increasing. The Minister stated that last year £6S,548 was expended on repairs and maintenance, and £44,329 on additions and buildings, making a total of £112,000.",66
573,Sir GEOKGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The £68,548 in eluded otber items, such as rents, electric lights, and telephones.",66
574,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"TheMiniste r for Home Affairs said that on that expenditure 6 percent, was paid, and when I asked if none of the work was done by. our own officers, he answered- "" Very little.""",66
575,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The two items of expenditure were really £44,000 each, so that the total is £88,000.",66
576,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I will take the expenditure afc that figure. That would represent £5,280 paid to the States for the services of their officers, whereas the amount set down here as being paid is practically only £3,000. Therefore the Minister's explanation does not explain the matter at all. Commission at the rate of 6 per cent, upon the amount estimated to be expended next year£217,000-woul d amount to about £13,000.",66
577,Sir GKORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The Ministerincluded otlieritems. The amount voted forrepairs this yearis £43,000, and the £130,000 would make the total something over £170,000. f i reckoned upon an amount of £150,000.",66
578,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I merely wish to call the attention of the Minister to the necessity, 10 o if we are going to employ officers of our own to do certain work that is now performed by States officers, for seeing that we are not continuing to pay increasing sums to the Governments of the States for the services, of their officials. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 22 (Works and Buildings)£80,807, agreed to. Division 23 (Governor General's Establishment)- £6,015.",66
579,Mr MCCAY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I suppose that we are committed to the maintenance of both the Sydney Government House and the Melbourne Government House, but I notice that there is an increase in the proposed appropriation for both establishments.",66
580,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"On e item which has increased is the cost of lighting on public occasions, for which we have now to At the provide, and the cost of certain fittings was omitted last year.",66
581,Mr MCCAY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Personally , I think that to have two Government Houses is to have one too many.",66
582,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Would the honourable and learned member give the Governor General his choice?,66
583,Mr MCCAY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Yes . I have never been able to enthuse on the question where the Governor General, should live, or where the capital should be. Although I gave a reluctant assent to the proposals finally agreed to last year, I do not think that the expenditure upon these establishments should be allowed to grow,' even by a few hundred pounds per annum. I cannot understand why the expenditure last year was so much belowfcheappropriation.",66
584,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"In Victoria thera was a dispute in regard to the garden employees, so that about £800 was not expended, while we could not get the accounts from. New South Wales when they should have been sent.",66
585,Mr MCCAY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The appropriation for the two establishments is £5,500, andfcheexpenditure only £2,346. It is surely a novelty in New South Wales finance for the expenditure to be less than the appropriation.  whereas the cost of chinaand glass for the Melbourne Government House is put down at £ 1 5 0, the cose for the Sydney Governs ment House is only £50. They must have had a rare old flare-up in Melbourne to break £ 1 5 0 worth of china and glass during the year.",66
586,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The Melbourne Government House was occupied last year for a longer period than the Sydney Government House.  the Victorians growled about the absence of the Governor General, I thought that he - was longer in Sydney than in Melbourne. Is not £ 1 5 0 a bit stiff, any way ? It is more than nine out of ten of my constituents have to live on in a year. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 24 (Miscellaneous)-£89,522 .",67
587,Mr BROW N,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I notice that provision is made for expenses in connection with choosing the site of the capital of the Commonwealth. Last year £1,500 was voted, and the expenditure amounted to £3,451. This year it is proposed to appropriate £1,500, and I should like to know if that amount is intended to partly cover the cost of the parliamentary inspection ?",67
588,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"No ; that was provided for last year. This year's vote will cover the cost of the Commission of Experts who reported upon the Capital Sites, and the preparation of the plans, <fcc.",67
589,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Does the item cover the whole cost of the Commission ?,67
590,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We shall make it go as far as possible.,67
591,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"North S y d n e y ) think that the Minister should give a reply to the 'question asked by the honourable member for Canobolas. Apparently, £3,451' was expended last year, and the two items of £1,500 each for this year and last year - would not be sufficient tocover that total.",67
592,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The difference between the £1,500 voted last year and the amount actually expended will be provided for in the Supplementary Estimates, which will be brough t down in a day or two. The £ 1,500 which .honourable members are now. asked to vote will be expended upon the Capital Sites Commission, and very little, if any more, money - will be required.",67
593,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Honourable members have already pointed out that no provision is made for any further expenditure in connection with the selection of the Capital Site, and I do not wish to argue that matter.. I should like to ask the Minister a question regarding the item "" Expenses in connection with the introduction of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, including preparation and printing of electoral rolls and electoral registration, £30,000."" Does that include the amount paid to the Electoral Commissioners who divided the States? I should like to know how much of that amount is intended to meet expenditure which has been rendered useless by the rejection of the distributions ?",67
594,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The total cost would represent only a few hundred pounds.,67
595,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Would that include the cost of the collection made by the police ?,67
596,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,That has nothing to do with the rejection of the distributions.,67
597,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,In the case of New South Wales we adopted the State rolls.,67
598,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Yes ; but further collections were made by the police.,67
599,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The rolls were collected by the State' Government who gave us the benefit of the work done for them.,67
600,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I understand that the police made a collection for the purposes of the State in the first place, and that it was agreed that half the cost would be paid by the Commonwealth. Through some mistake, however, that 'collection was not made on the basis of the Federal franchise, and consequently had to be rejected as useless.",67
601,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Why was the first collection valueless ? -! Mr THOMSON - Because it was abandoned, and a fresh collection had to be made.",67
602,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But that had nothing to do with the rejection of the distribution proposed by the Electoral Commissioner.,67
603,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The Minister must know that in the first place the rolls were compiled upon the basis of the State franchise only, and that since then a fresh collection has been made.",67
604,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Onl y of the names of those who came under the Federal franchise, but not under the State franchise.",67
605,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But a complete collection was necessary in order to ascertain the extent to which the original lists were at fault. I know that the whole of the lists had to be re-collected on the basis of the Federal franchise.,67
606,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,But that had nothing to do with the distribution made by the Electoral Commissioner.,67
607,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,The faulty nature of the first collection was one of the causes which led to the rejection of the distribution. The whole of the ground had to be gone over again after the Commonwealth had agreed to pay half the cost of the first collection.,67
608,Sir GEOKGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I am told that there was no definite arrangement that Commonwealth should pay half the cost.,68
609,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I am otherwise informed. The Commonwealth will certainly pay a share of the cost of making the last collection.,68
610,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Yes .,68
611,Mr THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,I should like the Minthat ister to give us some idea of the cost collection and also of the amounts paid the Electoral Commissioners.,68
612,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The Electoral Comisdeputy sioners for New South Wales and Victoria received £ 1 0 0 each ; the Commissioners South Australia and Queensland, £ 7 5 each; and the Commissioners for Tasmania and matter. Western Australia, £ 5 0 each.",68
613,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I do not the quite understand the item relating to - the cost of introducing the Commonwealth compiled Electoral Act. Last year £35,000 was voted, and only £1,840 was expended. This year £30,000 is asked for, and this amount will include the expenses in connection with the introduction of the Commonwealth Act, including the preparation and printing electoral rolls and electoral registration. diately. Then the cost of the elections is estimated at £45,000.",68
614,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,That is a distinct item.,68
615,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Do I understand that the £30,000 is intended to cover the cost preparing the rolls, and of providing the necessary machinery for the conduct of the elections ?",68
616,Sir GEORGE TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Yes . It is practione cally a revote of the £35,000, less the savings which we hope to effect.",68
617,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"The explanation of the Treasurer dissipates some of the doubts which I entertained in respect of this ticular item. At the same time, I should like to know whether the cost of pointment of divisional registrars, for the purpose of carrying out the machinery the Act, is included in it ?",68
618,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,Yes .,68
619,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,What steps have been taken towards the appointment of those this direction. officers ?,68
620,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,We propose to apwe point them veiy shortly. 10 0 2,68
621,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"We have been told that ever since the Electoral A ct was passed. Seeing that one of these officers has to be. appointed in connection with every polling the booth throughout the Commonwealth, it seems to me that the Department would be wise if it expedited its work in this direction. Otherwise the necessary machinery will not be ready in time for the conduct of. the approaching elections. So far, the compilation of the rolls has been left in the hands of the local police, and I presume those officers will be permanently of the charged with that duty. In New South to - Wales, however, the work of compiling and purging the rolls has been intrusted to electoral registrars, who are appointed for that purpose in every division. for I should like to know the intentions of the Government in regard to this important",68
622,Mr KNOX,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L," I recognise that Minister is at a considerable disadvantage, inasmuch as his colleague, who actually these Estimates, is not present. I have the greatest sympathy witli the view which has been expressed, by various, honourable members, that these deputy returning officers should be appointed without delay. What the Committee require is an assurance of that the matter will be dealt with imme",68
623,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,It is being dealt with. If the honourable member will ask me about it this day week he will find that the work has been completed.,68
624,Mr KNOX,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"I hope that accompanying of their appointment will be an advertisement in the morning newspapers intimating where the rolls can be seen and where the various Registrars can be consulted. There is only other item to which I desire to direct attention, namely, "" Cost of compilation and publication of a new edition of thei Seven Colonies, £500."" I am sure that that amount has been very wisely expended. I parshould like to know what steps are being taken towards placing the Statistical Dethe appartment upon a better basis.",68
625,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"Nothin g has yet been of done, but we are thinking about the matter.",68
626,Mr KNOX,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNA L,"It is important that some effective arrangement should be made in If we can work in harmony with the different States, probably,, may effect a considerable saving, and, afc the same time, secure a more reliable statistical production.
