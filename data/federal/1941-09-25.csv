1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. M. Nairn.) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. PUBLIO ADMINISTRATION. USE OF INTELLIGENCE SERVICE FUNDSNA COMMISSION.",12
2,Mr CURTIN,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL," by leave-The Prime Minister (Mr Fadden) announced, in the course of the statement that he made yesterday in connection with the use of the fund established for a special purpose in February, 1940, that if there were any matters in respect of which there was need for fuller statement and explanation, the Government would be willing to set up a royal commission to conduct an investigation. I then said that, on the facts, it was my view that a case had been made out that there had heen a wrong use of this fund. It is quite conceivable, however, that the known facts do not disclose all of the facts. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway), with my authority, last night made it clear that the Labour party would welcome the appointment of a royal commission if, as was alleged-and the allegations are repeated today-al l of the facts were not before the House. It is our view, of course, that on the admitted facts there was a case to justify the assertion that the fund had br-en put to a wrong use. The position today is, that the Miners Federation feels that the honour of a number of its officials may be involved, that their trustworthiness and integrity arc suspect, and they ask- I think quite properly-that a royal commission should he set up in order that, where there is guilt, it shall be established, and where there is no guilt there shall he clear exoneration of those whose names are being bandied about. Without elaborating the matter, I ask the Prime Minister to set up a royal commission to investigate and report upon all of the circumstances associated with expenditure from the fund established for a special purpose in February, 1940.",12
3,Mr FADDEN,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL," by leave-The request of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) is consistent with the offer that I made yesterday on behalf of the Government, to set up a royal commission to conduct an investigation of this matter; consequently, the Government has no hesitation in agreeing to that course. I shall be pleased to discuss with the Leader of the Opposition the terms of reference to the royal commission.",12
4,Mr AROHIE CAMERON,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"Will the Prime Minister, before appointing a royal commission to inquire into disbursements from the secret intelligence fund, submit to the House the terms of reference under which the commission is to work?",12
5,Mr FADDEN,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"The honourable member's request ""will receive the consideration of the Government.",12
6,Mr JAMES,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL," by leaveProbably every honourable member has known read in the press that the miners have taken up the attitude that if this matter is not expeditiously dealt with they will bring about a general stoppage of work throughout Australia, because so many of their officials are at present under suspicion. That suspicion has been fastened upon them by the references of the Attorney-General (Mr. Hughes) to an alleged interview between him and Mr Nelson and some mysterious and unidentified third person. When officials of the Miners Eederation interviewed the Attorney-General last week on this matter the right honourable gentleman mentioned the third person by name. A member of the deputation said to the Minister: "" Take a good look at me and say whether you have ever seen ine before "" ; the Attorney-General replied, "" I am not sure; I am doubtful"". The man then said to him, ""Well, I am the man whom you mentioned "". I should like the Government to state, before the House adjourns this week, who is to he appointed to the royal commission, and what are to be the terms of reference. Those terms should be broad. We do not want any ""white-washing"" of the Government in connection with the charges brought by honourable members on this side of the House. Last night I advocated the appointment of a royal commission, but if the Government is going to delay the investigation, or allow it to be unduly protracted, I fear that there will be grave industrial unrest involving, not only the miners, but also members of other unions, because it is alleged that moneys were paid by the Australian Democratic Front to union officials other than those of the Miners Federation. Mr MoCALL - Will the Prime Minister give an assurance that the terms of reference of the royal commission will be sufficiently wide to cover an investigation of the circumstances which led up to the disclosure of the information placed before the Leader of the Opposition, and particularly of the activities of Mr. Winkler, and the telephone conversations he had with various persons?",12
7,Mr FADDEN,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"As I - said to the Leader of the Opposition, the terms of reference will be consistent with the request which'he made as a result of the offer made by the Government yesterday, and will be submitted to him for consideration.",13
8,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"Has a decision yet been made for the arrest of Mr Joseph Winkler, or for the laying of a charge against him under the Official Secrets Act or any other Commonwealth law?",13
9,Mr FADDEN,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,The matter is receiving attention.,13
10,Mr WARD,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"In view of the refusal of the Government to furnish to Parliament during the discussion of the operations of the secret fund all papers and documents relating to the matter for fear of what they might disclose and whom they migb t involve, will the Prime Minister give to the House a guarantee that all sueh documents will be made available to the royal commission when it is making inquiries? Will he also assure the House that the sittings of the royal commission will be open to the public, and that none of the proceedings will be heard in camera, in order that the public will be fully aware of what has happened regarding the operations of this "" graft "" fund.",13
11,Mr FADDEN,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"I am yet to be convinced that the Government withheld from the House any document, any statement, or any fact regarding this matter. I have already stated on two occasions that the Government will discuss with the Leader of the Opposition the terms of reference of the royal commission.",13
12,Mr MCCALL,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"Will the Prime Minister inform me whether I correctly understood the Attorney-General to have said that no action can be taken against Winkler until the Leader of the Opposition has laid, a charge? Does the Leader of the Opposition subscribe to that view?",13
13,Mr FADDEN,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,The impossibility of my being able to say whether the honourable member correctly understood the Attorney-General must be obvious.,13
14,Mr CALWELL,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"Will the Prime Minister make the terms of reference Of the commission sufficiently wide to include an inquiry into the allegation that the budget, not yet presented to this Parliament, has already been shown to a number of persons who are not entitled to see it?",13
15,Mr FADDEN,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,In order to answer that question I should have to know from the honourable member definitely who has made that allegation.,13
16,Mr WARD,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"I ask the Prime Minister whether, when inquiries were being made into the leakage of confidential Government information, any checks were made of the telephone calls made by Mr J. Winkler, ex-assistant publicity officer of the Prime Minister's Department. If so, will he furnish the names of the persons to whom the calls were made, and has the Government any knowledge as to the matters that were discussed during those conversations? Did they have any reference to disbursements from the secret fund, or did they refer to matters connected with the budget? Further, is it a fact that one of the telephone calls made was to a Mr Ricketson, who is connected with the stock broking firm of J. B. Were and Company, of which the former Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) was at one time a director, and during the course of this conversation did Winkler say to Ricketson that he",13
17,Mr SPEAKER,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"Order ! The honourable member is giving information, not asking a question.",13
18,Mr WARD,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"I am asking whether this took place. Mr SPEAKER,-The honourable member must be reasonably brief.",13
19,Mr WARD,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"In the course of this conversation, did Winkler indicate that he had interviewed certain people and that the views that they had expressed",14
20,Mr SPEAKER,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,Order ! This is in the nature of comment. The honourable member must know that questions in .such form are not permissible.,14
21,Mr FADDEN,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,No doubt the honourable member will be afforded every facility to appear as a witness ancl give evidence before the royal commission. Later:,14
22,Mr MCCALL,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"I ask the Prime Minister whether the terms of reference to the royal commission will be sufficiently wide to comply with the public demand that inquiries shall be made into the motives for Winkler's treachery, and also into the reason which actuated Winkler in attempting seriously to damage the personal prestige of the honourable man, and bring about the fall of his Government?",14
23,Mr FADDEN,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"I am sure that the royal commission, and every one else, including myself, would be glad to ascertain the motives of Mr Winkler.",14
24,Mr MCCALL,APPOINTMENT OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL,"I hope that the terms of reference will be wide enough to enable the royal commission to make such an inquiry. NA OF WAR,",14
25,Mr BARNARD,EMPLOYMENT OP PRISONERS,"I ask the Minister for War Organization of Industry whether it is a fact, as has been reported in the daily press, that war prisoners to be employed upon afforestation, useful form of occupation? If so, has the honourable gentleman any plans cerning the States in which these men to be employed, and can he say whether Tasmania is to share in the enterprise?",14
26,Mr SPOONER,EMPLOYMENT OP PRISONERS,"My attention was debated ? drawn last week to a statement in a Melbourne newspaper to the effect that a report was being prepared for me dealthe ing with the employment of war a prisoners upon afforestation and water 122] conservation. I have only to say that such a report is not being prepared for me, and that I have no knowledge of the matter. NA BROADCASTING.

27,Mr RIORDAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON,"Has the P.vime Minister received from the Man-power and Resources Survey Committee a report upon its investigation of conditions in Queensland? As the report of the committee upon evidence taken in that State is vital to its f.iture well-being, when will the Government give consideration to it ancl make it available gentle- to honourable members?",14
28,Mr FADDEN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON,"As a fellow Queenslander, I am just as enthusiastic as is the honourable member concerning the welfare of Queensland; consequently, immediately the report was received within the last 48 hours it was sent to the appropriate authority for perusal and comment.",14
29,Mr ROSEVEAR,JOINT COMMITTEE ON,"The first two reports submitted by the Man-power Resources and Survey Committee have become the subject of reports to the Government by departmental officers, and these comments were sent to members of the committee marked "" Secret"". Is it the intention of the Minister for Defence Co-ordination to rc-assemble the arc members of the original Man-power and as a Resources Survey Committee who made the reports in order to discuss with them conthe submissions of the departmental arc officers upon which the Government is expected to act? Alternatively, is he prepared to place both reports before Parliament in order that they may be",14
30,Mr MENZIES,JOINT COMMITTEE ON,"The second part of honourable member's question involves matter which only Cabinet can decide. As to the first part, I point out that two members of the original committee are now in the Cabinet, and my own jurisdiction over them has ceased.",14
31,Mr MORGAN,JOINT COMMITTEE ON,"The statement has been made by the. Prime Minister that the report of the Commonwealth Man-power and Resources Survey Committee on Queensland, which, has beeu received during the last 48 hours, will be dealt with promptly. Some months ago, the committee submitted reports dealing with New South Wales and Victoria. Has the Prime Minister seen those reports? If he has, does he propose to adopt the recommendations contained therein? Will he lay the reports on the table of the House?",15

36,Mr SPENDER,RKOKUITIKO RTOHT OF VOLUNTEERS TO,"As to the first part of the question I do not believe that the lack of recruits for the Australian Imperial Force is due to the reason suggested. As to the second part, I shall not give consideration to declaring the wheat belts exempt from compnlsory military training. I should like the honourable member to place the third part of his question on the notice-paper.",15
37,Mr BLAIN,RKOKUITIKO RTOHT OF VOLUNTEERS TO,"Is the Minister for the Army in possession of any information which would indicate that the lag of enlistments in the Australian Imperial Force fromfchelarger towns in the wheat growing areas is occasioned by the fact that the residents of those districts have swallowed subversive doctrines for many yours, whilst many honourable members have done nothing to counteract this",15
38,Mr SPENDER,RKOKUITIKO RTOHT OF VOLUNTEERS TO,"I have no doubt whatever that the spreading of subversive propaganda has had. some effect on rePrecisely what that effect has been I am not able to determine.

51,Mr SPENDER,MONITIONS PRODUCTION I N,"My recollection is that the newspaper reports stated that one-third of the number of men called up for military training in Australia were to be exempted-no t only those who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. That, I think, is approximately correct. place The number of exemptions granted in respect of those engaged in rural industries is large. In one particular instance, of 140 men called up, over 100 were exempted because they were engaged in the dairying industry, and could make Minister for out a special case.",16
52,Mr BOSEVEAB,MONITIONS PRODUCTION I N,"If it be true that to in some cases compulsory military have been selected to remain in for the duration of the war by having their names picked out of a hat, does the Minister for the Army think that that system of selection is more judicious than an inquiry into the affairs of the trainees in order to choose those who, from the point of view of hardship, are best able",16

55,Mr SPENDER,MONITIONS PRODUCTION I N,"The call up of 25 per cent, of the Australian Militia Force for continuous duty is sanctioned by the provisions of the Defence Act. The question as to how these men should be chosen, whether by ballot or by selection, was answered by me earlier in reply to the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear). The selections must be made by the officers, who are given directions by a higher command, because they are acquainted with the qualifications of the men under their command.

59,Mr SCULLY,UNLICENSED WIRELESS,Las t week I asked a question of the Postmaster-General on the subject of the excessive fines imposed on residents of the northern districts of New South Wales for failing to take out wireless listeners' licences. Has the Postmaster-General had those cases investigated ? Is it the policy of his department to ask for very heavy fines for breaches of the regulations?,17
60,Mr COLLINS,UNLICENSED WIRELESS,"This matter has been brought under my notice by other honourable members, including the Acting Minister for Commerce (Mr Abbott). The fines were imposed by a magistrate on persons charged with using wireless sets without holding licences. It is not policy, neither is it the desire, of the Department to intrude harshness into any of its for activities, but it is the duty of the If department to seek out those persons who a illegally use wireless sets, and refuse to a purchase licences. When people are found to be indulging in this illegal the State magistrate, who hears in the case, imposes a fine in accordance with what he considers to be the seriousness of the offence. People who have not At purchased a listener's licence have no more right to use a wireless set than they have to travel in a train without a ticket. They are committing a breach of the law, ancl it is the duty of the Govern the ment to check up on them. Honourable members who receive complaints from rheir constituents about the harshness of fines imposed upon them should take the matter direct to the Commonwealth Attorney-General, who will deal with each case on its merits.

66,Mr FADDEN,WHEAT STABILIZATION,"Whils t I have no knowledge of the news item which the honourable member read, I am fully aware of an accumulation of sugar awaiting export.

83,Mr ROSEVEAR,FOSTARS SHOES PROPRIETARY,"Is the Minister for Transport aware that the office in Sydney which controls the matter of petrol supplies makes, in respect of all representations for an increased quota, a. stock reply in which it ""passes the buck"" to the Commonwealth authority? Has the Commonwealth in view or in operation a scheme for the zoning of the State of New South Wales, and the issue of a varying ration according to other transport facilities available, particularly in the far south coastal districts, which are not served by rail transport ancl at present have no shipping facilities?",19
84,Mr ANTHONY,FOSTARS SHOES PROPRIETARY,"A scheme of the character mentioned has already been put in operation on the far south coast. Lengthy journeys by motor transport from, I think. Nowra to distant points on the south coast have been prohibited, goods for that urea having to be sent by rail to the nearest point, which. I believe is on the Cooma line. The result of this is a very considerable saving of ihe use of petrol. Consideration is being given to the adoption of a similar course in other areas. TASMANIAN STEAMER EASES.",20

91,Mr DRAKEFORD,FOSTARS SHOES PROPRIETARY,"Is the Minister for Transport aware of the acute shortage of coal reserves in Victoria ? Can he say whether this is due to the fact that an unusually large proportion of the coal produced is being held in reserve in New South Wales ? If so, and having in mind the shortage of shipping, and the failure of the Government to attempt to overcome the difficulties caused by the break of railway gauge between Victoria and .Vow South Wales, will the honourable gentleman make some effective provision '-.i cii'iuT that Victoria receives its fair proportion of the coal produced?",20
92,Mr ANTHONY,FOSTARS SHOES PROPRIETARY,"I am aware of the coal shortage in Victoria. There is also an acute shortage in South Australia. The position has not been caused by the retention of undue supplies to strengthen reserves in New South Wales for the reserves in that State are much smaller than they should be, having in mind the security of the country. The difficulties have arisen through the dislocation of the coal-mining industry and the consequent non-production of coal. That is the reason for the shortage of coal in Melbourne at present. Wo are hoping that the position will be rectified in consequence of the cessation of the strike in the South Maitland .railway area. Unfortunately it will take some time to correct the acute shortage owing to difficulties in of relation to shipping and to the handling of heavy parcels of coal on the railway system.",20

95,Mr ANTHONY,FOSTARS SHOES PROPRIETARY,"There is no necessity for the Government to provide additional financial assistance for the building of wooden ships, for private enterprise already has ample opportunity to supply that need.

Ordered to be printed, and referred to Committee of Supply. BUDGET 1941-42. In Committee of Supply:",21
98,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH AIRCRAFT,"Darling Downs-Trea surer) [3.34] - It is my responsibility to present to honourable members the public accounts for the second year of the war, ancl to submit the Government's plans for financing an ever-expanding war effort. This year, war finance must dominate our financial policy more than ever. It is hardly necessary for me to remind honourable members that the real costs of war have to be met by the mobilization of our man-power and resources, ancl by the united efforts of all of us to supply our fighting forces with food, equipment, and munitions. This remains the central problem, whatever financial policy we adopt. Accordingly, the Government has framed its policy in order to expedite this mobilization of resources. The limits to our war effort are set by the supply of labour, materials and equipment at our disposal, and by our willingness to divert these resources, where required, to war needs. Financial policy, as I see it, should aim, so far as is possible by financial means(a) to bring into work the whole of the physical resourced which are available; (b) to promote the diversion of resources from civil to war BUimposes ; (<:) to distribute equitably the sacrifices made necessary by this diversion. It is in the lisrht of these principles that I ask honourable members to exam inrhonorancl judge the Government's plans. Before dealing with the details of the budget for 1941-42, I shall review very briefly the results of the year 1940-41. REVIEW OF 1940-41. Revenue Account. The revenue account for last year showed an exact balance, because the whole of the receipts, after meeting ordinary expenditure, were applied to war purposes. The amount so applied was £65,091,000, au increase of £3,106,000 over the budget estimate. This increase was clue partly to revenue being greater than was expected, and partly to savings of non-war expenditure. On the revenue side, the budget proposals provided for increases of taxation, amounting to £29.350.000. With these increases total revenue from taxation was estimated at £124,575,000. Actual collections were £125.3S4.000. Income tax yielded £39,315,000. or £1,815,000 above the estimate. Customs ancl excise revenue showed an increase of £780,000 over the estimate. On the other hand, war-time company tax and super tax .yielded ±1,010,000 less than had heen anticipated. The collections from sales rax and .estate duties also fell short of the estimates. The total revenue from all sources amounted to £150,482,000. On the expenditure side, the cost of non-war services amounted to £S5,391,000, or £947,000 less than the estimate. Details of actual revenue and expenditure are given in tahle 1. War Expenditure 1940-41. When the budget was brought down, it was estimated that the war expenditure from all sources would reach £186,000,000, viz., £143,000,000 in Australia and £43,000,000 overseas. The actual net expenditure proved to be £170,000,000, of which £127,000.000 was in Australia and £43,000,000 'overseas. This £16,000,000 below the budget estimate. The actual gross expenditure, however, was £1S1,000,000. rhe extra £11,000,000 representing expenditure on work and supplies from Australia for other governments which was recovered during the year. In financing this war expenditure, WR were fortunate to commence the year with a cash balance of £28,000,000. Revenue provided £65,000,000 ancl 'the balance of £77,000,000 came from loans raised during the course of the year; £15,000,000 was borrowed from the British Government, and approximately £62,000,000 came from loans raised in Australia. Loan Transactions and Public Debt. War finance has substantially affected the debt position during the last year. Two public loans were raised in Australia during the year, aggregating £64,000,000. Of this sum, about £48,000,000 was applied to war purposes and the balance nf £16,000,000 to Loan Council programmes. In order to encourage people to invest in Commonwealth loans, and to provide a means for subscription during the time when loans are not open, a system, of advance subscriptions to loans was inaugurated in March, 1941. This arrangement has been very successful. The support of war savings certificates continued throughout the year, particularly from war savings groups in factories, shops ancl offices. Certificates to a face value of £15,318,000 were taken up, bringing the total since the inception of the scheme to approximately £23,000,000. Further interest-free loans and gifts were also received, bringing the totals to the end of June from these two sources to £5.515.000 ancl £997,000 respectively. Two large conversion operations were successfully carried out in London during the year. A loan of the States for £.13.470,000, due on the 1st October, 1941, was the subject of a short-term conversion offer at 3 per cent. About two-thirds of the loan was converted, and the balance was paid off by the sinking fund with assistance from the Commonwealth Bank. This paved the way for a larger operation to convert optional loans of £30.000,000, representing debt of the Commonwealth and the States, carrying was interest at 4f per cent, and 5 per cent, per annum. The new securities were issued at. £99, with an interest rate of of per cent.; thus, the conversion will result in a saving of interest to the governments concerned of £434,000 per annum. No new cash was accepted; and the Government is grateful for temporary assistance provided by the British Govc-rnmont, which enabled the Commonwealth Bank to take up £6,500,000..worth of stock not converted. The statutory contributions from revenue for the redemption of debt by the Commonwealth and the States are being carried out-on an' increasing scale. Last year £12.89S,000 was provided, and in the current year it is expected that £14,000,000 will be available for these services. The aggregate debt of the Commonwealth and the States at the 30th June, 1941, reached £1,426,000,000, being £510,000,000 for the Commonwealth and £916,000,000 for the States. The increase during the year was £85,200,000, namely: Commonwealth £74,900,000, ancl States £10,300,000. ESTIMATED REVENUE 1941-42. I turn now to the estimates of revenue for 1941-42. On the basis of present rates of taxation, it is estimated that the total revenue from all sources will reach £163,227,000, compared with actual revenue last year of £150,482,000, an increase of almost £13,000,000. A substantial part of this increase is explained by a new item, "" pay-roll tax "", which was imposed to meet a portion of the cost of child endowment. This tax is estimated to yield £8,000,000. In other items, allowance has been made for a full year's collections in respect of taxes which were introduced with the Budget last November. Income tax and war-time company tax are expected to yield £49,050,000, or an increase of £5,745,000. Substantial increases are also expected from excise and sales tax. On the other side of the picture, a sharp decline of £9,000,000 is expected in customs revenue, due partly to restrictions we have imposed on non-essential imports and partly to difficulties of supply and shipping. Details of the estimated revenue are given in table 3. ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE (OTHER THA N WAR) 1941-42. Last year, the actual expenditure on all services other than war, amounted to £85,391,000. This year, the estimate is £102,306,000, an increase of £16,915,000. Child Endowment. This increase is predominantly due to the Commonwealth child endowment scheme, which commenced on the 1st July last, and is expected to cost £13,000,000. Invalid and Old-age Pensions. Invalid and old-age pensions are expected to cost £1,384,000 more in the current year than in 1940-41. The increased cost is mainly due to the liberalization of pensions announced in the last Budget, by which a general increase of 2s. per fortnight was granted in December, 1940, followed by a further increase of ls. per fortnight in April, 1941, because of an increase in the index of retail prices. The Government has now decided that in the payment of invalid pensions, £210s. instead of £1 10s. per week shall be considered adequate maintenance for each parent and adult dependant of a family of which a claimant for an invalid person is a member; each child under sixteen years being taken as equivalent to half an adult. This accounts for an additional expenditure of £50,000. Assistance to Primary Producers. Owing to shipping difficulties, the United Kingdom has been obliged to Mr Fadden. reduce substantially contracts for the purchase of Australian foodstuffs. This has created the need for drastic reorganization of many of our export industries. The commodities chiefly affected are meat,, dairy produce iand eggs. Details of the Government's reorganization schemes will be given to the House by my colleague, the Acting Minister for Commerce, but it is worthy of note here that the budget provides for substantial expenditure by the. Government for the expansion of cold storage, for the re-equipment of factories to change over from the production of butter to that of cheese, and for the drying of eggs. These plans will involve the Government in expenditure, largely of a capital nature, exceeding £500,000 in 1941-42. Provision is made also for an estimated loss of £1,400,000 arising out of the apple and pear acquisition scheme. An amount, of £750,000 is provided for the estimated cost of a subsidy to rural producers in the form of a reduction of the price of superphosphate. Mortgage Bank. The Royal Commission on Banking drew attention to a deficiency in our financial structure in - the lack of facilities for long-term borrowing. In 1938, a bill was introduced into the House to set up a Mortgage Banking Department of the Commonwealth Bank. The passage of the bill was delayed while the Government endeavoured to meet representations by certain State Government instrumentalities .which were themselves providing loans on mortgages. Before these negotiations were completed, the urgent and pressing problems of war administration fully occupied the Government's attention. The Government is, however, conscious that the problems created for rural producers by the war have increased the need for action to be taken to provide facilities for long-term borrowing. The Government proposes, therefore, to introduce, as soon as practicable, legislation to establish a mortgage bank. Although State instrumentalities are already operating in this field, the Government believes that the existence of supplemental and coordinating Commonwealth authority will give added strength to existing State institutions. The development of the mortgage bank will be of a progressive character, and the extent of its development will depend to a considerable degree on war requirements being first satisfied. The Government believes that the mortgage bank will be a valuable addition to the finance facilities of rural industry, and that, when firmly established, it will provide adequate - long-term credit to sound borrowers at reasonable rates of interest. Payments to States - immediately Special grants to certain States will be made in accordance with the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which has been adopted by the Government, and has been tabled for the information of members. The payments recommended compare with those for the previous year thus:South Australia .. 1,000.000 . . .1,150.000 Western Australia G50.00O . . Tasmania 400,000 . . 520,000 Total .. .. 2,050,000 . . 2.300,000 In respect of the grant to South Australia, however, the commission has recommended that, in addition to the amount of £1,150,000, a sum of £250,000 which, in normal circumstances, would have been included in the grant, should be held over until 1942-43, because of the present improved economic position of that State and a probable reduction of the normal grant next year. The Government will bring down legislation shortly to give effect to the recommendations of the Grants Commission. Other Increases. The remaining items of expenditure show a net increase of £680,000. Details are given in Table No. 2. PUBIJC WOBKS. In 1941-42, the Government plans to spend from all sources £24,000,000 on defence works, compared with an actual expenditure of £18,100,000 in 1940-41. The Loan Council borrowing, including semi-government and local government, was reduced from £24,000,000 in 1940-41 to a programme of £20,000,000 for 1941-42. The carrying out of the works for both defence and civil purposes provided for in this programme will place a serious strain upon the resources available, which have already been depleted by enlistments and transfers to other war work. Reducing civil works expenditure is one of the easiest forms of diversion of resources to war as it makes no cut in civil consumption. Now that public works are not required to maintain employment, loan expenditure should be limited to works that are of defence value or are and urgently necessary for civil purposes. The reduction that has been brought about hy the Loan Council decision is a step in this direction. Special consideration was, however, given to the position of States in which war expenditure was relatively small. In spite of this reduction, total expenditure on public works will still exceed that .1940-41. 1041-41!. of last year and will be considerably £ £ higher than in pre-war years. In 1941-42 630,000 the estimated expenditure on ""Works, Defence and Loan Council, including semi-government and local government, is £46,000,000, compared with an actual expenditure of £45,000,000 in 1940-41, ancl of £36,000,000 in the last pre-war year. Our war programme now requires both increasing resources ancl additional finance. In order to carry out this programme it will be necessary to keep civil works to a minimum, ancl this will require the full co-operation of State Governments ancl semi-governmental authorities. ESTIMATED WAR EXPENDITURE 1941-42. I now come to the crux of the budget- . our war proposals, and the manner in which they will be financed. Our war programme has so expanded that in the present year it will be almost double what it was in 1940-41. The full increase will not be reflected in the amount which we have to finance, because we expect to receive substantial assistance from the United States of America under the Lease-Lend Act in the form of essential war equipment which could not be produced in Australia or obtained elsewhere. Despite this assistance, the total cost of war expenditure to be budgeted for is estimated at £217,000,000, compared with £170,000,000 last year. Heavy expenditure must be incurred in the maintenance of our fighting forces both overseas and in Australia. We must equip ancl maintain additional forces now being raised. Munitions factories and annexes are nOw producing on a large scale, and a steadily rising flow of arms, ammunition, equipment ancl supplies is reaching all Services. In addition, extensive programmes of naval construction and aircraft production are in progress. These features illustrate the all-round expansion which has taken place in all phases of war activity. I am satisfied that' the estimate of £217,000,000 is conservative. The original estimates submitted by the Departments have been substantially reduced to avoid any risk of overstatement, and it may well be found necessary during the year to provide additional finance. In presenting the war estimates this year we have consolidated all defence and war votes in one group, which will be found in the ordinary estimates of expenditure, page 40. The subdivision as between. revenue and loan is confined to totals only. This arrangement will present a clearer picture than last year, when the detailed votes were subdivided between ordinary ancl loan estimates. EXPENDITURE IN AUSTRALIA. The estimated expenditure in Australia to be budgeted for is £160,000,000. Soldiers' Pay. At this point it is appropriate to announce that the Government has recently reviewed the rates of pay of members of the forces, and certain increases involving an annual cost of about £6,000,000, including deferred pay, have been decided upon. Details are as follows:Deferred Pay - It has been decided to increase the pay of members of the following forces by ls. a day, which will be credited as deferred pay and will accrue as from the date of this announcement :Australian Imperial Force overseas. Australian Imperial Force in Australia with less than six months' service. Royal Australian Navy (Sea-going). Royal Australian Air Force on special force rates of pay. ilr. Faddtn. Home Defence Military Forces on special force rates of pay called up or enlisted for continuous duty, who have completed six months' service. Members of the Royal Australian Air Force who embark for overseas will be credited with an additional ls. a day deferred pay for any period of service in Australia in excess of six months. This will give them equality with the Australian Imperial Force. Members of the Royal Australian Air Force and Home Defence Military Forces on special force rates of pay, serving at an operational station such as Darwin will receive a special credit to bring their total deferred pay .rate to 2s. a day for the period of service there. Members of the Australian Imperial Force already receive this credit. The effect, of this decision may be illustrated in the case of the Australian Imperial Force. A member in Australia with less than six months' service will receive Is. a day deferred pay; on completion of six months' service in Australia, or on transfer to an operational station, a member will receive 2s. a day, and when serving overseas, 3s. a day. Domestic Allowance - Las t year a domestic allowance of 7s. a week was granted to married men with one dr more, children. In addition, the allowance in respect of each child was increased from Is. to ls. 6d. a clay. Married men without children received no additional benefits. It has now been decided to grant an additional allowance of 3s. 6d. a week to married members of the forces without children. This will be payable to the wife, ancl will increase her allowance to 24s. 6d. a week. It will apply to members of the Australian Imperial Force, Royal Australian Navy (Seagoing), ancl Royal Australian Air Force and Home Defence Military Forces on snecial force rates of pay. and will take effect from the commencement of. the. next allotment period. NON-SERVICE WAR EXPENDITURE. In addition to heavy expenditure in Australia on the maintenance and equipment of our fighting forces, there are items of expenditure in many fields only indirectly connected with war production in the narrow sense. The following are items of this kind:Munitions Workers' Housing. - To meet the special needs of munitions workers, the Government has already engaged in extensive building operations. It has now set up a housing trust to carry out this work in the future. Advances will be made to State instrumentalities, but where necessary the Government will continue to undertake building on its' own account, using existing instrumentalities as construction agents wherever possible. Shipbuilding. Work is in progress on a comprehensive programme of merchant shipbuilding. This will involve the Government in expenditure of £1,000,000 on buildings, plant and equipment, and of £1,700,000 on construction. Substitute Fuels. The Government is pressing on with comprehensive plans for reducing Australia's dependence upon imported petrol. These plans provide for the development of local oil resources, the establishment of extensive power alcohol distilleries, and the stimulation of the use of producer gas. Total outlay on these activities in the form of direct expenditure ancl of assistance to private companies for developmental work will possibly reach £800,000 in 1941-42. Flax Development. The Government will expend more than £300,000 this year on buildings, plant ancl machinery in the establishment of flax mills in order to deal with the greatly expanded flax crop which is being produced this year to meet the United Kingdom requirements. WORK FOR OTHER GOVERNMENTS. The estimate of £160,000,000 of expenditribution ture does not convey a full picture of total war work to be performed in tralia. ""We have undertaken to provide, a wide range of war materials, &c, the United Kingdom, Empire and Allied Governments. The value of this work estimated in round figures at £55,000,000. It is anticipated that £49,000,000 will recovered during the year from the Goappreciable vernments concerned; consequently no provision for this sum is necessary budget. The payment, however, does not reduce the physical strain on our resources. Thus a better picture of the demands on our productive war capacity is obtained by comparing our estimated gross expenditure in Australia of £209,000,000 with the actual expenditure last year of £136,000,000. OVERSEAS WAR EXPENDITURE. Overseas war expenditure is estimated at £57,000,000, compared with £43,000,000 in 1940-41. This £57,000,000 of overseas expenditure requires finance, but for the most part it makes no call on Australian resources. The physical resources required are supplied by the United Kingdom. On the other hand, we are doing £55,000,000 worth of work for other Governments', which does not require budget finance, but does make a call on our physical resources. The two amounts roughly balance, so that we are doing for Empire and Allied Governments about as much as the United Kingdom is doing for us. The work done for other Governments, taken by itself, has the same effect as our internal war expenditure in decreasing the amount of goods available for civil use in Australia. We cannot, grumble on that account when we know that other peoples are bearing a similar and rather greater burden on our account. This applies in particular to the United Kingdom, where the burden of war is now falling much more heavily than it will in Australia, even with the increased effort we are going to make in the year before us. Our capacity to finance our overseas war expenditure depends upon Australia possessing sufficient funds in London to provide the means of payment. Last year we were able to made a substantial confrom Australian resources, but the we still had to borrow £15,000,000 from Austhe United Kingdom Government. We have given the United Kingdom Governfor ment an undertaking to meet as much of our overseas expenditure as the level is of our London funds permits. Last year even after providing £2-8,000.000 for'this be purpose our London funds showed an increase. It is expected that in 1941-42, mainly because of the exports in the of goods to other governments, our London funds will increase sufficiently ro enable us to do without assistance from the United Kingdom Government. Insofar as we meet overseas war expenditure from our own resources it will be necessary for the Government to raise the money in Australia to purchase the necessary exchange. The need to raise this money must, therefore, be taken into account in considering our financial problem as a whole. FINANCIAL PROBLEM SUMMARIZED. At this point the financial problem that confronts us may be summarized thusTlie estimated war expenditure to lie budgeted for is.. The estimated revenue on the basis - of present taxation is .. 103,000,000 The expenditure on non-war services will be .. 102.000.000 Leaving a bn.tance for war purposes of .. 01.000,000 Cash balances at the beginning of . the year were approximately .. 2,000,000 The balance for which finance has still to be provided is therefore - In order to finance the war programme we have to find this sum. from sources spending on. war. other than existing taxation. Last year we financed £77,000,000 by loans] which £62,000,000 came from loans raised in Australia and £15,000.000 from the British Government. - In November, 1939, the Acting Treamately surer laid down the basis of the Governduction ment's financial policy in these words:. . . a balanced programme of taxation, borrowing from the public, and borrowing the banking system. The balance between these three methods of finance must change from time to time and the determining factors will be largely economic. To those general principles the Governthis ment still adheres. Accordingly, I proeffected pose now to review the economic outlook for 1941-42 so that we may see clearly the nature of our problem. Mr Fadden. OUTLOOK FOR 1941-42. The Government expects that the steady increase in the total level of economic activity will he maintained in 1941-42, and that this will be reflected in a further rise of the national income perhaps to £1,000 millions, compared with £925 millions in 1940-41 and £794 millions in the last pre-war year. The Government recognizes that every effort should be made to mobilize all the available resources, so that this total can be pushed as high as the physical limits of our available labour, materials; and equipment permit. In the Department of £ £ Labour and National Service, and in the newly-established Department of War Organization of Industry, the Govern217,000,000 ment has two departments which are actively co-operating to ensure that our resources shall be employed to the utmost. However effective their work, there is a limi t to the total production which can he achieved, and. the Government believes that our capacity will be strained, to achieve the output required. National income on the one side measures the total value of the production of goods and services in the country, including Government services and the 03,000,000 services of the fighting forces valued at cost. On the other side, with certain qualifications, it measures the amount of money available to the - community for spending on consumption or capital 154,000,000 goods. The community includes, of course, all governments, institutions and companies, and the spending includes This national income would normally of have been spent by the community-by governments, companies and individuals - in satisfaction of civil needs. Last year, however, a considerable part, approxi15 per cent., of the national prowas used by the Government for war purposes. It was necessary, therefore, that the community should refrain from fro m spending the same proportion of their total incomes so that it could be transferred to the Government. Our taxation plans provided for only a part of transfer. The balance had to be by voluntary savings, namely, by the community willingly foregoing its use of resources. These savings - reached ""the Government through subscriptions to loans, war savings certificates, or indirectly through the banks. In view of the large amount of resources which had to he quickly transferred to the war effort, it was necessary for the Government to take certain steps in order to ensure that resources of a suitable nature were released from civilian employment. Public expenditure on non-war capital projects has been reduced, and, since October, 1939, private expenditure of a capital nature has been subject to direct Treasury control on the advice of the Capital Issues Board. During last year, a more stringent control has been exercised over the raising of new money for purposes not associated with the war and not urgently necessary for essential civil purposes. This control has been extended to building operations, but all housing with the exception of purely luxury dwellings has continued to be free of restrictions. During 1940-41 restrictions on imported non-essentials have been applied to a wider range of commodities, and the use of exchange for purposes other than imports has been further limited. Because of the greatly increased savings for which these controls were partly responsible, we were able to raise from the public and the banking system without inflationary effects, loans ling £86,000,000 for war and essential civil works, including State and semi governmental works, compared with £75,000,000 in the previous year and £37,000,000 in the last pre-war year. In 1941-42 the need for controls of kinds which I have just outlined will be even greater. Of the total production represented by the estimate of £1,000,000,000 for the national income, more than 22 per cent, will be for war purposes. Furthermore, the increase of incomes this year will be due not only to war production but also to the substantial surplus of export income over civil imports. This surplus, like the war expenditure, helps to swell incomes received , in Australia without increasing the amount of goods available for civilian spending. For both of these reasons, there will be an excess of incomes over the goods and services available for purchase by the public. This year, the excess of incomes over available goods and services is very much greater than last year, and if this is not to lead to rising prices, the public must adjust in one way or another their spending to the supply of goods available for purchase. The Government rejects the inflationary method of reducing consumption by letting prices rise faster than incomes. This means that, the Government must contemplate-(o ) further increases of taxation, (6) stronger appeals for private and public economy in all expenditure not necessary for the war. and (c) stiffening and extending the controls already instituted to reduce spending. This will provide the real saving to back greatly increased government borrowing both from the public and from the banking system. I . pass now to detailed consideration of the measures which will be necessary to secure this diversion of physical resourcesto war production, and consequently the diversion of purchasing power from private to government hands necessary tofinancethe balanceof £154,000,000 that has to be found. METHODS OF FINANCE. Before considering the matter of new financial measures, we should allow for what, on the basis of recent experience, total- might be got from the loan market. .Last year, we raised a total of £86,000,000, of which about £60,000,000 was available for war. This total included a substantial amount from the banking system, which was justified by diversion the of investments, rising total production, and increased savings. It is not necessary, at this stage, to estimate precisely what the market will yield this year, as we must return later to the problem of our borrowing. It is sufficient for the present to say that without further special measures, we should be able to borrow for war purposes not less than we did last year. This would reduce the amount, for which new financial measures must be taken, to about £94,000,000. Our immediate task is to decide what proportion of thi.' amount should be raised by taxation. Taxation. In general, taxation is the simplest, most effective and most equitable way of both raising the necessary finance ancl milking available the necessary resources, in the main, increased taxation leads to a reduction of private consumption-and - iiis frees for war purposes the labour, material and equipment previously employed in the production of goods for consumption. There are, however, limits to the use of taxation: (a) With anything like £94,000,000 to find, the increase of taxation necessary to raise the whole amount, if imposed suddenly, would be very disturbing both to business and to the consumer. Even though the weight of the new taxation came in only gradually during the year, as with most income taxation, the mere imposition of it may be too severe a blow. The need to divert resources will become progressively greater during the year, and the pressure io reduce non-war spending should grow with it. (b) Moreover, the effect of taxation is to free resources in general. There will, however, be need for particular kinds of resources which will require diversion by special measures. A survey of our war programme and of our resources suggests that a large part of the diversion required will have to be done by special measures. In the circumstances, the common-sense policy is to obtain by taxation a substantial part of the amount required, and to obtain the remainder by increased loans. In other words, it will be the responsibility of the Government so to manage the economy that, with resolute co-operation by the people, savings will be increased to the required extent. The minimum amount to be raised by taxation, or by contributions having the same effect as taxation, 1 put at £32,000,000, or about one-third of the amount for which finance is not in sight. I should have liked to propose a larger proportion, because taxation is, as I have said, the simplest and most effective way and can be made the most equitable way. 'Phis, however, is the minimum which I propose for immediate adoption. Unless our supplementary measures be fully effective and savings increase to the required extent, I shall have to propose further taxation before the year is out. THE BEQUIRED INCREASE OF LOANS. The total amount to be borrowed in Australia for war is therefore Mr Fadthn. £122,000,000, compared with about £60,000,000 in 1940-41. The task of raising this sum is somewhat accentuated by the need to convert a loan of £70,000,000, whicirfalls due on the 15th November next. A large part of this loan is made up of small holdings. The terms of the new loan have already been announced. Every bond-holder, no matter how small his holding, who converts to the new loan will help our war finance, and the Government looks forward to a splendid response from bondholders. Turning back to the £122,000,000, it is clear that the borrowing of this huge sum can be brought about only by an intensive drive for savings. An important contribution can be made without any increase of savings by diversion from private investment to public investment for war purposes. Private investment has already come under a large measure of control. Similarly, public investment for civil purposes is being curtailed. Gradually, as the need for resources for war purposes becomes more urgent, this control will be extended and intensified. The result will be that we shall not have the new capital goods which we could normally expect, for example, new factories and buildings (other than those required for war), new roads, railways and new public amenities generally. But this loss will not affect our present consumption. A further important contribution must, and I am sure will, be made by a greater determination to save. The necessities of war are day by day being more fully recognized, and it will be the task of the Government to promote this growing realization. Besides increased willingness to save, there will also be increased opportunity to save. This will come from the absence of many goods on which incomes are usually spent. The growing needs of war must reduce the supply of many civil goods. The Government has already placed restrictions upon imported non-essentials. There is little doubt that those restrictions will have to he extended, possibly into the field of home-produced goods. We must go without many comforts and conveniences, and this going without will give further opportunity for saving. The going-without is the hard thing, and that is inescapable. What .I am asking of the people is that, when they do not spend on some classes of good-, 1 let us say new. motor cars, they will, notuse the money for additional spending on other classes of goocls, but will really save it for the duration of the war. People who co-operate with the Government by increasing savings will not have reduced incomes on that account. They will be placing a part of their incomes - aside for expenditure in future years. The savings will be most useful if they go directly into War Savings Certificates and public loans. Not all, however, will flow into these channels. Some will take the form of deposits with Savings Banks or increased provision for insurance. Some will be employed to reduce existing indebtedness. This will be the method of many producers who willtake the present opportunity to increase their equities in their factories or farms. Some savings will merely tend to be left as idle deposits with the trading banks. All these types of savings are valuable and represent an effective contribution to the needs of war finance. When goods are short and incomes arc relatively high, there will be difficulties in controlling the prices and at the same time ensuring an equitable distribution of the goods in short supply. The Government is acutely conscious of these difficulties and for some .time has been giyine very anxious thought to the means of overcoming them. This is not the plac for a discussion of these problems which are likely to confront us in the course of the coming year. I can only assure the Committee that the Government is fully alive to them and determined to overcome them. Let me summarize the financial problem. The Government will borrow £122,000,000 to complete the provision for war expenditure. It will borrow this amount by public loans, by war savings certificates, and by loans from the banking system. It has a heavy responsibility to ensure that these loans shall be sufficiently balanced by real savings. A. considerable proportion of these loans must come from the hanking system, because the banks will be the repositories of much df the savings that will be made, and of much of the money which can be diverted from other form.' of investment. How far beyond that point we can borrow from the banks can be decided only by experience. I shall return later to the position of the trading banks in relation to the Commonwealth Bank and to the community. Financial Proposals Summarized. The financial proposals may now be summarized thus:f Total war expenditure .. 217,000.000 To be financed from- £ (1) Cash balances 2,000,000 (2) Budget at existing tax rates .. 61,000,000 (3) New taxation and wartime contribution .. 32,000,000 (4.) Loans from public and from the banking system. .. 122,000,000 217,000,000 TAXATION PROPOSALS. Indirect taxation in every form-cus toms, excise, sales tax-implie s a rise of prices. I am very unwilling to impose any taxes that will raise prices. Our necessity may become so great that we cannot avoid them. At this stage, I believe we can. I propose then that, except for a moderate rise of postal charges, additional funds shall be raised by a direct contribution from incomes, in the form of either taxation or loan. We need to reduce private spending and our aim should be to reduce the present spending power of every income by an amount appropriate to that income, varying according to our accepted principles from a very large proportion of high incomes to nothing on very low ones. There are, however, incomes cr parts of incomes which it is impracticable or unwise to tax to the full appropriate amount. In such cases, we can reduce present spending power to the appropriate level by taking the required amount in the form of loan, repayable when the exigencies of war are past. Contributions should be, in whole or in part, loan rather than taxation in these instances(a) Where income is legally or constitutionally exempt, wholly or partly from taxation by Commonwealth or State. This class includes boud income and gold-mining income. (7>) When on account of low State taxation, more income is left to a resident of one State thau to the resident of another State on the same income. Here the excess income should be on loan. (c) For taxpayers on low incomes from whom an immediate contribution is reasonable. In particular for single men and women saving should make provision for marriage. Their loan contribution should therefore, in appropriate circumstances, be repayable on marriage. The following arrangement is therefore proposed:(a.) A national contribution is assessed on every income in Australia, however derived. The exemption for a single man or woman is £100 and the scale of contribution progresses to 18s. in the £1 on high incomes. The national contribution is in general large enough to cover both Federal income tax and State income tax in the highest taxing State. (b) Prom the national contribution assessed are deducted the Federal income tax payable in the current year and the State income tax paid in the previous year and set down in the return of income. The remainder, if any, is collected as a loan, bearing simple interest at 2 per cent., which in general is the rate paid on Savings Bank deposits, and repayable after the war. It will be called the war-time contribution. A new federal income tax scale is designed to harmonize with the national contribution scale. As the national contribution takes full account of State taxation, it is no longer necessary to allow StBte taxes as a deduction from income in assessing the federal tax. The amount of federal tax paid by similar incomes will therefore now he the same in all States instead of varying from State to State. The new scale is designed to Mr Fadden. make the tax at each level of income about the same as the average tax under the present scale for that income, except, that for high incomes rates are considerably increased. The chief differences between the proposed tax and the present one are(a) The tax will be uniform in all States. (&) Increased rates on high incomes, (c) The disallowance of the exemption for children after the first as a set-off against direct child endowment. In this way, incomes will contribute £1,800,000 towards the total cost, £13,000,000, of child endowment The combined scheme of tax and loan will give about £20,000,000 of loan in the current year, and about £3,000,000 more tax than the existing scale. Further details will he given when the appropriate legislation is under consideration. Company Taxation. - Companies are taxed in various way's by Commonwealth and States and their dividends are taxed again in the income of shareholders. The total of all company income taxation for 1940-41 amounted to about £35,000,000 quite apart from taxation of dividends in the hands of shareholders. There is not much room for increased taxation. There is, however, a large amount each year allowed as provision for depreciation or left as undistributed profits and used for the expansion of business. In many cases, additions to depreciation funds cannot now be used fully, and expansion of business is not desirable. It is therefore proposed to take as loan 20 per cent, of the yearly accretion in these funds, and repay them after the war, when they will be required hy the companies for rehabilitation and expansion. There will he some companies which will require all available funds for expansion for war purposes, and provision will be made to release their contributions to the degree necessary. Loan contributions from provision for depreciation will be made by individuals also. I estimate that £5,000,000 will be obtained on loan mostly from companies in this way, after making allowance for possible repayment: but the estimate must be tentative, until checked by experience. I propose also to increase the rate of ordinary company tax from 2s. to 2s. 6d. in the £1. This will apply to both public and private companies, and is estimated ro bring in £2.500,000.' Post Office Charges. It is proposed to increase charges for postal and telephone services as follows:(i) ""War postage tax of - kl. in addition to the normal rates of postage on all postal articles except mail matter to ancl from members the fighting forces, air-mail letters to addressees abroad parcels. (ii) Increased telephone charges, viz.: - Rental s at rates varying from 5s. to 15s. per annum; an tional farthing per call on calls; and increases on a sliding scale on trunk calls exceeding 25 miles. The extra revenue this year is estioutbreak mated at £1,500,000. Further information will be supplied later by my colleague, Postmaster-General. Summary - should The total of additional funds which rime of peace. will become available in the ways T. have described is estimated to be- Tax Income taxIndividuals 3.0 20 Companies 2.S Post Office l.fi Total additional funds available will then be £32,000,000. SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES. With £32,000,000 raised in this way we shall have, as I said earlier, £122,000,000 to he raised by loans in ways I have outlined. This will require the full co-operation of the people of Australia, and to get that co-operation must give them the best possible protecto their profits before the war. tion against profiteering. There are two additional precautions which the Governstability ment proposes to take-dealin g primarily with excess profits but designed also as' additional safeguards against inflation. Control of the Private Banks. The banks have important functions in the community, particularly in time of war. However well they discharge their functions, there is a real danger that under certain conditions they may make excessive profits out of war finance; and that danger must be guarded against. The deposits of the trading banks have increased by £40.000,000 since the outbreak of war, ancl I have heard it suggested that of these additional funds which they have to invest are a. result of government and expenditure and should he lent to the Government at nominal rates of interest. But the increase of deposits is only in line, with the increase of employment and addiproduction. Bank deposits must be exlocal pected to rise with productive activity which is measured roughly by total employment. Employment in Australia has increased by about 15 per cent, since the of war, and bank deposits have increased by 14 per cent. There is then the no evidence of excess deposits. The deposits of the banks up to the present not be treated otherwise than in .""Nevertheless there is a possible danger for the future. Our finance in the next or (.UHll. Total. few months will require a good deal of Charlie-. temporary accommodation, and a necessary precautionary measure will be to £ni. tin. £m. remove any danger of secondary expansion by the trading banks, and so guard 23.0 against any excess banking profits. .1 7.S 1 .!> have given a good deal of consideration ro the question of the best method of 7.0 | 25 32.0 doing so. My conclusion is that the most: effective measure is to require the banks to keep in a special deposit account with I lie Commonwealth Bank any increase of rhcir funds due to war finance. As a further check on the efficacy of this arrangement, the hanks should furnish a the certificate from the Commissioner of Taxation, who has access to all of the facts, showing the relation of their profits, we before the payment of federal taxes, This method Avill in addition contribute to the of the financial system generally in that it will supply a check, if such is required, to any tendency to over-trade on the parr, of the banks. This measure of control is a variation of the method proposed by the Banking Commission, hy which the Commonwealth Bank could require the banks to keep with it deposits equal to any prescribed percentage of their liabilities to the public. I am satisfied that under war conditions the variation I propose will be practically more effective and immediate in its action than the commission's recommendation. It is, moreover, in keeping with the views expressed by the Banking Commission that it is by co-operation between the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks that the regulation of credit will be best achieved. With that end in view I have asked for and have obtained a firm undertaking from the banks that they will accept the procedure I have outlined above and co-operate fully with the Commonwealth Bank in carrying it oiit. The value of co-operation in working a plan of this kind is very great, and it should be given a fair trial. I shall have all the data before me upon which to judge its effectiveness, and, should it be necessary, the Government will not hesitate to invoke the National Security Act in order to ensure the results required, namely, the prevention of secondary expansion by the trading banks, and an assurance against excessive banking profits. The terms of the undertaking referred to are as follows:- NA The trading banks have no intention and no desire to make excess profits arising from war conditions. As a war-time measure and with the object of ensuring that .additions to their funds owing to war conditions will not be used to make excess profits or to expand advances in any way contrary to the national interests, they agree to pla.ee all surplus investable funds accruing in their hands on deposit with the Commonwealth Bank as special war-time deposits, and agree to the Commonwealth Bank making appropriate' variations in the rate of interest thereon to ensure that no excess war-time profits arise. To achieve the objects set out above the trading banks give the following firm undertaking - (1) They will not make new advances or grant increases in existing - except in accordance with the policy laid down by the Commonwealth Bank from time to time and to ensure Mr Faddcv. conformity therewith will supply to the Commonwealth Bank a monthly analysis of new and increased advances in a form approved by the Commonwealth Bank. (2) Before purchasing or subscribing to government or semi-government loans, the trading banks will obtain the concurrence of the Commonwealth Bank. (3) The trading banks will make available by way of deposits with the Commonwealth Bank all surplus investable funds accruing in their hands, i.e., all funds over and above those necessary to ena,l>lu the banks to meet the overdraft requirements of the public in accordance with the advance policy laid down by the Commonwealth Bank, and those funds necessary for the protection of their depositors. The deposits will be made at such low rates of interest as will avoid the trading banks making excess profits out of war conditions. These rates will be fixed by the Commonwoalth Bank from time to time. (4) They will advise the Commonwealth Bank periodically what funds become available as above and the Coinmonwealth Bank will decide the total amount of deposits required from the trading banks from time to time. (5) Such deposits will .be made in a special war-time de.]>osit account and will be for a term of six months. They will be renewed as they mature unless in the opinion of the Commonwealth Bank they are necessary to the trading"" banks for purposes mentioned in paragraph (3) hereof. (0) They agree to supply the Commonwealth Ba.nk with such certificates from the 'Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation as will enable that BANKS. bank to satisfy itself that the undertaking herein regarding profits is being observed. Control of Profits. I have dealt with the profits of the banks, and I shall now go on to the possibilities of excess profits in other business. It is inflationary finance which gives the great opportunity for profiteering in war-time, and our finance has not been inflationary. Moreover, our con- trols have been particularly effective. There are three governmental authorities through which profits have been controlled during the war. The Commonwealth Prices Commissioner has fixed profit margins of traders and manufacadvances turers and, in many cases, has specifically limited net profits. In some industries, however, individual firms, on account of differences in costs and efficiency, earn widely-varying profits whilst charging the same prices. The second authority controlling profits exercises its influence through prices fixed for Government contracts. Every care has been taken to control net profits when determining the prices to be paid under Government contracts. There has been much criticism of the cost-plus system, on the ground that it places a premium on inefficiency and allows excessive profits. The Government is well aware of this danger, and rhe Departments of Munitions and Supply have carefully checked costs in order to prevent abuses of the system. Critics overlook/the-fact that "" cost-plus was designed to meet a special situation. Goods not formerly produced in Australia had to be manufactured for the first time; new plant for special war orders had to be installed; plant and labour had to be diverted from their normal operations to war-time operations; orders had to be placed expeditiously where they could be executed. For all of these reasons there was no basis operating on the normal tender system in the early stages of the war, but as industry gains experience of filling wartime needs it is becoming possible in a widening range of goods to revert to the fixed quotation system. Finally, there is the taxation power. Honourable members will recall that during the last budget debates the question of war-time company taxation was remitted to an all-party committee, which recommended the present war-time company tax. This tax imposes a special progressive levy on profits in excess of 8 per cent, on capital employed. It is a high profits tax rather than an excess profits tax, and I am informed by the Commissioner of Taxation that its aggregate yield is greater than the possible yield of a tax that would take all of war-time profits in excess of a pre-war standard. Apart from the special war-time company tax; other imposts have been made on public companies. Federal taxation of companies, including private companies, yielded approximately £17,000,000 for the vear 1940-4.1, compared with £S,000,000 in 1939-40 and £4,250.000 in the year before the war. A further increase will take place in the current With these controls the general level of profits in this war has not risen greatly as it did in the last war. But the rapid expansion of economic activity and the the increased turn-over of most businesses have brought high earnings, and there may still be cases in which profits are in excess of the pre-war profits even when these were not unduly low. The proposal to levy an excess profits tax based on pre-war standards was rejected last year by the committee representative of all parties set up to report to the Government upon the most suitable form of taxing profits during the war. The Government accepted the recommendations of rhe committee. In the meantime, further experience has been gained of the measures by which the Government is controlling profits, and there is at present a parliamentary committee, representative of all parties, investigating prices and profits. This committee will review the whole problem ancl consider sueh gaps as may remain in the Governmental machinery for controlling profits. I assure honourable members that we shall for not hesitate to take any further steps necessary to prevent profiteering, or to tax excess profits where they occur. The Government is asking the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Profits to expedite its report so that the position can be reviewed in the light of its findings. BUDGET SUMMARY. For convenience I now summarize the key figures of the revenue budget as follows:£ £ Estimated revenue on the basis of taxation now in force .. .. 1(13,000.000 Additional revenue to be derived from taxation and postal charges . . 7.000.000 170,000,000 Expenditure, omitting war services 102,000,000 Proportion , of cost of war services to be charged to the budget ..

In addition to the war expenditure which is to be charged to the Loan Account, other relatively small amounts for Post Office Works, Drought Relief, and Farmers' Debt Adjustment will be met from Loan Fund. Estimated Loan expenditure in 1941-42, compared with the actual expenditure of 1940-41, is out in the following table:Post Office Works 1,014,000..

In three years, our expenditure has more than trebled. In. contrast with a pre-war defence expenfinancial diture of £14,000,000, we have to find year the huge sura of £217,000,000 for war. The financial plan which I have be required. placed before you on behalf of the Government is simple, and it recognizes the need for a proper balance between taxaof tion and loans. First - Taxatio n in conjunction with the war-time contribution has bean increased. From these sources we shall raise £170,000,000, compared £74,000,000 in the last pre-war year. Mr fadden. Secondly - The Government proposes to borrow £122,000,000 for war purposes. 1.940-41. 1941-42. This can only be achieved by every one Actual. Estimatoil. £ £ making savings which involve some sacrifice, and contributing to our war funds in one form or another. These 2.000.000 savings are essential if our war effort is 08,000,000 to expand as it must. Thirdly - The Government will carry 25.000,000 out a progressive plan to ensure that the increasing resources required for war are obtained. It will also take resolute 170,000,000 . . 217,000,000 measures, if necessary, to prevent warprofiteering by individuals or institutions. This is Australia's third war budget and it brings us face to face with this reality: the raising, paying and equipping of our armed forces must take precedence over our spending on comforts and luxuries.

Whatever the occasion demands will be done within our physical capacity to do it. 250,000 Developments in the ever-changing war S50,000 situation must, dominate our financial plans. We shall have to revieAv, and 2.000,000 perhaps to modify, the budget in the light of developments o\erseas. We must pay r careful attention to the progress made in the provision of additional savings and to the blending of budget policy with to the economic policy in general. We may have to call for greater sacrifices as our war obligations increase. For all these reasons we cannot assume that our plans for the year are finally this determined in the budget. The Government proposes to review the budget Avithin the next three months, and to make provision for any additionalfinancethat may I submit this budget to the decision Parliament with full confidence that nothing will divert us, individually or collectively, from our plain duty. We must continue to provide the sineAvs of war without consideration of privilege, with creed or party. No more is asked than is necessary for the responsibilities we all must share. We have to meet the challenge of the most powerful and ruthless foe that has ever attempted to strike at the foundations of our national security.

100,Mr BLACKBURN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Bourke) [4.50] I do not think , that the House should adjourn without an assurance from the Government that the scope of the inquiry by the royal commission into the use of secret funds will be sufficiently wide to enable investigations to be made of allegations that certain financial proposals of the Government were communicated to persons who had no right to know of them. I have no ground for believing that such communications were made, or were not made; but I am concerned about statements that I have heard, and reports that I have read, that improper communications took place on this subject. It has been alleged that the improper dommunications were made through an intermediary to an officer of the Prime Minister's Department, who, I cannot conceive, had any right to such communications. I have been informed of the substance of certain telephone conversations. I consider that that matter should be investigated. The House is eutitled, also, to an explanation why such a long time has been allowed to elapse without any attempt having been made to take proceedings against the officer who is said to have made these communications. The fact that proceedings are not being taken, ancl that there is no indication that any proceedings are ro be taken, against this person, raises in my mind a suspicion that there are persons. in the Parliament and in the Government who cannot afford to allow that person to speak freely on this subject. Mr WAHJ> - They are afraid.",39
101,Mr BLACKBURN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,At any rate the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is.,39
102,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,Did not the Prime Minister say that the whole matter was now in the hands of the Commonwealth Law Department?,39
103,Mr BLACKBURN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"When the Prime Minister was asked a question on the subject today he refused, to my mind, to commit himself to an inquiry into anything except allegations concerning the use of secret funds. That is a comparatively unimportant part of the whole story. The people of Australia will require that these other allegations also be investigated.",39
104,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,It would be interesting to know who makes the allegations.,39
105,Mr BLACKBURN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,That also should be discovered.,39
106,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,Does the honourable member make them?,39
107,Mr BLACKBURN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,I make the allegation that I have heard and readstatements that have created the greatest suspicion in my mind.,39
108,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,No doubt the royal commission will be pleased to call the honourable gentleman as a witness.,39
109,Mr SCULLY,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Gwydir) [4.53] - I direct the attention of the House to the serious position that has arisen through the failure of the Loan Council to allocate to the Government of New South Wales sufficient money to enable, it to maintain its public works programme during the current financial year, and, in particular, to continue the work on the Keepit Dam, at Gunnedah. On the 18th September, I made representations to the Treasurer  that I had received on this subject from the secretary of the camp committee at the Keepit Dam, Gunnedah. In reply to those representations I received the following letter, dated the 22nd September, from the honourable gentleman:22 nd September. 1041. Mr VV. ,1. Scully. M.P.. Parliament Bouse. Canberra. Australian Capital Territory. Dear Sir. .1 acknowledge your representations of the ISth September in connection with a telegram received by you from the secretary. Camp Committee. Keepit Bam. Gunnedah. regarding in-allocation of loan money for New South Wales. J also have received a telegram direct from the secretary of the Camp Committee stating that the work was closing down and asking for rc-allocation of loan money for New South Wales. To that telegram I. have sent the following reply:Your telegram seventeenth .Loan Council recently approved allotment four and half million pounds for State works this year. Allocation that amount to specific works matter for Statu Government in consultation with Co-ordinator-General of Works. Suggest you address your representations State Government. Yours faithfully. (Sgd.) A. FAODEK, Prime Minister aud Treasurer. This subject is of the utmost importance to the people of New South Wales. The plight of the Government of that State in this connection is undoubtedly due to action taken by the 'Commonwealth Treasurer at the loan Council. The Co-ordinator-General of Works, Sir Harry Brown, prior to the meeting of the Loan Council, made a close investigation of the loan requirements of the various States, including New South Wales, ancl recommended certain allocations. The Loan Council subsequently reduced the allocation proposed for New South WaI-2S by Sir Harry Brown by £2,500,000. This action was taken by reason of the fact that the Commonwealth Treasurer used his two deliberative votes, ancl also his easting vote as chairman of the council,, to defeat the allocations ruconmieuded by Sir Harry Brown. His votes were supported by the votes of the representatives of Tasmania and South Australia. The decision of the Loan Council has prevented the Government of New South Wales from proceeding with absolutely essential works, including the important water conservation scheme for the north-west of the State, which is essential for the development of that area, and also for effective post-war reconstruction planning. Moreover, the cessation of the work on the Keepit Dam deprives between 200 ancl 300 married men of permanent work. That must necessarily have serious results for the wives and children of the men concerned. The need for a water-conservation scheme in the north-west of New South Wales has been accentuated by the progressive drying up of the artesian water basin in that area of the State. Unless the Keepit Dam project can be continued material damage will be inflicted on the economic structure of the whole State, and serious loss will fall upon the people. I appeal to the Treasurer to review this whole subject ancl to summon another meeting of the Loan Council in order that the allocations decided upon at its lust meeting may be considered. It is absolutely essenmember tial that the north-west conservation scheme shall be completed, if the people are to continue to develop that country and if effective provision is to be made for post-war operations. The Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales has requested that an early meeting of the Loan Council be summoned to review this subject, and I sincerely trust thai the request will be granted.",39
110,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,Kooyong-Minister for Defence Co-ordination) [4.58] The honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) has raised the matter of the scope of the inquiry by the royal commission which the Government intends to appoint.,40
111,Mr BARNARD,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,Is the right honourable gentleman closing the debate?,40
112,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"I am. not; I am merely taking the earliest opportunity to clarify the issues raised by the honourable member for Bourke. I believe that the honourable member for Bass (Mr. Barnard) will agree that if a royal commission is to investigate certain in a tiers those matters are not appropriate for a mass of public accusations and counter allegations pending the hearing by the royal commission. Cabinet is to meet as soon as the House rises in order to consider the terms of reference to the royal commission. The matter raised by the honourable member for Bourke is, I imagine, on all fours with that raised by the honourable member for Martin (Mr MCCall) yesterday.",40
113,Mr BLACKBURN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,I myself raised it in my speech last night.,40
114,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"I understand that the issues relate to certain telephone conversations which have been referred to in the public press. I am not able to say, ar the moment, what the precise terms of reference will be. Cabinet will discuss them shortly. But I inform honourable members that insofar as the conversations relate to me, or to matters within my knowledge, I shall insist-and I use that word advisedly-that any suggestion that might directly or indirectly concern myself shall be probed with the greatest possible publicity. T desire to make that perfectly clear. Perhaps that will be to the honourable an indication of the way in which this problem will be approached by the Cabinet.",40
115,Mr CALWELL,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,Will the terms of reference include the allegation that details of the budget were disclosed in advance to certain interests?,40
116,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"I have heard in this House an allegation which was repeated from the press. I am completely unaware of any foundation for it. But if any sueh allegation is made, then it must be examined.",41
117,Mr CALWELL,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,-Will there be an examination of the source whence the newspapers received their information? ' Mr MENZIES - Certainly . I desire to make it quite clear that that also will be examined.,41
118,Mr CALWELL,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,Without press privilege?,41
119,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Without press privilege, having regard to the matters that have been discussed, which I have followed with a certain degree of interest, because at, one stage I seemed to have passed from the role of a spectator almost to that of an actor. I want to make it quite clear that there will be no limitation upon the investigation of this matter so far as I am concerned; that I regard as something which is duo to myself.  able gentleman fare if the Cabinet does not agree to the terms of reference he desires?",41
120,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"I think that it will agree to them.  desire to bring to the notice of the Government, and particularly the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender), the matter of the allocation to country and provincial newspapers of advertisements which ar.e inserted for the purpose of notifying the liability of certain citizens to submit themselves for military training. I understand that the officers in charge of the different military districts are instructed to insert in suitable newspapers advertisements with respect to the call-up of trainees. I have ascertained that some military officers have interpreted the expression "" suitable "" to mean that they shall withhold advertisements from country newspapers which in their opinion do not cover an area containing a sufficient number of trainees to warrant advertising. This is to their credit, from the point of view of the conservation of public moneys. On the other hand, certain other military officers do not place that interpretation on the expression, with the result that newspapers in their districts receive a very substantial amount, of advertising matter, irrespective of the number of trainees covered. In one military district, the country press has received advertisements practically a column in length, whereas in another military district, which is in charge of an officer who gives the restricted meaning to the word "" suitable "", newspapers with an equal circulation do not receive any advertisements. I am not quarrelling with the exercise of care in the expenditure of public funds. I contend, however, that there should be clarification of the basis upon which the officers in the different military districts who have the allocation of these advertisements shall act.",41
121,Mr MENZIES,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"How did the Woodend Star fare?  my complaint; but I am not quarrelling with the interpretation of the officer who made the allocation to that newspaper. There should not be differentiation between townships and newspapers according to the military areas in which they are situated; if a newspaper in one area is to receive a substantial revenue-producing advertisement, fair play demands that a newspaper in another urea, which docs not cover a fewer number of trainees shall receive like treatment. That is the burden of my complaint. I request that the Government take steps to have even justice handed out to the various newspapers. It might very well consider the removal of the expression "" suitable"" from the instructions issued to military officers. An illustration of the differentiation of which I complain is provided by the Ballarat Courier-whic h apparently can secure every advertisement that is published-and the Ballarat Mail, which has' a lower circulation and can obtain only an occasional advertisement. It is said, of course, that the Ballarat Courier covers a larger number of readers; but, on the other hand, the Ballarat Mail. even though its circulation is lower, covers that very large section of the population which is producing the greatest number of recruits for the Australian Imperial .Force and has also the greatest number of persons liable to be called up for compulsory military training. I understand that the Ballarat Courier is sold at l i d . a copy, whereas the Ballarat Mail can he purchased for 4id. a week, and, consequently, has a wider circulation among the larger families, which undoubtedly provide the biggest number of trainees. I shall not mention the names of two country newspapers which illustrate the point that I am making, because I do not want them to be deprived of the substantial amount of revenue they now obtain from the advertisements they receive. Incidentally, they are not in my electorate. My purpose is to convince the Government that all newspapers should be put on the one basis. A question in relation to the matter was asked today, and the reply was that the matter had received the attention of the Government, and that instructions had been given that a fair basis of apportionment should be observed. I am quite sure that when the Minister made that statement ho was unaware that some of his officers adopt a practice different from that of other officers. To-day, the Government was asked what action it proposes to take in the direction of relaxing the obligation imposed on certain compulsory military trainees in order not to deplete unduly the supply of labour available for harvesting operations. The Minister replied that the matter is receiving consideration. It is so important and urgent that not only consideration but also immediate action is demanded. A. letter addressed to me readsI rto wonder if yon can give anv advice the problem of labour for the forthcoming harvest. I am in a predicament, as I am my own farm of 150 acres of crop to stack a nd stook. Anybody with a knowledge of cutting, slooking and stacking hay realizes that the problem is of major magnitude. The writer of the letter went on to sayI t does not seem possible to get even man to assist. The few local chaps that II bout would not supplv one man between farms. My usual permanent man and the help that wo usually got in the harvest are overseas. As a fanner yourself, you will realise that, as far as harvesting is concerned, one can do practically nothing on one's own. This is a serious problem. In Victoria at least, the farmers withiu a month will be in the middle of hay harvesting operations, and - unless the Government decides quickly what it proposes to do a very large portion of different crops will not be harvested and conserved for the national need; indeed, for the war effort. In the circumstances, I urge the Government to deal immediately with this urgent national problem. I hope to receive a suitable reply from the Ministers concerned - - ",41
122,Mr BARNARD,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Bass) [5.11 ] - I join with the honourable member for Ballarat  Government in relation to the supply of labour for harvesting and dairying operations. In reply to a question that I asked, the Minister for the Army (Mr. Spender) informed me that he is iooking into the matter. I stress its urgency. Clearly, unless labour be available for harvesting operations, the harvest cannot, be garnered. The problem is a. serious one. The same conditions apply to dairy fanners, whose operations arc adversely affected because of the scarcity of labour, caused partly by the call-up for compulsory military training. This afternoon, I asked the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr. Spooner) whether he had received a report in respect of the employment of prisoners of war on afforestation ancl water conservation works, and received the reply that a report had not been furnished to him and that he had no knowledge of the matter. The Minister for Labour ancl National Services (Mr. re Holt) was good enough to intimate to me that he ancl the Minister for the Army on had been taking action. If prisoners of war are to be employed on afforestation and water conservation works, I urge the Government to consider the suitability of Tasmania for afforestation purposes. Re-afforestation has been the subject one of investigation for a number of years. aTc A statement on the matter was made by two Mr Lane Poole, Inspector-General of now Forests, as far back as 1928, when the Development ancl Migration Commission was making a survey of the whole of Australia. Mr Lane Poole is regarded as a very eminent authority on the subject of afforestation in this country. During the course of the investigation, Mr G. D. Rodger, B.Sc., Chief Porestor of the Australian Capital Territory, stated that Tasmania was known to nossess the best forest climate in the Commonwealth, and was credited with the possession of very large areas of high forests. went on to sa.yOutside of the highlands of Victoria and New South Wales, it is doubtful whether Australia possesses any region whose climate is so propitious for the growth of the better kinds of conifers as Tasmania. threatened famine of softwoods, all regions with conifer climates are of first importance. The Commonwealth Grants Commission, in its second and third reports, discussed various methods of overcoming the disabilities under which Tasmania suffers. In both these reports it suggested that something could be done to assist the State by subsidizing afforestation work. The reportstatedThe form such help should take would require technical examination, and ""we do not consider it our province to recommend i in general terms. An example, however, may make our meaning clearer. Tasmania has great forestry possibilities, bnt her assets have been depleted. A long-term forestry ixilicy involving considerable expenditure over a term of years is needed. Such a policy has been worked out and described to ns in evidence, and the Commonwealth Director of Forests commented on it very favourably to us. This |iolicy has now been initiated with the help of the Commonwealth grant for forestry, but it is hampered by uncertainty as to the necessary funds in future years. '(agree that we should get the best use possible out of prisoners of war, and if their services are to be utilized, I press rhe claims of Tasmania for a share of the work upon which they would be engaged. For various reasons Tasmania has never received, nor can it, because of geographical considerations, receive a reasonable proportion of capital war expenditure, hut if it is possible to make up to that State a part of this loss the Government should not fail to do so. Three or four days ago there appeared in the newspapers a report that orders worth. £8,000,000 were being given in the various States for the supply of machinery, and of this amount Tasmania was to receive only £78,425, or less than 1 per cent, of the total. Tasmania has all the natural advantages for afforestation work, including a suitable climate, and its claims are worthy of consideration. The fact thai ilr. Barnard. it is separated from the mainland by .Bas3 Strait should not be regarded as an obstacle.",42
123,Mr MCLEOD,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Wannon) [5.20] - I endorse the remarks of the honourable  garding the distribution of government advertising in connection with the callingup of military trainees in country areas. I , too, have received complaints from the With the proprietors of country newspapers. One proprietor has so far received only one advertisement, while others have received none at all. In country districts most families subscribe to a local paper and, in the interests of the public, notices regarding the calling-up of trainees should be inserted in the local paper so that they may he seen by those concerned. About a. week ago I asked a question in this House regarding the distribution of advertising as between the country press and the metropolitan dailies, and It except learned that, during the period under review, £33,000 had been paid for advertising to the newspapers in .the six capiral cities, and only £2,731 to.newspapers in country districts. The Government employs advertising agencies for the placing of war loan advertisements, and these agencies deduct 20 per cent, of the total amount payable to the country newspapers to which they allot the advertisements. In one instance the amount charged for such an advertisement was £3 12s., representing a charge of ls. an inch, which is very reasonable. 'The agent deducted 15s. I i . , sending the newspaper proprietor a cheque for £2 16s. 5d., which reduced the rate for the advertisement to 9d. an. inch. Surely advertisements can be placed with the various newspapers by the government departments concerned, thus doing away with the need to pay commission to advertising agents.",43
124,Mr MORGAN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Reid) [5.86] - This afternoon I brought under the notice  predicament of men employed in the Clyde engineering works at Granville who are losing their jobs because of the re-organization of the works for the purpose of executing government war orders. The right honourable gentleman said that if I put the question on the notice-paper he would consider it. However, I bring the matter np now as one of urgency because, according to my information, fifteen men were put off on the 12th September, and another fifteen are to be put off tomorrow. The Government promised that a minimum of inconvenience would be caused to the public in the working out of its war production plans. The Government is giving great assistance to the Clyde Engineering Company Limited, having entered into an extraordinary arrangement whereby an advance of £150,000 by the Bank of New South Wales is guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government through the Commonwealth Bank. Now the company has closed clown a part of its works which had been in operation for thirty years. Employees who were engaged in the enamel bath section cannot be absorbed in war work by the company, and they are to be displaced. Having regard to the generous assistance which the Government is giving to the company, it is only fair that something should he done for the men. Many of them are old and trusted employees with fifteen and twenty years of service. They have families and are over military age. This is the first test of the Government's plan for the reorganization of industry, and it provides an opportunity for the Government to show what it proposes to do for men who lose their jobs because of industrial reorganization. On the 5th September I brought the matter under the notice of the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr Spooner), who gave me an attentive hearing, hut apparently it docs not come under his department because, on the 25th of this month, he wrote to me as follows:I enclose copy of letter and supporting torrriatiori that I received today from the company, from which it appears that the particulars of thu displaced men have already been supplied both to the Commonwealth and State employment authorities. The matter of their future employment does not come within the scope of my department, but I suggest that you might press the claim of these men at the Commonwealth Employment Department. As you are aware, two large war establishments are projected within accessible distance from Granville, and while these are not yet in production it may be that preliminary arrangements are being made for personnel.",43
125,Mr HOLT,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,Has the honourable member given the names of these men to the officers of my department?,44
126,Mr MORGAN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"I communicated with the Minister's department, and I understand that an officer went out and took the names of the men. The arrangements mentioned by the Minister are still in the preliminary stage, and months will elapse before employment is found for any large number of men. In the meantime, they should receive some consideration-perhap s in the for m of sustenance for them ancl their families. Over three mouths ago, I communicated with the Treasurer (Mr Eadden) regarding the application of the Granville Municipal Council for financial assistance to construct a road, a few hundred yards long, between Parramattaroad, Granville, ancl Grand-avenue, in order to give access to certain large in dustries, most of which are engaged in the production of war materials. One of them is the Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited. The cost of constructing the road, including a bridge over a creek, is £12,000. At the present time, the fund.« of many local governing bodies are not particularly buoyant, and the Granville Council being no exception, it sought, from the Commonwealth a grant of £6,000 and approval to borrow the balance of the money. The proposition was most reasonable, because the road would definitely facilitate access to war industries. Three months elapsed before 1 obtained any information. At first, I received only formal acknowledgments of the receipt of my requests. Then I had an interview with the Treasurer, and inwrote to him a letter marked "" personal"". A few days ago, he notified me that the request had been declined. His letter statedWith reference to my letter of 26th August, concerning your representations on behalf of the Municipality of Granville for Commonwealth assistance towards the cost of construction of a road and bridge in that district, the information now furnished 'by the Department of Munitions indicates that the only Commonwealth war activity in the district is the annexe in course of erection by the Australian Aluminium Works, which will be controlled by the Aircraft Production Commission. This enterprise has now commenced proinstitute duction, and will supply large industries in the neighbourhood that are manufacthat turing parts for aeroplanes. The road is able. required to ensure the safe transport of materials in that area, as the present route has two dangerous crossings and totally inadequate to carry the traffic that will pass over it in future. To indicate that the Treasurer possibly been misinformed about the matter, I quote a letter which I received today from the town clerk of the Granhis ville Municipal Council. It reveals that various industries other than the AusDuring tralian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited are interested in the construction of the road. It statesI n reply to your letter of 23rd September, 1941, I am pleased to supply the information you require regarding the industries which would be directly served by the proposed from Grant-avenue to Pa rramatta-road, follows:Firm. James Hardie and Company Proprietary Limited (fibro-cement manufacturers) . -- 800 Fifield Magnesite and Refractories Proprietary Limited (fire bricks, &c.) .. . . 4 0 Wesco (Australia) Proprietary Limited (kalsomine manufacturers) .. . -- 45 Australian Cream' Tartar Company Proprietary Limited (cream of tartar manufacturers) Wunderlich Limited (roofing tiles, - bricks, tcrra-cotta and fibrocement manufacturers) .. The Shell Company of Australia Limited (oil refinery) 200 Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited (aluminium forging and rolling mills) Australian Fertilizers Limited (soil fertilizer manufacturers) S Non-Metallic Limited (rock and ore milling) . . .. ... I would stress the fact that the council's request is for a contribution of half cost by Commonwealth and for permission to borrow the other half of the cost. Apart from the industries mentioned the letter, other factories would use road for transport of materials, and. addition, this work would be of great conemployment. venience to 7,000 or S,000 employees in the district. I emphasize that the request is not trivial and ask the Treasurer to men concerned? Mr Morgan. an independent inquiry into the facts. If he does so, he will be satisfied the proposition is fair and reason",44
127,Mr HOLT,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Fawkner-Minister for Labour and National Service) [5.34] is The honourable member for Bass (Mr. Barnard) referred to the possibility of using prisoners of war in connection with has afforestation work in Tasmania. Unfortunately, I was absent from the chamber when he outlined the details of proposal, but I shall be pleased to give full consideration to his suggestions. recent weeks, the Department of the Army and the Department of Labour and National Service have been investigating the possibility of utilizing the services of prisoners of war upon the kind of project which the honourable member mentioned. But, as the House will appreroad ciate, certain practical difficulties are as associated with any such proposal. The matter of security, the provision of No. of Employees. accommodation, ancl problems relating to health have to be taken into consideration before effective use can be made of the labour of war prisoners. When plans are sufficiently developed, the Minister for the Army (Mr. Spender), and I hope to hold a joint conference with appropriate officers from our respective departments with a view to putting the scheme into effect. 119 Mr BARNARD - Will the Minister examine Tasmania's claims for con250 sideration?",45
128,Mr HOLT,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Certainly ; the possibility of making use of prisoners of war in Tasmania will be fully examined. 400 When the subject of afforestation is under review, that State has particular claims for consideration. 1.1 The honourable member for Reid (Mr. Morgan), referred to the problem created 1,873 by the displacement of certain labour at Clyde Engineering works. I am gratified the to learn that he brought the matter to the notice of the employment division of the Department of Labour and National in Serviee, and I shall discuss with my the officers the best method of placing the in men, as soon as practicable, in regular",45

131,Mr BLAIN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Northern Territory) [5.38] - A religious publication, The Signs of the Times, contains a reference to evidence which an anthropologist- a woman-gav e before the Joint Committee on Social Security in Melbourne. According to this report, she declared that the missions do more harm than good to the natives. I challenge that statement. I shall not mention her name, because I attended a science congress in Canberra at which she delivered lectures, and I respect her for the voluntary work that she has performed among natives in New South Wales. Nevertheless, her evidence is a serious reflection upon the missions. All religious denominations are rendering excellent service to this forgotten race in the Northern Territory. In the Islands east of Darwin, the Methodists are carrying on the good work. Nearer Darwin, in West Arnhem Land, the Church of England is performing really magnificent service. Eor the natives on Melville Island, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Darwin has done a most effective job. Fortunately, food supplies there are ample. In the Alice Springs district, numbers of detribalized natives roamed the roads until a few years ago, when Father Maloney, who had a wonderful experience of life among the aboriginals on Palm Island, put the natives into huts and cared for them, and secured voluntary contributions to provide schools in which to educate those of superior intelligence.",46
132,Mr BARNARD,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Fro m personal perience, does the honourable member say that the missions arc doing a good job among the natives?",46
133,Mr BLAIN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Certainly . I am gratified to learn that the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard), who is a good churchman, is a member of the Joint Committee on Social Security. He will not allow such allegations to go unanswered. I also feel confident that the Postmaster-General (Mr Collins), who until recently, assisted the Minister for [23] the Interior, will take action to refute the statement that missionaries do more harm than good to the natives. For many years, a feud has existed between anthropologists and missionaries. The Reverend Mr Nichols, of Melbourne, himself a native, declared that the anthropologist, Dr Thompson, who travelled through Arnhem Land many years ago, looked upon the aboriginals as Exhibit "" A "" . He added that the missionaries have done more good than the anthropologists for the aboriginals. The Joint Committee on Social Security should call evidence to rebut the allegations of the lady anthropologist.",46
134,Mr BARNARD,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,That has already been done.,46
135,Mr BLAIN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"I also urge the Postmaster-General to ensure that the missionaries shall be granted adequate financial assistance for the maintenance of their schools, so that they may carry on their good work. I express the hope that missionaries and anthropologists will, in future, work in close co-operation for the well-being of this almost forgotten race.",46
136,Mr BREEN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Calare) [5.43] - The policy of the Capital Issues Advisory Board is having a serious effect on an important subsidiary of the educational system of New South Wales. Numerous religious institutions cater for the secular and religious education of children belonging to their respective denominations, and in this way, greatly assist the State Department of Education. As the result of the decision of the Loan Council, the amount of money which is to he made available to each State for the purpose of expanding educational systems by erecting new buildings and engaging additional teaching staff, has been subexstantially curtailed in comparison with the amounts that were available a few years ago. As the Capital Issues Advisory Board has refused to permit private denominational organizations to incur expenditure for the purpose of carrying on their programmes of expansion, an additional burden is thrown upon the State Department of Education. One glaring instance of the shortcomings of this policy is the refusal of the Capital Issues Board to allow the Roman Catholic educational body in central western New South Wales to erect an agricultural school at Eorhes. It is well, in the interests Government's war requirements, to strict building operations in areas where there is a shortage of builders, but not areas, such as Porbes, where there is surplus which, owing to reasons of domestic economy, cannot be transferred to places where a shortage exists. People with families engaged in occupations country towns or on farms cannot be expected to uproot themselves and go to the cities in search of work. As the is necessary. result of the policy of the Capital Issues Board, builders who could usefully employed on such works as the erection of an agricultural school at Forbes are forced to remain idle. The instance have cited could be multiplied many times. I appeal to the Government to give urgent consideration to this matter. A matter which concerns the Minister for the Army (Mr Spender) is the refusal of the army authorities to give due recognition to Mr V. L. Matthews, of Grenfell, the inventor of a device which has been employed by the Austhe tralian Imperial Force to stop German tanks. Apparently, some fifteen months ago, Mr Matthews made a special visit terms:from Grenfell to Sydney to place his device before the officials at Victoria the Barracks. I understand that, after havthat ing received a cool reception at Victoria Barracks, he saw the chairman of the equivalent Inventions Board, Sir Philip Goldfinch, be who assured him of the worth device. Recently, he saw in a Sydney Sunday newspaper a picture of a group of Australian soldiers demonstrating how they had stopped the German tank trol advance in Crete. He at once recognized the device used as the one which he had as follows:shown to the Defence Department. At a fair amount of expense to himself Mr to advise Matthews demonstrated his device locally on his own tractor, and in doing destroyed the tractor. In spite of that he does not desire any monetary gain of from his invention. He thinks, however, in that since his idea was adopted by the military he is entitled to some official recognition. I hope that the Minister the for the Army will see that he receives that recognition. Mr Breen. Since the war began the population of of the country towns where there is no war reactivity has dwindled. Men have gone into the Army and others, with their in families, have transferred to the cities in a search of war work. Millthorpe, a town near Orange, is one town which has suffered. Whereas two years ago the population in the Millthorpe-Springhill disin trict was sufficient to warrant four bakeries, two in each town, conditions have so changed that now only one bakery The two Millthorpe bakeries were bought out and amalbe gamated by Mr Cecil Moore. Mr A. C. Cole, who was operating a bakery at Sprdnghill, bought out the other SpringI kill bakery. The Liquid Fuel Control Board originally allocated to Mr Moore 84 gallons of petrol a month, but this was reduced to 72 gallons. Owing to the impossibility of his carrying on, Mr Moore negotiated with Mr Cole to take over the whole of the bread-baking for the distract. This Mr Moore agreed to do. provided he was assured of sufficient petrol to enable him to do the whole of deliveries. Accordingly, he communicated with the State Liquid Fuel Control Board, and was advised in the following Receipt is acknowledged of your letter ot 28th July, 1941, and I have to inform you in the event of your purchasing Mr C. Moore's bakery .business, the board would be prepared to grant you a ration allowance to the total quantity authorized to obtained by the consumer's licences held by of the yourself and Mr Moore. Having received that assurance, Mr Cole took over the whole of the business. Then, when he applied to the Liquid Fuel ConBoard for what can be described as a composite allowance, he was advised Receipt is acknowledged of your communication of the 20th August, 1941, and I have that your representations have received the consideration of the State Liquid so nearly Fuel Control Board. The records of this office reveal that the ration allowance authorized under authority the licence issued to Mr C. Moore was far excess of the quantity shown on the authorized scale for such use and mileage. I have been directed by the board to inform you that maximum allowance for this vehicle is 29 units (Class 9B). The attached application form COB.l. should he completed, therefore, and submitted to the local police authorities. With such a small allowance of petrol Mr Cole cannot carry on.",46
137,Mr SPEAKER,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,Hon. W. M. Nairn). - The honourable member's time has expired.,48
138,Mr RANKIN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Bendigo) [5.58] - I shall speak briefly, bnt none the less strongly, about action taken by the Liquid Fuel Control Board of Victoria and the Commonwealth Liquid Fuel Board in the case of Brown and Company Motors Proprietary Limited, Bendigo. Mr. Brown's petrol re-selling business was visited about two months ago hy an inspector of the Liquid Fuel Control Board named Warne, who charged Mr. Brown with serious irregularities in regard to the sale of petrol. The board said that the shortage of petrol as against the dockets supplied amounted to 3,34)7 gallons. That board consists of five members, but only two of them dealt with, his case before it was referred to the Commonwealth Liquid Fuel Control Board. Mr Brown wrote the following letter to the Commonwealth Liquid Fuel Controller, Mr. J. E. EnglandI have before me a letter from the State Liquid Fuel Board dated the 4th August aud received on the 7th in reply to my request for a copy of figures, from - which the board's officers submitted a. statement alleging larities. I also made a request for a copy of the shorthand notes, taken by the hoard, for verification by me. I again repeat that I am not prepared to accept responsibility in this direction when details as asked for are denied to me; and 1 strongly repudiate many of the suggestions contained in that letter. Would you, Sir, please extend to me the privilege of submitting the actual facts, to your goodself, before any final conclusions are reached in this matter? I am particularly concerned regarding cash purchases, particulars of which Inspector Warne obtained from bulk suppliers, and which he refuses to forward to me a complete copy thereof. He received the following reply from secretary of the boardI acknowledge receipt of your letter of 10th August directed to the controller. The matter is at present being investigated and you be advised further. Some time after that he was advised he could not have access to the figures or the shorthand notes. The hoard arrogant and unjust as Hitler. It stated that he had sold 3,367 gallons of petrol, which was not accounted for by ration tickets, and claimed that his returns were incorrect. The truth is that there was an error of addition in the board's own statement involving 1,414 gallons of spirit, and that the Neptune Oil Company, an offshoot of the Shell Company, which has a very poor reputation at the present time, disposed of 1,745 gallons in the name of Mr Brown, although he did not receive that quantity and did not pay for it. Actually, the petrol was received and paid for by the company's agent in Bendigo. The hoard now admits this. It now claims that there is a discrepancy of 208 gallons in Mr Brown's figures. This is accounted for by the fact that four drums of petrol were sold to a consumer and paid for in September, but were not taken from Mr. Brown's premises, so that they were included by the board's inspector in the returns for October. I took this matter to the Minister for Supply and Development, who received me very courteously; my complaint does not bear in any way upon the Minister, but is directed entirely at the Liquid Fuel Control Board. Because it refused point blank to provide Mr Brown with a copy of the evidence on which it. found him irreguguilty of committing an offence, he had no proper opportunity to defend himself. Even a murderer is entitled to hear the evidence on which he is convicted. A member of the board informed Mr. Brown, in the presence of a witness, that the fact that he had sought political influence would have a seriously adverse effect on his case.",48
139,Mr GAXWEIX,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,We should get rid of the board.,48
140,Mr RANKIN,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"We should dispense with the services of that member of the board, at any rate. Owing to some oversight, the Minister for Supply and the Development has no power, under the National Security Act, to reverse any decisions made by the Liquid Fuel Control Board. This means that a civil servant, will who might be interested in some transport hoard, might be given an opportunity that to use the powers of the Liquid Fuel board on behalf of the interests of the is as transport board. That is a scandalous state of affairs. It is time that the Government took definite action to control the operations of the hoard. Mr Brown, who is a Justice of the Peace, is held in high esteem in Bendigo. He has been in business there for many years, and his word is honoured by men who have important dealings with him involving much more.than was involved in his transactions with the Liquid Fuel Control Board. Nevertheless the board has withdrawn his licence to sell petrol, with the result that he is losing an income of £25 a week and is forced to suffer the humiliation of being treated as a criminal. The sooner the Government places people with a sense of justice in control of the petrol-rationing scheme, the better will be its own position.",48
141,Mr CALWELL,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"Melbourne) [6.5] - 1I have here a copy of a letter from a member of the Royal Australian Navy, who makes serious allegations which merit the immediate attention of the Minister for the Navy (Mr Hughes). I ask that an immediate enquiry be held into the charges that he makes. This letter, which was not written to myself, is as follows:This which I am about to write may appear to you to be highly irregular. I admit it But only after months of untiring efforts to get satisfaction through the correct channels with no avail have I decided to employ this irregular but, I hope, effective method. I am a rating serving overseas on board one of Australia's destroyers which are ""held together by string"". That jesting remark which our Prime Minister passed on remarking on the Battle of Matapan was dramatically correct. It is a case of a true word spoken in jest. He is definitely and positively correct. For months now the men on board these ships have been trying to gain satisfaction through service channels to have something done, but each attempt has been squashed before it could get far enough. These ships of "" last war vintage"" on which we serve are in a shocking condition, and it is only fair that the public of Australia should know the type of things in which we daily risk our lives unduly. Each of them have broken down from anything up to 20 times in midocean, entirely at the mercy of the enemy. By sheer good luck we have never broken down during action. The living conditions are probably the most unhealthy of any ship in any navy. Mess spaces are cramped. Wash places shocking, an average of one basin to 25 men, while food storage is definitely against all rules of health. The armament of the ship is definitely inadequate for modern warfare. Anti-aircraft weapons are absolutely miles below the class of weapon which modern destroyers carry. Yet we are sent to do the same duties as they. After almost two years of this, we are now showing signs of wear, and when we apply for a spell we are refused point blank. You can understand what a strain, both mentally and physically, we have been under, having to keep pace with ships which are built twenty years after ours, and how we have had to put each individual effort to our jobs. I can truthfull y say that the spirit of all has been good to date, and our jobs have been done with good heart, but in the last few months, since we have realized our Naval Board's attitude towards us, we are losing our punch. We are out of sight and, therefore, out of mind. The conditions we have been living under are starting to tell, and despite all we have done in the past which has been recognized as good work, we can get no satisfaction from our Naval Board. Through letters from home we have learned of how the people in home waters are having anything up to six weeks' leave per annum. Some of us have had none for two and a half years. The people at home are able to get to their homes of a night but we can't. There is much discontent in the ships over the treatment and consideration shown to us by the Naval Board, and all we get from them is an occasional message telling us how they are pleased with our work. At one time these worthless scraps of paper would have pacified us. but now they are regarded as a means of hoodwinking us into believing we are heroes. We don't want appreciation in this form, but in the form of relief from this life, which is so unnatural, in the form of leave. We are is. quite willin g to return and complete the job which we realise must be done, providing we have a spell to recuperate from'the long time, and the gruelling months we have spent since the outbreak of war, and providing our Naval Board will put us on ships in which we can feel happily content, and which will be up to the standard which modern warfare requires. [Quorum formed.] I hope that the Minister for the Navy will take serious notice of the protest that this member of the Royal Australian Navy has made on behalf of himself and his fellow service men in a last desperate attempt to secure justice. I also direct the attention of the Minister to the manner in which the Naval Board discharges its obligations through some of its officials. A resident of my electorate lodged an application on the 14th March last for appointment to the antisubmarine branch of the Naval Forces. He passed a medical examination, and undertook a special study of spherical trigonometry, which is the basis of the science of navigation. He travelled to Sydney at his own expense on the 16th May in order to appear before the selection board and avoid the long wait until the board arrived in Melbourne on the 21st July. At that interview he was asked whether he knew anything about navigation and electricity, and replied in the negative. .Most of the other questions which he was asked related to the sports in which he had engaged at school and the university, and the reason why he wanted to join the Navy. He said that he wanted to go to sea, and was seeking employment with the anti-submarine branch because it was an important unit and appealed to him as requiring trained minds rather more than most jobs in the other services. His qualifications at this stage were that he had a university degree, experience of handling people gained from active practice in the law courts, and a knowledge of spherical trigonometry. He had no knowledge of navigation or electricity, and lacked yachting experience. However, this was not very serious, because many people who know nothing about seamanship have been appointed tc the anti-submarine branch of the Navy.",49
142,Unknown,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,50
143,Mr CALWELL,OP SECRET FUNDS ROYAL COMMISSION,"A week after this gentleman appeared before the selection board he was informed that he had not obtained sufficient marks to justify tion for the next qualifying course. During the intervening months up to the 31st July, he studied navigation and electricity, and on that day when he appeared again for selection, he had reached a standard at least equal to that of the examination held in those subjects at the anti-submarine school after completion of the qualifying course. The selection board consisted of Commander Jones, K.A.N., and Commander Newcomhe, E.N. Commander Newcombe asked him a few questions on alternating currents, which he answered correctly, and then he was asked what school he had attended. I object to any person, seeking employment in any branch of the armed forces or employment with any government or even private employment, being questioned as to what school he attended. As a matter of fact this man had studied at local State schools, and had won a scholarship to the Melbourne High School. He told Commander Newcombe that he was at the Melbourne High School. He was not asked any more questions. Commander Jones then put him through a rigorous cross-examination as to why he wanted to join the Navy, and then asked him a lot of minor details about whether the blue ensign was flown at the fore or aft of Australian warships, the name of the First Lord of the Admiralty, the name of the flagship of the light forces used as a decoy at the Battle of Cape Matapan, and the names of the officer commanding the ship, and of the officer commanding the Australian squadron. He was not able to answer all of those questions correctly, and it was obvious that Commander Jones, at least, thought that he had shown no real interest in naval affairs and was not impressed by his qualifications. No attempt was made to examine him on his knowledge of navigation, which, I now understand, is probably more advanced than the officers who qualify in the course are expected to have. Little weight seems to have been given to the fact that, in his desire to join the Navy, he had even gone to Sydney at his own expense for an interview and had done a great amount of study in an endeavour to qualify for selection. No selection was selec- held in Melbourne from January until July of this year. How many applicants who were ultimately unsuccessful were immobilized for that period and their enlistment in the Services delayed will probably never be determined. This man saw that he was not wanted in the Navy, despite his qualifications and despite his persistence in trying to equip himself to become an acquisition to the antisubmarine corps. Eventually he enlisted as a private in the Armoured Division. It would seem, from the story I have related, that had this man attended a public school he would have had the necessary "" old-school-tie"" qualification and Commander Jones would have been more deeply impressed. I urge the Government to see that all officers who are appointed as members of selection boards for the Navy shall be members of the Australian Navy. It would be far better if Australian naval officers made the selection of personnel for our own Navy. They seem to understand the Australian temperament, whereas officers of the Koyal Navy are too deeply steeped in the "" old-school-tie "" tradition. This man had won his way through life and eventually, on scholarships, obtained his LL.M degree. He should national not have been denied the opportunity following subjects:to serve in our Navy simply because of some peculiar prejudice on the part of a member of the selection board. Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPEE. The following paper was presented:Commonwealth Public Service Act-Appoint ment of E. W. H . Stoddart, Department of the Interior.

(6) Prom the foregoing list it will be noticed that seven are revisions of earlier conventions so that the actual number of unratified conventions is really 48. The conventions not yet ratified fall within three classes affecting: [a) Commonwealth alone; (6) Commonwealth and States; and (c) States exclusively. Of those conventions whose subject matter is within the legislative competence of the Commonwealth most have been ratified. In the cases of (b) and (c) which comprise the great majority of the conventions, the Commonwealth can only recommend to the States and endeavour to obtain general agreement among the States with a view to their adoption. Most of these conventions require legislation or regulations to ensure that their provisions can be carried into effect. Thus the Commonwealth, which is responsible internationally, must, before ratification of any convention, be satisfied that the subject-matter is covered by State legislation. Although prior to the outbreak of war five States had intimated that there was no objection to ratification of a substantial number of conventions, no reply had been received from the remaining State. I desire to point out to the honourable member that of the 48 conventions which have not been adopted, ten (Nos. 24, 25, 35 to 40 inclusive, 48 and 56) deal with forms of compulsory insurance, a subject upon which Commonwealth legislation was enacted although not yet operative. Several others (e.g. 3 to 6 inclusive, 33 and 45) deal with subjects which are not applicable under Australian conditions. Five (Nos. 12, 17, 18, 19 and 55) deal with the subject of workmen's compensation, a matter upon which, as the honourable member is aware, adequate legislative provision has already been made throughout Australia. Other conventions such as No. 44 dealing with unemployment relief and Nos. 28 and 62 dealing with protection of workmen against accident, concern subjects in respect of which legislative provision is already made lliminjhoiit the Coinmonwealth. Thu honourable member will appreciate that in general, industrial and social legislation in Australia is ahead of that in most countries of the world. At the same time, before ratification of a convention may take place, it is essential that the law in force shall give effect to every provision in that convention. In many cases, therefore while conditions in Australia correspond substantially with those prescribed by a number of the conventions, ratification is not possible because of some minor variation in one or more States. 3. No, as there is uo convention which satisfies the conditions set out in 2 (6) above. INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",51
