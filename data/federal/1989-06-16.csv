3,Dr BLEWETT ,SENATE,"Bonython-Minister for Community Services and Health) (10.03)I indicate to the Committee that the Government proposes to agree to amendments Nos 1 and 2, which relate to the new proposals affecting general practitioners (GPs), and amendment No.4, which relates to the provision of a 008 service number. But the Government will not accept amendment No.3, which imposes a sunset clause on the reinsurance sections of the legislation. Therefore, it may suit the convenience of the Committee to consider amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4 together, as the Government will be accepting those amendments, and then to consider separately amendment No.3. I move: That amendments Nos I, 2 and 4 be agreed to. I would like to make some remarks about these proposals. The Senate spent a vast amount of time on these measures and, as I have pointed out, it has proposed several amendments to the very desirable initiatives which are incorporated in the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. The Bill is very clearly designed to improve the health care system for both patients and providers. Every proposal in the Bill came from either professional groups or groups within the community. The Government was responding to a series of proposals and changes which had been advanced from the community itself. The Australian Democrats and the Liberal and National parties in the Senate are proposing to block or delay some of these changes which will benefit patients, the majority <;>f general practitioners and the majority of people with private health insurance, particularly the elderly. A number of these issues will be dealt with by a Senate select committee. The Democrats' position is, as usual, fairly difficult to fathom and, in many ways, seems to us to be quite misguided. They have proposed various amendments which can be described as opportunistic, trendy or, in some cases, displaying a complete lack of understanding of the intention of the legislation. Let me take, first of all, the changes concerning general practitioners. These new arrangements were designed to provide financial incentives for general practitioners to undertake appropriate vocational training and maintain their skills in what is a rapidly changing field. 1 think everybody agrees, in principle, with those proposals. Everyone I have talked to says that, in principle, they agree with those proposals. The Opposition and the Australian Medical Association (AMA) in principle agree with them. We can say that, in principle, these proposals are supported by all the major groups concerned, both political and professional. The Australian Medical Association, which ran a campaign of misinformation against the legislation, in its own policy platform states: Adequate post-graduate training is a pre-requisite unsupervised medical practice. No medical practitioner should enter unsupervised general practice without having completed such training. That is a statement made by the AMA with which the Government, of course, fully agrees. The AMA policy also states: Regular participation in continuing medical education is essential. The Federal Government, by these measures, is trying to encourage both vocational training and continuing medical education. It is not going as far' as the AMA would require-that is, making it a pre-requisite for general practice. Those GPs who have sufficient practice experience or who complete appropriate postgraduate training and who are prepared to undertake continuing medical education will be eligible to use a new set of Medicare schedule items with higher Medicare fees and rebates. They will be eligible to enrol on a new vocational register and will be rewarded for their efforts in undertaking general practice training, just as physicians and surgeons are enrolled on vocational registers and receive higher rewards. The new arrangement will enhance the status of GPs and provide an improved career structure. It will provide better patient quality care, with opportunities for GPs to spend more time with their patients, and should result in a reduced requirement for the expensive ordering of diagnostic tests, pharmaceuticals and unnecessary referrals. I stress again something often entirely ignored in the public and Senate debate-that is, the new arrangements are entirely voluntary. For those GPs who are ineligible, or who choose not to enrol, the current items will remain on Medicare. So no-one is disadvantaged and no doctor is worse off. The fact is that about 90 per cent of GPs, both full and part time, will be automatically eligible to enrol, and they would be better off. More importantly, too, so would be their patients. The Senate amendment to refer clause 10 of the Bill to a Senate select committee will delay the introduction of the vocational register and the increase in fees and benefits, which would otherwise take effect from 1 August 1989. The Government is clearly disappointed with the attitude of the Oppofor sition and the Democrats. These very important changes will be put off because of the delay in the introduction of the register. It is the Government's view that the register could be established. As I indicated in this House, most of the concerns that the Seriate raised in debate on this legislation will, of necessity, be addressed when legislation is brought before both chambers of Parliament during the next session. But at least we would have had the register established, the new system in place and, of course, GPs benefiting from the new schedule of fees. So, clearly, we are disappointed that the Opposition has taken this view. We believe, and we are confident that the inquiry that takes place will prove it, that there is overwhelming support for the principles embodied in the GP sections of this legislation. We are confident that the Senate select committee will come to a similar conclusion. We have no fears whatsoever of exposing this issue and these important changes to what we see as the unnecessary scrutiny by the select committee. The decision has been made to refer the matter to a committee and we are quite confident in facing that committee with our proposals. The Government will cooperate with the committee in the interests of both patients and doctors in the hope that the matter can be quickly resolved and these important changes brought into practical effect. Given our confidence in the outcome of the Senate select committee's examination, there is little point in opposing the amendment which prevents the introduction of clause 10 of this Bill although, in accepting the amendment, the Government must express regret at the adverse financial impact on patients that will occur as a result of the inevitable delays. We are forced to say again to members of the medical profession that we hope they will maintain the existing schedule and charges until the new proposals are brought into place. We regret that we have to ask them this, but it is a decision made by the Senate. On that matter, I just. want finally to say something about the attitude of the AMA. As I have said in this debate and in previous debates, the AMA in its own policy lays down even tighter desirable requirements for GPs before they go out into unsupervised practice. The AMA has attacked the legislation on the grounds that there has not been sufficient discussion. I remind the House that in September last year the AMA unilaterally introduced new GP descriptors without any discussion with government whatsoever. It now says that there must be more discussion on a matter as important as this, although in September last year it was fully prepared, without any discussion with government, without any discussion with the community, to impose the new descriptors. Secondly, this Government offered the AMA full participation in the. discussions in developing this new regime for GPs. The AMA, unlike the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, refused to enter into those discussions and now has the hide to run around claiming that the issue was not discussed with it. I have to say that I believe the AMA emerges very poorly from its whole exercise in opportunistic politics. I hope that the AMA, having failed to participate in discussion to take up the opportunities it was offered, will at last endeavour to represent effectively the GP constituency through the Senate select committee that has been set up. I indicate again that the Government accepts with reluctance the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats and the Opposition. We have every confidence that the proposals of the Government will be proven to all before that select committee to be a major advance not only for GPs but also for their patients. The other amendment with which we have no quarrel is amendment No. 4 from the Australian Democrats. Amendments Nos 1 and 2 related to the proposal I have just discussed. Amendment No. 4 states: The Minister shall direct the Secretary to make provision for the development of a service which will enable a person to make a telephone call to an office that is under the general control of the Secretary, at no greater cost than the cost of a local telephone call. In many ways this is one of the Democrats' trendy amendments. We regularly make such provision, particularly when any major changes are being made. But, as my ministerial colleagues have accepted a proposal like this in relation to other social security and veterans' affairs legislation, we are prepared to take that amendment from the Democrats on board.",10
4,Mr SHACK ,SENATE,"Tangney) (10.15)-I wish to deal with these amendments in reverse order because my comments on amendment No. 4 will be very brief. The Opposition finds itself in the same position as the Government. We recognise that in the interests of facilitating public contacts and communications, the Government regularly provides a so-called 008 number to enable people to ring in at a charge no greater than the cost of a local call. In the Senate we judged this Australian Democrat amendment to be, in the Minister's words, one of the trendy matters that they hoped to put forward at, the last minute. If the Government chooses to accept it i.n order to be consistent with its action in a previous piece of. legislation, so be it. We are prepared to let it go through as well. I turn substantively to amendments Nos 1 and 2, which deal with general practice. In the short time. I have available I want there to be no doubt about the Opposition's stance on this issue. In his remarks, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) said that I would be expressing in-principle support for the changes as they impact upon general practice in this country. He can say that with some confidence because he has had the opportunity to hear me speak, not only in this place but also at another function outside the Parliament where we shared a platform. He is correct. The Liberal and National parties have no problem in principle with an attempt to improve and upgrade the status of general practice in this country, not only in terms of how general practice views itself, but also in terms of how the rest of the medical professionindeed, the specialities-and the public view general practice. It is lamentable that through historical circumstances a view has arisen in the community that if a doctor cannot get into one of the specialities he might as well do general practice. The view has arisen that general practice is not a speciality in its own right in terms of being simply that-general practice, in which there are very skilled and trained professionals who have frontline responsibility for heath care problems in the community and the expertise to deal with these matters properly. Increasingly, members of the public are resorting to specialists-I believe unnecessarily-when in days gone by we were quite satisfied with the services provided by general practice. General practice is one of the gateways into the medical system, as it were. If general practice were doing its job properly and being recognised as and rewarded for doing its job properly, I have no doubt that we would save money in the hospital system and the medical system generally. Complaints would be able to be treated at general practice surgeries. There would be no need for unnecessary referrals and no need to resort to secondary and tertiary medical care. There is no doubt where we stand in terms of valuing general practice and wishing to see it enhanced in its own eyes. It has an internal morale problem which I am sure the Minister recognises. General practice should be enhanced in the eyes of medical specialists, the wider medical community and the public generally. The Opposition has no complaint with any goals to try to institute a system of ongoing vocational education to encourage general practice to continually update itself so that it can discharge in a first class way its health care responsibility to the general community. In terms of some of the specifics of this legislation, the Opposition has no quarrel with the system of a different rebate to provide some financial incentives for general practice to undertake that ongoing vocational care. I turn to the question of a Senate inquiry and explain why I am now in the relatively happy position of congratulating the Government on accepting that Senate amendment. I shall explain why we supported the need for a Senate inquiry into these matters. It is not our aim to question the intention of the legislation or its goals, but we do wish to question very clearly and carefully the implementation of the legislation. It is all very well for the Minister to come here and say that after enormous consultation he has arrived at a so-called accord with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) and to cast the Australian Medical Association (AMA) as the villains in this piece. I give the Minister some unsolicited and gratuitous advice because I fail to appreciate why he goes out of his way to attack the AMA when, at the end of the day and despite other medical representation, it is still the largest medical body in Australia. If the Minister wanted to institute a system that impacts not only on members of the RACGP but also on the entire system of general practice in this country, in the interests of good government and good administration, he should have been at pains to consult with everybody, to take on board all their concerns and to try to answer their queries. To be as generous as I can on this last morning of the last sitting of the session, I point out that even if I were to concede all the arguments about implementation of these proposals-which I do not-I still believe that the Government has failed, as has the RACGP, in its efforts to educate general practitioners in the community. By supporting this reference to a Senate inquiry, we have provided a process of consultation that the Government failed to provide. We are providing a system scrutiny and the opportunity for, at the very least, education and understanding about the implementation of these proposals, both of which the Government failed to provide. Further, I suspect, we are providing the opportunity for evidence to come forward so that the Government can reconsider what it is on about. If it really wishes to achieve the goals that the Minister has espoused on behalf of general practice, it will make some changes to the implementation of this legislation. We will have an opportunity in this place and in the Senate during later debates to make the point that there need to be some very clear changes in 'the implementation of these proposals. We also think that if ever the Government embarks on this course again, it needs to recognise that there is no point in considering negotiations and consultations complete if it deals only with one group representing a proportion of general practice. It must take account of the views and opinions and try to answer questions and increase the knowledge of everyone who will be affected by the proposals. At the end of the day, if the Government is to achieve its goals it will have to rely on general practice to implement the system for it. We do not have the wit, the circumstances or the manpower, nor is it in any way possible for the Government or for the bureaucracy supporting the Government to achieve - hese goals. These goals will be achieved on behalf of the Australian community by general practice. If the Government wants to achieve the goals, it must ensure that general practice is on side, working with it. I say this in the most genuine way that I can. The Government should look to the way in which it has attempted to do this in the past and make sure that it does not make the same mistakes again. If it does make the same mistakes again we will have a repeat of this process where the legislation is, in the Government's words, delayed and subjected to unnecessary scrutiny and inquiry, but in our words, being properly' delayed and subjected to proper scrutiny providing for proper consultation which the Government has failed to provide. The Government claims that at the end of the day the whole system is voluntary and that no-one will be worse off. Then it says that because of this delay some people will be financially disadvantaged. Quite frankly, the Government cannot have it both ways; it cannot run both those arguments. After the Senate inquiry and with the support that I have expressed in this place and elsewhere for the ultimate goals of this general practice proposal, I believe that we can improve the system and look to the deficiencies of the implementation. We can answer all the concerns, educate and alleviate and hopefully remove doubts. We will improve general practice in this country, not for the short term but for the long term and we will improve health care through general practice.",12
5,Dr WOOLDRIDGE ,SENATE,"Chisholm) (10.25)I wish to speak to the aspects of these amendments relating to general practice training. I note the much more conciliatory line of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) today and I will reply in kind. I have two concerns and they revolve around the nature of the training and the entry onto the register. I support the statement of my colleague the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack) that people on this side of the House have no quarrel with the nature of continuing medical education and no quarrel with the attempts of the Minister to increase the ,status of general practice, but we do have particular problems with the nature of the training and how people would get on to that register. My particular concern is the closed shop nature of this matter. I know that that is not what the Minister intended and I know that he read out the policy of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), which is that adequate postgraduate training is a prerequisite of unsupervised medical practice. I presume that the Minister has the AMA's policy book. If he looks at it he will see that it was a 1985 motion. I attended the AMA assembly at the University of Sydney in 1985 when that motion was debated and passed. I took part in that debate. I went to lunch at the cafeteria next to the rugby oval and sat with the general practitioners after I had been defeated in that debate. They said, 'Don't worry. This had to get through. We want to limit manpower in general practice, we want to increase rebates, and this is the first step'. In my job as the representative of the younger doctors, I was continually up against this type of thing. When I spoke quietly to people from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, from the family medicine program, from NAGPA and from the AMA after the debates they would say that the real agenda was to limit the entry into general practice. My second concern is how this will affect women in the medical profession. Again, have no doubt that the Minister had .intention of purposely disadvantaging this group in the medical profession. Women an increasing number in the medical professpeaking sion; they will make up 24 per cent of it 1995 when this comes into place. While the Minister has said that it is there are documented cases already in Victoria of women having been told that if they are not on the register they will lose the positions that they currently have. The plight of women in medicine is difficult one. I refer to an article in the newspaper that I cut out in 1981, headed 'Women surgeons: the unkindest cut'. I will read the article in part because it is pertitice nent. It says: If a woman wants to specialise in the branches medicine most esteemed by doctors themselves she must be prepared to undertake six or seven graduate years of full-time training. These years correspond with· the period when most women are having children. Monash University sociologist Dr lone Fett says the result has been that women have been excluded from major specialities unless they ried, or childless, or postponed maternity until their early thirties ... Dr Fett wrote in 1976: 'While the medical profession complains that medical women under-use their medical education on the one hand, it virtually ensures that many will under-use it by making discriminatory regulations on the other'. Because of these discriminatory regulations there are 12 female surgeons currentiy in Victoria. It is the same sorts of discriminatory regulations that the College is putting up, through the Minister, and it will have the same effect on women. My third concern is the rigid nature of the training, and this puzzles me. I refer to the Doherty report at pages 267 to 271, which actually lists the training requirement in overseas countries. After the registration year in the United Kingdom, there is two years' training for general practice; in the United States of America, two years; in Canada, one year; in New Zealand, one year. We are proposing four years after the registration year. I am informed by the college that no other country in the English speaking world has these sorts of requirements. In the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand they are all entirely voluntary. This is at I odds with what the Minister said to Murray no Nicholls on 24 May. In Australia we are introducing a scheme that will be the most are rigid and most demanding in the English world. That is on top of six years by of medical training and one year, possibly two years, of postgraduate training before entirely voluntary, registration. My fourth concern is what it will do to special interest groups within general practice. People who have sought to specialise in areas such as rehabilitation or palliative care, industrial medicine or sports medicine will a be specifically excluded, and that puzzles Age me. Someone who works two sessions a week in general practice is eligible; someone who works two sessions a week in general pracand three sessions a week in sports medicine is not eligible. That does not make of sense. If a footballer with an injury to his ... knee sees a general practitioner working two postsessions a week he will get a higher rebate than someone who goes to a doctor who specialises in sports medicine. That seems simply unfair. My fifth concern is one raised by the Dohremain unmarerty report, where it says: The committee is not convinced that sufficient resources and appropriate hospital and community training posts are available to accommodate the needs of all. potential general practitioners as well as trainees in the various specialities. While it may appear to be voluntary, what the Minister is doing and what even Doherty acknowledges exists is putting people in a position where, because of a lack of training positions, there are not the jobs there for the training they wish to undertake. That is one way that the College can see of starting to wind back the entry into general practice. 1 .ask the Minister six very specific questions: First, why has he introd\lced the most rigid requirements of any country in the English speaking world? Secondly, why is he going against the recommendations of the Doherty report, which was presented only one year ago and was the most extensive inquiry into medical education ever seen in this country? Thirdly, why has he downgraded the relative importance of doctors who seek to gain particular expertise within general practice? Fourthly, why has he given the College of General Practitioners the ability to control manpower in the same outrageous way as other colleges? Fifthly, why has the College been given powers for putting people on and off the register that no other specialty colleges have? Sixthly, if he is so concerned about the level of rebates, given that the vast majority of doctors will qualify for the increased rebate anyway, why is he not increasing the rebates now? 1 look forward to this being discussed in the Senate inquiry and hope that we can work through these concerns.",14
6,Dr WOODS ,SENATE,"Lowe) (10.32)-1 must say that the debate over the last few weeks in this place, the other place and the public forum of the media has been rather reminiscent of the events of a couple of years ago when we had the then Leader of the National Party in Queensland saying things like, 'Don't you worry about that'. It has been said that there may be a few problems with this legislation, but the Government will fix them up later. I think the expression used was, 'We will do the fine-tuning a bit later'. The Government is asking us to pass this legislation as it stands, saying, 'Don't worry about the flaws in it. We will fix them up later. Nothing could be more inappropriate to the functions of this place. As the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack), my colleague the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and 1I have previously stated, we have no problem at all with the principle of encouraging education for general practitioners and further training. The problem we have is with the way in which the Government is doing it. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) said a few moments ago that the proposals he is putting forward would benefit patients and that, by obstructing them, the Opposition was in turn being detrimental to patients. The truth is, of course, that the proposals will benefit patients only if they give a better service. If one asks oneself whether one will get a better service if one has a female general practitioner, a family medicine problem or a sports injury problem, to take just a few examples of the many examples that we could list, the answer clearly is that one will not be better off. One will be seeing somebody with a special interest in, for example, sports medicine; yet that person will be able to bill one for a smaller amount than would have been the case if one had seen somebody with no particular expertise in that area. That cannot be sensible; it cannot be encouraging good medical practice. The Minister is saying that these people should get training in areas which are completely irrelevant to their particular practice so that they can get on this centralised register and therefore send a larger bill and get a bigger rebate. There is no sense at all in that proposal. The Minister also said that it was voluntary. Theoretically it is voluntary, in the same way as joining the mafia is voluntary in as much as if one does not do it one will be in trouble. The Minister has said that they would not be worse off. The truth is that, by his own figures, he has said that 90 per cent of the general practitioner population would be better off, which means that 10 per cent would be worse off. Ten per cent may be nothing to the Minister, but to those 10 per cent it is a significant problem. At this stage it is 10 per cent at the first entry. As time goes on and part time GPs and people with special interests continue with their practice, they will not be allowed to enter the register and the 10 per cent will become 20 per cent and the whole thing will deteriorate. Quite clearly, as the honourable member for Chisholm mentioned, there are major problems in the voluntary nature of this proposal in that if one does not actually get onto the register one will have major trouble getting a job. Any practice is going to prefer to employ somebody who will bring a larger rebate into the practice than somebody who is not on the register and who therefore brings in a smaller rebate. That is going to discriminate against female GPs. There is no doubt at all in my mind that that is the case. Repeatedly the Minister for Community Services and Health blames the Opposition for blocking proposals which he says will benefit pensioners in particular. Quite clearly, the remedy to that is in his own hands. He has the power to change the rebates at a stroke. As he has pointed out, the vast majority of GPs will get' the rebates anyway when they come in, if they come in. In that case, why not stop what he is saying is a problem for pensioners, in .particular, by changing rebates now rather than saying, 'No, I will not change them; I am going to take my bat home until they have got themselves on the register so I can control them'. That is what the register provides-centralised control, particularly from the Federal Government's point of view. It is also a preliminary to a nationalisation program. Of course, theoretically, there is no reason why the next stage in this procedure will not be the preferred provider kind of GP whereby if one is not a Government approved GP one basically cannot earn an income and cannot practise. We see that as being just one stage down the line. The consultation the Minister mentioned is really consultation in the form of divide and rule. The Minister has basically said that he will fight the Australian Medical Association (AMA) because it will have too much, power; that he will pit it against the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. It has offered the college a nice juicy bribe by giving it the power to control its own profession in such a way that it can limit entry, increase the incomes of its members and increase its own power. At the expense of the vast majority of other GPs, the elite from the College of GPs will have great-r control over their own practice. That is entirely inappropriate. The consultation undertaken by the Minister has been merely to pit the college against the AMA. If he had any sense, he would realise that the appropriate way of approaching this would have been to have had a meeting of both the AMA and the College of General Practitioners, not in an aggressive fashion, as was proposed a few months ago, but in a conciliatory fashion with the best interests of the profession at heart. I have no doubts at all that in that situation the AMA would come to the party and offer constructive suggestions on how to implement these proposals. As I said, we all accept the principle behind these proposals. I am sure that the review committee will agree with the findings of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in this matter. Hopefully we can not only encourage GPs to educate and train themselves but do so without imposing this centralised control upon their profession.",16
7,Dr BLEWETT ,SENATE,"Bonython-Minister for Community Services and Health) (10.38)In closing the debate, I want to make a few brief comments on the three amendments we are discussing. It is always easy in matters such as this to make rhetorical statements. The real difficulty is in turning rhetoric into something that can be implemented on the ground. That will always involve some winners and some losers. Some people will be dissatisfied; some will be uncertain. We have taken this matter into consideration in very long-term discussions, extending over many months and in great detail, with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners in order to work out a practical on the ground plan. We never believed that there would not be some opposition or some doubts from some sectors of the profession. Of course, that has all been made worse by a deliberate policy-I say this quite clearly-of misinformation by one medical organisation in this country. ),hat organisation did not participate in those discussions. I have no doubt that the historical judgment on the Australian Medical Association, when the offers made to the AMA by the Government are examined, will show that we offered full consultation with that organisation. Indeed, I have to say that consultation is a two-way process. It is not just a matter of, the Government being willing to consult, as we were; the other organisations have to be prepared to come to the party. The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods) said we have not given enough attention to the finetuning. I agree that more work has to be done, and I have indicated in this place that of course a lot of the post-register details would have to be worked out; legislation would have to come back here next session and be dealt with by both Houses of Parliamen.t. But when we talk about fine tuning, let us think about the AMA's position. In September last year the AMA was prepared to introduce a totally new system, with new descriptors, . without any finetuning at all. Again, I think the attitudes need to be contrasted. Also, I cannot accept the odd logic of the honourable member for Lowe when he says that of course the Minister must admit some people would be worse off because 90 per cent will be better off. But it is conceivable in logic, as is the case here, that 90 per cent will be better off while 10 per cent will be in the same position that they are in now. It does not have to follow that because 90 per cent are better off the other 10 per cent are worse off. I accept that some 10 per cent will be in the same situation as they are in now. The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who has been very active in these debates, posed a whole series of issues to me. I want briefly to attend to them. First of all, he raised the closed shop nature of the proposals. The closed shop-if it be a closed shop-suggested in these proposals in relation to general practitioners (GPs) does not compare, as I think some of his own evidence suggests, with the closed shops that already exist in areas such as the honourable member for Lowe's own specialist area-that of physicians-or even more so with surgeons. If both honourable members are supporting me in breaking down some of the excessively closed shops that exist, I look forward to their support in future sessions of this Parliament. But obviously this proposal gives the Royal College a professional status in relation to GPs that it has not had before; it gives it an organisational authority which it has not had before. Certainly, it is a much looser, freer and more open operation than exists for most of the professional speciality organisations in medicine at this time. The situation of women in the profession was raised. The provisions made by the Royal College for the part-time training of women GPs would put every other professional medical college to shame. In other words, the Royal College is much more prepared, much more ready, to accept part-time training, and accelerated part-time training, than the other professional colleges. Much has been made of comparisons with other countries, and there has been reference to the Doherty report on Australian Medical Education and Workforce into the 21st Century. That report said that we should not introduce a mandatory system of GP training. We have not introduced a mandatory system. The GPs have a choice. Let me go through the situation in other countries. In Britain there is three years' compulsory vocational training in general practice. It is compulsory in a real sense that one cannot practise either as a sole practice or as a partnership in Britain, one cannot go into the private side of the British system, without having that three-year qualification. It is true that one can go into a salaried position-Dr Woods-But everybody is in a salaried position.",17
8,Dr BLEWETT,SENATE,"I am talking about practising in Britain, which is based on a capitation system-that is, the private element as distinct from a salaried element, in a health centre or hospital. When I am talking about the private system, I am talking about the private system, I am talking about the British system of paying private practitioners for their patients through a capitation system. A GP cannot run such a practice or be a partner in such a practice unless he has such a qualification. In Canada there are two years of voluntary training but, unlike in Australia, GPs in Canada play a major role in the hospital system. I think there is much to be said for that; it is something we should be looking at here. In Canada, most GPs are involved in the general hospital in their locality. They cannot operate in such a hospital unless they have that two years of further post-graduate training as a GP. It is true that in New Zealand there is a requirement for only one year of voluntary training at the moment, but the New Zealand Medical Council has recently introduced an indicative register for GPs who demonstrate competence and training. Current requirements are demonstrated competence and five years' experience, three of which must be in general practiee. From 1990, doctors will have to be members of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners, which involves passing an examination. So the world is moving very rapidly-much too rapidly for the Opposition. We really need to catch up with the changes that are taking place around the world. On the issue of specialities, I agree there are some problems, but I regard general practice as itself a speciality. Sports medicine, for instance, is a different form of tice. It has many advantages for those who practise it. Those honourable members who are doctors will know that sports medicine tends to involve a much greater use of procedures than other forms of general practice. The honourable member for Lowe and the honourable member for Chisholm would know that, unfortunately, under our system procedures are highly valued and consultations are not so highly valued. If one is involved in a speciality such as sports medicine, which places much greater emphasis on procedures, one is already drawing some clear financial benefit that flows from that. We have to be careful about treating general practice as a proper speciality. That involves a general provision of services. The Select Committee will have to discuss some of these issues. Let me say that I respect general practice. I respect sports medicine and some of the other specialities, but I think they are specialities which are distinct from general practice. I now refer to the ideological comment by my friend the honourable member for Lowe that this register is the first step towards centralised control leading to nationalisation. I point out to the honourable member that he is already on a register with the Health Insurance Commission. All specialists are listed on a register with the HIe because they cannot be paid the highest specialist fees unless they are on that register. That has been the case for many years. None of that is a step towards nationalisation. Equally, this GP register would be just another register in addition to the specialist registers that the HIC already has. It is in no sense a step towards centralised control or some form of nationalisation; it is a necessary feature. Just as it is necessary for specialist physicians and specialist surgeons to be listed on the register so that they can be paid the highest specialist fees, in the future that will be the case for general practitioners. I am sure that many of these issues will be debated further by the Senate Committee. I am hopeful that the same understanding will be shown to them as has been shown increasingly by general practitioners who think seriously about the proposals that have been prepared. I take this opportunity to thank the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. prac- Despite all the abuse that was launched against it, it continued effectively to represent its clientele during six or seven months of very bitter attack because it was prepared to enter into consultations. We will continue to do all that we can as a government to honour the commitments we have made to that college and to the GPs in the community. Question resolved in the affirmative.",18
9,Dr BLEWETT ,SENATE,"Bonython-Minister for Community Services and Health (10.48)-1 turn to the amendment with which we do not agree-that is, amendment No.3, relating to the imposition of a sunset clause on the reinsurance legislation which would bring it to an end in 12 months time. I move: That amendment No. 3 be disagreed to. In regard to that part of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 relating to health insurance, the Government has made changes to reinsurance which we believe are a considered response to pressures developing in the private health insurance sector, worked out after considerable consultation with all elements of the private health care market. The reinsurance arrangements have taken about a year's consultation with all the elements in the health insurance market. This sort of complex and detailed legislation takes a lot of consultation. The reinsurance arrangements form an integral part of effective community rating whereby all people are treated equally for health insurance purposes, regardless of their age, medical history or family size. This provides added protection to the aged, the chronically ill and large families, who would otherwise face prohibitive private health insurance charges. Our changes are designed to extend the reinsurance arrangements to include all hospital costs, both basic table and supplementary benefit, from day one for people aged over 65. They will basically extend and make more effective the principle of community rating. They are designed to protect the aged and share the cost of their hospitalisation more evenly amongst the funds. They create a level playing field between health funds so that health fund contributors are protected and the industry is stabilised, while still allowing health funds to compete on issues of service delivery and cost-effectiveness. The Government is also providing a oneoff payment of $20m to the reinsurance account this year to minimise the effect of these changes on those funds with increased liability. We believe that that transition funding is necessary. The changes remove the current disincentive for health funds to insure people aged over 65. There is no doubt that in practice there is a disincentive for health funds to enrol people aged over 65. These changes have attracted the overwhelming support of pensioner groups and, indeed, the great majority of health insurance funds, funds representing over 80 per cent of contributors. In regard to the Senate's proposal for the establishment of a select committee on issues relating to private health insurance, the Government regards this as duplicating an inquiry already established by the Australian Health Ministers Conference. The health Ministers have already agreed to have an inquiry on a whole range of these issues, so there is an element of duplication in this Senate proposal. The terms of reference that have been passed by the Senate seem to lack an adequate assessment of this issue because they make no specific reference to the two chief elements which drive up contributor rates-that is, the charges made on private patients by the public hospital system and the charges made on private patients in private hospitals. They are the two chief factors determining the rate of increase in health contribution rates, yet they are not directly referred to in the terms of reference. I look forward to receiving some guidelines from the shadow Minister, the honourable m.ember for Tangney ( Mr Shack), who no doubt helped to write them. I believe that others must have been involved to produce such a one-sided set of terms of reference. I hope that those issues which are fundamental to an assessment of insurance will be able to be discussed in the committee. Nevertheless, despite these inadequacies, we will cooperate with the Senate inquiry while it examines issues which are important to the public. We will respond to any recommendations which would improve the system within the framework of Medicare. Indeed, the Government belie-es it would be valuable for the inquiry to be expanded, as I have said, to cover other issues relating to private hospitals and equity of access by the public, because that is probably needed to ensure that a full assessment is made. The Government totally rejects the proposal to impose a one-year sunset clause on health insurance changes. This, in our view, would cause total chaos in the health insurance industry and much financial hardship to elderly people. It would be irresponsible for the Government to accept a 12-month sunset clause of this nature in relation to such complex legislation. It is totally unacceptable to the Government and, I believe, to the people of Australia, that these new arrangements would come into effect for 12 months and .then drop off on 30 June 1990. As I say, it would be irresponsible for the Government to accept such an amendment. I believe that it would be irresponsible for any party which aims to be a government to accept such an amendment. It may well be easy for the Australian Democrats to move such motions because they will never be in government, but I think that any party which hopes to form a gov.ernment should look very seriously at whether it should support such a motion. It would lead to increased instability and insecurity. It would set impossible deadlines for the Government to meet. In addition, there would be uncertainty for the health funds as to their future position, with the result that benefit to contributors through lower contribution rates would not occur. There are already well advanced proposals for a merger between the major health funds in Victoria and South Australia. These proposals would represent a significant rationalisation of the industry with savings in overheads and other economies to the considerable advantage of the contributors of those organisations. This merger is very much dependent on the reinsurance changes that are occurring. The sunset clause would mean that the merger would probably not proceed. The health spokesman for the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter, who is responsible for this sunset clause, stated in the other place on Wednesday that elderly groups were totally in agreement with his motion for a sunset clause. I can only say that Senator Coulter seems to have misled other senators as his proposed sunset clause has been roundly condemned in writing by the Australian Pensioners Federation, the Australian Council on the Ageing, the Australian Retired Pensioners Association, the Victorian Council on the Ageing and the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia. These people regard the proposed changes not as stopgap measures but as fundamental reforms which are necessary regardless of what the select committee recommends. Therefore, while we are fully prepared to participate in the select committee and will take on board recommendations for improving the system within the framework of Medicare, we totally reject the proposal for a sunset clause as being a political ploy designed to bring instability to the private care sector and which can only harm health fund contributors, particularly the aged.",19
10,Mr SHACK ,SENATE,"Tangney) (10.56)-1 find myself in a position of not being able to be as generous in my comments on this section of the legislation as I was in my comments on general practice. The Government deserves the strongest possible condemnation for the way in which it has handled this issue. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) talks about extensive consultation. I think he needs reminding from time to time that we still operate in a parliamentary democracy. He and the Government stand condemned for the speed with which they moved this Bill through the House of Representatives originally and for the lack of opportunity that we, as representatives of the public, have had to focus on these important, far-reaching changes to Australia's health care arrangements. Even more importantly than that-if there is something more important-they stand absolutely condemned for the outrageous scare campaign that they have been conducting within the aged community of this country. In the Minister's press release of 23 May he said: Pensioners wi1l pay more for health insurance if Opposition plans to shelve current legislation succeed. . . . the Opposition has deserted every pensioner and every pensioner group, which has been unanimous in their support of changes . . . I would like the Minister to explain in his closing remarks the 14 June statement by the President of the New South Wales Council of Senior Citizens, Mr Joe Weston, who also represents the Council of Retired Union Members, amongst others. Mr Weston accused the Government of making misleading claims designed to frighten the elderly. He said: The Government. legislation wi1l force many elderly people to forgo priva,te insurance and force them to rely on Medicare. Such statements are hardly consistent with the Government's claim that its plans enjoy the unanimous support of pensioner groups; I inform the House that the truth of the matter is that the aged members of the ·community are now beginning to realise that the health Government was attempting to hoodwink them into believing that the reinsurance proposals would provide a long term solution to the problems of the health funds to which they belong. Slowly there is a growing community awareness that redistributing the cost of the aged amongst the health funds is far from being a satisfactory solution when more than two-thirds of Australia's 71 health insurance funds operated at a loss in 1987-88. Operating losses for all the funds came to almost $60m last year. It is not hard for the House to appreciate the size of the problem. What is the Governm'ent's solution? What is its supposed adequate response to a problem of such magnitude? Once again, we have seen fiddling at the margins-bits being lopped off' the newer and smaller closed funds and grafted on to the older and larger ones. To top it off', there is a splash of government money thrown into act as a sweetener. Put simply, this is a recipe for disaster, since the net result will be fewer insured people and, therefore, fewer lower risk contributors to offset the costs of the high risk ones. The Government bleats that its legislation will restore stability and certainty to health insurance. The only certainty is that the number of people with health insurance will continue to decline under this Government. In such circumstances how on earth can there be stability? What is the Government's record in terms of giving health insurance stability? Let me list some of the things which the Government has done to undermine the funds since it has been in office. In 1984, it introduced Medicare, thus creating a disincentive for people to provide for their own health insurance costs through private insurance. It removed tax deductions for health fund contributions. It gave itself a monopoly over medical insurance, thus robbing the funds of the largest proportion of their business. It raised the Medicare levy in 1986, driving out even more people from the health funds. It slashed its contribution to the health benefits reinsurance trust fund from $IOOm in 198283 to a mere $lm in 1988-89. It has abolished the Commonwealth bed day subsidy to private hospitals. It has reduced the Medicare benefit from 85 per cent of the schedule to 75 per cent for medical costs of private patients in hospitals, forcing the funds to pay the resulting 25 per cent gap from their basic tables. It has prevented the funds from accumulating special reserves to cover the cost of long term patients. It has required that privately insured patients be automatically classed as private patients, regardless of whether they are receiving genuine private treatment. The Government has legislated to force the funds to pay benefits for nursing home-type hospital patients and it has forced the funds to pay for prosthetic implants which were previously supplied from the public purse. As a consequence of all these Government moves, family contribution rates have been pushed up by around $4 a week. The only compensating incentive is the knowledge that people might be able to avoid getting stuck in public hospital queues. Bit by bit this Government has chipped away at the funds. When we add it all up, the sum total of the shift of responsibility hils added around $400m to the liability of the funds. Now the Government hopes that a one-off injection of $20m of taxpayers' money, combined with contributions to the reinsurance pool from the smaller and newer funds, will create some sort of magic pudding which will prop up the whole edifice until after the next election. I wish to focus for a minute on the $20m. The Government says that it is for the reinsurance pool. According to Senator Cook, arising out of questions that my colleague Senator Puplick asked him, the money is not to go into the pool but will be distributed to some of the funds. The distribution will be calculated on the basis of claims experience in 1989-90. As a rough guide, using the 198788 figures as a base, recipients of this money will be six profit funds, 14 closed funds and seven open funds. The Government is fudging the issue. It is not injecting support directly into reinsurance and the pool. Instead, it is putting money into try to smooth things out for some of the funds in order that they can contain their contribution increases for the funds that they are being forced to contribute into the pool. It is a very short term measure. We then ask the obvious question: What will happen when the $20m runs out? I will tell honourable members what will happen. Rates are going to rise and membership of those funds is going to decline. I say to the Minister that it will simply not work; it will not wash. We are not asking him to take our word for it. I quote from a paper by Geoff Richardson and Dick Scotton, the architect of Medibank imd the· co-designer of Medicare, on the subject of the new insurance arrangements. It states: ( At best the proposals may postpone the need for a more fundamental change. However, if implemented they are likely to result in a further anaesthetising of market forces. Funds that achieve cost savings on behalf of the elderly will have to pass them back to the reinsurance pool. As there is little or no advantage to their members or themselves there will be even less incentive to engage in entrepreneurial activity to reduce costs. Further, with such insensitivity to performance we could expect an increase in the costs of the elderly. For reasons such as these we do not accept that the reinsurance plans will succeed in giving the aged and chronically ill the security and certainty that they should have in relation to health care. I return to the point I made in my speech at the second reading stage. This proposal is a stopgap measure, an attempt to paper over the cracks in our crumbling health care system and to draw a veil over the inadequacies of Medicare between now and the next election. The Government is driven by a political strategy to say that the entire thing is fixed, then to limp home to the election and hope that it will fall over the line, after which it will be forced to face up to the structural problems contained in Medicare and the health insurance system generally. It is a thinly disguised plan to remove Medicare from the political agenda in the lead-up to the next election. . We are not interested in expediency, and we are certainly not interested in short term solutions when it comes to health insurance and health care. Health care is too important to be kicked around like a football, and that is what this Government is trying to do. It even talks about the reinsurance arrangements as paving the way for a return to a level playing field. We are not in a game. Health care for some is a matter of life and death, and that is why we want the Senate to examine carefully all the issues which the Government will not face up to. That is why we want an investigation which can arrive at some long tenn solutions to the problems of the private health care sector. Medicare is clearly failing to live up to its promise of access for all according to need, funded by all according to means, and for as long as public hospital queues run to something like 100,000, the situation will only get worse. It is high time to redress the balance between the public and private sectors before the whole system collapses. Through the agency of a Senate committee we will investigate how to do that.",21
11,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ,SENATE,Mr MiIlar)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,23
12,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,SENATE,"Moreton) (11.06) - I wish to join in the sentiments expressed by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack), and particularly to highlight that this is ply a political ploy by the Government in rearranging the chairs on a sinking Titanic. The private health funds, and particularly their members, have been belted and belted by the present Government over the last few years. No wonder the Government had to introduce measures to try to paper over the cracks. The number of people with private health cover has continued to fall over the' years. I notice that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) is about to pick up his pen to try to refute that comment with some concocted argument that I would have heard previously. The latest figures, which I think came out in April, show that about another 63,000 Australians ceased to have private health cover over the previous quarter.",23
13,Dr KLUGMAN ,SENATE,They are saving money. Good luck to them .,23
14,Mr DONALD CAMERON,SENATE,"They are saving money, and good luck to them, but what the honourable member for Prospect does not understand is that every time a family or an individual abandons priv-te health cover and therefore no longer has access to the private hospital system, that individual or family then becomes a drain on the public hospital system. That is one of the realities. This Government stands condemned for the way if has eroded people's incentive to take care of themselves over the years. The point, was made by the shadow Minister that the Government is big-noting itself today with the .promise of an injection of $20m into the reinsurance pool. The year we:went out of office our Government's contribution was $ 100m. This year I think the Government is contributing $lm, which is a fall of $99m in current values. Yet the Minister stands here today and says, 'We are going to inject $20m, but we are not going to do it in the future. It is a one-off contribution and we expect you to pay for yourselves'. The shadow Minister has correctly stated that the Government has transferred the burden of at least $400m, and I believe the figure is closer to $450m, onto the shoulders, of the people who have taken out private health cover. My own family pays at least $1,300 annually simply for hospital cover, and that sim- excludes the contribution that we make through the 1.25 per cent Medicare levy directly through my salary. The cost of health cover in this country has become astronomical under the present Minister and he has been the Minister for Health from the very inception of the Hawke Government. 1I have long admired you as a Minister because you are very clever when speaking on your feet. You come in here and wrap parcels up and give arguments to try to justify why things are done. But every time you say something, only those sleeping would not the thoughts behind what you are saying, because you are very clever politically.",23
15,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,SENATE,Order! The Community honourable member is ostensibly addressing the Chair and he should address his remarks of admiration through the Chair and not the Minister.,24
16,Mr DONALD CAMERON,SENATE,"Well, my in playing admiration is certainly muted in reality, cause he is just a clever politician and hardly ever to be trusted because there is always ulterior motive to whatever he does. It is exactly the same with reinsurance. He knew that the whole private health cover system was grinding to a halt. He sent for the doctor to do anything to get over the hump. The approach to this problem. reality is that within a year's time the problem will be very much with us. 1 applaud the Opposition for the strength of its conviction. 1 did not mean to start argument between the Minister for Health and the Minister. for Defence ( Mr Beazley) and the shadow Minister on this, who are all at the table. It just shows how sensitive Goverr,.ment is on this subject. Taking people's tax deductability, or rebate as then was, which they could use to look after themselves, was a disincentive. The Governsolution. ment selectively put the burden onto the private health funds by reducing the Medithe care contribution to the medical costs of private patients in hospitals, forcing the funds to pay the resultant 25 per cent gap from basic tables. That was another slap at the people who are trying to care for themselves and provide their own cover. 1 conclude by saying that the Government has a very shabby record in what it has done to the private sector and to these people who have tried to cover and protect thema selves. It is only to be expected that it has problems, because they are problems that the Minister created. The only health fund that used to get into trouble a few years was Medibank Private. It had a lot of diffiure culties. It had to plunder $21m from Victorian contributors to save its bacon in other States. The Health Benefits Association of Victoria has not had a very successful track record in that State. A lot of the problems that face the health funds today in other States are very much Blewett and Hawke be analysing Government created.",24
17,Dr HARRY EDWARDS ,SENATE,"Berowra) (11.14)-I wish to speak very briefly to the Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill to support my colleagues, in particular the shadow Minister, the to honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack). He pointed out that the Government has been running quite an outrageous campaign on the fears of pensioners with bemisleading claims that have frightened them, and in particular attempting to suggest that an in the proposals before the chamber the Government is proposing really effective solutions to this problem, particularly of a long term and lasting nature. That is not the case. This most definitely is a stopgap, bandaid ' The Opposition is allowing this legislation to pass but it is attempting to draw the attention of the chamber and the people of an Australia to the fact that this is not a long term solution to the problem. So it is quite outrageous to sow the idea in the minds of pensioners and others that the Opposition is the obstructing something which would be of benefit to those people. It is allowing this it stopgap measure to pass but is drawing attention to the fact that it is not a long term The Govermtlent needs to turn its attention to that. Reinsurance can work at best of times only if there is a large and significant private insurance industry and a significant contribution from government. The community rating system makes extremely difficult effective competition between private insurers. It is difficult for all the funds to charge the same rate because they have different patterns of membership. We can make it work, to some extent, through reinsurance proposals but only in the context of large private insurance industry and a signow nificant contribution from government. As has been stressed, in effect, the private insurance funds have been knocked from pilago lar to post by this Government in one measafter another. The membership of funds has fallen from about 67 per cent to 46 per cent. Here we have another stopgap measure, the effect of which will undoubtedly be that rates will rise again and there will be a further decline in membership. So quite fundamental change is required in this area. The Opposition is drawing the attention of this Parliament and the people of Australia to that necessity. This short term measure is a bandaid solution. As the $20m runs out and as rates begin to rise again, what we are saying will become very evident. More people will leave the funds. We need a quite fundamental . reform of the so-called Medicare system. Only then can we have an effective health system in this country.",24
18,Dr WOODS ,SENATE,"Lowe) (11.l7)-The issue before us is vitally important. I think it is important that we establish exactly where the blame lies. Quite clearly, it is with the. Government. The Government has tried to blame some of the newer funds, which are making profits, for being greedy and rapacious-they are just two of the words it has used in its scaremongering tactics. The reality is that the newer funds, such as Health Australia, have only 2 per cent of the market. How it is possible for any fund with 2 per cent of the market to have the impact that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has been claiming is completely beyond me and completely beyond any reasonable assessment. Quite clearly, the blame lies with the Government. Let me take two examples. The first refers to the financing of the reinsurance pool. The figures speak for themselves. Under the Fraser Government, the contribution to the reinsurance pool was a total of $575m. Under the current Minister, over the last six years, the contributions have totalled only $46m.",25
19,Dr KLUGMAN ,SENATE,Good on him.,25
20,Dr WOODS,SENATE,The honourable member is proud of $46m compared with $575. There must be something wrong with his logic.,25
21,Dr KLUGMAN ,SENATE,You can't call it private insurance and then make the Government pay.,25
22,Dr WOODS,SENATE,"I remind the honourable member that the other reason that the funds are in such terrible trouble is that the number of privately insured people has dropped from 67 per cent to 45 per cent. So fewer people are being insured because of a number of factors which have discouraged private insurance. As a result, we cannot expect funds to be viable. That is why the funds are facing the difficulties they are facing now. What people in their right minds would start up a new fund at this stage? Given this legislation, who would enter the health insurance market? Nobody would. The only way to fix the problem in the longer term is to encourage people to be privately insured, and that is part of the thrust of the Liberal Party's proposal. That is what we will do and that is how these problems will be solved in the longer term. As my colleagues have said, this solution is simply a bandaid, a temporary solution just to get the Government over the next election. The Government has indulged in scaremongering tactics to frighten pensioner groups in particular. It has tried to put the blame where it does not belong. The blame for all the problems, not just the current problems, lies on the other side of the House. I think that scare campaign is despicable. If the Government is so sure that the committee, when it reviews the matter, will endorse not only community rating-we share that endorsement-but also the Government's proposals, why is it so scared of the sunset clause? On the one hand the Minister is saying that the committee will say that the Government is doing the right thing and, on the other hand, the Minister actually said that the Government wanted the changes' to be implemented regardless of the findings of the committee. Basically, the Government wants it both ways. The Government wants the committee to endorse what it is saying but, when it comes to the legislation, it wants to ignore the committee's findings. The Government is having a bob each way and that is nonsense. We put the blame for the problems which we are facing at present entirely with the Government and the Minister. It is hoped that these temporary measures will get the Government through to the next election. I am delighted to know that the Minister will be moved to a new shadow Ministry after the next election.",25
23,Dr WOOLDRIDGE ,SENATE,"Chisholm) (1l.20)I would be grateful if the Minister for Community Services and Health· (Dr Blewett) could answer two questions when he is summing up. I refer to the paper written by Dr Dick Scotton, to which the. honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack) referred. Dr Scotton says: The two possibilities therefore appear to be that either the impact of the new regulations will be small and pointless, or that it will be large and destructive . . . I ask the Minister: Which will it be-small and pointless or large and destructive? If it is neither, could the Minister please say where Dr Scotton's logic is wrong? Secondly, Dr Scotton states: . . . the proposed changes to the reinsurance pool will accelerate the trend towards adverse selection. marginal good risk individuals that will drop their insurance . . '. It appears that health funds are actively encouraging elderly members to join. I have a facsimile from one of Australia's largest funds which I received yesterday, which states: There would be no encouragement to enrol or retain elderly membership . . . That is, there would be no encouragement to do this if· the sunset clause is approved. My second question to the Minister is therefore: If young people who are good risks are going to drop out and the funds are going to enrol older people who are a high risk-and given that for every $1 put in by someone over the age 65, that person takes out $3will not the total liability of the funds increase? How then will premiums not rise?",26
24,Dr BLEWETT ,SENATE,"Bonython-Minister for Community Services and Health) (11.23)I do not propose to enter into a widespread Medicare debate because, undoubtedly, we will have 12 months or more of that. It will be a continuing debate and I will have plenty of opportunity to reply. I am pleased with the vote of confidence from the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack), who said that, after the next election, the present Government will have to fix up the insurance system. I want to deal with two or three specific points that have been raised. The first point is that somehow we manufactured a campaign by pensioners. I think that is a very poor judgment of pensioners. The campaign by pensioner groups has been very spontaneous because those people recognise that, whatever the long term issues and problems, there are clear benefits for them in this legislation. I think it is very odd for honourable members opposite to say that pensioners were somehow worked up and scared by the Government. Clearly, they have recognised their own interests in the present legislation. Despite the one letter quoted by the honourable member for Tangney, I am still confidentand this is confirmed by all the correspondence I have had in the last 24 hours-that the overwhelming body of groups representing the aged in this community support this legislation as addressing one of their concerns. I think Dick Scotton would be as surprised as anybody else to discover that he had anything to do with Medicare. He did have a past with Medibank but the latest effort to somehow portray him as being one of the architects of Medicare would surprise him as much as it surprises me. I certainly disagree with him that the effects will be either small or pointless or large and destructive. My own view is that there will be a series of changes which will have beneficial effects. These changes will not have massive effects on the system; we do not see that occurring and vie do not see that as needing to occur. We believe that the changes that do take place will be significant and beneficial to the system. In terms of the honourable member's other question, of course that will depend on whether lots of young and' healthy people drop out of the funds. There is not much evidence of that occurring. At present 80 per cent of fund members are not aged people. There is a very big pool of non-aged people in the funds. Of course, it is important to try to maintain that balance, and my view is that it will be roughly maintained by these proposals. After the change in the health insurance situation in 1984 when Medicare was introduced many people did drop out of private insurance, but the number of privately insured has been relatively stable since that date, fluctuating between 46 and 49 per cent of the population. Most interesting of all, despite the increase in charges in those four years, one million more people have taken out top rate private insurance for access to private hospitals. We need to look at these trends very carefully. 1 believe that the changes we are making here, while not massive or sweeping, will have a beneficial effect on the health insurance system. For these reasons, we reject the sunset clause proposals but are prepared to participate fully in the Senate inquiry. We will take on board any reasonable proposals that emerge from that inquiry, provided that they are within the framework of Medicare. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Question resolved in the affirmative. INTERNATIONAL AVIATION: NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed from 15 June, on the following paper presented by Mr Willis: International Aviation: Maximising the BenefitsMinisterial Statement, 15 June 1989. and on motion by Mr Robert Brown: That the House take note of the paper. EmptyHere the statement made by the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) on international aviation. We often get calls from the Opposition for further deregulation and further micro-economic reform. This is a good area in which to contrast the rhetoric of the Opposition with the actions of this Labor Government in providing for more efficient and more effective aviation, both domestically and interstate. Firstly, I draw to the attention of the House the fact that this Government, after 35 years of detailed economic regulation of domestic aviation, indicated in October 1987 that the two-airline agreement would no longer operate, and provided the requisite notice for total deregulation of domestic aviation. It needs to be said again and again when the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull), the shadow Minister, says in this House how much in favour of deregulation he is that the fact is that during the years of the Fraser Government not only did that Government not deregulate domestic aviation but it entrenched it. We have shadow Ministers today saying what the Opposition wlll do and how the Government is not going far enough, against the background and history of opposing efficiency and microeconomic reform, and completely failing to come to grips with the economic challenges and opportunities facing the Australian people. It ought to be said that, within the framework of the two-airline agreement, the action of the Opposition when it was in government was not to promote fair competition. I have detailed previously in this House how action after action, government initiative after government initiative, was taken on the conservative side to prop up the private enterprise carrier and to bring down Australian Airlines. Mr Saunderson-To stifle competition. EmptyHere Opposition is not a party for competition; it is a party for regulation and anti-competition, and that is what its record shows. The Australian people should not be fooled by the rhetoric. What do we have here? After this Government's historic breaking of the two-airline policy, sweeping aside 35 years of regulation, we are moving in on international aviation. The Minister has outlined the history of international aviation in Australia. Basically, it is a system of bilateral, intergovernment agreements. Australia has 27 such bilateral international agreements and worldwide approximately 2,000 such agreements exist country to country. It is fair to say that much of what has driven government policy in the past has been to protect Qantas Airways Ltd, our international carrier. We have insisted that when an agreement is negotiated to allow an international airline access for the first time, or increased access, we have preserved' Qantas's rights and extended them through bilateral agreements in that country. Notwithstanding that we have international intergovernmental bilateral agreements, there has been increased competition, fuelled by a number of factors. The first is the megacarriers. For example, whereas Qantas has about 40 very large planes, the American megacarriers have about 500, which really puts our size into perspective. In addition, integrated marketing arrangements and computerised reservation systems are being developed. That is where our competition is coming from. There has also been a tremendous growth in tourism which has forced a change in our thinking. I will give some examples of the size and the impact of tourism on the Australian economy. The number of inbound tourists to Australia has been growing at about 26 per cent. The worldwide figure is 9 per cent, so one can see that Government policy, directed at trying to attract tourists to Australia, has been working significantly to the benefit of all Australians. Japanese tourism to Australia in 1988 increased by 64 per cent over the previous year. This is tremendous growth. It is estimated that tourists added 1.4 per cent to our gross domestic product in 1987-88 which translates into a contribution of about $4.8 billion. In job terms, it generates about 103,000 jobs. So tourism has been very important to the economy. It has been growing very rapidly. We have shifted very much away from the situation when Qantas was fighting to attract tourists here; Australia is now a very popular destination in its own right. In reviewing these arrangements the sole criterion of concern no longer needs to be their impact on Qantas. That does not mean that we are abandoning the national interests that Qantas represents; nor are we denigrating the tremendous contribution that Qantas makes to our export earnings through its bringing in of tourists. We are trying to get a broader and wider horizon for making some of the decisions. Following this review of international-aviation, decisions will be made that will include a wider range of views in determining our negotiating strategies, particularly tourism and trade views as well as those of Qantas. It demonstrates a readiness to encourage new services by foreign carriers where these will lead to improved tourism and trade opportunities for Australia generally. We want to promote growth and competition by developing arrangements with other countries, giving airlines greater commercial freedom to introduce new services and to respond more quickly to market demand. We will examine the benefits that could flow from a separate Australian international airline operating scheduled cargo services. We will highlight to foreign carriers the opportunity for servicing the full range of Australian gateways, not just those of Melbourne Tullamarine and Sydney Kingsford-Smith, whilst recognising that Sydney in particular will remain an attractive destination. This statement is very important. To illustrate some of the impact of this new framework in renegotiating air services agreements, let us look at what will happen in our growing markets in Thailand, Singapore and Japan. On the Australia-Thailand route five additional B747 services can now be brought on by the airlines at any time. On the Japan route up to an additional eight B747 services can be operated from October this year and through 1990. Similarly, on the Singapore route there is to be a provision for another eight B747 services to commence from October throughout next year. For my friends of St Raphal's, I want to introduce a little national prominence into this debate by indicating that from April 1991 a further two services a week to the Federal Republic of Germany will be permitted, thus allowing Qantas and Lufthansa German Airlines to offer a combined total of 14 flights a week between Australia and West Germany. It is important that we note the contribution that tourism is making, the jobs that it is generating and the dollars that it is bringing in. It is important that we have a flexible system that will facilitate even more tourists to enter. The shadow Minister for tourism talked in his contribution about Manchester airport. I guess it would be inappropriate for me not to say something about Badgerys Creek. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know from previous speeches of mine in this House that I remain an unrepentant champion of Badgerys Creek. I believe it is inevitable that Badgerys Creek will be built. To those who are concerned about the third runway I say that I have serious doubts about whether the third runway proposal will survive a decent environmental impact statement process. In any event, that will take at least 18 months. If one looks then at the construCtion time for the third runway and the addetl capacity that we now have matched with the increased growth in domestic and international services at Kingsford-Smith, I am sure the status quo will remain. There will in effect be no increased capacity. That is why it is important that the design work for a larger facility than just a general aviation facility should proceed at maximum speed at Badgerys Creek. Badgerys Creek will provide the much needed capacity so that passengers can determine where they want to land. There is a danger in developing methods, whether by charging or opening up new airports, to try to get tourists to seek destinations other than Sydney. It is very bad marketing practice not to allow customers to make the choice about where they want to land. In the short term we may be able to fiddle around and divert them somewhere else but, no matter where they want to land-whether it be Sydney, Cairns, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide or Darwin-we must have the capacity to meet the tourists' choices about where they want to land and what they want to see. I sum up by saying once again that we on this side of the House welcome the Minister's statement. In terms of micro-economic reform this Government has got the runs on the board and a commitment for further micro-economic reform in this area as in others. The rhetoric of the Opposition sounds very nice when we hear what it would like to do, what it might do and what it is thinking of doing. But the reality is that it had the opportunities over the last 30 years and its performance was zilch. As the honourable member for Aston ( Mr Saunderson) said, it dropped the ball. It had. the opportunity but it dropped the ball. Tragically, the impact was not just on its side; the Australian economy and the Australian people have suffered because of it. Had the Opposition taken action, we would have a stronger and even more dynamic economy than we have. We are committed to further reform in international aviation and we look forward to and welcome the opportunities that will come with the previously announced Government policy of deregulating the domestic airlines.",27
29,Mr MILLAR ,MAXIMISING THE BENEFITS,"Wide Bay) (11.45)-1 listened with customary interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Chifley ( Mr Price). Apart from his final blanket barrage about the g-neral competence of the Opposition, I am moved to say that I found him at his persuasive best today. He put forward some very telling points. The statement by the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) on maximising the benefits of international aviation is pertinent, topical and important. It relates to an activity, a commercial enterprise, an industry that can only be described as 'high risk'. One might think that I am referring to the hazards-real or imaginedin the physical act of flying. Happily, that is not really a consideration today. Aircraft reliability and safety have developed a degree of confidence and assurance among travelling passengers which were not necessarily the order of the day in my early years when DH84s-would you believe, twin engined, fabric covered bi-planes---'were the regular means of public transport. We have progressed from them through the DC3s to the Boeing 747s and other modern aircraft of today. Therefore, the risk does not relate to that aspect of aviation, international or domestic. The risk attaches to the very nature of an industry which is characterised by astronomical costs, the necessity to read the developing situation with substantial lead times and the need to order aircraft years ahead at considerable commercial risk if the assessments and judgments prove, in the fullness of time, not to be based on reality. Nobody knows these things. This statement addresses the considerable development in international air travel and the quite responsible calculations are predicated on the situation perceived and the situation imagined. Without wishing to introduce a pessimistic note, I point out that one would be irresponsible to dismiss the possibility that with the economic circumstances prevailing not only in this country but also throughout the world, particularly the Western world, these prognostications may fall lamentably short of what had been hoped for. We cannot really do anything about that. International ah:lines cannot reasonably shut down their operations on the basis that things may not work out as they had hoped. It is a case of boldness having to be their friend. They v-nture forth with their fingers crossed, no doubt. Thus far, they have done extraordinarily well. In this context, I turn to the question of Qantas Airways Ltd. This is an air.line of which we are very proud for historical reasons, quite apart from its effectiveness and efficiency which, in itself, would warrant admiration. Qantas has always been synonymous with success. Yet, years after the inception of that airline, why are we still beset with the lament that it is lacking capital? If success is synonymous with profitability, something has gone seriously wrong. In the main, Qantas has not been able to finance its own capital requirements. Is it perhaps the case that governments have been less than charitable in addressing Qantas operations? Have we, in short-sighted fashion, under the pressure of more immediate circumstances, elected to divert from Qantas the funds that are essential to its continuing capital development? Even today we find that Qantasas an airline, along with domestic carriers, is limited in its ability, to finance its operations. Hence the move from both sides of the· House-if not into to, at least in part-towards privatisation. The debate on that matter is far from concluded. It will be interesting to see how it comes out. But privatisation is not an absolute cure-all; after all, the overwhelming majority of bankruptcies and insolvencies take place in the private sector' of our economic infrastructure. That is not meant to be condemnation. I simply put forward a cautionary word that privatisation is not necessarily synonymous with prosperity. That certainly accommodates a philosophical view and I would say, without reservation, that on balance it is an environment to be preferred. Governments should not become too heavily involved in the conduct of busin-s. We have the problem of capital costs. We look to enhance Australia's own capabilities for international travel as well as to accord a reasonable entitlement to other nations on which we rely for reciprocal accommodation. In the simplest terms, we cannot expect to have access to all countries in the world while at the same time denying them access to our country. Some tightrope walking is required there. Thus far it has been done in reasonable accord but we remain perpetually at risk if we seek to preserve our own position with too great a vigour because this will provoke a response from other areas. As the honourable member for Chifley pointed out, unpalatable though it may be, in the totality of global aviation we are very small fry. That does Qot 'mean that we need not be vigilant in addressing these issues. The honourable member for Chifley touched on another problem obliquely when he referred to our international flight terminating points and the fact that Sydney was overloaded. He' mentioned the possibility of seeking to divert tourists to alternative ports in Australia. At first blush that seems to be a thoroughly logical and acceptable course of action except, as the honourable member for Chifley said, that we should not seek to tell intending visitors to Australia what is good for them, where they should go and what they should see. However, there is still room for some re-arrangement at least to take the stress off Sydney Airport and open up opportunities not previously perceived by tourists and travel operators. In fact, they may actually enjoy going to Cairns, Brisbane or Melbourne, but-and there is a big but we suffer the continuing problems of the demography and geography of this country. These elements are perpetually in conflictit is too big a country; there are too many community points on the eastern seaboard; and they are too few people to service the costs attended on those circumstances. If one flies into Brisbane, the capital of my home State, one finds a lamentable international airport terminal facility. It is not simply a question of getting an aircraft through air traffic space and onto the runway. That is the easy bit-for a skilled pilot. When people spill out in their hundreds into the terminal the problems begin. Perhaps aircraft arrival times have pinnacled and have cla,shed with departure times. The result is unbridled chaos in the terminal. Then there are the infrastructure costs, which can be very substantial. This has proved to be the case. Then there is the question of financing. Who is to provide capital funding for all the infrastructure necessary to service international flight operations? That will remain a continuing problem. There is another point I wish to mention which rather saddens me. At first blush it may seem far removed from international travel but actually it is vital to both international and domestic travel. As a child of very tender years I can remember being impressed by the pinnacle of Australian and global aviation achievements by Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith, Jimmy Melrose, Broadbent, Amelia Earhart-Putnam and Bert Hinkler, who came from what was the electorate of Wide Bay at one time but has since suffered from redistribution. In those days Australia was not only achieving greatness in aviation but also there was generated a great pride in and an affinity and empathy with flying. We remained for a considerable time at the forefront of aviation exploration and achievement. What do we find today? We do not have enough pilots in the country. Sure, the established airlines are subject to competition from other airlines internationally which induce our pilots, within the parameters of propriety, to leave and chase more money and there is a limit to our capacity to match them in money terms. But, in simple market circumstances, it stands to reason that if we had a pool of aviation oriented young Australians, male and female, the prospects of meeting that shortfall, not only for Qantas and our domestic airlines but also for the Royal Australian Air Force, would be much enhanced. In brief, I am saying-and I am reverting now to the general aviation area-that we should be encouraging, not only as a government and a parliament but as a society, the young to turn their thoughts to aviation, to facilitate the fulfilment of their interests and their ambition to learn to fiy. The cost today of learning to fiy is utterly prohibitive. It is a deterrent to many young Australians who would like to learn to fiy. I will not go to the extent of suggesting that we give subsidies to people to learn to fiy. I am talking about what we used to describe as air navigation charges-now the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). charges-and so on. They should be factored to recognise that it is not just a cashbook arrangement, that there are intangibles and imponderables from which the country might conceivably profit. I think we should pursue that. We get bogged down with the accountancy mentality. I will give a prime example. Last year I was fiying with a commuter airline· from Brisbane to Longreach. Its air navigation charges had previously been $800,000 a year. That is a lot of money for a small time service, with all due respect to the operator; but it was viable, using the term in its loosest context. The adjustment to charges as a consequence of the establishment of the Civil Aviation Authority was going to take the annual charges to $1.3m. There could be only one result from that situation. Longreach was not going to have an airline. Passengers just could not meet the charges necessary to maintain the viability of that particular service. So what have we got? The· CAA, instead of getting $800,000, will get nothing because there is no service. That demonstrates the monumental folly of making short term decisions. It seems to meet the immediate requirement of proving without doubt that one is· running a commercially viable operation, that one has certain capital assets and one must achieve, say, a notional 10 per cent return. Therefore, it works back and says, 'We have to adjust all these charges to achieve that outcome'. In actual fact what it is doing, metaphorically speaking, is going round shooting its customers and it is going to put itself out of business. We should be thinking about that. I began by talking about international aviation. We immediately associate that activity with the leviathans of the air-the 747s with possibly larger aircraft still to come-and the sky being full of thousands of aircraft. I digress by saying that it proved a little disconcerting when I was on the flight deck of a 747 on the way to London to find with astonishing frequency the lights of approaching aircraft on the same reciprocal track but, one hoped, a vertical separation of a couple of thousand feet and an approach speed of a closing rate of 1,600 or 1,700 kilometres an hour. One could do nothing but pray desperately that the system was working-and it did work.· That is encouraging. In saying that it works, one raises for .discussion the question of the price of safety and the extent to which we can factor all of our operations, as seen in sequCfncing and separation at Sydney Airport-worshipping safety when in actual fact one is rendering inoperative the service that should be available to the public. I trust that I have not bored the House with those random comments, but I see them as pertinent to the paper that is before the House.",30
30,Mr SAUNDERSON ,MAXIMISING THE BENEFITS,"Aston) (12.00)-I rise to support the statement made by the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) yesterday. I would like to comment on some of the points that have been raised by Opposition spokespeople on this issue. Like the honourable member for EmptyHere surprises me is the way in which Opposition members tend to criticise the Government, speaking of a lack of action, an inability to control prices and a failure to support the tourism boom as well as raising privatisation and capital injections into airlines. In addressing these issues, I will start with the ones just mentioned by the honourable member for Wide Bay ( Mr Millar). Firstly, I think it is important in talking about the operations of airlines and their efficient way. economic performance to look at what has happened over the last 40 years or so, which, as we have to keep reminding the public, the Opposition was in government for 30 years or more. The Opposition claims now to have always supported private enterbeen prise, free competition, efficiency in governwe ment and so on. All this rhetoric is constantly thrown at us and at the community. In 1983, when we came to office, we gave Qantas Airways Ltd a capital injection of $60m. That was equal to two-thirds of the capital put into Qantas by that time. In other words, for 37 years it had operated on a capital injection of in the order of $ lOOm. It had never been given anything during the years of the coalition Government to help it in forming its capital base. Australian was in a similar position. When we came to office in 1983 its debt-equity ratio was in order of 90: lO. It had been forced to rely; debt; therefore, its profit capacity had been substantially reduced during those years. Looking at Qantas's performance in relation to profit, the company has earned from all sources since its creation $564m in total profit. Of that, $485m has been earned since 1983. In other words, 86 per cent of the profit that Qantas has earned in its lifetime of operation has been earned during the six years of this Government. I think that highdirectly lights the question of who has been supportto ing the airline industry, who has been supporting tourism and who has been supistry porting efficiency in government. I turn to the services available at airports. I believe the creation of the Federal Corporation will result in dynamic reform of the services available and a renewing of infrastructure in a more efficient and proper way. Already the· Federal Airports Corporaments tion has moved to improve services at both Sydney and Melbourne airports. It has em1983 barked on a program of renovation which will ensure that all passengers, both internabeen tional and domestic, will receive better servnegotiating ices at the airport, and it will be done in a more cost efficient way. I think that highoperate lights the fact that in the short period we have been in office we have been able to achieve efficiency and allow for capital funds to be put into the airline industry in an Two major criticisms were made by the of Opposition's spokesman on aviation, the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull). Firstly, he said that we have done nothing to reduce air fares in Australia since we have in office. If we look at air fare pricing find that over the last four years there has been a decline in real terms in air fares in Australia. The consumer price index has increased by in the order of 36 per cent, whereas air fares, on average, have increased by in the order of 25 per cent. We have had a decline in real terms in air fares in Australia. That has been achieved by our commitment to providing more efficient services as well as an increase in competition to ensure that the best is achieved for the travAirlines elling public. The other important criticism is that our the operations in the airline industry have done on nothing to support tourism in Australia. In terms of support for tourism in Australia, when we look back in history the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown) will be given credit as having been perhaps in the most dynamic Minister for tourism that Australia has seen. There has been a rapid improvement in the number of tourists coming to Austnilia, and that is the key to a viable tourist industry. That increase has been credited, and I think quite rightly, the dynamic concepts that the honourable member for Parramatta brought to the minfor which he was responsible. There· have been dramatic increases in the number of peopl- coming to Australia, and the Government . has been active in ensuring that Airports airline services have increased. To put the lie to the criticisms of the the Opposition about our having done nothing, it is worth going over some of the improvein services that have occurred in the six years we have been in office. Since March an additional 4.9 million international airline seats into and out of Australia have made available as a result of bilateral processes. That is a 71 per cent increase. Thirty-five international airlines now scheduled services to Australia, and 14 of those airlines commenced their services during the period of this· Government; that is, one-third of those services have come into being since we have been in office. Whilst there has been a strong growth in air travel to Australia from all regions in recent years, the greatest capacity increases have occurred in three of our biggest markets-New Zealand, the United States and Japan. On the trans-Tasman route, for instance, Qantas Airways Ltd and Air New Zealand have increased their capacity from 50 flights a week to 97 flights-a 36 per cent increase. The boem in US tourists coming to Australia has resulted in an increase on· the USAustralia route from 27 flights to 60, and total seat capacity has grown by 112 per cent during that period. The most outstanding example of capacity growth has been on the Australia-Japan route. Between 1981 and 1985 there was a capacity for three 747 flights a week but now there are 30 passenger flights a week with services landing, in addition to the major ports, at Perth and Cairns, and we expect that some time during the next year flights will also land at Adelaide. That has resulted in a 422 per cent increase since 1985 in the number of seats available. That shows that the Government has been supporting the tourism industry within the capacity available to this point. Many of the growing demands could not have been met under any system of regulation or control, or in fact under a system of absolutely no control and no regulation at all. Demands have grown so rapidly and to some extent so. unpredictably that it would have been impossible for anyone to provide the substantial capacity increases that would have been required to meet every demand, both in and out. I come back. to our historical reasons for having some form of control over international flights. Early in the piece it was clearly in Australia's interests to have control over the number of flights coming into and leaving Australia particularly as, quite rightly, Australia wanted to have a niche in the international air market. In the early days there were more Australians going out of Australia to see the rest of the world than there were people wanting to come here, and unlimited access to international flights would simply have ensured that we had no international service of any note ourselves. Even though in modern days Qantas is a small airline compared to the megacarriers, it does have international standing and is recognised internationally as one of the finer airline services. It was quite right for us to regulate and control the access of other carriers to the Australian market, given that the market was primarily an Australian one. But things have changed dramatically, given that we now have more overseas tourists coming to Australia than we have Australians going out of the country to see the rest of the world. That is an important change because we must now increase our capacity if we are to maximise the benefits available to Australia through international tourism. As the honourable member for EmptyHere tourism in Australia accounts for in the order of 1.4 per cent of our gross domestic product. In ·other words, it generates some $4.8 billion in the Australian economy. It also results directly in some 103,000 people being employed to service the industry. It is important for our overseas earnings to foster an internation.al tourism industry. At the same time, of course, in any of our decisions in this area we must also take into account Qantas's interests, because Qantas itself generates important revenue for us by \\lay of its overseas earnings. In 1987-88 those earnings amounted to in the order of $1.9 billion. Of course, Qantas is the major promoter of Australia as a destination. It carries out an important role in simply attracting tourists to Australia. So, whilst other' airlines may well hop on the band wagon and take the benefits of increased tourism to Australia, it is Qantas which is doing the hard work of promoting Australia and encouraging people to come here. Once we have an influx of people greater than Qantas can handle it is important that we ensure that all of ,those who wish to come can come; therefore, it is important for the Government to look now ,at not making international agreements purely and solely on the basis of bilateral arrangements. As, the honourable member for Chifley pointed out, clearly when we are talking about megacarriers which have hundreds and hundreds of planes in their fleets, it is impossible, because Qantas has only about 50 planes, for us to insist on a flight for flight arrangement. That would simply mean that we would limit the number of seats available in many areas. That in itself would result in an inflated price for seats because people would want to come and therefore would pay more than they should have to. So it is important to recognise that tourism is an important part of our economy, not just for jobs in Australia but for our balance of trade and foreign earnings. We must ensure that we negotiate landing rights to accommodate the growth in tourism as it occurs. These changes indicate a balanced view which does not simply put in place a laissez faire approach but recognises that there are important factors other than simply looking after our own international carrier. We must ensure that the tourist boom is promoted and is not cut short simply because tourists are unable to come to Australia. I fully support the Government's action. It is another step in our continuing move to take the airline industry into the twenty-first century. That will be a large step, given that the Opposition did nothing during its period, in office to ensure efficiency in the industry itself.",32
31,Mr SNOW ,MAXIMISING THE BENEFITS,"Eden-Monaro) (12.15)-An important part of the ,statement made by the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) was the acknowledgment of a surge in inbound tourism in 1988. This meant that the provision of extra passenger seats was extremely important. I must compliment the honourable members for Aston ( Mr EmptyHere Bay ( Mr Millar) on the contribution they made to this debate. I do not particularly want to add to it. I want to emphasise that Qantas Airways Ltd and other international airlines have played an extremely important part' in increasing tourism within Australia. We cannot always be expected to meet the peaks. That did not always happen, particularly in the bicentennial year and with the Expo 88 celebrations when we naturally expected a surge in tourism. We certainly got it. We did not meet those peak demands. There was 'a huge growth in demand and we met it to some considerable extent. When those important celebrations were on last year, we saw a strengthening of links between local governments, State governments, the Federal Government, industry and other community groups. In my own region of south-eastern New South Wales we saw an important strengthening of local tourist groups. The visitors centre in the CoomaMonaro shire has made a contribution over many years due to the far-sighted recognition of local people. When the Snowy Mountains Authority was being reduced in size and activity the local groups managed to set up a visitors centre. They were pioneers in bringing people to their local area. They were an example to other tourist groups throughout Australia. In recent years, we have seen a strengthening of tourism in coastal areas including the city of Shoalhaven, the Eurobodalla Shire and the Bega Valley Shire. In ,these areas, people have been able to get much better access to local tourist activities and to go to tourist centres in local areas. Whether it be Bega, Merimbula, Narooma or Ulladulla they have been able to go to local groups, service stations and other contact points to find out what is happening and what is available within the region. The State Government has linked with those important initiatives that have been taken by local government and local groups through its tourist authority. Through its massive advertising campaigns overseas, the Federal Government has been instrumental in bringing people from other countries to take advantage of those services. Qantas, with its excellent record; has played a major role in bringing tourists to Australia. Other international airlines have also made an excellent contribution. There are industries other than airlines, such as travel agencies in local areas, which have been able to contribute towards the setting up of a great network which has brought more tourists to our country through the airlin,es system. We have even seen local farmers taking advantage of it. I think of the rotolactor in the Bega area, where people from all countries of the world are able to drop into see the latest in computerised dairying and to take advantage of some of the opportunities that are available by observing how farms in Australia operate and how they use new technology. Our own Snowy Canberra Tourist Association has helped to' bring a large number of people from overseas to our local areas. We have seen local voluntary and employed workers in our visitors information centres assisting people to find out just what is best to see. The international airlines have contributed substantially to an increase in tourist numbers. These numbers were up 26 per cent between 1987 and 1988 compared with the world growth of 9 per cent. Naturally, we cannot expect that sort of increase to keep going. We will not get it but we can build on it. There are two things we need to do. Firstly, we need to improve our standards in Australia so that we can continue to encourage people flying here. It is already happening. We are finding now that we have busloads of overseas tourists travelling the Princes Highway and visiting the Snowy Mountains, not just every month as they were doing or even every week, but every day. We need to improve those standards so that the people who fly here will go back with a positive message about our record. Secondly, our accommodation and restaurants need to improve. They have shown that they are willing to take the initiative to meet that challenge. In the Snowy Mountains, we saw industry groups getting together and helping to set up, through the local Commonwealth Employment Service in Cooma, - raining schemes which meant that we were able to use local people in providing services in the hospitality industry, whether it be in accommodation or restaurants. As I have travelled around presenting certificates to those people, it is interesting to see how they have seen the importance of linking up with the overseas tourists who are coming in with the airlines. They are providing a service which satisfies those people. Just from attending very often the final day of the schemes and presenting certificates tq people who have graduated, it has been interesting to see how they have learnt some of the techniques which are absolutely essential to providing services, whether in motels, restaurants or hotels. These are services at all levels of charging. We have seen a much higher interest by people in providing that service, people who originally may have taken on a job in a motel and seen it as just a job to make money. They now take pride in their work and very often see it as a step to higher things. It may simply be a job which satisfies them more because they have been taught how to do it properly and because their employer has been prepared to give some time to them and allow them to go away and do some training, whether it is at a technical and further education college or with an organisation such as the Retail Traders Association or the ACT Regional Tourism Industry Training Committee Inc. These have been important links. We also need to increase our net earnings from that inbound tourism. To do that we need to have better and more efficient air services. This is extremely important. We need to maintain safety as well. Those who saw the movie Rain Man-which was a winner of many Academy Awards-would have notiCed how Raymond, the autistic person in the movie, refused to fly on local airlines with his brother in the United States. This was a United States film. He managed to get out of it by listing the accident rates of all the airlines. They went through the whole lot in the United States. He just would not fly on any of them. His brother was desperate to get him into the air. He said, 'Look, you just won't find an airline that has not had an accident of some sort.' His brother said, 'There is one airline'. His brother asked him what it was. He said, 'Qantas'. So there we have an Australian airline accurately represented in an overseas movie as an airline which has a very proud record in safety. I compliment the Government in its moves towards deregulation on being determined not to sacrifice safety. That is extremely important in all our areas of transport when we are bringing tourists to Australia. In the House today is the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown). I received a letter from him the other day, which I am pleased to send on to a constituent, setting out how much the Government is concerned about maintaining safety at the same time as it is moving towards more efficient and cheaper travel. It is absolutely vital that we do that. If our primary aim is to increase tourism, then we have to get away from the emphasis just on business for the Australian airline. We need to get people here on any airline at all, and it is extremely important that we do that. We have two tasks: Firstly, we need to maximise the number of tourists even if it does mean encouraging new air services to come to Australia, even if it does mean that Qantas does not get the same proportion of passengers it has always received. Secondly, we need to seek more work, and we can do that by seeking more rights for Qantas, as Australia's airline, so that it can serve a wider range of destinations and build a more sophisticated network of services. The Government has shown that it can take a hardheaded approach in a wide range of areas, and this approach has paid off. We have seen a solid decrease in social security spendprevail. ing simply because the Government has taken this hard-headed approach. We have also seen a drop in the amount of fraud, evasion and unfairness in the taxation system because of that hard-headed approach. But there are few areas in which we have taken that approach more than in the area of transport and communications. My own involvement in policy formation in the past two years has resulted in some excellent reports and then action taken in broadcasting, television, shipping and waterfront issues as well as in telecommunications and aviation issues. So the Government, in this statement, has taken another important step in recognising the contribution of another area of government and industry activity-international aviation. We need to maximise the benefits, I compliment the Minister for Transport and Communications on his statement and I am pleased to join with other rnembers in' the House, who have preceded me, in endorsing the statement.

In asking those questions of the Leader of the House, I point out that members of the Opposition, along with' members of the Government, returned for what was expected to be one ordinary sitting day. Yesterday we had an opportunity to ask questions and discuss a matter of public importance. Of course, today's sitting was not anticipated, but we are here. Likewise, we have come prepared to ask questions. This is the democratic Parliament of Australia. Yesterday we discussed a matter concerning China, where democracy does not I would have thought that, at the very least, the Government would have made available for Question Time the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) or, in his absence, the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Lionel Bowen) and other Ministers. I think at the moment there are only three Ministers in the. chamber. Perhaps the Leader of the House would reconsider what he has just said and accept questions from the Opposition and also members of the Government for the next 50 minutes.",37

45,Madam SPEAKER,BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE,"Order! The honourable member for North Sydney has a stuck needle. He will cease interjecting. Mr BEAZLEY.,-I will take the questions of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the honourable member for Hume ( Mr Fife), seriatim. Basically, he started off by asking me exactly what the business of the House was likely to contain for the rest of the day. I will answer that question first and I will then have a chat about his problem with Question Time. On the question of the business before the House, there are a number of matters before the Senate which, if amended in any way, would require consideration by this House. If the amendments not agreed to by this House are not accepted by the Senate, we would be obliged to reconsider them. As far as I am aware, only one Bill in that category is being considered at the moment by the Senate. In all likelihood, that Bill will be amended. As I understand it, there is a possibility that we will be accepting some of those amendments and I hope that that Bill will be reported in this House within the next hour. Mr Shack-Which Bill?",37
46,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE,"The Resource Assessment Commission Bill 1989. When that is done, we would be required to remain until such time as we are convinced that several other items of legislation-one item of taxation legislation and one item of health legislation-have been accepted by the Senate. We will have to wait and see whether the Senate will pass the health legislation in the form it was passed in this House this morning; we will have to see whether it is generally accepted by the Senate in the way in which it was passed by us some time ago. I understand that both those things are likely to happen but, until they happen, we have to remain in the vicinity of this building. Mr Tim Fischer-You don't know what you are doing.",38
47,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE,"I have an excellent idea of what we are doing at the moment and I am going through the program for honourable members. Another matter which we have to consider also requires us to wait around. I have had to indicate to a number of honourable members in the course of the day that there is a motion in my name on the Notice Paper giving all members leave of absence. Should that motion not be carried, two things will happen: firstly, nobody will get paid; and, secondly, within two months honourable members' seats will be vacant. EmptyHere that. Let's have an election.",38
48,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE,"After two months without pay honourable members opposite would not be able to pay for the election. The fact is that we need to wait around to pass that too. However, as usual, we are 100 per cent in the hands of the Senate. The Senate has got used to considering at a leisurely pace material that is handed to it. That is its wont. But it is no good Opposition members coming in here complaining about that. The reason the Senate bats on at such a leisurely pace is that the Opposition chooses that it should. As far as its members in the Senate are concerned, they are less worried than we are about what is happening here. On the matter of Question Time, this House was not called back to deal with normal business-unlike the last time we were called back in these circumstances, we ran a normal business day yesterday. It was called back specifically to consider the ways in which the Senate chooses to deal with our legislation. I have said before in this placeand this is something for honourable members to bear in mind-that it will invariably be the case that we will break several weeks before the Senate does. There is one simple reason for this: no business conducted by this House after a particular date will be considered by the Senate in the course of a session. Honourable members on both sides of the House ought to bear in mind that we are given a cut-off date for relevant consideration of business by the Senate. From that point on, essentially we sit in this place for no good purpose. The Senate said to us that the cut-off date was 26 May and, from that date, no further legislation that we passed in this place would be considered by the Senate in this session. That is a real problem in the management of government business; it has been a real problem for some time. So we are forced into a situation where we will be continually hauled back-it is possible to foresee that this will happen in the future-to consider matters which the Senate has dealt with at its leisure and often in a form which is rather like legislative pong. It does not help much. The fact is we conclude by a particular date. It does matter how well we have programmed our business-the Senate will not consider Bills dealt with after that date. The way in which it chooses to debate legislation almost invarreality iably means that the Senate proceeds at much slower pace than we do. So it is not question of planning the Bills better. processes that apply in the Senate are differcelebrated ent from those that apply here. Yesterday we had Question Time and we debated a matter of public importance. We broke a precedent that we had established previously where we had neither. As far we are concerned, today is a day on which we will deal, as far as possible, basically material that is passed back to us from the Government is deplorable. ' Senate. We will need to be here until such time as the Senate has concluded all its items of business which will have a major on Government policy. We therefore need a period of peace and quiet in which we can reflect on this essential injustice that has been handed down to us by the Senate. Those honourable members who would have asked questions today can hold those questions until the Parliament reconvenes in August; they can go into form of retreat in which they can contemthe plate the Standing Orders and the behaviour of their Senate colleagues; and they will come back in August refreshed and able to offer suggestions as to how we can persuade the another matter.

60,Mr LAMB ,HIGHER EDUCATION,Stteeton) (2.15)-1 take the opportunity to make some comments on the speech-Dr Charlesworth-For an hour and a half.,40
61,Mr LAMB,HIGHER EDUCATION,"The clock indicates only 15 minutes. I take the opportunity to comment on the statement made by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins) and the various reports that were tabled with that speech. As the Minister pointed out, there will be massive changes in the higher education area. Higher education will be reorganised and refinanced and, as a result, very much revitalised. I do not think there is one institution that is not touched by the amalgamations between the universities and the colleges of advanced education anywhere in Australia. The form of these amalgamations, some of which are virtually in place and some of which are being further debated and discussed-I. point out in very much a voluntary way-is very different from what we saw under the Fraser Government in the beginning of this decade, when a gun was pointed at the heads of the institutions. They were forced to amalgamate purely in order to save funds and Government outlays, without thought to the educational consequences of those amalgamations. Quite rightly, those amalgamations were roundly criticised in the report of the task force on the amalgamations in higher education which was produced in April this year. Here we see proposals which have been thoroughly canvassed and debated. We have left it to the. institutions themselves to choose their partners, in consultation with the Commonwealth Government and State governments. The number of institutions will drop from 72 to about half that number, about 35. There will be a new kind of university which retains the unique characteristics of each of the partners in the binary system. I said 'partners', but there has been a very great sense of opposition between the two sectors. Here we will see an amalgam of the best of the universities, keeping the university traditions, with the unique contribution of the characteristics of the colleges of advanced education. It was not before time that the binary system;-the division between colleges of advanced education and universities-brought itself down under its own weight. It divided higher education into two levels. Many employers chose graduates from, and many students entered into,. institutions based on various values, not always on an educational basis, but on the basis of a portrayal of what the universities stood for-a Irlore elitist education-and perhaps the portrayal of the colleges of advanced education as being more vocationally oriented. After some time we saw how unstable that binary division was. There was a blurring. of the distinction between vocational education and non-vocational education. There was a blurring of the distinction between research in universities and supposedly non-research, of a pure kind, in colleges of advanced education. We saw that colleges had to set up their own privately funded research centres to· carry out pure and applied research. What the Minister has announced has quite rightly sounded, once and for all, the death knell of that artificial division between the two major sectors of higher education-the colleges of advanced education and the universities-and introduced, for the first time, a unified national system. This should be welcomed, not by those who see their own careers as foremost in education but by those who value higher education for its educational contribution to this country. I guess the benefit should be quickly spelt out. With the unified system we will have less duplication, less overlap and a greater spread of opportunities for students within one institution to get credit transfers for a course in one area and be able to carry it forward to another. We will see students from all the capital cities, irrespective of whether they live in the west or the east, having greater access to a range of courses with a range of educational objectives. Of course, with the greater funding that the Minister has announced, there is a far more positive environment for education planning. There is greater incentive for both academic staff and the often overlooked supportive general staff. A greater predictability goes with the assurance of triennial funding and with the end of the binary system. As I have said, there will be greater flexibility for students and staff, who will be able to work closer together to provide a more holistic education. What is most important in the changes in the binary system is the greater access to higher education that is forthcoming. An important strand to the Government's social justice policies is that we have greater access for both sexes to all levels of higher education to which an individual aspires and who as a consequence will better serve this country. We will no longer have people destined for a second class education and others, because of having been born into a wealthy socio-economic grouping, picking the eyes out of the better courses in the so-called premier division. On the matter of equity, I point out that the Minister has said that $9m will be given to provide child-care places in higher education institutions. Some 430 places will give opportunities to women, both those who interrupted their education during their childbearing years and those who will re-enter education as mature age students having been denied for one or more reasons the opportunity to achieve the qualifications that come with completed secondary education. Of those places, 114 will be in Victoria. I will quickly mention the geographic spread,. which increases the amount of access. There will be nine places at Bendigo, 20 at Deakin University at Waurn Ponds, near Geelong, 25 places at Footscray, 20 at Warrnambool, 30 at the Western Institute, associated particularly with a pilot project in science for women, and 10 places at Wodonga Institute of Technical Educatibn. There will be a greater choice for students, especially women. Of course, amalgamation also brings an associated range of new processes. The Minister has mentioned greater accountability to the public for the content and presentation of study courses. I point out that, when State governments put together their legislation to establish the new institutions, they will have a wonderful opportunity to change the composition of the boards or councils that govern these higher education institutions. For too long the contribution, value and expertise of women has been ignored in our society. For far too long men have been stacked into the membership of these boards or councils, usually recruited or attracted through the old boy network. I would like to see affirmative action take place in the composition of these boards and councils of these larger and more responsible higher education institutions-perhaps no more than 25 per cent and no less than 25 per cent men or women. In other words, we would have a fair spread of gender. I note that in the electorate of Deakiri, which is serviced by the Box Hill college of technical and further education, for the last two years there has been a female president of that very large college. I think it is the largest technical and further education college, other than Sydney, in Australia. I congratulate Box Hill college on its foresight. When we get to vice-chancellors, perhaps there is-MONICA",40
62,Mr GEAR ,HIGHER EDUCATION,We have a female one in Western Australia.,42
63,Mr LAMB,HIGHER EDUCATION,"lam glad to hear the honourable member remind me that there is a new female appointee in Western Australia to join Di Yerbury; they will be the only female vice-chancellors. I would like to see more recognition given to female· academics and administrators. Of course, we will not achieve amalgamation without problems. Of course they will be short-term problems if they have been addressed properly at the planning stage and are backed with adequate finance. The Minister has pointed out that $3m will be provided for refurbishment associated with amalgamation and for amalgamation planning problems. In staff balancing, there will be $9m for voluntary retirements and so on. I want to point out a particular problem that has emerged with the amalgamations in Victoria. I refer to Victoria College. On page 66 of the report of the task force on amalgamations in higher education, there is a recommendation that a substantial portion of the load in teacher education be transferred to the proposed new university in west Melbourne. I question that because while I thoroughly support the increased access to tertiary places, including teacher education, for people in the western suburbs, we should not reduce access to tertiary places for people from the eastern and south-eastern suburbs. I see no equity in increasing places for people from the western suburbs at the expense of those in the eastern suburbs. We need to provide a far better balance if we are to continue the Minister's objective of a fair spread of opportunity. The present patterns of employment of primary teachers and the predictions of growth in primary school enrolments suggests the need for more places in pre-service primary teacher education programs in Victoria, not just a transfer from the Toorak campus of Victoria College to the proposed Western Institute. The figures that I have had from the Minister responsible for education in Victoria show that there will be a steady growth in primary school enrolments from now until the year 2000, so we will continue to need additional primary school teachers. If we base it on a teacher-pupil ratio of one to 20, the demand for additional teachers for primary schools will be almost 200 in 1991, the last year of the triennium we are discussing, dropping slightly from 178 to 118 in 1993. These figures take no account of retirements. In the light of the difficulty of accurately predicting teacher supply and demand-it is extremely difficult, as we have seen in trying to predict the supply and demand of engineers in the past, with the consequential bottlenecks and oversupplythere is a case for a modest increase in numbers for pre-service education for primary teachers rather than simply a transfer of numbers from one institution to another. We should also point out that this is the only reduction in numbers proposed by the task force for Victoria. It relates to a faculty that has already suffered great trauma through significant cuts imposed in the 198182 amalgamations under the Fraser Government. That is because it has misunderstood the teaching faculty in Victoria College. The College has pointed out to the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission that the Toorak campus is not just a separate entity. It should be borne in mind that the school of primary teacher education is a single organisation unit with cross-campus departments. Many staff at the school teach at both Burwood and Toorak campuses. Many of the teachers throughout the· eastern suburbs have not completed four years of their bachelor of education and would be able to do further units at the Lilydale campus which is on the border of the electorate of Streeton. We should see Toorak and Victoria College in a far different light-not simply as a transfer of student places in teacher education from one to another. It would be a mistake to do that. There will certainly be continued demand for the College's postinitial programs. The alternative-I would like the Minister to give due consideration to this-is that numbers in primary teacher education for Victoria College should be held constant and new places created for the proposed university in west Melbourne. That is a minor change. It may mean a bit of juggling of funds, but it will mean continued access to teacher education places for those in the east without its being to the detriment of those in the west. 1 congratulate the Minister on the moves that he has made in the area of higher education. These moves have not come from on high, but have resulted from encouragement. They have come from the institutions themselves. With an extensive capital and recurrent funding program, I believe that the amalgamations will proceed successfully, to the advantage of higher education, without the trauma and mistakes that resulted from the amalgamations which occurred under the Fraser Government-MONICA",42

I wish to make a few general comments about higher education, in particular the unique type of university referred to by the honourable member for Streeton ( Mr Lamb). I wish to highlight briefly some of the failings of the concepts of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins) and mention some of the specific criticisms of the Minister's approach, including reference to a newspaper editorial in this morning's press. Finally, I wish to say a few words about sponsorship arrangements in Queensland for existing colleges of advanced education, in particular the Darling Downs Institute in my electorate. Mr Lamb-A good institution.",43
66,Mr TAYLOR,HIGHER EDUCATION,"It is a very good institution. A more effective higher education system is central to efforts to innovate industry, to raise work force abilities and to guarantee rising living standards in the future. Higher education must provide an environment of expanding opportunity to satisfy the demands of young people and others seeking to enhance their careers and broaden their knowledge. The great challenge is to expand .the capacity and improve the quality. For the higher education system to meet these expectations it must enjoy the confidence of its students, the academic staff and the community as a whole. It must also have assured sources of funds for expansion where appropriate and for continuing improvements in quality. Each institution should have sufficient freedom to determine its own direction and goals, subject to reasonable systems of public accountability for the use of taxpayers'money. It is clear that the capacity of institutions to respond flexibly to change in the external environment and to upgrade their standards of academic and administrative performance has been reduced by inappropriate internal structures and excessive governmental regulation. The Government's solution lies prinProfessor cipally in what some have referred to as iron fist in the velvet glove approach of Minister for Employment, Education and Training, wherein public tertiary institutions have been invited-and I use that word very cautiously-to join a new unified system which will largely remove the distinction becontinued: tween colleges and universities and wherein There all public institutions were invited to submit educational profiles setting out their broad objectives plus a whole range of details on mation student loads and intakes, teaching duties institutions. and a willingness to achieve national prioriHe ties, including equity. It seems to me that the Minister's proposto as have placed greater weight of central government regulation on the system. Under the unified national system the Government will require institutions to negotiate for directly with the Department of Education, Employment and Training and, in effect, inmistake. He said: stitutions will compete with each other for favours from the Government. I feel that the control effect of the forcing of amalgamation tween institutions without adequate regard to the economic or educational benefits that amalgamation is very clear. The ernment has also moved to take more direct control over research and higher education by earmarking an increasing proportion of research funds for projects decided by govdesire ernment in the national interest. Finally, the Government is attempting to introduce a very unsatisfactory higher education contriwith bution scheme, the so-called graduate tax, which fails to take adequate account of matters such as part time students in employinent, the scheme's failure to return tax collected to higher education institutions and the probability of confusion and/or abuse the system. I wish to move to some specific criticisms that by the Vice-Chancellor of the Melbourne, Professor David Penington, who said: The Federal Government's higher education reforms are misguided and even dangerous. He continued: Mr Dawkins's claims of deregulating the higher education system are a farce and, in fact, regulation has taken a quantum leap since he has taken over the ministry. The reforms are those of hyper-regulation. Penington goes on to talk about an the enormous increase in the demand for inforthe mation being made by the Department of Education, Employment and Training, which included exhaustive research and education profiles, supplemented by repeated requests for the same information in other forms. He has been no reduction in the demand for data on every detail of our financial administration and expenditure, and an increase in demand for inforconcerning every single student entering our went on to say that what was needed was deregulation and institutions committed meet measurable objectives in education, research training and research, with funding provided for the purpose. Professor Penington was very concerned about the present funds 'amalgamation frenzy' between institutions around the country which he described as a The concept that 'bigger is better', that centralised improves management and that the output of the system would be enhanced by wholesale amalbegamations is nonsense. of He went on to talk about changes being Govdriven by an appeal on the part of many colleges to the common human motives of the desire to gain greater status and esteem by becoming part of a university and by the of institutions and their leaders to become bigger in the belief that physical size and/or the size of one's budget were equated importance or the conference of power. In Professor Penington's view all .this was 'very negative and very dangerous'. Finally, . he questioned the Government's research policies, arguing that they involved 1930s socialist beliefs that excellence should not be of backed because it was elitist. He said: The Dawkins philosophy is one of the old world, Fabian type, rooted in 1930s socialism and the belief central political control should deliver what is University of needed by the people. I turn now to an editorial that appeared in the Australian this morning headed 'Dawkins talks through his mortarboard'. Some people may suggest that he talks from a point a little further down in his anatomy. The editorial says: It is characteristic that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, should use a university graduation ceremony to sneer at his critics . . . In treating Sydney University graduands to a gratuitous attack on The Australian's Higher Education section as well as boasting about extra money and graduates pouring into education, Mr Dawkins unwittingly illustrates just what ails Australian higher education. The beSetting sins of Australia's universities and colleges of advanced education are bad tempered intolerance in the 'soft' sciences and a utilitarian focus on employment in the 'hard' sciences. Mr Dawkins . . . is a product rather than a cause of these problems. Nevertheless, the policies he is pursuing are bound to make them worse. Mr Dawkins wants to boost annual graduate output by more than 50 per cent within 15 years. Yet over this three-year period real funding per university student has fallen 8 per cent. In the absence of better teachers and the maintenance of high entry standards, more graduates mean worse graduates. This hardly helps Mr Dawkins' oft-stated aim that higher education must improve Australia's human capital and boost national income. The editorial goes on to say: Criticism, indeed, is the lifeblood of academic course. Education can only take place in the context of a vigorous exchange of ideas. Mr Dawkins complains that The Australian has published views contrary to his own yet he has never agreed to an interview with the Higher Education section. Mr Dawkins' real problem is his inability to grasp that university education is about thinking more than training and about culture more than future employment . . . The Minister and the vice-chancellors are unable to discuss higher education except in terms of economic benefit or bureaucratic empirebuilding. There must be more to a university education than finding a good job-although this is an important aim. There must be more to university teaching than securing one's quota of 'equivalent full-time students' and 'refereed papers per equivalent full-time member of staff'. I turn to what the Queensland Minister for Education, Mr Littleproud, said recently in Brisbane. He said: Since the Commonwealth system did away with the differentiation between universities and CAEs, the State looked at applications for university status from BCAE and Darling Downs and Capricornia institutes of advanced education and had proposed to grant university stat-s from 1993. This had caused the Commonwealth to threaten to suspend $36 million worth of recurrent funds intended for allocation in 1990 and 1991 for additional student places, and Queensland's share of the capital for these two years (estimated to be more than $40 million). Now Darling Downs and Capricornia will become university colleges sponsored by Queensland University and the Commonwealth and State will assess the future status in late 1992. In the short time left I would like to ask the Minister a number of questions. First of all, what does sponsorship really mean? Is that sponsorship being driven by the Commonwealth or is it being passed on to the State to act as the proxy for the Commonwealth? Although one could argue about what is in a name, I ask the Minister to say why the Darling Downs Institute has been left as the Darling Downs Institute, whereas the Capricornia Institute has become the Capricornia University College. Will the University of Queensland be used as a financial Whipping post for financial stringencies in which the Darling Downs Institute might very well lose? Will the Darling Downs Institute retain direct access to the Department as part of the unified system or through the University of Queensland? I think that, as far as the staff at the Institute are concerned, disthat is a very important question. Does the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC) university check-off list have any governmental status? I refer the Minister to a report in the Australian on 14 June which set out what those AVCC qualitative indicators are. It. says: . . . about 500 equivalent full-time student units . . . minimum proportion of their students \ to be allocated to postgraduate research . . . Will the Minister please indicate what governmental status, if any, that check-off list has? Finally, I have to say that I favour any higher education system that will meet the objectives I have just outlined, as well as restoring a sound funding basis and giving State governments greater responsibility for planning future development in the States. Some of what the Minister proposes under the unified national system makes very rational sense. However, the issues strongly militating against his total package are both impractical and philosophical. I am particularly worried about the latter. It is about time that the Minister took crass political ideology out of higher education and moved away from the increased central government control inherent in his policies. It seems to me that there is a serious danger that the Dawkins cure will be more painful than the educational disease and has the potential to kill the higher education patient.",43
67,Mr GEAR ,HIGHER EDUCATION,"Canning) (2.45)-ln supporting the statement of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins), 1 would like to observe that it seems to me that the education system in a country reflects or mirrors the economy. It is hard to think back to 1983 and recall what the education system was like then, but one indicator that comes to mind is the retention rate in our high schools in 1983, which was an appalling 35 per cent. That figure was one of the lowest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, if not the lowest. We have raised it to 58 per cent. Last year it was up to 58 per cent and we hope to have it well in excess of 65 per cent by 1991. Certainly, the retention rates in o-r high schools are important because it is from our high schools that we will get the skilled work force and the higher education graduates. It is. very hard to compare the education system in 1983 with the one today because we have a more dynamic system nowadays. The statement by the Minister in the House yesterday takes this one step further. If we look at higher education and the absolute numbers in 1976 when Mr Fraser came to power, we find that in round terms the number of graduates from our institutions was 225,000. Over the seven years that he was in office, that figure increased to 250,000-an increase of about 25,000 over seven years. One would think that that was not very much; in fact, the situation was almost stagnant. Compared with the growth rate of the Australian population, we might have gone backwards. Betweet:l 1983 and 1989 the number of graduates of higher education institutions increased from 250,000 to 320,000, an increase of 70,000 since we have been in government. We know that by 1991, 350,000 young people will be going through our institutions. 1 said at the outset that the education system mirrored the economy of the country. It was acceptable in 1983 to have such an abysmal retention· rate in our high schools and an abysmal 250,000 people coming out of our higher education institutions because in 1983 our economy involved nothing more than sending rocks, wheat and wool overseas. We did not have a manufacturing economy. Certainly after 1982-83 when this country was in recession and we actually lost jobs the education system did turn out people according to the economy then. The economy has undergone a rapid change since then under the industry policies of this Government, promoted by the taxation policies which underwrite the sort of investment we are starting to see in industry now. There is now a call from industry for more graduates. 1 was not surprised when the honourable member for Groom ( Mr Taylor) spoke about what the Opposition calls the graduate tax, the higher education contribution. It is one way in which this Government has, rightfully, gone about funding that expansion in our· higher education system. 1 was one of those who advocated for quite some time that we should make the students contribute something to their education because they are privileged compared to people who leave school and do not take up formal education. They are advantaged because the Government spends a lot of money on their education. It costs the Federal Government about $10,000 per year to keep each of those students at school. When they get their degrees and go out into the work force, they can expect over their working lives to earn substantially more than somebody who had not been to university. 1 had some figures taken out by the Parliamentary Library and in round terms they indicate that somebody who left school at age 15 and did not receive any formal training whatsoever-that is, worked as a labourer or in the non-skilled areas-could expect to earn about $650,000 over his working life in 1986 dollars. If he took up an apprenticeship and learned a trade through the T AFE system, he could expect to earn about $900,000 over his working life. If he went to a university and received a university education he could expect to earn in the vicinity of $1 tm over his working life. We can see that the difference between an unskilled person and a person from a university is of the order of $900,000 in 1986 dollars over a working life. 1 do not think it is unreasonable to ask students to make some contribution out of that, back into the system which gave them that benefit. Every time members of the Opposition take a cheap shot at the higher education contribution, they should take some cognisance of the fact that graduates from our universities get that personal benefit for themselves. It is not unfair to make them pay back into the sysexpansion tem some of the money they will earn. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know that since we became the Government tax rates have tumbled. The top tax rate will have been reduced from 60c to 47c from 1 Januporate ary next year, the 48c rate has gone down to 40c and the bottom tax rate has dropped from 30c to 2lc. Of course, when graduates are paying back their contribution, they be paying it at 2c in the dollar from average weekly earnings up to $35,000, and 3c in the dollar thereafter. So, even adding those rates onto the new tax rates, we are nowhere near ment has been-the tax rates that used to operate when the Liberals were in power. But, of course, the Opposition has come up with a funding scheme of its own. It bit shonky, as we would expect. The figures do not add up. Its proposal contains an up to front fee of around $600. It is very hard for a university student to meet the cost of to university, with the cost of books and all the other costs associated with his study, without that up-front fee as well. It really is der. a disincentive. The higher education contribution overcomes that because there are no up-front fees and people pay it when they can afford to. But, of course, if Mum and Dad want to pay before their children go university, that facility is available too. have never been convinced by the argument that people in Australia do not see the value of higher education. One has only to look the private schools in this country. Mums and dads are quite happy paying out thoument. sands of dollars to send their young people to private secondary schools. It is ludicrous to suggest that when a young person wanted to go to university Mum and Dad would put away the chequebook. The simple fact is that more people are starting to see the benefits of higher educadetail tion. I am not just referring to the people the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business ( Mr Barry Jones) was talking about when he said he could tell where university graduates came from by their postcodes. and large that was true. I think people substantial wealth have always seen the efit in education. By and large-not univerright sally, but by and large-the people in our universities in the past have tended to come from the better to do suburbs. But with the of education now and the number of young people staying on at school, we need more and more university places, and that is what this Government has provided. I have a graph here which I cannot incorin Hansard because there is no Opposition frontbencher here to give me leave, but if I could incorporate it honourable members would see a dramatic take-up from will 1983, when this Government came to power. It has begun to look a bit exponential. The graph is rather flattened out for the Liberal years of government, but since this GovernMrs Sullivan-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable member for Canning has said he cannot incorpois a rate this graph because there is no frontbenchet present. There does not happen be anyone sitting here at the moment, but I make two points: First of all, frontbenchers going do not decide what goes into HansardMONICA",46
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,HIGHER EDUCATION,Mr Leo MCLeay)-Order! There is no' point or orMONICA,47
69,Mr GEAR,HIGHER EDUCATION,"As I was saying, the graph is flattened out for the years of the Liberal Party and starts to take off exponentially to from 1983. It just shows the commitment of I this Government, and, of course, of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who is building on the good work of at former Senator Susan Ryan, the first Minister for Education under the Hawke GovernThis Government does take education seriously, and that is demonstrated by the resources we have given to education. The honourable member for Groom relied fairly EmptyHere I am not going to go into that in any great because I think the Minister has more than answered that, but suffice it to say that his views are not shared by the wider community of vice-chancellors in this country, most of whom I am sure are quite appreciaBy tive of the reforms that the Minister has of brought to the higher education sector-and bennot only the higher education sector, but across the board. We have looked not only at higher education but also at technical and further education. Recently in Tasmania, with all the State Ministers, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training put forward a very constructive plan to start rationalising education services in this country. It is about time that was done, and it just shows that right across the educational spectrum this Government has taken a much greater interest than did coalition governments. I would like to spend some time on amalgamations, because the Opposition spokesman on education, the honourable member for Flinders ( Mr Reith), has been going around, especially in my home State of Western Australia, saying that the University of Western Australia and Murdoch University would have their funds slashed if amalgamation did not take place. That is totally wrong. The honourable member was being totally dishonest if he did say that because the fact is that there is a financial incentive, not a disincentive, for those universities to merge. In other words, the universities are going to get more money if they merge, and they realise this. The senates of both those universities have recommended amalgamation and it is taking place. As the honourable member for Streeton ( Mr Lamb) pointed out, we are going to have a woman vice-chancellor at our new University of Western Australia. It will be a better university because of that amalgamation. The sorts of benefits that accrue to larger institutions have been well canvassed in this place, but certainly some of the more obvious benefits go to research. Certainly, the research effort in this country has been found wanting in the past. The decisions announced in the 1988 Commonwealth Budget will see the injection of an additional $870m into higher education over the 198991 triennium, resulting in the creation of an additional 49,000 student places and the construction of 128 major building projects. Research funding by direct expenditure on research will increase in real terms from $102.1m in 1989 to $208.1m in 1992. In about three years, we will have doubled the amount of funds going to research in our higher education system. With the restructuring of our higher education system, the larger universities are much better placed to take the maximum effect from that dramatic increase in research funding. It stands to reason that a bigger university with bigger campuses, more teaching personnel and more research personnel can undertake very much more meaningful research than can a number of small, isolated institutions. It seems to me that not only is that a major advantage, but also a greater range of courses can be offered by the bigger institutions. When there was talk of putting a private university in Western Australia we were told that one of the advantages was that, with a private institution tied to the Curtin University of Technology, it would be possible to mount courses that currently could not be undertaken. Of course, by combining our public institutions we can do exactly the same thing. Not only will staff and students benefit from such an amalgamation, but Australia itself will benefit. I support the thrust of the Government's moves in higher education. Such moves are long overdue and I am sure that as we move into the 1990s and into the next century the proposals that Minister Dawkins has introduced into this House since he became the Minister will stand this country in good stead.",47
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,HIGHER EDUCATION,"Mr Leo MCLeay)-Before I call the honourable member for Moncrieff, I point out to honourable members that having tables incorporated in Hansard does not necessarily need the agreement of a Minister or an Opposition frontbencher; it just requires that the House does not disagree and that the table or gr-ph meets the guidelines laid down by Madam Speaker.",48
71,Mrs SULLIVAN ,HIGHER EDUCATION,"Moncriefi') (3.00)-ln my 15 years in this Parliament, I have participated in and listened to many debates on education. I think this debate today is the saddest contribution to the education debate that I have heard in those 15 years.",48
72,Mr GEAR ,HIGHER EDUCATION,You said that last time.,48
73,Mrs SULLIVAN,HIGHER EDUCATION,"1 did not say that last time because I did not speak after the honourable member for Canning last time. It was after his speech that the thought came to me. Today, we are debating the subject of tertiary education, particularly of university education. If there is one benchmark of universities, it ought to be that they fearlessly seek the truth and rigorously examine it. Assertions were made in the speech made by the honourable member for Canning that were simply not true. There were references to facts which were nothing like an objective examination of those facts. They were a propaganda exercise. There was reference to certain figures which do not fit the position that universities and colleges find themselves in today. When the honourable member referred to extra funding and extra students, he overlooked the fact that the institutions are· being required to turn out more graduates and to take more students with less per capita for the students. There is an 8 per cent reduction in real terms per student under this Government. It talks about extra students but it does not give the resources that are necessary. It is not as though one is trimming a lot of fat off these institutions. For years now, they have been subjected to rigorous Government examination and have had substantial cutbacks over Ii period. Frankly, the approach to this debate is symptomatic of the approach taken by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins). The Minister has shown an original authoritarian attitude to education. and no sense of education itself. I would be the first to accept that education has a role to play in training. The better training one gets the better one's education is, not just the better the skills of one's teachers. The higher the standard of one's education, as distinct from training, the better the outcome is when one has to train. That is something that the Minister will not face. It is something that the vice-chancellors have pointed out to him. The honourable member for Canning very glibly swept aside the views of Vice-Chancellor Penington and said that he is not typical of vice-chancellors. If he is not, it is a disgrace. I do not think the honourable member could say that; it is nota true statement. There are many vicechancellors and many leaders of education in Australia today who are extremely concerned about the expressed views of Minister Dawkins on education. He seems to think that education relates only to, training. In fact, if we gave people a good basic education we would get a better outcome than we would get with the training of the people who have been narrowly educated. The Minister does not see it in those terms. It is all very well to talk about outcomes in terms of numbers of graduates. One has to have some objective assessment of the quality of the education behind that. This is a great concern of educators today. The Minister's proscriptive approach to education and his clear desire for Government to play a role in what research is being undertaken and what is taught are not the best way to the best outcome. This is not to say that one ought to give limitless money to institutions and never examine the outcome and that they should be able to have money for whatever research comes into their head. Not at all! There was a very rigorous process which had been in place for years and which has been modified from time to time. Situations have arisen which have led to a good output in terms of research. We should be concerned not only with technical and technological research but with these areas in other areas of research. The great fear is that governments will not understand that. Many of the great discoveries of modern times that have arisen out of research would not have appeared to have any connection with the outcome. In fact, pure research can lead to terribly important applied outcomes. Pure research in certain areas to do with biology .will eventually lead to important breakthroughs in the medicine area. There will be an applied result. That result is not yet perceived. It is not for the purpose of the result that a lot of that research is being undertaken. It is research to discover the facts, the truth. Once we have discovered the truth, we can look at what we can deduce from it. To look at what we want as an outcome is not the best starting point for much research. Our time to speak in this debate is limited. This is a pity because we have very few debates on education in the House of Representatives. This is the first proper debate that we have had on the Minister's objectives as outlined in the White Paper a long time ago. I want to make some general statements in relation to the statement made by the Minister yesterday. I also want to make some specific statements in relation to a concern of mine which is also a very important concern for many people in Queensland. I am referring to the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education. The honourable member for Streeton ( Mr Lamb) said that, when the Fraser Government moved to undertake certain amalgamations, the institutions had a gun pointed at their heads and there was no thought for the consequences. I have touched on the consequences of the outcomes of what this Government is all about. The Government keeps saying over and over again that the institutions did not have to amalgamate. That is right; they did not. But they did if they wanted their funding or wanted to grow, which is very relevant to the Gold Coast College which I will come to in a minute. In his statement, the Minister said: This Government has explicitly stated that only support mergers which have the support of institutions concerned. One cannot expect an institution to enter into a merger unless it wants to be there for one reason or another. Without a doubt the overriding reason for a number of institufull tions to merge has been financial. In SOPle areas the mergers have been positive and well received. In other areas they are causing trauma and difficulty. They will continue do so. The sadness is that they are going cause educational trauma and the outcome is going to be very poor. To say that there was a choice in this process for all the institimes, tutions is like saying that a condemned son has a choice between the death sentence and life imprisonment. They are given choice but the two alternatives are quite unattractive. The choice here was to amalwho gamate, even if the outcome is unattractive in educational terms, or not to look forward to any growth in the future. The matter of the binary system also was touched on by the honourable member for Streeton. Speaking personally, I think we spend far too much time talking about this matter. In the end, it is a case of a rose by any other name smelling the same. We all know that there are universities in this try which offer courses that would have been offered by colleges of advanced education there had been CAEs in place at the time Higher when the universities embarked on those courses for which there was a perceived need. We all know that there is university type work, teaching and research being carried out in certain CAEs. It really did· not matter that there was a distinction in those cases. But there are importantly other areas of such work that I believe would never have been undertaken if we had not had the CAE sector. People say that we are now merging everything into universities and doing away with an artificial distinction-which in some areas was artificial but not all---':so things will be okay. The more likely outcome is that T AFEs are going to start to move. It has started already. Already in a number of cases TAFE colleges in this country are requiring tertiary entrance (TE) scores from entrants. That is light years away from what the original concept and the continuing concept of T AFE it will has been. If T AFEs are going to ask for TE the scores, they will not be catering to a very important group of people. The term 'TE scores' that I am referring to is a term used in my own State. If T AFEs are going to look at qualifications that come at the end of a secondary education, they are moving away from a group of people who need what they offer in educational and training terms and there will be nothing for them. Governto ments will have to move to fill that vacuum. to I refer to people who did not have the opportunity of receiving a full secondary education in earlier times or even in current for one reason or another. These are perpeople who need a very particular sort of training after having been in the work force; a and people who are made redundant who have not reached that level of education but have been in the work force for some time. The future role of TAFE is something that should very much concern us in this place. We ought to be concerned that the abolition of the binary system does not lead to a change in the TAFE area. This is a change that we would not really want, at least without debating whether we want it. I have very few minutes left, so I must spend the little time. I have by referring to counthe Gold Coast College of Advanced Education. The Minister has tabled - a document if called Supplementary Funding Decisions on Education for the 1989-91 Triennium, and it is subheaded 'Statement by the Hon. J. S. Dawkins, Minister for Employment, Education and Training'. It is this document on which his statement to the House yesterday was based, and his statement is essentially a precis of the elements of that document. On page 11 of the printed version of this document we find the following statement: The Commonwealth and Queensland governments have agreed that the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education as a separate entity will not member of the unified national system. That is now out of date information. I appreciate that this larger document would have been printed before the Government was aware that the Gold Coast CAE is to merge with the University of Queensland. But the Minister has known since Tuesday that that was so, and there is no excuse for his not making an amendment to this document in the form of some reference to the Gold Coast CAE in his statement. I suggest that the reason he did not properly inform the House-it has been left to me to do that is that although he has known since Tuesday what is going to happen to this important institution, he simply did not want it to be an element in the debate. If ever there is a nonsense in what is being undertaken, it is perfectly illustrated by the Gold Coast CAE. I quickly give the House some figures. The college took its first students in 1987, so it has been functioning for just on two yearsit did not start at the beginning of the year. As at the beginning of this year it was already up to 1,000 students. It is growing at an extremely rapid rate. It happens to be positioned in the most rapidly growing area of Australia and it is directly serving a population of about a quarter of a million. The college was well overdue when it was established and it has strained at the seams to try to meet the demand. Each year that it has operated, it has taken more students than its anticipated number. For example, this year it was expected that it would have 760 equivalent full time student units (EFTSUs), but in fact it has 820. Next year it is anticipated it will have 995.Commonwealth EFTSUs plus about 120 provided by the State. In 1991 the projections are that it will have 1,305 Commonwealth funded EFTSUs and about another 250 State places. That rate of growth shows that it will very rapidly, within very few years, reach the level of enrolment that would have been necessary for it to be a university. Its plea for not being pushed into the artificial situation of being a college of the University of Queensland, which is where it finds itself now, is that its pattern of growth would be affected by that. In fact it is some- . thing that will operate for probably five years at the very most. So both the university and be a the college will have to go through the turmoil and difficulty of trying to fit that college into the university structure when, by the time it has done that it would be time to extricate itself. The very real concern is that that amalgamation will affect the rate of growth of the institution. It has been taking more students than it was funded for because it perceived it had a responsibility to fit in every last student that it could. I ought to refer to the fact that the amount of money, mentioned in this document tabled by the Minister, for amalgamations in Queensland totals only $l.5m over the next two years. How the very long list of amalgamations that appear on pages 10 and 11 of this document can possibly be achieved for that amount of money is quite beyond me. It contrasts strangely with the amounts being provided for other States. One suspects that the amount of money this Federal Government is making available for Queensland's tertiary amalgamations is once again much less than that State needs. Queensland has lagged behind in funding for some time. It looked as though it was starting to catch up, and now the Government says, 'You must amalgamate the institutions but we are not going to fund it properly'.",48
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,HIGHER EDUCATION,Mr Mountford)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. .,51
75,Ms CRAWFORD ,HIGHER EDUCATION,"Forde) (3.15)-I am delighted to speak on the ministerial statement concerning amalgamations, because I think this debate shows us the nature of society and the way in which people look at society. While the honourable member for Canning ( Mr Gear) has seen the role of education and the economic system reflected in the education system, I see our education system and the changes that are occurring, particularly in relation to amalgamations in the higher education system, as very much part of the social fabric of Australia. The opposition that we are seeing to the amalgamations is in fact striking at the very heart of the issues. We must ask: Firstly, why is there and why has there been opposition to the end of the binary system; and secondly, why has there been opposition to an expansion of institutions in which equity, opportunity, wider research and wider programs are going to become part of the fabric of these higher education institutions? It would seem that once again entrenched in the Opposition and the universities is opposition to the notion that higher education will be for all Australians, who will be given the most opportunity and the greatest equity so that we can expand our institutions to cater for everybody. When we hear opposition to amalgamations, we are first reminded about the binary system-that it had to end. But with its ending we hope we will see the creation of newer, more dynamic and more honest institutions. We also hope that, in line with the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the Higher Education Council, our institutions can demonstrate their capacity to deliver and develop substantial and high quality research and postgraduate programs as well as a wide range of teaching services and so on. The honourable member talked about opposition in Queensland to amalgamations and we saw the State Government's attempt to call three of its CAEs universities and create them as independent institutions, without acknowledging any form of development in terms of research and postgraduate programs. If these amalgamations do nothing else but ensure that quality is brought across the board to all institutions, that the very best of teaching and resources and the very best of courses are available to all Australians, and that this is entrenched within the newly amalgamated institutions, then all Australians, not only students in the higher education system, must be the beneficiaries of such a program. This unified national system for higher education will ensure that all institutions will meet the reforms that are inherent within the program. Indeed, as part of the program we see the establishment of educational and institutional profiles. We have heard that many institutions oppose the creation of such profiles, but why? Because profiles demand an indication of where institutions see themselves. going. As receivers of public funding, surely it is not unreasonable to ask public institutions, which are spending our taxpayers' money, to give an indication of the kind of role which they see for themselves within our community. The honourable member for Groom ( Mr Taylor) talked about culture and so on. While I have no difficulty in accepting education as being an inherited part of our culture, it is not elitist and it should be for all; we should all have access to it. When we are asking institutions to ensure that their commitment to learning and to education is there and is demonstrated and is part of their process and profile, then I believe the institutions should be able to acknowledge that and to place that within their profile. Surely we are not asking too much of them to recognise and to acknowledge where their strengths are, the kinds of programs they believe they should have and what they should be doing. We see this emerging within this process of amalgamation and within the unified national system. We have heard discussions about the quality of mergers and the way in which institutions have been merged. We have heard much about school retention rates and the expansion into the higher education sector. We must ensure that, while our youth remain at school, we can guarantee that they will have places within our higher education system. So those institutions must respond to changing needs. Why should we waste money with duplication of services, administration and programs? Why should we have second rate programs when there are better quality programs down the rqad? The savings that we make will enable us to expand, to offer more places to more of our' youth and to use the talents of Australian youth for the betterment of our society. The amalgamations will ensure that duplication does not occur and that any savings which are made will accrue to the institutions. So it is in the best interests of the institutions to ensure that they operate efficiently and effectively, in the same way as the rest of the community is being asked to operate. Those savings which will accrue to institutions can then be used by those institutions to expand their places. and their research programs. Surely this is not unreasonable? We also see as a benefit of amalgamation the better provision of transfer of credit within and between disciplines. We know now and we recognise that many of our students wish to transfer between disciplines and institutions. Currently they find it exceedingly difficult because there is no portability. The amalgamations will make this possible. The amalgamations will also ensure that we have an enhanced level of student services, particularly for institutions on adjacent or nearby sites. Often many of our smaller institutions, and some of our newer institutions, have not had the benefit of the wide-ranging student services that some of our older and larger institutions have. Surely the Opposition is not suggesting that such student services should not be available to all students within our community. The amalgamations will ensure that better student services are delivered to a wider range of students. We would also hope for an expansion and improvement in the standard of facilities and services for teaching and research. It is absolutely imperative that people are given the opportunity. There should be an acknowledgment of where quality and excellence is and all institutions should be raised to that kind of level. Diversity and expansion will be part of those institutions. We will see an opportunity for many institutions to develop new teaching programs and we will see new areas of specialisation in professional training, research and development. Of course, the need for each institution to cater for a larger and more diverse population will mean that a wide range of programs will be maintained, providing for particular regional needs in a cost-effective way. The challenge is for institutions to meet the changing world and a' more wide-ranging student population. I say yet again that what we have seen within some of the older institutions and what we have heard here today is a belief that, somehow, higher education should be and should remain the prerogative of a small group of people within the community. This is blatant nonsense. We are living in 1989. We are about an expansion of opportunity, an expansion of equity and an expansion of places within the community in the most cost-effective way to. ensure that teaching services, student services, research services and programs are not duplicated and, in the process of doing that, ensuring that those quality programs can be expanded across the rest of Australia. We heard also of staffing concerns. There has been a wide range of negotiations and a 4 per cent salary increase for academic staff has been agreed to. There have also been a number of early and voluntary retirements. Within the new program of award restructuring, these new institutions will be able to be part of that. In fact, they will be pursuing flexibility and rewarding performance and achievement, just as the rest of industry will be under the current process. We have also heard discussions on external studies. The University of Queensland has a reasonably large external studies department which will not be funded under the current amalgamations. Why? Because the university failed to pursue it. The Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education, which has a smaller external studies department, wanted to expand and develop that department and offer it as part of its program. Since the Institute already operates in a regional area of provincial Queensland, that would seem to make sense. We hear people bleating about certain changes being thrust upon them. But we should ask those people to speak to their university administrations to find out what has actually happened and what representations were made by those administrations on their behalf. We have heard quite a lot of discussion about the nature of amalgamations. Within Queensland there has been a lot of debate in a number of smaller institutions. Of course, it is blatant nonsense to suggest that, in 1989, institutions with 500 and 600 places can offer the same kinds of facilities, programs and expansion that larger institutions can offer. There has been a number of amalgamations to ensure that these programs will be met. Brisbane College of Advanced Education will be ceded to Griffith University. Griffith University has always acknowledged equity and opportunity. Brisbane College of Advanced Education has a more traditional approach to higher education. With the marriage of those two institutions one would assume that the best of both will emerge. That will happen. The Queensland Conservatorium of Music will merge with the University of Queensland. It will continue to have its own advisory council; it will not lose that special role which it fills. Administratively, it will become cheaper and easier for all of us. So we are looking at delivering the best service to our talented young people. We are looking at providing this opportunity to as many of them as we can. If we are talking about expanding places and quality, Queensland certainly needs expansion. It had an expansion of 7 per cent of places in 1989 and we are already looking at a further 49,000 places within the national structure for 1989-1991. These reforms are an attempt to balance institutional autonomy with public accountability which, in the long run, will result in the delivery of a quality, vibrant and vital higher education system which will be unified in the national interest and which will deliver high quality education and research to our community.",51
76,Mr MILTON ,HIGHER EDUCATION,"La Trobe) (3.30)-It gives me great pleasure to be able to speak about the benefits of the amalgamations which are now occurring in higher education, particularly as I was Assistant Registrar at the University of Melbourne for 15 years. Indeed, I worked at that university for 17 years. In that time. I had a rather different idea of what one might call the viable size of universities. I had the good fortune to be able to travel around the country, and also overseas to Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, supported by a grant from the University of Melbourne. That gave me the opportunity to see what was happening overseas. There was no doubt that institutions such as the University of California, with seven or eight campuses and approximately 100,000 students in all, had a considerable number of problems with the administration of such a large unit, and with the ability of the staff to keep in contact with the students and not become remote from them. In those days I had the idea that a viable unit for higher education would be some 10,000 students. It seemed to me that 8,000 to 10,000 students in such an institution could enable that intimate development between the staff and students which was important for the development of those students. The problem, of course, is that since that timeparticularly in Australia-we have had to practise financial stringency. We just do not have the funds to be able to keep on proliferating the number of higher education institutions which we have. At the moment there are approximately 72 higher education institutions in Australia. The Government's intention, with these amalgamations, is to reduce that number. It will eventually be reduced by half to about 35. I realise that there are problems· with this sort of amalgamation. Our predecessors in government forced a number of mergers on these institutions, and did it in a way which reduced the funds that were available to those institutions with virtually no consultation at all. Mr Reith-The whole issue is about money now, is it?",54
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,HIGHER EDUCATION,Mr Leo MCLeay)-The honourable member for Flinders will cease interjecting.,54
78,Mr MILTON,HIGHER EDUCATION,"That is an interesting interjection. I know that the Opposition is trying to put over the line that all the Government is concerned about is money. It is not all we are concerned with at all, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr Snow) knows very well. He and I have had many discussions about this problem. This Government is looking for institutions that can provide good research and higher education opportunities for students. Mr Snow-That is right. Hear, hear!",54
79,Mr MILTON,HIGHER EDUCATION,"That is what we are concerned about. The honourable member appreciates this, as does the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins). I have looked with great interest at the report of the task force on amalgamations in higher education. I have also noted that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has just produced a set of underlying principles which it believes should apply to institutions of higher education, particularly, of course, universities. I can well appreciate the concern of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that in some way we will debase the currency of universities. I do not think that is what this Government is about. Certainly, when one reads the general principles underlying amalgamation which have been indicated in the report of the task force, one can see that the Government is not about debasing the currency. The task force had on it some distinguished people. It was chaired by Dr Gregor Ramsey, Chairman of the Higher Education EmptyHere is a deputy secretary of the Department of Employment, Education and Training; Dr Russell Linke, Counsellor to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training; and Professor Ian Chubb, Deputy ViceChancellor of the University of Wollongong. With these sorts of people preparing the report, one could expect it to be of a high calibre and, indeed, it is. I was interested in looking at the list of potential benefits which come from an amalgamation. For example, there will be an expanded range of available disciplines and categories of award. Of course, in that respect one has to ensure that the staff of the institution have the appropriate qualifications. The amalgamation of institutions which previously did not have the opportunity of cross-fertilisation will help to lift tional calibre of the staff. Also, a larger institution has more attractions for staff wishing to take up positions in such a new body. As a result, there will be much greater flexibility in the number of disciplines and subdisciplines which are offered to the students. Of course, improved flexibility of subject choice is very important too. That is where the subdisciplines are very important under the main discipline. This is important for students who have embarked on a course and, in their first year, as many do, change their views with the impact of higher learning. They suddenly realise they want to go in another direction. Improved flexibility of subject choice is absolutely vital in such circumstances to enable a student, having done the first year, to move to a different range of subjects in the second and third years. There are better provisions for transfer of credit both within and between the different disciplines, and again that is very important. When I first joined the staff of the University of Melbourne way back in 1962, it was exceedingly difficult for many students to gain credit for different courses. For example, if a student had commenced a course in architecture and wanted to move to engineering, the engineer would say, 'You have not done physics, chemistry or maths; you are good enough. What you have done in the school of architecture is not good enough to entitle you to transfer to us'. We cannot waste those sorts of resources. Students like that may have gone off to do something else. They may have gone to the theatre, as many good architecture students have done, and had good careers. Nevertheless, those people could have been very valuable within the university if they had had the opportunity to transfer to engineering. I can give a number of other examples of the sorts of problems experienced with the transfer of credit. That also applies with regard to transfer of credit from overseas institutions. Unfortunately, there was a certain attitude that within our universities we have such a high level of learning that it is impossible for students to transfer directly from, say, one of the universities in Europe. Some of those universities might have been founded hundreds of years ago and qur own universities may be a mere 100 years old, and perthe educa- haps less in many cases. Another factor was the enhanced level of student services, particularly for institutions on adjacent or nearby sites. It is interesting to note that the University of Melbourne is amalgamating with the College of Pharmacy. When I was Assistant Registrar at the Faculty of Science it was very clear that such an amalgamation would be of great benefit to the pharmacy students. Of course, there was at that time a very strong relationship between the University of Melbourne and the College of Pharmacy. That relationship will now be considerably strengthened by the amalgamation of the institutions. Another item that is mentioned is the increased strength of the academic departments or schools. As I pointed out previously, the cross-fertilisation between the various elements in the new body could prove a valuable way of enhancing the educational opportunities for the students. Finally, there is the expansion and improvement in the standards of facilities and services for teaching and research. One of the problems that we have seen in some of the colleges of advanced education is that the staff have not had the same opportunity to engage in research, which is such a vital element of higher education. It is absolutely essential that staff have this opportunity to engage in research. That puts them at the coalface of education and the frontiers of knowledge. Of course, that is of great benefit to the students concerned. It is interesting to note that in Victoria we had the advantage of structural adjustments which the Hon. Evan Walker introduced and which have helped the Commonwealth Government in its support of the amalgamations that are presently taking place in Victoria. There are other benefits arising from amalgamation. I have mentioned very briefly the fact that there is an opportunity for career advancement for both the academic and general staff, which is important. As an ex-member of the general staff of universities I have found that general staff are sometimes treated as second rate citizens which they are not. Universities and institutes of higher education cannot function without the support of general staff who, too, need career opportunities. In a large institution there is far more opportunity to advance in the administrative levels. Another very important factor is that staff and students have improved access to library facilities and computing services. A larger institution can ensure that it has a much wider range of those services and also the funds to be able to keep up to date ?lith the new methods and the new computers that are constantly being introduced. There is also the increased purchasing power for equipment and materials. This, too, was mentioned by the task force. What we are driving at is that those university officials. purchasing new equipment will have more funds at their disposal and, therefore, a better opportunity to look around for the best equipment. They do not necessarily have to take the cheapest available; they can look for the best available. In the final analysis, that is far better for the students. Another aspect of amalgamation that is absolutely vital is the fact that a more competitive basis for attracting overseas students and visiting staff is created by the enhanced educational profile. The wider range of disciplines attracts students from overseas. This gives the new amalgamated institution a good public profile. It means that students from overseas see the institution as one from which they would like to derive their education. This Government has done very well in its efforts to attract students from overseas to Australia. Of course we have the present example of the unfortunate troubles occurring in China. We have some 10,000 Chinese students here; hopefully, we will give those students the opportunity to stay in Australia, if they wish. We will find that we will have great benefit from the skills that those students have gained and that they will be able to bring to Australian society. However, it is a great pity that they cannot take those skills back to their country. Perhaps they will one day. I have some faith that this will happen when the Chinese Government sees sense. The Government has shown great initiative in instituting these changes.",54
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,HIGHER EDUCATION,Mr Leo MCLeay) - Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,56
81,Mr BRUMBY ,HIGHER EDUCATION,"Bendigo) (3.45)-It is my pleasure to support debate on the statement from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins) on higher education. In doing so, I want to speak at some length about education in general, but primarily about the report tabled in the House by the Minister, the report of the task force on amalgamations in higher education. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will know, I chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. The first report that my Committee tabled in this House in 1987 was titled Setting the Course. It was a report on the efficiency and effectiveness of institutional practices in higher education. In the course of preparing that report, members of my Committee visited a large number of institutions throughout Australia and took evidence from a wide variety of organisations involved in higher education. Our report made a number of recommendations regarding the higher education system, particularly in relation to growth in the system. We also made a number of comments on the question of institutional amalgamation. Basically, the view that the Committee put in our report was that tl\ere were advantages. through amalgamatiobs of institutions and that they should be encouraged where there were clear educational advantages, where there were clear cost advantages and where the institutions were physically contiguous. I am pleased to say that in a number of cases around Australia amalgamations have proceeded primarily on that basis. I indicated that this debate was a fairly broad one about education and higher education. I take the opportunity to applaud the Government's initiatives in the education system, particularly those in the secondary school system, in so dramatically increasing the retention rate, the participation rate among students proceeding through to year 12. It has been remarked earlier in the debate that, when this Government was elected to office in 1983, the retention rate, the number of students continuing from the first year in school through to year 12, was a very low 36 per cent. I am pleased to say that that figure has. been increased dramatically under this Government. I can now say with some pride that the number of young people staying on at school to complete 12 years of education is 58 per cent Australia-wide. We expect that through 1989 that figure will increase to over· 60 per cent. In that respect I have every confidence that the Government will meet its target of a retention rate of 65 per cent by the early 1990s. Some people have said, 'What is the advantage of young people staying on at school to finish 12 years of education?'. There are significant advantages. Perhaps the greatest advantage is not to the individual but to the nation. By international standards, particularly those of countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Australia still has a low proportion of its students completing 12 years of education. In turn, that contributes to what I consider to be a skills base in the community which is less than adequate. By remaining at school longer, there are benefits for the individual in a broader, rounder, better based education. There are ongoing benefits to the individual in that the individual's prospects of gaining better employment will improve. Of course, there are benefits to the· nation through having a better educated and more highly skilled work force. I saw some statistiCs earlier this year which confirmed that employment and unemployment levels are very closely correlated to levels of education in our community. The figures I saw suggested that for young people who had left school having completed education only to year 10, the average unemployment rate at some stage later in life would be around 15 per cent. If they completed 12 years of education their unemployment rate would be a single digit figure; and if they had gone on to complete higher education, further education or tertiary education their unemployment rate would be about 3 or 4 per cent. Clearly there is a relationship between the level of education and employability, so I encourage young people-as I do in my electorate regularly-to stay on at school as long as they can. If they have the determination and ability to participate in tertiary education and complete a degree, they should do so. Having spoken about the secondary education system, I will conclude my remarks on this section of education by saying that the Committee of which I am chairman has another inquiry under way at present on retention rates in secondary education. The subcommittee which is investigating this matter is being chaired by the honourable memEmptyHere subcommittee members are doing an admirable job in listening to the views of parents, students and teachers throughout Australia and trying to determine the factors which affect students' decisions as to whether they will stay on to complete 12 years of education. Two very clear messages about student choices have come through to members of that subcommittee. The first concerns the breadth of the curriculum. From the views that have been put to us, there seems to be no doubt that curriculum choice is important. The second message is that the question of income support is also important. A report on this matter will be tabled by the Committee later this year and that will provide an opportunity for a full discussion of the issues and the recommendations which we shall make at that time. I have a special interest in this area of higher education because the Bendigo College of Advanced Education is located in my electorate of Ben-igo. Mr Reith-Surprise, surprise!",56
82,Mr BRUMBY,HIGHER EDUCATION,Well one never knows now with redistributions and so on. Something that is called 'Bendigo' is not necessarily in Bendigo. Mr Reith-Have they still got the gun at their heads in Bendigo?,57
83,Mr BRUMBY,HIGHER EDUCATION,"It always disappoints me when we get these rapid fire interjections from members of the Opposition about matters which come before the House. We are waiting eagerly to hear the details of the Opposition's policy on higher education. We have not heard it yet. The Opposition waxes lyrical about how bad amalgamations are, but only eight years ago its own Government proceeded down the path of reducing the number of tertiary institutions. That occurred when the honourable member for Hume ( Mr Fife) was the Minister. It met with some opposition at the time, but it was the right decision. In exactly the same way, this Government is making the right decision by reducing the number of institutions from more than 70 to the mid-30s. I turn to the question of Bendigo-and I urge the shadow Minister to take note of this. When I was elected in 1983 there were about 1,500 effective full time students at the Bendigo College of Advanced Education (BCAE). There are now 2,800. In the space of just 6t years of this Government, we have virtually doubled the number of students who are able to participate in education at the Bendigo College. That quite dramatic achievement contrasts very markedly-and the people of Bendigo will not forget thiswith the policies of the previous Government which reduced student numbers at the BCAE. I am pleased to see that in the Minister's response to the task force, tabled in the Parliament, he says that the BCAE will be the beneficiary of $1.7m of additional funding over the next couple of years. A sum of $1.2m will be used for the construction of a new general teaching building and another $500,000 will assist the college in providing additional student housing. People often forget that during the period of the Fraser Government not one cent was spent on student housing at institutions or colleges throughout Australia. This Government has provided substantial assistance for student accommodation-quite rightly so-and regional areas such as Bendigo and Ballarat have been the beneficiaries. The BCAE has also been the beneficiary of a number of other grants in recent times. It was successful in obtaining grants under the equity program and I am pleased to see that nine full time child care places will be available and paid for by the Commonwealth over the next three years in order to cater for needy students who, otherwise, would be unable to participate in tertiary studies. We have also recently announced some grants under the innovative rural education program. Some good things are happening at the BCAE. At the moment that college is involved in very intensive study on the question of its future arrangements and whether it should be part of a Victorian State university based on the conglomerate of DeakinWarrnambool-Ballarat-Bendigo or whether it would be better as part of a larger' La Trobe University in partnership with La Trobe, the Phillip Institute of Technology and possibly the Swinburne Institute of Technology. I have a personal view on that matter which I know is shared by many people in the Bendigo community. I think the interests of students-present and future-in the Bendigo region would be best served by an arrangement between Bendigo College and La Trobe University. I say that because I think it would offer increased opportunities to young people in the region and it would mean that in the very near future students at the Bendigo College-or Bendigo university campus, as it would' be under an arrangement with La Trobe University-would have the benefit of a degree program from La Trobe University. There are many other advantages which I do not have time to go into at this stage. I conclude my comments by saying that in my view there are a number of benefits which can be provided through institutional amalgamation. I reiterate, as the Minister has done time and time again, that this Government is not forcing or requiring any institution around Australia to amalgamate. Mr Reith-What nonsense!",58
84,Mr BRUMBY,HIGHER EDUCATION,"The shadow Minister says, 'nonsense'. Apart from taking his own degree, I doubt whether he has ever set foot inside a tertiary institution in his life. Has he ever spoken to people? Has he ever done anything except quote from newspapers parrot-fashion, day after day, as he does in this place? He would not have a clue. Mr Reith-You are so out of touch you would not have a clue; you would not have the vaguest idea what is going on.",58
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,HIGHER EDUCATION,Mr Leo MCLeay) - Order! The honourable member for Flinders will cease interjecting. Mr BRUMBYThe honourable member would not have a clue. This is his fourth shadow portfolio in three years. Every time he gets a new portfolio he mucks it up and he gets shifted to another one. He will muck this one up too. Mr Reith-That is personal abuse.,59
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION,I warn the honourable member for Flinders.,59
87,Mr BRUMBY,HIGHER EDUCATION,"This is the portfolio that the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) did not want. The Opposition lead"" ership asked itself, 'Who else will take it? Who can we otTer it to? What mug is there on the Opposition benches-MONICA",59
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION,"Order! The honourable member for Bendigo will address the matter before the Chair. Mr BRUMBYThe honourable member for Flinders should open his eyes. No-one is forcing anyone to be part of any enforced institutional amalgamation. There are clear advantages in amalgamation in relation to credit transfer. If the shadow Minister does not recognise that, he should look at the wastage that occurs in our higher education system. Much of that wastage results from the fact that there is no proper system of credit transfer in Australia. The system is presently inadequate and, certainly, fewer and larger institutions will improve the prospects for appropriate credit transfer which guarantees standards of quality in the future. A number of other advantages will flow through from amalgamation. These are detailed in the Minister's response and 1 certainly endorse what he has said. 1 hope that this process 'continues for the educational benefit of young people throughout Australia, particularly those who reside in central Victoria and who attend the Bendigo College of Advanced Education.",59
89,Mr WRIGHT ,HIGHER EDUCATION,"Capricornia) (4.00)-1 enter this debate for a few moments to comment on the impact of what this Government has done in my own area. 1 preface my remarks by commending the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins) for the initiatives he has taken and the innovative plan he has implemented across this nation. He has brought about a new era for tertiary education. If one wants to see an example of the change and the advantages one has only to go to central Queensland and visit the Capricornia College of Advanced Education, which is soon to be the University College ,of Queensland. My only hope would be, as the Minister considers this matter again, that, instead of being called the Capricornia University College, it be called the University College of Central Queensland, so that at the end of the day, in 1992, it becomes the University of Central Queensland. It is because of this Government that we have seen major changes and major advantages flow to central Queensland. For many years Queensland missed out on catering for the number of students who desire to go on to tertiary education. Because of the extra money that will be available and because of the plans that have been put in place, tens of thousands of young Australians will benefit from the advantage of having that education,. That is certainly true of my area. The Government has taken note of the importance of providing additional facilities and additioQal places for students in northern Australia. I am pleased about that. 1 welcomed the announcement last week that central Queensland shall become one of the providers of what used to be called external education and is now called distance education. Central Queensland will be one of the eight places across this nation providing a special type of tertiary education for tens of thousands of students. As one who completed a degree by doing external studies, 1 understand the hardships and difficulties that people face when they try to study externally. The Government has seen fit to ensure that the education facilities are not placed just in the capital cities. The Minister announced the other day that $2.8m will be provided for a new social science building for Capricornia. 1I have asked him to try to bring forward further capital funding so that we can have the engineering block finished. 1 would also put in a plug at this moment for more moneys so that we can develop a distance education complex. A precedent has been - et in the Darling Downs area: Over $7m has now been allocated for a dIstance education complex on the campus there. Clearly, there will be a need in a short time for more moneys, for more space and for more facilities to meet the expansive role that Capricornia will play in providing distance education throughout Australia. We have seen major changes. We have seen that this Government has been prepared to make the hard decisions when it comes to a user pays approach based on the ability to pay. We have seen that the Government is prepared to acknowledge that unless we train our young people academically we will not be able to compete in the twenty-first century. We will not have the new technology, the skills or the expertise. There may be the need for change again. One realises that this is a time of great change, but the Hawke Labor Government and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training have been willing to tackle the problem and really do something about the difficulties across the nation. Whilst there will always be those who say that it could have been done in another way, the outcome will show that it is Australia which has benefited and it is Australians who have benefited. It is the young people of this country who will get that tertiary education, not simply because additional money is being spent but because Australia has had a government that had a strategy and a plan. It is because of that plan that Capricornia particularly, the area I represent, will now be able to play a vital part in providing tertiary education throughout this nation. I hope that as we develop these facilities we will realise that to our north we have millions of people who want to take advantage of this service and that they will want to gain from the quality of the education that exists in this country. There are some 10 million Indonesians learning English right now. They want to grasp our language. The opportunity has been taken up by many universities and colleges throughout the nation. It is an opportunity that can be developed and advanced upon. I believe that we should sell that service, as one university in New South Wales is already trying to do and Capricornia is trying to do by going to Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. There are 176 million Indonesians, 14 million or 15 million Malaysians and 60 million Thais who are desperate to take advantage of our facilities and the quality of education in Australia. Full commendation goes to the Minister and the Government for bringing about a new era of tertiary education in this nation. Question resolved in the affirmative.

90,Mr MCGAURAN ,RESOURCE ASSESSMENT,"Gippsland) (4.06)The farcical conduct of this Parliament by this Government in the last sitting days before the adjournment and again today continues with the production of the amendments before the chamber. I remind the chamber that towards the end of the sittings of the autumn session the consideration of legislation was curtailed by the brutal imposition of a guillotine which allowed little or no time for proper discussion of a whole range of matters. Now, on the second day of sitting of the recalled House of Representatives, we have not had a question time, we have not had the opportunity to debate a matter of public importance and, as if to rub salt into the wound, we have been served up the most farcical amendments to an important piece of Government legislation seen in a long while. What makes them so farcical? Let us leave aside the close examination of the actual wording and look at the process of how they came into being. Senator Norman Sanders of the Australian Democrats let the cat out of the bag with his public statement that these amendments were negotiated not between the Democrats and the Government but diEmptyHere director of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) , and the offices of the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin). We can forget the Democrats as they are irrelevant to the parliamentary process by their' own admission. We now have stature by direct negotiaintegrity tion, unencumbered in any way, between the ACF and this Government. How far will this opportunistic, cynical Government go to buy the votes of the extremist conservation movement? When will this Govermhent balance the proper energy resource needs of this nation and the standard of living of all Australians so dependent on that sector with proper concerns for the environment? At present the balance is hopelessly tilted in favour of the most extreme conservationist voices in the country. It is grossly irresponsible of the Government to act in this way. As for the Democrats, no words could express my disgust and loathing for those political prostitutes. For them to abandon their responsibilities in this way and allow an unelected representative of a comparatively small organisation to negotiate with a Minister of state really defies belief. This Government will go along with it. There are no rules for this Government. Forget accountability through the parliamentary process. It does not care about guillotining legislation, knocking off Question Time or curtailing proper debate. Just how much more of this abuse of the parliamentary process do the elected representatives of the people of Australia have to be subjected to? Let us look at the wording of the amendments which the Government has produced for the House of Representatives. Firstly, we notice that after subclause 16 (1) there will be a new subclause inserted, subclause (lA), which in some way only goes toward accommodating the concerns of the Opposition regarding States rights being affected by the proposed Resource Assessment Commission (RAC).Moreover, there is not sufficient detail given to the second major concern of the Opposition, on which we moved an amendment in the Senate, relating to confidentiality of matters and information produced before the Resource Assessment Commission. The Opposition believes that a Senate committee ought to undertake a proper examination of the Resource Assessment Commission. There are too many unanswered questions about it. I and the Opposition acknowledge that whilst we have a Labor Government so blatantly and unashamedly courting the extremist environmental vote, we have to, however reluctantly, accept the need for a Resource Assessment Commission. It is the only forum where the forestry industry as well as the mining, petroleum, farming and fishing industries, have any hope whatsoever of an objective, unemotional and rational examination of proposed projects. At the moment those industries have no future whatever because this Government is being led by the nose by those with the loudest voices. This is not a Government providing leadership or courage in decision making; it is a Government that will bow to the strongest, most publicised group in Australia. For that reason, on return to government the coalition would examine the RAC and perhaps radically restructure or even abolish it, because it has the potential, firstly, to infringe on States rights and, secondly, to add another layer of bureaucracy to decision making in this area. The point is that once we have Federal and, in some cases, State Labor governments, we have no choice but to acknowledge reality-that they are gutless in making all manner of decisions-and accept an RAC. But it has to be an RAC that even under the Government's desperation to appease the conservation movement has some semblance of reality and fairness. Quite frankly, the amendments transmitted to the House of Representatives-and we must bear in mind the short time, as always, that we have to debate them-do not meet thaL criterion, particularly in regard to proposed section 37 (3), where we learn that those who appear before the Resource Assessment Commission may well have their costs of preparing a submission, as well as their travel costs and associated costs of all kinds imaginable, paid by the taxpayer. The conservation movement argues that this would become a legalistic body, acting almost as a de facto Federal Court. That is rubbish, under both the terms of the legislation and its intent as expressed by the Government. Rather, the lawyers will be kept out of the RAC. Instead, the RAC will be operating like the Industries Assistance Commission, where the claims of both sides of the argument can be tested. At present, the extremist conservationists are not properly tested by the media and their submissions, however wild and unsubstantiated, are accepted holus bolus by this Government. But, at the final hurdle, the Government, has fallen. It has sought to. appease the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Democrats. Forgive me,-I should not even bother mentioning the Democrats. They bowed out of this; they handed it over to EmptyHere dedicated in representing the ACF, is not accountable to anywhere near the same extent as even a single member of this chamber. So, quite frankly, the Opposition is appalled at the procedure and process that has brought us to the point of this particular amendment, and the several others that amend the legislation in not so drastic terms. We reject out of hand the Government's refusal to refer the proposed RAC to a Senate committee-where, I stress, the RAC would not in any way be bogged down. There would have been a reporting date given, the first day of the spring session, and, certainly if I had anything to do with it, the Opposition would have been likely to accept the immediate institution of the RAe. But, instead, we have an RAC again weighted in favour of extremists. So the supposed victory of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy together with his junior Minister, Senator Cook, the Minister for Resources, against the seemingly monolithic power of the Minister .for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), has fallen somewhat short. It is a very hollow victory by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and Senator Cook, and I very much regret that. The losers in all this will, of course, be the Australian people as the Government digs a hole even deeper for our resource industries. There needs to be a balance between resource industries, naturally, and the environment. But we are not going to achieve that by drawing up a set of rules which will apply to the RAC so heavily weighted in favour of extremist conservationists. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reportedi report adopted. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Message received from the Senate acquainting the House that the Senate does not insist upon its amendment disagreed to by the House to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 15 August 1989, at 2 p.m., unless otherwise called together by Madam Speaker or, in the event of Madam Speaker being unavailable, by the Chairman of Committees. NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That leave of absence be given to every member of the House of Representatives from the determi·. nation of this sitting of the House to the date of its next sitting. House adjourned at 4.17 p.m. until Tuesday, 15 August 1989 at 2 p.m. in accordance with the resolution agreed to this ,day. NA The following paper was deemed to have been presented on 16 June 1989: Proclamation by His Excellency the Governor General fixing 30 June 1989 as the date on which section 15 of the Defence Service Homes Amendment Act 1988 shall come into operation. The following answers to questions were circulated: Treasury: Public Opinion Polls (Question No. 389) Mr Downer asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 5 November 1987: (I) What was the total sum spent by the Minister's entire portfolio on public opinion polls in the period covered by the 1986-87 Budget. (2) What was the objective of each of the opinion polls and what did each cost. (3) Who was commissioned to undertake each opinion poll. (4) Are the results of each opinion poll publicly available.",61
91,Mr KEATING ,PAPER,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department and the Australian Taxation Office are the only parts of the portfolio to incur expenditure on public opinion polls from 1986-87 budgetary allocations. The Department of the Treasury: (I) Part of a total project cost of $178,500 was allocated and spent on public opinion polls. (2) The project was directed towards; Quantitative and qualitative research .to measure understanding of the 29 October tax changes; (October-November 1986); Briefing of advertising agencies short listed in respect of an information campaign on Reform of the Australian Taxation System; Advice on selection of an agency to undertake the information campaign of Reform of the Australian Taxation System; Detailed briefing of the selected agency; Testing of preliminary and final concepts and copy; Three national telephone monitors to assess the impact and relevance of the information campaign on Reform of the Australian Taxation System; (November 1986-April 1987); The provisions of a benchmark and three monitor reports. (3) The public opinion poll was an extension of an earlier campaign concerning reforms of tax policy conducted over the previous two years. Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls (ANOP) was selected after tenders were called in March 1985 by the Information Coordination Branch of the then Department of Sport Recreation and Tourism and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. ANOP was NA requested in October 1986 to conduct further research into community understanding of the changes in tax policy and to advise the government and advertising firms accordingly. (4) No. The Australian Taxation Office; (I) $97,353. (2) To improve the level of service to taxpayers and agents by awareness of attitudes towards the tax system and the Tax Office. (3) The survey was undertaken by Reark Research Pty Ltd and was arranged by Hill and Knowlton Australia Pty Ltd. Hill and Knowlton were appointed as public relations consultants to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) after selection by the ATO in consultation with the Information Co-ordination Branch of the Department of Administrative Services. (4) No. Medicare Levy (Question No. 887) Mr Howard asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 19 April 1988: Does a (a) single-income earner on $32,060 per annum pay a Medicare levy of $400 per annum, (b) couple on $30,058 and $1,942, respectively, pay $375.72 and (c) couple on $26,900 and $5,100, respectively, pay $336.25; if so, why does the current method of calculating the Medicare levy mean that single-income earners and other taxpayers on the same income level but in different family circumstances pay different amounts of levy.",64
92,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Yes (b) Yes (c) Yes The Medicare levy, like the personal income tax system, is based on the taxable income of individuals who are residents of Australia for income tax purposes, subject to exemptions for low income earners. The income thresholds where liability for the Medicare levy commences free from the levy all those individuals with an equivalent income to holders of a Health Care Card or a Pensioner Health Benefits Card for the whole of the year. For 1988-89, individuals (regardless of marital status) with taxable incomes of $9,560 pa or less are not required to contribute towards Medicare. Similarly, married couples and sole parents with family income of $16,110 pa or less are not required to pay any Medicare levy; this threshold increases by $2, I00 for each dependent child or student. Accordingly, whether families and single taxpayers with the same level of income will have the same Medicare levy liability will depend on the apportionment of income between the income earners in the family and their respective liabilities for the Medicare levy on the basis described above. Distribution of Wealth (Question No. 1135) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 August 1988: . (I) What collections of probate information are made in each of the Australian States and territories. (2) What information do these collections provide about the distribution of wealth in Australia.",64
93,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) Each of the States and Territories maintains a probate registry of deceased persons on whose behalf probate has been granted on assets held in that State or Territory. These comprise files on each such individual and provide information on their estate in that particular State or Territory. However, I am advised that these files are not classified in terms of the size of estates, nor is the information .collected therein summarised in tabulated or aggregated form. Accordingly, I understand that they could not readily be used to estimate the distribution of wealth in Australia. The States and Territories no longer levy probate, estate or inheritance duties, these having been phased out and abolished between 1976 and 1984. Prior to the abolition of these duties, I understand that only the Victorian and Tasmanian State Governments collected information relating to duty payable in a form capable of providing an estimate of the distribution, by size, of estates in those States. However, given their narrow base, these data would be of limited use in assessing the distribution of wealth in Australia. International Monetary Fund: Compensatory Finance Facility (Question No. 1202) Mr Langmore as-ed the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 September 1988: (I) How does the Compensatory Finance Facility of the Internlltional Monetary Fund operate so as to offset the effects of deteriorating commodity priCes on developing countries. (2) What have been the results of the review of this facility. (3) What are the main features of the proposed Contingency Financing Facility and are (a) those features less generous in any way than current arrangements and (b) the proposed conditions of this facility to be more onerous in any way than for the Compensatory Finance Facility.",65
94,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I), (2) and (3) The Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been combined with new IMF financing for external contingencies to establish a single facility, the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF). The essential features of the CFF have been preserved. Compensatory financing remains available to IMF members, particularly primary commodity exporting countries, that are experiencing balance of payments difficulties resulting from shortfalls in export earnings or excesses in cereal import costs. Such events need to be seen as being temporary and largely beyond the member's control. The third element of the new facility, the contingency component, is designed to provide members pursuing Fund-supported adjustment programs with protection against adverse changes in external economic conditions. Contingency financing is intended to help maintain the momentum of adjustment programs in the face of adverse external shocks that are beyond the control of the member, through an appropriate blend of additional financing and adjustment. Contingency mechanisms are attached to Fund arrangements, and financing is provided to cover part of the net effect on a member's balance of payments of unanticipated movements in, for example, export earnings, import prices and interest rates. Other variables such as workers' remittances and tourist receipts can be covered where they are of particular importance. In designing the CCFF the IMF Executive Board recognised that the time-horizon of programs supported by the Fund has lengthened with the growing complexity of problems facing IMF members. In such circumstances, without appropriate arrangements, unpredictable shocks could endanger the successful implementation of Fund supported programs. The amount of financing available under the CCFF depends on the balance of payments position of the member and is subject to quite complex limits. Aggregate limits of 105 per cent of quota apply for drawings under any two of the three components of the facility and 122 per cent for drawings under all three components. Where a member has a satisfactory balance of payments position, apart from an export shortfall or an excess in cereal import costs, the limit of 83 per cc;:nt of quota has been retained for compensatory drawings for either of two components (subject to a combined access of 105 per cent of quota for the two elements). For members whose balance of payments problem is more serious and extends beyond these two factors, access limits are 40 per cent, 40 per cent and 17 per cent for contingency financing, export shortfall and cereal import costs components respectively, with scope to apply an optional tranche of 25 per cent of quota to supplement anyone of the three components to bring total access to a limit of 122 per cent of quota. For members with a balance of payments position which is satisfactory apart from the export shortfall, access to compensatory financing is dependent upon the member showing its willingness to cooperate with the Fund to solve its balance of payments problems (as was the case under the previous CFF arrangements). For members whose balance of payments problems go beyond the effects of an export shortfall, access to compensatory financing requires that the member agrees to find appropriate solutions to its balance of payments difficulties which underlie the request for financial assistance. A member satisfying this requirement is eligible to make an immediate purchase of up to 40 per cent of its quota for an export shortfall. For access over that limit, and up to a limit of 65 per cent of quota, a higher test of cooperation applies. If the member's cooperation with the Fund has not been satisfactory, or its policies are judged to be seriously deficient, a three-tier test of cooperation applies: the member can make drawings up to a limit of 20 per cent of quota on the basis of adequate prior actions; up to a limit of 40 per cent of quota on the basis of a program which meets the usual criteria for access to the upper credit tranches; and up to 65 per 'cent of quota on the basis of a review of such a program. International Monetary System (Question No. 1205) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 September. 1988: (I) Is he able to say what decisions were reached at the 13 April 1988 meeting of the Finance Ministers of - the Group of Seven major industrial countries on ways of improving the functioning of the international monetary system. (2) What dangers are there for Australia in such decisions being made at forums at which we are not represented. (3) What calls have been made by national leaders or international organisations for a more comprehensive international conference on aspects of international financial reform. (4) Would there be value for Australia in such a conference at which we would be a participant.",65
95,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the seven major industrial countries met on 13 April 1988 to conduct multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the economic policy coordination process adopted at the 1986 Tokyo Summit and strengthened at the 1987 Venice Summit. The prime focus of the ongoing coordination process has been the development of appropriate macroeconomic indicators and general strengthening of surveillance mechanisms and consultation arrangements among the G7 economies. The intensification of policy coordination among the major industrial countries as reaffirmed in the G7 communique of 13 April 1988 is a key element in the efforts to promote stability in financial markets and to sustain growth throughout the world economy. (2) The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) attends meetings of the G7 Ministers and Governors and has the opportunity to speak in the broader interests of the global economy, including Australia. To some extent, therefore, Australia and other countries not directly involved in the decisions on policy coordination must rely on the interventions of the IMF. It is also relevant that decisions within G7 and other restricted groups do no occur in isolation; rather, the underlying issues tend to be the subject of on-going dialogues in a number of fora, including (in particular) the IMF. One of the principal functions of the IMF is to act as a permanent in'stitution in which member countries examine each other's economic policies and the functioning of the world economy. Prospects for the world economy and the interaction of policies among countries are reviewed regularly by the IMF's Executive Board and subsequently by the IMF Interim Committee. Th-e reviews are based on the IMF's World Economic Outlook Report, which contains a comprehensive analysis of short-term and medium-term prospects for the world economy, as well as for the economies of individual Fund members and country groupings. In addition to establishing a global context for the surveillance that is conducted in periodic Article IV Consultations with individual member countries, the World Economic Outlook exercise provides a basis for identifying potential economic conflicts and tensions that may arise among countries. (3) and (4) While they attracted some popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s, calls for a comprehensive international conference on reform of the international monetary system do not now attract widespread support. It is not apparent that such a conference would represent any improvement on current procedures for llddressing this whole issue. Debt Distressed LoW Income Countries (Question No. 1206) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 September 1988: ( 1) What sum of official debt or official guarantees of private debt to each debt distressed low-income country does Australia have. (2) Is he able to say for what policies has the Development Committee of the World Bank called in relation to interest rates reductions on official reschedulings or alternate measures having a similar impact. (3) Does Australia provide the assistance agreed to by the Development Committee to those countries. (4) Did Australia provide such assistance to Egypt and Iraq in their recent re-schedulings. (5) What interest rate was charged to those countries.",66
96,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am advised that, as at 30 June 1988, Australia had $180 million outstanding (excluding shortterm exposures) in officially insured export credits and export finance loans to debt distressed lowincome countries (defined as coun-ries that are currently eligible for access to concessional financing from the World Bank's soft-loan arm, the International Development Association, and have debt-service commitments that are large in relation to export receipts). Country-specific data for such exposures are regarded as commercial-in-confidence and are not publicly available. Australia has not official development assistimce loans outstanding, our aid to developing countries being provided wholly in grant form. (2) The official communique of the April 1988 meeting of the IMF /World Bank Development Committee recognised that additional efforts were required to ease the burdens and support the adjustment efforts of many debt-distressed, low-income countries and urged creditors and debtors to consider measures to this end, including, where possible, interest rate reductions in official reschedulings or alternative measures having a similar impact. Discussions were then under way in the group of official creditor countries known as the Paris Club on proposals to provide additional distressed, low-income countries in the rescheduling of medium term official and officially-guaranteed export credits. Paris Club creditors agreed in November 1988 that, in rescheduling such credits for the poorest, most debt-distressed Sub-Saharan African countries undertaking appropriate economic adjustment measures, they would consider, on a case-by-case basis, providing additional assistance by choosing one or a - combination of the following options: (a) write off one-third of the debt-service obligashareholders tions to be consolidated, with the debt-service remaining due (retaining market interest rates) being repaid over 14 years, including an 8 year grace period; (b) consolidate at market interest rates, with a maturity period of 25 years, including a 14 year grace period; (c) consolidate at a preferential interest rate (the market rate reduced by the lesser of 3.5 percentage points or 50 per cent), with a maturity period of 14 years including an 8 year grace period. Previously, the Paris Club had agreed rescheduling terms for some debt-distressed, low-income countries involving an extended 20 year repayment period at market interest rates. The new arrangements are designed to provide additional relief to eligible debtor countries while ensuring adequate comparability of treatment of creditor countries. (3) No. Australia will provide assistance to debtor countries under the 'menu' approach agreed by the Paris Club where: the country concerned seeks a Paris Club rescheduling and the Paris Club agrees that the country is eligible for assistance under the 'menu' approach; and any amounts owed to Australia by the country are included within the terms of the multilateral rescheduling. (4) No. Bilateral rescheduling agreements with Egypt and Iraq were concluded before the 'menu' arrangements were put in place. Egypt and Iraq would not, in any event, qualify for additional assistance under the arrangements which are intended to apply to the poorest, most debt-distressed countries. (5) Interest payments arrangements are on a proper commercial basis. Goldmining Companies (Question No. 1393) Mr Cobb asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 November 1988: (1) How many gold mining companies are (a) registered in Australia and (b) listed on Australian assistance to debt- stock exchanges; (2) How many of those gold mining companies declare profits and what is the total sum of those profits; (3) How many of the listed companies pay dividends; ( 4) What is the total sum of profits paid in the form of dividends and what percentage of profits do those dividends represent; (5) What difference would it make to Australian if those companies had to pay company tax and fully frank their dividend payments; and (6) What difference would it make to both overseas owners and shareholders if company tax has to be paid.",67
97,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) to (4) The information sought is quite detailed and is not readily available. Particular problems arise because a number of companies engage in gold mining as well as other activities. Considerable resources would need to be marshalled to assemble the information requested and I am not prepared to divert those resources from other more urgent tasks for this purpose. (5) The effect on Australian shareholders of the imposition of company tax on gold mining companies will depend on those companies' dividend payout ratio, whether that ratio is changed, and the taxation status of the shareholder. .If the companies currently payout their profits as dividends, then, in most cases, no change should occur in the after-tax dividend income of individual and institutional shareholders. At present, dividends paid to such shareholders are taxed in the shareholders' hands at their marginal tax rates. When company tax on gold mining companies is introduced, such shareholders will receive an imputation credit for company tax already paid on company income underlying their dividend. If the company tax rate exceeds the shareholder's marginal rate, the excess imputation credit can be used to offset tax on the shareholder's other income. The imposition of company tax will in this case generally not change the amount of tax paid on income paid as dividends to shareholders of gold mining companies. Only the point at which tax is charged will change. An exception to this result applies where the shareholder cannot fully utilise the imputation credit. In this case, an increase in tax equal to the unutilised credit would arise. This general result for resident individual and institutional (ie life offices, unit trusts and superannuation funds) shareholders will also apply to dividends received by private companies. Where dividends are received by public companies, the company tax applying to the gold. mining company represents a new layer of tax, but the resulting imputation credits may be' utilised by the dividendreceiving company to frank its own dividends in subsequent distributions. Where the shareholder is a resident tax-exempt entity, imputation credits will be unable to be utilised. Accordingly, the imposition of company tax represents a final tax in this case. The effect is different where companies retain profits. At present, by retaining profits a gold mining company can increase its share price and produce capital gains for its shareholders. If the shareholder purchased shares on or before 19 September 1985, no capital gains tax is payable when the shareholder disposes of those shares; if the shareholder purchased the shares after 19 September 1985, then only the non-inflationary or real component of capital gains would be taxed when the shares are sold. Shareholders clearly benefit from a return in the form of a capital gain rather than a dividend, thus encouraging gold mining companies, in the absence of company tax, to retain most of their profits rather than distribute them as dividends. This has the effect both of reducing tax and of deferring its payment. In this case, the imposition of company tax will represent an increase in tax payable, and a reduction in tax deferral opportunities. (6) In the absence of company tax on gold mining companies, the only Australian taxes paid by foreign investors would be dividend withholding tax of 15 per cent (30 per cent if the investor resides in a country with which Australia does not have a double tax agreement) and, if the investor owned more than 10 per cent of the company, capital gains tax. The effect on overseas investors of the imposition of company tax on gold mining companies will depend on the tax treatment of the investor's Australian income in the investor's home country. Where the foreign country operates a foreign tax credit system, the imposition of Australian company tax may, in some cases, increase the investor's credit given for Australian taxes paid and thus reduce tax on that income in the investor's home country. This will generally only apply, however, where the foreign shareholder has a substantial interest in the Australian company. The imposition of company tax in Australia in such cases would shift tax revenue from foreign governments to the Australian Government without increasing the overall level of tax paid. In respect of countries without foreign tax credit systems, the imposition of Australian company tax would increase taxes paid by the investor, rather than merely shift where taxes are paid. This may also apply to portfolio shareholders in countries utilising a foreign tax credit system. Perth Airport (Question No. 1443) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 1 December 1988: (I) Is there a master plan for the development of Perth Airport; is so, (a) who prepared the plan, (b) will she supply a copy of it to me and (c) is it still current. (2) Was land at Newburn resumed to provide for a parallel runway; if so, who now controls the land. (3) Is it proposed that this land be transferred to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). (4) Has arty Government department or instrumentality applied for the re-zoning of land resumed for airport development; if so, (a) what are the details for that application, (b) what re-zoning is sought and (c) does this re-zoning mean that the original use proposed for the land will not be pursued. (5) Has the FAC recently negotiated new leases for the development of domestic terminals at Perth airport. (6) In terms of the potential development at Perth Airport, will those leases restrict the development of additional runways or taxiways. (7) Are those leases consistent with the long term development planned for the airport; if not, why not. (8) Will she provide details including site maps of the terminal lease areas and their location with respect to existing facilities and proposed or potential facilities. . (9) Is it proposed to extend further the east or west runway; if so, does this runway take flights over the central residential area of Belmont. (10) Is it proposed to develop a parallel runway. (II) Are developments on FAC land subject to development applications of the local government authority, building permits and the payment of other fees.",67
98,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The .answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (a) the former Department of Aviation; (b) the Perth Airport General Manager can supply a copy; (c) Yes. (2) Yes; the Department of Administrative Services. (3) The issue of ownership of this land is now under discussion between FAC and DAS. (4) Commonwealth land is not subject to zoning requirements. \ (5) No. The leases were negotiated by the Department before the airport was transferred to the FAC. (6) No. (7) Yes. (8) Site plans of the terminal lease location with respect to existing and proposed facilities can be prepared. (9) Apart from the main runway, Perth airport has two aqditional runways. One runs east-west (11/ 29), the other northeast-south-west (06/24). The Mlister Plan makes no provision for extension of the 11/29 runway. Although the Plan provides for a north easterly extension of the 06/24 runway, there are no early or medium term plans for such extensions. The 06/24 runway is used mainly for landings from the northeast. Under noise abatement procedures, take-offs to the south-west over Belmont are severely restricted and this would continue to be the case. (10) The Master Plan provides the option of constructing a parallel runway when commercial and EmptyHere immediate plans to construct such a runway. (II) Developments on FAC land are not subject to local authority approvals, permits or associated fees. Sydney Airport (Question No. 1485) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Does a 747 aircraft flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Sydney have to carry additional fuel, equal to the weight of 50 passengers, to allow for the delay over Sydney because of congestion at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. . (2) Has Australian Airlines estimated the cost of delays at the airport. (3) Is the estimate $8-$lOm per annum; if not, what is the estimate. (4) Has the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) considered raising landing charges at the airport to the point where international airlines are forced to use Melbourne and Brisbane airports; if so, (a) when was this consideration given, (b) what are the details of the charges proposed and (c) is the proposal to be implemented. (5) Has the FAC introduced landing charges designed to discourage use of the airport by aircraft under 5700 kg; if so, (a) what are those charges, (b) what aircraft are affected, (c) when were those charges implemented and (d) is it proposed to monitor the impact of those charges on traffic at the airport. (6) Was it proposed that those charges should be extended to other types of aircraft; is so, what aircraft were considered. (7) Will the Government give an unequivocal commitment that it will not support any policy that limits or restricts access to the airport by commuter aircraft; if not, why not.",69
99,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable areas and their member's question is as follows: (I) Priority A aircraft (which includes airliners) arriving at Sydney are currently required to carry either 10, 20 or 30 minutes traffic holding fuel, depending on the time of arrival. For a Boeing 747, 30 minutes holding fuel weighs about 4700 kg, which is roughly equivalent to the weight of 50 passengers. Two operators, Qantas and United Airlines, have been granted an exemption from this particular requirement in that aircraft on non-stop flights from the USA to Sydney need carry only ten minutes traffic holding fuel, equivalent to the weight of about 17 passengers. These are the only operators currently flying the direct service. (2) Australian Airlines has estimated the cost to the airline of delays at Sydney Airport. This includes delays due to air traffic congestion and bad weather conditions.· (3) Based on the seven month period ending 31 January 1989, Australian Airlines estimated the cost per annum of these delays to be around $7 million. (4) No. (a) Not applicable. (b) Not applicable. (5) Yes. (a), (b), (c). On I April 1989 the Corporation introduced a minimum fee of $200 . per landing for fixed wing general aviation aircraft at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport during peak periods which occur each day between 7.30 am and 10.00 am and between 4.30 pm and 7.00 pm. (d) The system will be monitored to determine the effects on the pattern of arriving aircraft during the peak periods. (6) No. (7) The question of access to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is currently being addressed by a review of traffic management arrangements. The recommendations of this review will be considered by the Government in due course. Airports: Radar Facilities (Question No. 1488) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (1) What radar facilities operate at (a) Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and (b) other capital city airports. (2) When were those facilities installed. (3) What plans are there to upgrade those facilities. (4) How many incidents of failure or malfunction occurred with each individual radar system each year since 1983 at (a) Sydney and (b) other capital city airports, and in each case, what was the (i) cause and (ii) duration of each failure or malfunction. Mrs KellyThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are Route Surveillance Radars (RSR) at Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney Airports which provide Radar coverage out to a maximum of 160 nautical miles. There are similar sensors located at The Round Mountain and Mount Majura, the latter providing radar coverage to Canberra Airport. Terminal Area Radars (TAR) which have a normal operating range of 50 nautical miles are provided at Melbourne and Sydney Airports. Brisbane Airport has a new Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) which, wh-n commissioned, could be used for both Terminal Area and Route Surveillance purposes. A medium range radar provided and maintained by the Department of Defence at Darwin Airport is used by the Civil Aviation Authority for air traffic control within 80 nautical miles of the airport. Hobart Airport is not equipped with radar facilities. The RSR and TAR sensOrS provide signals to integrated radar displays used for Air Traffic Control. At Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, the radar displays are the modern Air Traffic Control Autonomous Radar Display Systems (ATCARDS), whilst the Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra displays are the older Thompson-CSF Bright Display System. (2) The radar sensor facilities were installed in the following years:Sydney RSR 1963 Sydney TAR 1971 Melbourne RSR 1965 Melbourne TAR 1972 Brisbane RSR 1963 Brisbane TAR 1988 Adelaide RSR 1963 Perth RSR 1968 Canberra RSR 1969 The current radar display systems were installed in the following years:Sydney 1971 Melbourne 1988 Brisbane 1969 Adelaide 1987 . Perth 1987 (3) Except for the modern Brisbane Monopulse SSR, the CAA plans to replace all the above-mentioned Radar sensors within the next 4-5 years under its Radar Sensor Procurement Plan (RASPP). ATCARDS, being a modern software based system, is able to be 'upgraded' throughout its service life of 15-20 years to meet changed operational requirements and to ensure maintainability. The Bright Displays at Brisbane, Sydney and Canberra are planned to be replaced early in the 1990's with modern radar displays. (4) Radar facilities operated by CAA are complex systems deriving raw radar data from a number of radar sensors and processing this for presentation to Air Traffic Control. Systems. are designed using duplicate equipment and mUltiple sources of radar data to minimise the impact on overall radar performance of a malfunction in one element of the system. In general an equipment malfunction does not result in system failure but in some cases can lead to a reduction in functional capability until the fault is rectified. The radar service in Sydney is known to have failed totally on two recent occasions due to primary power short term interruptions to radar programs of approximately \0 minutes total duration on 6 and 9 September 1988. A more detailed response for Sydney and other locations in the form requested by Mr Blunt. is not possible at this time. The analysis of performance data is an extremely labour intensive and costly exercise because of the complexity of the system and would require scarce staff resources to be diverted from other more essential duties. Taxation Deductions for Donations (Question No. 1505) Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (1) For the last year for which figures are available what was the (a) total sum of donations chtimed and (b) estimated cost to revenue, under sub-section 78 (I) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. (2) Can the figures referred to in part (I) be detailed further on the basis of the types of recipients.",69
100,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) and (b) The available income tax statistics relate to deductions for gifts allowed to individual taxpayers and do not include. amounts of donations by business for charitable purposes which can be shown to be in the nature of business outgoings and which may, therefore, be allowed under section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The extent to which such gifts may be allowed as business expenses is not known. Based on the available statistics for the 1986-87 income year the sum of deductions allowed under section 78 (I) and the estimated cost to revenue was $325m and $141m respectively. (2) The available data by type of recipient is as follows: Recipient Amount of Estimated Overseas Aid Funds. . School Building Funds . Other Public Institutions Total Senior Executive Service (Question No. 1520) Mr Reith asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Will the Minister identify each Senior Executive Service or equivalent position within the Minister's department or a\lthorities responsible to him which has been reclassified since I July 1988 and to which the occupant has been reappointed, indicating in each case (a) resultant increases in salary and other entitlemerits and (b) whether or not the reappointment followed normal selection procedures. (2) On what basis is it claimed that the reclassifii!ations conform With the national wage fixing ciples. (3) How many Senior Executive Service or equivalent positions are there within the Minister's portfolio.",71
101,Mr HOLDING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) No Senior Executive Service (SES) or equivalent positions were reclassified. It should be noted, however, that following approval from the Minister for Finance on 15 March 1988 the top structure of my Department was reorganised. The reorganisation within the Department, .not including the ACT Administration, involved the abolition of 20 SES level I positions and the creatiOri of 17 SES level 2 positions and the abolition of 8 SES level 3 positions and the creation of 6 SES level 4 positions. All positions were advertised and subject to merit selection. A number of officers occupying positions. that were abolished were successful in gaining promotion to the new positions. The ACT Administration was reorganised on a similar basis. (2) National wage fixing principles were fully observed in establishing the new structure.

(2) What are the details of those charges. (3) Why have those charges been introduced. (4) What is the estimate of the additional revenue this schedule of charges will generate. (5) Will those charges result in additional air traffic for Bankstown Airport; if so, is this the Government's intention. (6) What is the current level of traffic on a monthly and annual basis for Bankstown Airport. (7) What air traffic control procedures are adopted at Bankstown. (8) Are the taxiways at Bankstown Airport adeprinquate for the current level of traffic. (9) Are delays experienced when aircraft seek to cross active runways. (10) Is any consideration being given to the construction of additional taxiways at Bankstown Airport. (II) Would a new taxiway at the eastern end of the runway complex reduce delays; if so, (a) has the feasibility of its construction been investigated, (b) what would the cost be for its construction and (c) are there any plans to construct this facility.",71
102,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. A new schedule of charges was introduced on I April 1989. (2) Airports owned by the Federal Airports Corporation are divided into three groups for charging purposes. Sydney (KS) Airport falls into Group One, charging details of which are as follows: Level General Rate' $5.00 per 1,000 kg Maximum TakeOff Weight (MTOW) (pro-rata) Domestic Rate: $5.75 per 1,000 kg MTOW (prorata) This rate applies only to aircraft weighing more than 45,000 kg MTOW operated on domestic services by Ansett or Australian Airlines. All other aircraft pay the general rate of landing charge. Minimum Charges: General Aviation Aircraft-$25.00 per landing at any Group One Airport,other than landings at Sydney in the morning and evening peak periods. $200.00 per landing at Sydney Airport during peak periods, which occur each day between 7.30 a.m. and 10.00 a.m. in the morning and between 4.30 p.m. and 7.00 p.m. in the evening. Regular Public Transport-Aircraft $25.00 per landing (including Supplementary Airlines) Discounts: 50% for helicopters. Peak period charge at Sydney does not apply to helicopters. Application Landing charges apply to all landings at Sydney (KS) Airport. (3) To reHect the general increase in the CPI and to encourage light fixed wing general aviation aircraft to move out of the busy peak periods. (4) $3.35 million. (5) It is possible that the increased charges at Sydney (KS) Airport will result in additional air traffic at Bankstown Airport. It is the Government's objective to reduce congestion at Sydney (KS) Airport. (6) The average monthly number of aircraft movements at Bankstown Airport is approximately Airport Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Perth Hobart/Cambridge. Launceston Coolangatta Essendon . Archerfield Bankstown 33,475 movements. In 1988 there were 401,701 movements recorded. (7) There is a control tower at Bankslown and air traffic control in operation. Details of General Aviation Airport Procedures (GAAP) can be found in the Aeronautical Information Publication (AlP) and the visual Hight guide (VFG) which are available from the CAA. (8) Yes. However, in periods of high demand, some delays occur. (9) Extensive delays do not generally occur except when there is abnormally high demand for runway use. (10) and (II) The Federal Airports Corporation has under consideration the construction of additional taxiways at Bankstown Airport, including the feasibility of a new taxiway at the eastern end of the runway complex to reduce delays. The estimated cost of these works would be in excess of $1 million. General Aviation Charges (Question No. 1532) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon, notice, on.28 February 1989: (I) What will be the impact on revenue (a) in total and (b) at each affected Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) airport, of the new General Aviation charges to be introduced by the FAC from I April 1989. (2) What is the projected impact on revenue (a) in total and (b) at each FAC airport, by category of charge.",72
103,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) The Federal Airports Corporation introduced new aeronautical charges at all its airports, effective on I April 1989. Two of the new charges specifically affected general aviation aircraft. Those charges were the General Aviation Infrastructure Tariff (GAIT) and parking chargeS on general aviation aircraft at primary airports. The total revenue from those two charges in 1989/90 is estimated to be $1,565,300. The following table shows the impact of the new charges by airport and by category of charge: Revenue from Revenue from Total GAIT charge parking charge revenue $ $ $ 150,000 150,000 100,000 100,000 75,000 75,000 50,000 50,000 50,000 50,000 20,000 25,000 ' 45,000 115,000 115,000 43,000 43,000 165,500 165,500 100,000 100,000 225,000 225,000 Airport Moorabbin Parafi""ld Jandakot . Total Note: Data is unavailable in regard to additional Flight Crew: Breaches of Alcohol (Question No. 1540) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Since 1979, how many cases have there been of pilots of flight crew in Australia flying in breach of ANR 247 relating to flying whilst under the influence of alcohol. (2) In each case what was the penalty imposed.",72
104,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There have been ten cases detected of flight crew flying in breach of the former Air Navigation Regulation 247 (now Civil Aviation Regulation 256) since 1979. (2) The penalty in each case since 1979 where legal action was taken was: Fine $500 2 Fine (amount not recorded) Fine $2000 I Fine $150 I Fine 750 I Fine $2500 Two months imprisonment Available records are not detailed and some penalties may have been imposed for a number of offences, including those that are alcohol-related, arising from the same incident. Suspension of a licence, or other action which prevents a pilot' from flying, is an action in the interests of air safety, not a penalty imposed on the individual. In this regard action was taken in eight of the above cases to suspend or cancel the pilot's licence. In two other cases pilots employed by major airlines were suspended from duty and required to attend company drug rehabilitation programs. Tobacco Products (Question No. 1623) Mr Scholes asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 6 March 1989: Does the inclusion of tobacco products in the Consumer Price Index act as a disincentive to the use of punitive financial measures to discourage smoking; if so, will he examine the justification for Revenue from Revenue from Total GAIT charge parking charge revenue $ $ $ 214,600 214,600 130,000 130,000 102,200 102,200 1,115,300 450,000 1,565,300 airports transferred to the FAC on I April 1989. t-is practice in the light of Government policies to Regulations dIscourage use of tobacco products.",73
105,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The inclusion of tobacco products in the CPI does not constitute a significant dC(terrent to the use of punitive measures to discourage smoking. Tobacco products currently have a weight of 2.3 per cent in the CPI. A 10 per cent increase in the Commonwealth excise on an average packet of cigarettes would increase the CPI by .less than one tenth of one percentage point. The CPI seeks to measure changes over time in the retail prices of a constant basket of consumer goods and services. This basket of goods arid services is determined by the spending patterns of households. As tobacco products account for part of this spending, it would be inappropriate to remove them from the CPI. United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Question No. 1643)",73
106,Mr J,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"angmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 7 March 1989: (I) Was Australia represented at the recent United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) meeting in Cote d'Ivo,ire which considered cooperation and standards in the production and use of fertilisers and pesticides. (2) Is Allstralia able to use these' meetings to enhance our exports of agricultural inputs. (3) Is Australia able to benefit from participation in the determination of international standards for industrial production and use. (4) How will Australia's decision to withdraw from UNIDO affect our ability to participate in these opportunities to expand our exports and contribute to the establishment of international standards.",73
107,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The matters addressed in this question fall within the portfolio responsibilities of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. It would therefore be appropriate to address the question to that Minister. World Bank: Power Sector Loan (Question No. 1644) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 7 March 1989: (I) Does Australia support the delay of the World Bank's power sector loan while concerns continue that the proceeds might be used to finance nuclear power generation. (2) If so, what is Australia doing to support this delay.",73
108,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The World Bank has decided not to proceed with its Power Sector II Loan to Brazil. Instead, the Bank has proposed a package of loans including two project loans covering electricity transmission, distribution and conservation, and an energy-environment policy and conservation loan. Components of the latter would include energy environmental programs comprising an environmental master plan, an environmental action plan and support for energy conservation measures. This proposed adjustment operation would be based on written undertakings by the Brazilian Government to carry out policy changes and specific actions relating to energy conservation. Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (Question No. 1659) Mr Macphee asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 8 March 1989: (I) What funding has the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) received for the years 1982-88. (2) Has the current Chairman of the ABT, on a number of occasions, requested additional funds so that the ABT can discharge its statutory obligations effectively. (3) Has the outstanding number of media ownership transactions yet to be heard before the ABT and the added responsibilities resulting from the Government's media ownership changes to 1987 affected the ABT's ability to discharge its role effectively; if so, (a) will the 'ABT receive additional funds and (b) when. (4) If the ABT will not receive additional funds, why not.",74
109,Mr WILLIS ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Funding for the ABT over the years 1981-82 to 1988-89 is given in the following table. Year 1981-82 . 1982-83 . 1983-84 . Funds Year expended 1984-85 . 6,021,000 1985-86 . 6,924,000 1986-87 . 7,316,000 1987-88 . 8,023,000 1988-89 . 10,014,000 The Budget for 1988-89 includes funds of $1,162,000 to cover the costs of relocating the Tribunal's Melbourne based functions to Sydney. When this amount is removed, actual expenditure for 1988-89 is expected to amount to $8,852,000. (2) Yes. (3) The Government has recognised that there has been an increase in the ABT's workload and that the media ownership changes of 1987 have contributed to this. (a) The Government has agreed to provide additional funding of $1,007,000 in the 1988-89 financial year. The Tribunal has also sought expanded funding for 1989-90 and a decision on this will be made in the Budget context. (b) (See 3 (a» (4) (Refer 3 (a» Iran (Question No. 1660) Mr Kent asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 9 March 1989: (I) Which Australian companies are currently operating within Iran? (2) Is he able to say what is the nature of their business in Iran? Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I have referred the honourable member's question to the Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE). I am advised that, there are many companies who are trading with Iran only some of whom are AUSTRADE's clients. These companies in dealing with AUSTRADE provide details of their activities in the market on the basis it is for background information only and that it will not be divulged. However, I am aware of two Australian organisations who have established offices within Iran-Elders and ANZ (Grindlays). You may also be interested to know that Australia's total exports to Iran in 1987/88 amounted to $375.7 million-an increase of Funds over 9 per cent on the previous year. Our major expended exports to Iran are: wheat, iron and steel, butter, 4,022,000 coking coal, barley and meat. 3,906,000 Although Australia's exports to Iran increased in 4,650,000 the last financial year, AUSTRADE has forecast a lower level of exports (under $300M) in 1988/89. The decrease in trade this year is due to a number of factors, however it is anticipated to be only short term. The country's essential needs for basic foodstuffs, raw materials, industrial feedstock and specialist manufactures, together with the emphasis Iran will place on equipment and expertise for agricultural reconstruction, will provide a solid basis for Australia to push our exports to over $400 million in 1989/90. South East Asia Industry Mission (Question No. 1661) Mr Smith asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 9 March 1989: (1) How many officers from the Minister's Department were included in the South East Asia Industry Mission (SEAIM) between 24 November and 9 December 1988. (2) What was the cost to the Minister's Department of (a) their travel, (b) their accommodation and (c) publicity material. (3) Is the Minister able to advise what funding for the SEAIM joint venture was provided by (a) Austrade and (b) industry. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No officers from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce were included in the South East Asia Industry Mission. However, one officer from the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) was included. (2) The cost to Austrade was (a) travel $4455 (b) accommodation $3593.30 (c) nil (3) (a) Austrade allocated $10,500 towards the cost of mounting the SEAIM Mission. (b) Industry members including the Office of Defence Production contributed $32,000 towards the costs of mounting the SEAIM Mission. These funds contributed to the costs of travel and accommodation for the Mission leader Major General Coates A.O., promotional literature and Austrade services in each of the countries visited. Treasury: Security Checks of Staff (Question No. 1684) Mr John Scott asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (1) Does the Minister's Department and any authority responsible to the Minister have any, requirement to conduct security checks of its staff; if so, are security checks carried out by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). (2) If security checks are required and are not undertaken by ASIO, (a) by whom are they carried out and (b) does a review procedure equivalent to that contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act apply to such checks; if not why not.",74
110,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Yes, for all agencies except the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. Security checks, for the purpose of assessing a person's suitability for a security clearance, are conducted on people selected to occupy designated security assessment positions (DSAPS) or positions of trust (POTS) and on appointment. Requests to ASIO to provide a security assessment forms part of the security clearance process for DSAPS-ie where access is required to national security information classified confidential and above, or to secure areas. For positions of trust, the Commonwealth Personnel Management Manual requires the Department/ Agency to assess the general suitability of persons to occupy a position which may allow the occupant access to sensitive, non-national security or to valuable assets. The process involves: A check of the person's identity. Requesting a check of police records. An assessment of the person's loyalty, trustworthiness, reliability and character. An ASIO security assessment is not required for POTS. For DSAPS, in addition to the above requirement for POTS, the Commonwealth's' Protective Security Manual and Personnel Assessment Manual require that a security assessment be requested from ASIO, but only after the Departmental Secretary/Agency Head is satisfied as to a person's general suitability to occupy a DSAP. Where it is determined that, on general suitability grounds, a person is unsuitable to occupy a DSAP a decision is taken to cease further clearance action and a security assessment is not sought from ASIO. Where a Departmental Secretary/Agency Head decides not to grant a security clearance, or ceases further clearance action based on general suitability grounds, the following avenues of appeal are available: Under Division 3, Part III of the Public Service Regulations; The Merit Protection Review Agency for Commonwealth employees; and The Commonwealth Ombudsman for Non-Commonwealth employees. Department of Community Services and Health: Security Checks of Staff (Question No. 1692) Mr John Scott asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Does the Minister's Department and any authority responsible to the Minister have any requirement to conduct security checks on its staff; if so, are security checks carried out by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). (2) If security checks are required and are not undertaken by ASIO, (a) by whom are they carried out and (b) does a review procedure equivalent to that contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act apply to such checks; if not, why not.",75
111,Dr BLEWETT ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. Security checks, for the purpose of assessing a person's suitability for a security clearance, are conducted within the portfolio where access is required to National Security Information classified Confidential and above, or to secure areas. A security check by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) forms part of the security clearance process. (2) My Department's security checks are always undertaken by ASIO. Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories: Security Checks of Staff (Question No. 1693) Mr John Scott asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Does the Minister's Department and any authority responsible to the Minister have any requirement to conduct security checks of its staff; if so, are security checks carried out by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). (2) If security checks are required and are not undertaken by ASIO, (a) by whom are they carried out and (b) does a review procedure equivalent to that contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act apply to such checks; if not, why not.",76

For DSAPS, a security assessment from ASIO is required to be sought, but only after the Departmental Secretary/Agency head is satisfied as to the person's general suitability to occupy a DSAP. If he is not satisfied, further clearance action is' not pursued and ASIO is not involved. (2) (b) Where, a Departmental Secretary/Agency head decides not to grant a security clearance, or ceases further clearance action, the following avenues of appeal are available: under Division 3, Part III of the Public Service Regulations the Merit Protection Review Agency for Commonwealth employees; and I the Commonwealth Ombudsman for non-Com­ monwealth employees. Crayfish (Question No. 1721) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, upon notice, on 5 April 1989: (I) What are the (a) names of companies importing crayfish and (b) the quantity imported by each of them during the last year. (2) What companies are known to have reexported imported crayfish under a Western Australian product label. Mr Barry Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Your request for the names of importers of crayfish cannot be met because of the limitations imposed on the disclosure of confidential information by Section 16 of the Customs Administration Act .1985. However, I am able to inform you that over the last twelve (12) months there were five (5) companies which imported a total of 19.42 tonnes of lobster into Western Australia. Lobster is the Customs Tariff description which inCludes crayfish. (2) The Australian Customs Service has no knowledge of the alleged mislabelling of imported crayfish but statutory responsibility over the trade description of exported crustaceans rests with the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service under the Export Control Act. Any crustacean that undergoes any processing or re-Iabelling after being imported requires the issue of a permit by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy before re-export. International Council of Monuments and (Question No. 1729) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for the Arts and Territories, upon notice, on 5 April 1989: (I) When was the International Council of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) established and when did Australia join it.

IUCN has not taken a decision on a location as yet. The issue will be discussed at the next meeting of Council, to be held in June 1989. Some interest has been expressed in Australia hosting the next Assembly. Representation of Australia as the State Member at the next IUCN Assembly has not yet been determined. Ms Eiser will participate at the June 89 Council meeting at Gland. TuUamarine Airport: Public Seating (Question No. 1751) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 11 April 1989: Is it proposed to purchase new public seating for terminals at Tullamarine Airport; if so, (a) will it be acquired from an Australian producer or from overseas, (b) what will be its cost and (c) if the seating is to be acquired from an overseas supplier, were Australian suppliers considered. Mrs KeUy-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has advised that the International Concourses and Departures Hall at Tullamarine are being refurbished, and that new furniture will be purchased as part of this process. (a) to (c) No decision has been made on the supplier, country of origin, or cost of the furniture, as tenders for the purchase have not yet been called. Civil Aviation Authority: Head Office (Question No. 1753) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 10 April 1989: Level of Representation Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany and officers of the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment Ambassador to Mexico and officers of the Department"" of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (1) Where is the Head Office of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in Canberra. (2) What other buildings are occupied by the CAA in Canberra. (3) When was the decision taken to purchase a building in Canberra for the CAA. (4) What (a) was the cost of the building, (b) will be the cost of fitting out the building, and (c) will be the cost of relocation. (5) Why does the CAA consider it more appropriate to own a building than to lease space. (6) What will be the impact of financing the building on CAA finances.",77
115,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Head Office of the CAA occupies space in the following major office buildings in Civic, ACT: Civic Advance Bank Building, Allara Street Custom Credit House, Akuna Street Wales Centre, Akuna Street Scott House, The Boulevard (2) The CAA also occupies space in the following buildings: Cooleman Court, Weston Deakin Offices, Deakin GlO Building, Braddon Wales Street, Belconnen Natwest House, Civic ,Various buildings on Canberra Airport. (3) The decision to acquire the National Convention Centre Building No. 6 was taken by the CAA Board on 15 February 1989. (4) (a) The purchase price for the building was $49,331,000. (b) The fitout of the building is subject to both consultation with unions and commercial evaluation of fitout options. It is expected to cost about $10,500,000. (c) The cost of transferring staff to the new building is estimated to be about $150,000. Costs associated with the relinquishment of existing leases are still subject to commercial negotiation. (5) The accommodation presently occupied by the Canberra functions of the CAA is dispersed over a number of buildings, is functionally inefficient, is of a poor standard and is in urgent need of major refurbishment. Purchase of a new single building to satisfy the majority of its accommodation needs in Canberra, instead of embarking on a major refurbishment program and continuing to lease, provides the Authority with considerable long term economic benefit. (6) Acquisition of the National Convention Centre Building No. 6 by the Authority was a commercial investment decision and, as such, represented a reduced cost solution to the Authority's Canberra office accommodation requirements. Capital servicing costs arising from the project are more than offset by the anticipated savings in lease payments and refurbishment costs for rented accommodation resulting in a net reduction in annual financing requireuted ments for the Authority. Mr T. Williams: Consultancy (Question No. 1757) Mr Blunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 11 April 1989: Has Mr T.

(2) Yes, both the collections and the properties are culturally important. (3) At this stage, the Government is considering the terms of the offer and it would be inappropriate to comment further. Directors-General of United Nations Agencies (Question No. 1818) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 8 May 1989: (I) Did Australia and Canada at the twenty-fourth Ordinary Session of the General Conference of UNESCO in 1987, propose an amendment to the Constitution to permit the Director-General to be appointed for more than two terms. (2) In which specialised agencies of the UN have Directors-General been (i) nominated and (ii) appointed since 1987 for a third or later term and how did the Australian delegation vote in each instance. (3) In which specialised agencies of the UN do the Constitutions permit the Directors-General to be appointed for no more than two terms and how long is the term in each instance.",81
122,Mr DUFFY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) No. The Constitution of UNESCO does not limit the term in office of the Director-General. Article VI.2 provides as follows: ""The Director-General shall be nominated by the Executive Board and appointed by the General Conference for a period of six years, under such conditions as the Conference may approve, and shall be eligible for reappointment."" As an element of Australia's efforts to promote reform throughout the UN system, Australia has advocated an initiative to limit the term of office· for the Directors-General or equivalent of international organisations. The basis of the Australian initiative has been that an upper limit of ten years in office would maximise the benefits of continuity and relevant expertise. The range of terms of office in the multilateral system extends from 4-6 years. The initiative has been referred to as the ""two term principle"". At every opportunity including the General Conference of UNESCO in 1987 when Frederico Mayor Zaragosa was appointed Director-General, Australia has sought to increase support for the ""two term principle"". (2) The only instance since 1987 where a Director-General of a UN specialised agency has been reappointed for a third or later term is the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) where Dr Edouard Saouma was appointed for a third term of six years in 1987. Consistent with the two term principle Australia opposed the reappointment of Dr Saouma. Australia opposed moves to re-appoint the Director-General of UNESCO M'Bow for a third term in 1987. He was not re-elected. (3) The charters of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) and the Universal Postal Union make provision for their Directors-General to serve no longer than two terms. Workers Compensation (Question No. 1819) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 8 May 1989: Following the pUblication of ""Selected Statistics on the General Insurance Industry for the year ended 30 June 1988"" by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, is he able to bring up-to-date the information provided in the answer to Question No. 1174 (Hansard, 29 September 1988, p. 1319).",81
123,Mr HOWE ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) On the basis of figures provided in the Office of the Insurance Commissioner's pUblication ""Selected Statistics on the General Insurance Industry for the year ended 30 June 1988"", the updated figures for 1987-88 are: Workers Compulsory compensation third party $m $m Direct Premiums 2171.8 1960.7 Benefits (including legal, hospital and medical costs) 2208.9 1529.7 Administration expenses and commissions . . . . . . 288.2 86.2 The following legal and medical costs are estimated using the same method used to answer previous questions on notice on this subject. However, there are some indications that legal and medical costs may have risen at a faster rate than the rise in benefits; if this is so, the following figures may be an underestimate. Workers Compulsory compensation third party $m $m Legal (excluding solicitor /client costs) 201.0 255.5 Hospital and medical 402.0 223.3 The percentage increases on premiums between 1986-87 and 1987-88 were: Workers Compulsory compensation third party per cent per cent Direct premiums -20.6 37.9 Earned premiums -12.29 36.77 (2) Since September 1988 the following events have occurred. In New South Wales the review of the transport accident scheme (TRANSCOVER) was completed in November 1988. Legislation subsequently reintroduced the capacity for victims of motor vehicle accidents to obtain lump sum payments for pain and suffering. Wide-ranging reforms of the New South Wales WorkCover system have also been recently announced. These include the reintroduction of commpn law in a modified form, the abolition of journey accident coverage, increased levels of certain benefits, and restructuring of the administration. Tasmania introduced the Tasmania Workers Compensation Act 1988 which establishes new administrative procedures and bodies, including a Workers' Compensation Board and a Workers' Compensation Commission. There have been some changes to entitlements but benefit levels have not been greatly affected. National Collecting Institutions: Reviews (Question No. 1821) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 8 May 1989: Further to the answer to question No. 1239 (Hansard, 23 November 1988, page 3136). have the reviews of the National Library of Australia and the Australian National Gallery been completed; if so, (a) into which other national collecting institutions have reviews been instituted and (b) who is conducting the reviews.",82
124,Mr HOLDING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The reviews of the National Library pf Australia and the Australian National Gallery have been completed and I have received both reports. No other reviews into collecting institutions have commenced. The review program provides for examination of the operation of the Protection of able Cultural Heritage Act 1986 to commence in July 1989. In 1991 it is planned to conduct reviews into the National Film and Sound Archive and the National Science and Technology Centre. At this stage, no one has been appointed to conduct these reviews. Gladstone Airport (Question No. 1823) Mr Sinclair asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 8 May 1989: Has the Government undertaken to assist the Gladstone-Calliope Aerodrome Board with funding to extend and widen the airport runway at Gladstone; if so, (a) when was this undertaking given. ,(b) has the, amount been budgeted for in Commonwealth outlays. (c) how much fundi""ng has been allocated and (d) when .will the assistance be coming.",83
125,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: No undertaking has been given to the GladstoneCalliope Aerodrome Board to assist with the funding of the completed upgrading works. The Government did consider Commonwealth reimbursement of the cost ($185,000) of those works in the 1988 Budget context, but budget circumstances were such the Government was unable to accede to the proposal. The proposal to fund the works was included in consultations with the aviation industry seeking agreement on cost recovery measures associated with development works proposed for Commonwealth funding under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan. The airline concerned has indicated its agreement in principle to cost recovery arrangements and the proposal has been included for consideration in the Budget. Steyr Rifle (Question No. 1831) Mr Millar asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 8 May 1989: (1) Does the Steyr 5.56mm rifle have (a) a tumble problem, in that the twist rate has been raised from I in 9 to I in 7, in breach of the Geneva Convention, (b) a lower tolerance to water in the barrel than the 7.62mm SLR, thereby having a lower operational reliability, (c) a ""cook-off"" problem not present to any significant extent in the 7.62mm SLR, and (d) a problem with a plastic trigger mechanism. (2) Can the 5.56mm round be stopped by lightweight body armour at even point blank range. (3) Was it shown during the Falklands War that small calibre rounds do not stop humans. (4) Did the Gurkhas reject the Steyr because of its inability to penetrate jungle. (5) Are Steyr ammunition reserves insufficient for Mov- war purposes of more than one to two months duration. (6) Has a comparison or evaluation been made between the Doring Mk5 7.62mm rifle and the Steyr and SLR; if not, why not.",83
126,Mr BEAZLEY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (la) No. I am advised that a barrel rifling twist of one turn in 178mm (7 inches) provides the bullet of the recently developed NATO standard 5.56mm ball ammunition and its tracer counterpart with the appropriate spin to provide stability in flight to ensure accuracy. (\b) No. I am advised that during comprehensive Australian evaluation, the Steyr weapon performed to the required standard when water was introduced into the barrel during adverse conditions testing. A direct comparison with the in-service 7.62mm SLR has not been made. But, as far as a general comparforthison with the SLR can be made, the Steyr has demonstrated superior operational reliability during adverse conditions testing. ( 1c) No. Further, a direct comparison with the semi-automatic SLR is not valid as the new rifle is an automatic weapon. (Id) No. (2) No. The new 5.56mm ammunition will penetrate military body armour at ranges beyond the effective range (400m) of the new rifle. (3) The British Army has also adopted its own new 5.56mm rifle designed to fire the new 5.56mm NATO Standard ammunition. However, these weapons are only just entering service and were not in service during the Falklands War. As far as is known only the older style 5.56mm ammunition (M193 or equivalent) was used during the Falklands War and so any discussion on effectiveness of small calibre 1989 rounds during that conflict is not relevant to our new rifle and its ammunition. (4) It is not known if the British Army's Gurkhas have evaluated the Steyr rifle, however see paragraph (3) above. The rifle the British Army has adopted is of British design and manufacture. (5) The Steyr rifle is not yet in service with the Australian Defence Force. When the weapon enters service, appropriate reserves of the new ammunition will be available. (6) No. Some information on a 7.62mm rifle developed by R. M. and J. M. Doring Industries of Queensland is held by my Department. However, the Army, which is about to be re-equipped with locally manufactured highly capable 5.56mm rifles and light machine guns designed to fire the new 5.56mm NATO Standard ammunition, does not have a requirement for such a weapon. The limited Army small arms engineering resources are fully committed to the present small arms re-equipment programme and an evaluation of the Doring Industries weapon could not be conducted without detriment to that programme. Ozone Layer Conference (Question No. 1841) Mr Cobb asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 23 May 1989: (I) Did the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business attend a recent conference in England on the ozone layer which was arranged by the British Prime Minister; if so, who paid for the Minister's trip. (2) Did the Australian Government refuse funds for the Minister to attend the conference; if so, why. (3) Since March 1983, which other Ministers have had their overseas trips paid for by an overseas country.",83
127,Mr HAWKE ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes; the British Government paid for the trip. (2) Mr Jones was personally invited to attend the conference by the British Government, as a guest of the Government. The invitation noted that the British Government would provide a return air ticket as well as normal hotel and living expenses in Britain. As such, there was no refusal of funds by the Australian Government. (3) No other Minister has had air fares paid by another country since March 1983. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Question No. 1842) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Community Services!lnd Health, upon notice, on 23 May 1989: Further to the answer to question No. 1780 (Hansard,8 May 1989, page 2190), who were the AIDS Councils education officers who considered material such as the brochure ""6 tips for hard cocks"" to be an effective means of communicating messages to male homosexuals.",84
128,Dr BLEWETT ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The brochure was developed by the AIDS Council of New South Wales (ACON) Education Working Group which comprises staff of the Council and other people involved in preventive AIDS education. Following the brochure's development, I understand that it underwent the standard endorsement procedures of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations (AFAO). These procedures require certification from education or similar officers from two different AIDS Councils that the material concerned is appropriate for AIDS education. In the case of this brochure, ACON and the Victorian AIDS Council provided written certification that the pamphlet was appropriate safe sex educational material and deserving of endorsement by AFAO for the purpose of classification by the Office of Literature and Film Classification. I also understand that, in making application to the Chief Censor for classification of the brochure, it was certified that the only venues in which the brochure was intended for distribution were places where gay and bisexual men meet; that it was not intended for the general public nor for venues to which the general public go; that it was intended for distribution throughout Australia; that its purpose was to educate men who have sex with men as to the proper use of a condom for sex; and that it provided unambiguous instruction in the proper use of condoms. Arms Cache (Question No. 1844) Mr N. A. Brown asked the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 24 May 1989: (I) Was the cache of arms illegally imported into Australia, apparently bound for Fiji, and discovered on or about 30 May 1988 (a) sold, (b) otherwise disposed of or (c) retained by Australian authorities. (2) If the cache of arms was sold, (a) on what date was it sold, (b) to whom was it sold and (c) what sum was obtained. (3) If the cache of arms was not sold but otherwise disposed of, how was it disposed of. (4) If the cache of arms was retained by Australian authorities, (a) by which Australian authorities was it retained, (b) where are the arms now situated and (c) what use will be made from them. MrBarry Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ( I) The cache of arms seized by the Australian Customs Service on 30 May 1988 was forfeited to the Crown. The arms have now been transferred to the Australian Defence Force at their request. (2), (3) and (4) See answer to Question I. Henderson Poverty Line (Question No. 1863) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 29 May 1989: What is the current so-called Henderson poverty line (a) after tax and (b) after housing costs for (i) a single person, (ii) a couple, one of whom is employed and (iii) a couple, one of whom is employed, and one child.",84
129,Mr HOWE ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The latest available updated estimates of Henderson poverty lines are for March quarter 1989. The lines refer to income after tax. (a) (i) For a single person not working the figure is $137.80 and for a single person working $170. (ii) $227.40. (iii) $273.30. (b) (i) For a single person not working the afterhousing poverty line is $82.30 and for a single person working $114.40. (ii) $166.30. (iii) $206.70. Sydney Airport: Curfew (Question No. 1541) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Has her attention been drawn to claims made by a senior Qantas Captain that, as a result of the Government's curfew changes at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, safety margins for 747 aircraft have been reduced. (2) Was the Government aware of this consequence when it changed curfew arrangements. (3) Has the Government undertaken any studies to determine whether a heavily loaded aircraft using full power to take off on a restricted runway makes more or less noise than the s-me aircraft using runway length and less power, (4) if so, (a) who conducted the study, (b) what were the results and (c) will she provide details of the study.",85
130,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am aware that the claim has been made. (2) The revised curfew procedures introduced at Sydney Airport from 30 October 1988 do not involve any compromise of safety standards. (3) No specific studies were carried out. An assessment of the effects of taking off from a, reduced runway length indicated that noise at locations behind the departing aircraft would be reduced at the cost of much smaller increases in noise at locations around Botany Bay. Noise studies comparing the old and the new curfew arrangements at Sydney are being conducted. While no definitive result is yet available from the studies, preliminary indications are that the revised curfew arrangements have reduced the noise impact of aircraft operations during the curfew period at Sydney. ( 4) Not applicable. Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (Question No. 1542) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Is, she able to say whether the A-stralian Association of Pilots has recommended that Its members should not co-operate with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI); if so, (a) why h-s this recommendation been made and (b) what IS the Government's response. (2) Will the failure of pilots to co-operate with BASI handicap the Bureau in its investigations of air accidents. (3) What is the Government's practice on the confidentiality and use of information provided by pilots and others to BASI.",85
131,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) In December 1987 the Australian Federation of Air Pilots directed its members not to co-operate with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation on matters relating to accidents or incidents. This action was prompted by Federation concern over the alleged use of Bureau material in committal proceedings against a pilot charged with manslaughter following an accident near Hamilton Island in Queensland. The material collected by the Bureau was not usable as evidence in the court, because such material is not gathered in accordance with the Rules of Evidence. The charges against the pilot were subsequently dropped, but the Federation has maintained greater its ban against contact with the Bureau. The Government is obviously concerned at the ban, because in order to maintain this country's enviable safety record there must be a free flow of information to the Bureau. Negotiations are continuing in an effort to resolve the present situation. (2) At this stage the ban has not had any significant effect on the ability of the Bureau to conduct its investigations, as not all Federation pilots are complying with the ban. Bureau investigators have the power to issue summonses if it is considered that information from the pilots is critical to a particular investigation. In most cases, relevant information can be obtained from other sources. (3) The Bureau treats information which it obtains in accordance with internationally recommended practices. For example, public access to those classes of information which are covered by Annex 13 of the Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation is only available under due legal process. This includes statements from those persons responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft; communications between such persons; medical or private information; opinions and analysis of information, including flight recorder information; and Cockpit voice Recorder information. The Bureau will, however, reveal the facts and circumstances surrounding any a:ccident or incident, so .that appropriate safety measures can be taken by the regulatory areas of the Civil Aviation Authority. Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) What are (a) the number and (b) the type, of incidents involving aircraft operated by the Civil Aviation Authority and his Department, or their predecessors, for each calendar year from 1969, for (i) not following approved procedures, (ii) inadequate preparation and planning for a flight, (iii) incorrect use of equipment, (iv) misunderstanding air traffic clearance, (v) improper maintenance by CAA ground engineers, (vi) operating without proper air traffic clearance, '(vii) inadequate supervision of flight by pilot-in-command, (viii) attention diverted from operating the aircraft, (ix) navigation error/not knowing position of aircraft/deficient map reading, (x) operating carelessly, (xi) component overload through poor judgment, (xii) lack of familiarity with aircraft, (xiii) inadequate radio listening watch, (xiv) forgetting to cancel Search and Rescue alert, (xv) attempting to operate a known unserviceable aircraft and (xvi) actual breach of the Air Navigation Regulations. (2) How does this operating record compare with the industry standards for commercial aviation and general aviation. (i) not following approved procedures (ii) inadequate preparation and planning for a Hight (iii) incorrect use of equipment (iv) misunderstanding air traffic control instructions (v) improper maintenance by CAA ground engineers (vi) operating without proper air tramc clearance (vii) inadequate supervision of Hight by plt-incommand (viii) attention diverted from operating the aircran) . (ix) navigation error not knowing position of aircraft deficient map reading . (x) operating carelessly (xi) component overload through poor judgment (3) Are there criteria for establishing whether the operating record referred to in part (2) is satisfactory; if so, does the record meet those criteria. (4) Has she, or any of her predecessors since 1969, received an assessment of the incidence of these types of failings; if so, (a) when were those assessments made and (b) will she make them available to members.",85
132,Mrs KELLY ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation operates a computerised air safety occurrence recording system which has been interrogated to answer this Aviation question. The system assigns factors (type of incident) to each occurrence. This means that totals do (Question No. 1672) not reflect the number of occurrences involved just the number of times the factors were assigned. There were 216 factors related to the occurrences recorded against the operation of CAA aircraft for the 20 year period 1969-1989. The following table depicts the number of times a factor (type of incident) designated in the question has been assigned. (2) Incident statistics are not catalogued to provide comparison as anticipated by the question, whereas accident statistics do provide a valid comparison of the relative performance of aircraft operators. CAA aircraft have been involved in five minor accidents in the past 20 years which when expressed as a rate per 100,000 hours flown produces a figure of 2.67 which is well below the average rate of 3.2 for commuter and supplemental airline operations. The accident rate for charter operations fluctuates about an average of 8 accidents per 100,000 flying hours. (3) There are no criteria. Rather, judgments are made on the basis of the known record and the frequency of occurrences. Accident and incident prevention in the CAA aircraft operations receives high priority as evidenced by the comparatively low number of occurrences involving CAA aircraft. (4) As far as can be aSfertained, there has been no assessment of accident records relating to CAA aircraft operations. 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 total . . 6 4 0 0 0 50 2 4 2 0 I 2 0 I I I 0 0 37 0 0 I I 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 27 0 0 0 0 0 0 22 0 0 0 0 31 0 0 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 17 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 13 0 0 0 I 0 I 0 I 2 0 I I I 0 I 0 I I 0 0 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 I 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 I 0 I 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 I 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 I 0 0, 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 I I 2 0 0 0 I 0 I 0 6 0 0 0 O· I 0 I 0 2 I 0 I I 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (xii) lack of familiarity with aircraft (xiii) inadequate radio list.ning watch (xiv) forgetting to cano.l Search and Roseu. alert (xv) attempting to operate a known unserviceabl. aircraft ....... (xvi) actual breach of the Air Navisation Regulations Mr Lloyd asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: What are(a) the quantity of flavoured milk taxable to 20 per cent and (b) the amount of sales tax collected on flavoured milk in (i) the six months since the 1988-89 Budget and (ii) the corresponding six months in 198788.",86
133,Mr KEATING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Flavoured beverages that consist of less than 95% of milk, milk powder, whey, whey powder and whey paste, or a combination of such goods, are taxable at 20%. Flavoured beverages that consist of not less than 95% milk etc are taxable at 10%. (b) (i) & (ii) Amounts of sales tax revenue derived from particular commodities are not recorded separately. However, it has been estimated that the amount of sales tax collected on flavoured milk in the six months since the 1988/89 Budget is $4.5m and the amount for the corresponding period in 1987/88 is put .at $4.0m. Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 5 April 1989: In relation to the position of business manager for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, (a) what ,are (i) the role and (ii) the responsibilities of the position, (b) what are the working hours, (c) where is the position located, (d) how long has the incumbent been holding the position and (e) has the position been publicly advertised; if so, when. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) (i) & (ii) The General Manager-Business is responsible to the Commissioner for the administration and commercial management of the Scheme. and for ensuring conformity with statutory and legal obligations under the relevant legislation.

The General ManagerBusiness is also responsible for representing the Authority in its relationships with major customers, bankers, government bodies, professional societies and similar groups. A further key task is to develop proposals· for the future management of the Scheme in the context of the Government's policy announced in October 1987 for Government Business Enterprises. (b) The working hours are the normal full working week of the Authority. However, like most senior officers, the General Manager-Business works longer hours as required by the responsibilities and scope of the position. (c) The position is located in Cooma at the Authority's Central Office. (d) The incumbent was appointed in January 1989. (e) Following the resignation of the previous incumbent in August 1988, an Australia wide search was conducted via newspaper advertisements and the use of executive search facilities. Kangaroo Skins (Question No. 1739) Mr Macphee asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon (Question No. 1723) notice, on 6 April 1989: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 627 (Hansard, 3 June 1988, page 3298), will the Minister release a copy of any investigative report carried out by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service in consultation with the Australian Customs Service regarding claims that Steinwell Commodities (UK) was commissioned by the Government to sell kangaroo skins to German importer Louis Breuninger Lederfabrik; if not why not. (2) Will the Minister release a copy of any investigative report provided by trade officials in Bonn and the United Kingdom authority. responsible for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES); if not, why not. (3) Why was the UK CITES authority asked to investigate this matter when the kangaroo skins which were purported to be offered to Louis Breuninger Lederfabrik do not come under any. of the CITES Appendices. (4) IS the Minister able to say what steps the UK authorities took to find Steinwell Commodities (UK). (5) Why were not Interpol and the Australian Federal Police called into investigate this matter. (6) Will the Minister call upon Interpol and the Australian Federal Police to investigate the offer thoroughly. Mr HoldiJig----:The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) As outlined in the answer to question No. 627 (Hansard 3 June 1988, page 3298),the alleged offer by Steinwell Commodities to the German importer, Louis Breuninger Lederfabrik was investigated, with the result that the allegation could not be substantiated, The files regarding this matter have not been closed, and the release of the material gathered to date could jeOpardise any future inquiries into the matter, should further information be forthcoming. (3) The UK CITES Authority, which assisted in the investigations, is responsible for wildlife trade matters involving the UK, regardless of whether the specimens concerned are listed under CITES. (4) The UK authorities were requested to investigate the matter, and subsequently advised that no record could be found of Stein well Commodities. The procedures adopted in undertaking the investigation, were appropriately left to the UK authorities. (5)' In matters which could indicate a breach of the Customs barrier, the Australian Customs Service is the agency responsible for undertaking enquiries rather than the Australian Federal Police. The matter was investigated, and as there were no indications that a breach of the Wildlife Protection Act had occurred, the involvement of other agencies was not co-sidered appropriate. (6) If any further information wa- to be provided, which could substantiate the claims which have been made, the matter will be pursued with the support of the appropriate enforcement agencies. Assistance to Immigrants and Refugees (Question No. 1756) Mr Wright asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 11 April 1989: (1) What assistance is given to (a) immigrants and (b) refugees by the Federal Government in the areas of loans, housing, work opportunities or any other area. (2) What arrangements have been made with the State Governments to provide assistance in the areas referred to in part (1). '",87
134,Mr HOLDING ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) The Federal Government does not provide assistance specifical\y targeted for immigrants in the area of loans, housing or work opportunities. The Government does ensure, through its Access and Equity Strategy, that all Australians have equal access to and an equitable share of government resources. Many Federal Departments have developed comprehensive program information campaigns in community languages and employ bi-lingual workers. The following programs offer assistance to immigrants (including refugees): Language The Federal Government provides language services (interpreting and, translating) to non-English speaking Australians. These are the Telephone Interpreter Service which is an interpreting, information and referral service available Australia-wide through ' eight staffed centres (in the capital cities) and a 008 network in the rest of Australia. The Service is available seven days a week, 24 hours it day. The other language service is the translatidn service provided for immigrants, refugees, other government authorities, voluntary and private organisations and private individuals. $3.255m was provided for these services in 1988/89 (administered by Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, DILGEA). Adult Migrant English Program (A,MEP) The AMEP is a nationally co-ordinated English language teaching program for adult migrants, especially those in their first few years in Australia. The program is a partnership between the Commonwealth, which plans, funds, and provides national direction, and the State's/Territories which deliver the programs from some 500 locations across Australia. Learning provisions include formal courses, distance learning, English in the Workplace and home tutoring by volunteers. To facilitate migrants' access to the program, the Federal Government administers a number of SUP"" port services, including child care and living allowances for those attending full""time courses. Living allowances are based on unemployment benefits and are the only payments made directly to individual clients. The AMEP's national budget for 1988/89 is $62m of which $5.9m and $2.1m have been allocated for living allowances and child care respectively (administered by DILGEA). Jobtrain Under the JOBTRAIN program $1.9m has been allocated for 1988-89 to conduct training for mi'grants with overseas acquired qualifications. The objective of the training is to bring participants to a standard of learning and expertise which will enable them to gain recognition and registration in their profession in Australia. Funding under this component can be granted to State Governments, Universities, Teaching Hospitals or Professional Organisations (administered by Department of Employment, Education and Training, DEET). SkillShare SkillShare, a Federal Government program which commenced in January 1989, assists the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged people to obtain and retain employment or proceed to further education or training. The SkillShare target group includes those who may face barriers to employment or further education or training because. of difficulties relating to race, culture and language. Immigrants and refugees are included in the SkillShare target group. The SkillS hare training, marketing and curriculum strategies recognise the needs of participants from non-English speaking backgrounds and special provisions are available to encourage their participation in the SkillShar- program. English language training, particularly in the vocational context, and the acquisition of vocational skills and qualifications is often the focus of SkillShare assistance to this group (administered by DEET). Labour Market Programs The Federal Government has a number of labour market programs for people who are long term unemployed or otherwise at risk in finding employment. The programs include counselling, short term vocational training and/or short term wage subsidies to employers. Migrants and refugees with limited English are one of the groups considered at risk in finding employment, and, accordingly, may receive assistance from one of the labour market programs (administered by DEET). Advanced English Language Program for Migrants The Government is providing $4.143m in 1989 under the States' Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1989 for Advanced English for Migrants. The Program provides funds to TAFE authorities for courses designed' to: (i) increase English proficiency to a level where migrants seeking to obtain training can achieve entry into post-secondary institutions; and (ii) help skilled migrants to develop an adequate command of English for occupational purposes or to obtain recognition of their overseas qualifications. Eunds are provided to assist the provision of courses which build upon language skills obtained previously, often through the Adult Migrant Education Program (AMEP). TAFE authorities have been strongly urged, and are expected, to liaise with the AMEP (administered by DEET). . Adult Literacy In addition the Government has provided $3.1m in 1989, for adult . literacy under the States' Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1989 and the National Policy on Languages. The. program enables States to offer courses to assist adults who are unable to read and write English (administered by DEET). . . Australian Traineeship System (ATS) Under the Australian Traineeship System (ATS) employers are entitled to a training fee of $1000 per approved trainee. Employers are eligible to receive an additional $ \000 if they employ trainees assessed by the .CESas being. disadvantaged. The disadvantagedinclude migrants with English language difficulties (administ-red by DEET). National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR) .As part of its National Agenda for a Multicultural. Australia, the Government proposes to implement a strategy of reform leading to simpler, more flexible arrangements for migrant qualifications recognition based on non-discriminatory assessments and national competency standards. A National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR) will be established to oversee the strategy which will include improved access to remedial and bridging courses, including English language training and impro,ved pre and post arrival counselling and referral services (administered by DEET). Child Care The Federal Government has funded childcare which is oriented to ethnic groups and developed resource centres· to 'provide, amongst other things, multicultural resources (administered by Department of Community Services and Health, DCS&H). Aged Care The Federal Government has established ethnospecific homes and hostels for the. ethnic aged and provided capital funding (up to 100% for hostels) for ethnic communities who have limited assets. (I) (b) or the 140,000 immigrants selected for entry to Australia in 1988/89, the majority are expected to be self-supporting on arrival. The Refugee and Special Humanitarian entrants, which represent less than ten per cent of the yearly Migration Program, are the only immigrants eligible for the following assistance. Humanitarian entrants are eligible for a period of subsidised accommodation on arrival at migrant centres or flats. Eligibility is up to 6 months subsidised accommodation but averaging about 3 months. In certain circumstances emergency accommodation is provided for other immigrants in need of crisis accommodation. In 1987/88 some 9800 immigrants (almost all refugee/humanitarian cases) were admitted to Migrant Centres and flats. 1987/88 net operating costs were $5.28 million. Entrants. under the R'efugee and Special Humanitarian Program may apply for an interest-free personal loan of up to $800 per family from CALFRIC Ltd (Committee for Allocation of Loans Funds to Refugees in Centres, a non-government agency separately constituted as a company for the purpose) to help them move into private accommodation. From total capital of $1.4 million provided by the Federal Government, CALFRIC allocates funds to lending agencies which in turn make loans to individuals and families meeting loan criteria. Loan repayments are returned by the agencies to CALFRIC to enable further allocations and loans to be made. By means of this revolving fund, the Committee has made about 11,500 loans, valued at some $6.4m, since its inception in 1979. Refugee and Special Humanitarian entrants may also receive emergency clothing if required when they arrive at Migrant Centres. This scheme provides for voluntary agencies, such as St Vincent De Paul, to receive reimbursement of up to, $65 for each immigrant receiving clothing (administered by OILGEA). 2. The following settlement assistance programs are Commonwealth/State funded programs of which immigrants (including refugees) are direct or indirect beneficiaries: National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters Limited which is responsible for setting national professional standards for the interpreting/translating profession. It achieves these aims by accrediting professional training courses (administered by OILGEA); State/Territory Government programs for language services for clients of State/Territory Departments and agencies (administered by OILGEA) and refugee minors cost-sharing program which addresses the problem arising from a breakdown in care arrangements for both refugee wards and minors. Funds are used to employ specialist welfare staff who counsel and supervise refugee minors and their extended families (administered by OILGEA). National Skills Shortage Program Under the Federal Government's National Skills Shortage Program resources have been provided to a number of State Governments to conduct bridging training for overseas qualified nurses. Such training enables the nurses to work in their profession and also assists in redressing the shortage of nurses (administered by DEET). SkillShare SkillShare operates through a network of projects in all States and Territories. The sponsor organisations, who may be either non-profit community organisations or local government authorities, manage each project and where appropriate provide linkages for participants with relevant State Government services eg: a SkillS hare project operating in Victoria holds English classes for immigrants and refugees, and is funded through the Adult Migrant Education Service, Victorian Department of Education (administered by DEET). National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR) The Government is encouraging State initiatives including State overseas qualifications recognition units and promoting improved Commonwealth-State co-operative arrangements through NOOSR. At the Special Ministerial Conference on Training held on 28 April State Education, Training and Industrial Relations Ministers endorsed the Government's broad strategy for the recognition of overseas qualifications (administered by DEET) Home and Community Care (HACC) The Federal and State Governments co-operate in the funding and delivery of the HACC program which provides ethno-specific services when existing general service providers are unable to assist (administered by DCS&H). Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) This joint Federal/State funded program has been made accessible to immigrants and refugees through the employment of bilingual workers, particularly in women's refuges (administered by DCS&H).

Prime Minister's Overseas Visits (Question No. 1833) Mr Smith asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 11 May 1989: (I) How many overseas trips have been planned for him between 2 June and 31 December 1989. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (I) The Department is responsible for the delivery of the Government's policies, labour market pro. grams and services relating to apprenticeship matters. Within that context, the Government's objectives are to meet the long term needs of the economy for trade skills, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, by improving the efficiency, flexibility and equity of the trade training system. The Department seeks to achieve these objectives through the delivery of a range of labour market programs providing incentives and support to both employers and apprentices within the framework of State/Territory Apprenticeship Systems. As noted in (2) (b) below, the Australian National University, is the only area for which I am responsible that currently employs apprentices: In 1987 a committee was established within the University to review current practice in relation to apprentices (and Trainee Technical Officers) and to make recommendations on future arrangements. As a result, an Apprentice Training Scheme has been set up and is to be co-ordinated by a Central Committee. The Scheme will formally operate from 1990. The primary objective of the Scheme is to provide the university and the community with skilled trades and technical staff. This objective, while serving the needs of the University, recognises the University's obligation as an employer to replace the human skill resources that it recruits from the community. In terms of numbers, the present goal of the scheme is to increase the number of apprentices to 22 by 1991. (2) (a) Nil.

135,Mr HAWKE ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Three trips have been planned between 2 June and 31 December 1989. (2) From 16 June to 3 July 1989, I plan to visit the following countries: the United Kingdom (with ministerial colleagues) to follow up Mrs Thatcher's invitation last year for high level talks and to attend a trade and investment conference; France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Hungary, for bilateral discussions with Government and business leaders; and the United States of America, to meet with the new Administration for bilateral talks on international, political and trade matters of mutual concern. I plan to attend the 20th South Pacific Forum meeting, which will be held in Kiribati, 9 to 12 July 1989. I plan to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which will be held in Malaysia, 18 to 24 October 1989. It is not practical to give estimates of costs in advance; the costs of all ministerial overseas travel are made public in due course. Decision by Mr Kim Hughes to Play Cricket in South Africa (Question No. 1853) Mr Baldwin asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 25 May 1989: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the decision by Mr Kim Hughes to play cricket in South Africa for two years. (2) In light of recent controversies relating to rebel ""Australian"" sporting teams touring South Africa, has the Government adopted any position relevant to Mr Hughes' decision; if so, what is that position.",91
136,Mr HAWKE ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am aware of press reports that former Australian cricket captain, Mr Kim Hughes, has accepted a full-time ""captain coach"" role with the Natal provincial team in South Africa's domestic Currie Cup cricket competition for two season, with an option for a third. (2) In fulfilment of its commitment to the Gleneagles Declaration, the Australian Government will continue strongly to discourage sporting contacts with South Africa, including participation by Australian players in any rebel tour or domestic South African cricket competition. The Government makes every effort to keep Australian sporting organisations aware of its position. I understand that Mr Hughes would be liable to a ten year Australian Cricket Board (ACB) ban if he were to play in South Africa. The Government appreciates the co-operation of the ACB in relation to its policy on sporting contacts with South Africa, which is based on a recognition by the Board (and the International Cricket Conference) of the potential that such contacts have to damage international cricket.

(2) Are those communities satisfied with the service and equipment provided by Acesat. (3) Has the Government invited Telecom to duplicate and expand the service currently offered by the private sector. (4) Did the Government subject Telecom's offer to the competitive tendering process. (5) What sum will it cost the taxpayer to have Telecom duplicate the services already available to those Aboriginal communities. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is a Government policy objective to extend National broadcasting services (ABC television and BOOKLETS radio) to all Australians including those living in remote areas. This objective is pursued through various schemes involving a mix of satellite and terrestrial delivery. Currently, the Department of Transport and Communications is implementing the Remote and Underserved Communities Sc-eme (RUCS) which is bringing ABC television to 42 communities throughout Australia. Because of concerns expressed by Aboriginal communities about the uncontrolled reception of culturally inappropriate material. Aboriginal communities are being offered a variation of R US entitled the Broadcasting for Remote Aboriginal Communities Scheme (BRACS). BRACS enables eligible communities not only to receive, record and retransmit ABC and commercial radio and television programmes but also to introduce other relevant Aboriginal programs including locally produced material. In the above context the answers to the questions are: (I) and (2) I am not aware of the details of commercial arrangements entered into by remote· Aboriginal communities with private companies. (3) No. (4)and(S) See 3. Aboriginal Retirement Village (Question No. 1390) Mr Sharp asked the Minister for Aborjgicies will apply. nal Affairs, upon notice, on 24 November 1988: .

(9) How many places will be made available within the village. (10) Has ICAC indicated a proven demand for those units. (II) What action will the Government take .if was proven that the units were being used for poses other than originally stated. (12) What is the expected cost for the purchase of the land. (13) What. area of land is involved. (14) Is the price being asked above or below that value. (IS) What other lands were considered for the construction of those facilities. (16) Are there substantial areas of land· already owned by the Aboriginal community within the Shoalhaven area which would be suitable for construction of the retirement village. (17) Will non-Aboriginal persons be eligible for residency within the retirement village. Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. The Illaroo Co-operative Aboriginal Corporation (lCAC) has negotiated the pur-hase of an area of land at Judith Drive, North Nowra, from the Shoal haven City Council. (2) The total costs have not yet been determined, but they are not expected to exceed $1 million.

These instructions have been updated as required but only one update relating to Parliamentary Questions procedures has been issued in period that I have been Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. That update was issued by the Director, Ministerial and Portfolio Co-ordination on IS November 1988. This. instruction reduced the time for the preparation of draft responses to questions placed on notice by Senators from four to three weeks and related to Senator Macklin's motion agreed to in the Senate. I have not personally issued a directive or instruction to Departmental officers relating to the procedures for handling questions on notice.

(6) When will the report be available and will she supply a copy of it to me. (7) Why did the CAA undertake this work.",100
138,Mrs KELLY ,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) No. Under existing Government guidelines, the purchase of services need not go to public tender. However, ten firms were considered in a limited tender process. (3) Five companies initially tendered: International Public Relations Professional Public Relations Hill and Knowlton Canberra Liaison Michael Kellaway and Associates. Three companies were shortlisted for interview. The interview panel, after considering presentations decided not to proceed with any of the companies initially shortlisted. Three more companies were invited to submit proposals. They were: JoPolkington Pty Ltd, Melbourne Ken Bennett Australia Pty Ltd, Canberra John Walker & Associates, Canberra. John Walker & Associates was awarded the contract. (4) A copy of the consultant's brief has been supplied. (5) $29,500 (6) The report was available on 3 February 1989 and a copy has been supplied. (7) In todays changing corporate environment the development of a strong corporate image is integral to the promotion of any organisation. The CAA was also concerned to understand the state of internal communication given changes made towards the end of 1988 to rationalise the organisational structure. As a new organisation it believed information provided by such a review constitutes an important reference point for future development. Aer.onautical Charges (Question No. 1494) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: When will I receive a response to my question without notice (Hansard, 19 October 1988, page 1899) concerning the Federal Airports Corporation and aeronautical charges.",102
139,Mrs KELLY ,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The then Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, .the Honourable Gary Punch, MP, answered the honourable member's question at the time it was asked. He did not undertake to provide any further information and the question must therefore be considered answered. Motor Vehicles: Australian Capital (Question No. 1495) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for the Arts and Territories, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) How many motor vehicles are currently registered in the ACT as (a) private or (b) business or commercial (i) Sedans and (ii) 4-wheel drives. (2) How many registered vehicles are (a) imported luxury vehicles, including models made by (i) Rolls Royce or Bentley, (ii) Mercedes, (iii) BMW, (iv) Volvo, (v) Saab, (vi) Jaguar, (vii) Citroen, (ix) Porsche, (x) Ferrari, (b) other luxury or high performance vehicles and (c) other vehicles priced above the tax depreciation level. (3) Is he able to say what are the occupations or businesses of the registered own-rs.",103
140,Mr HOLDING ,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) Private-sedan category 89,663. (b) Business or commercial-sedan category 4,694. Information on the number of 4-wheel drive vehicles is not readily available because of the system according to which records are kept. Manual collation of the data would involve a significant demand on resources which I am not prepared to ask the ACT Government to undertake. (2) (a) (i) Rolls Royce or Bentley 34, (ii) Mercedes 1,380, (iii) BMW 664, (iv) Volvo 2,312, (v) Saab 582, (vi) Jaguar 334, (vii) Rover.398, (viii) Citroen 166, (ix) Porsche 104, (x ) Ferran I I. (b) Information on luxury or high performance imported vehicles is not available as a general category. While the information could be gathered from an examination of details relating to individual makes of vehicles, this would require a significant demand on resources which I am not prepared to ask the ACT Government to undertake. (c) No such information is available for the period prior to 1983. Since 1983 ACT vehicle registration records have listed the market value of vehicles as declared by owners. However, the informati<Jn is not held in a manner which can be readily accessed to respond to the question. Provision of the information sought would require a significant allocation of resources which I am not prepared to ask the ACT Government to undertake. (3) No. Nursing Homes and Hostels: Subsidies (Question No. 1506) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Since the introduction of Commonwealth subsidies for capital expenditure on nursing homes, hostels for the aged and similar institutions, what has been the subsidy paid in each financial year, exTerritory pressed in 1989 dollars. (2) What subsidies have been paid to religious organisations. (3) Does the Commonwealth have any entitlement to financial recovery when any of the real estate, on which a Commonwealth subsidy has been received, is sold. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: .

(v) 79,538,712 Explanatory Note (i) (a) Figures have not been indexed to 1989 dollars because of changes in relative weightings of components in the most relative weightings of components in the most relevant index (Implicit Price Deflator (IPD)Gross fixed expenditure private non-dwelling construction). The figures can be deflated usirg the Consumer Price Index (CPI) although the CPI provides only a general/rough indication of 'inflation'. (i) (b) Separate ""expenditure"" figures for approved grants to Religious Institutions are not available due to the method of record keeping over the years. However, ""approved grant"" figures for religious and total institutions, together with ""Total expenditure"" figures for total institutions (for .other than the 1985-86 year), have been compiled from the annual reports of the Departments in which the capital subsidy arrangement has resided since 1954-55. The ""Total expenditure"" figures reflect the payments made in the year of the grant and/or subsequent years and in any year can be more or less than the ""Total approved grant"" figures. (ii) The figures prior to 1965-66, which were in pounds, have been converted to dollars. (iii) Religious grants for 1969-70 and 1970-71 are not available separately. An estimate for each year has been made. (iv) The ""Total institutions approved grant"" figure for the 1985-86 year is an estimate based on the information currently available. (v) Figures regarding capital subsidy to religious organisations are not av-ilable after 1983-1984. These figures were kept by the Department of Social Security until the function passed to the Community Services Total portfolio. Since that time, no distinction has been made between religious and other organisations in the keeping Total of statistics of capital funding. (3) The Commonwealth does have an entitlement $ $ $ to financial recovery in respect of land and buildings 7,999,450 which are sold, where the land and the buildings 8,665,590 have been subsidised by the Commonwealth. under 10,306,717 the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act. Under 9,111,008 new agreements being drawn up, the amount to 10,279,910 which the Commonwealth will be entitled wi1l be a 12,699,586 proportionate amount of current value at the time 16,749,870 of sale, based on the proportionate amount originally 18,999,963 contributed by the Commonwealth. 22,183,287 Locomotives: Noise 21,296,871 42,517,480 (Question No. 1544) 71,603,617 Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Land 42,386,623 Transport and Shipping Support, upon no52,110,000 52,720,000 tice, on 28 February 1989: 51,140,000 (1) Has the Government required Australian Na45,750,000 tional (AN) to take specific action to reduce the 56,700,000 noise of its locomotives; if so, what action is re58,430,000 quired. 52,630,000 (2) If AN is not required to take specific noise 46,603,764 reduction action, why not. 46,468,295 55,788,213 (3) Does the Commonwealth have a noise crite65,467,000 rion standard. (4) Is there sound attenuation equipment fitted to AN locomotives; if so, what is it. (5) If sound attenuation equipment is not fitted to AN locomotives what would be the cost of fitting equipment. (6) Are new locomotives for AN on order; if so, (a) what are they, (b) when wi1l they be delivered (c) what sum will they cost and (d) wi1l those locomotives be fitted with noise reduction equipment. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. (2) There are no Federal noise controls that apply to AN and AN locomotives are exempt from the South Australian 'Noise Control Act 1976-77'. (3) There are no obligatory design rules, regulations or standards applicable to the construction of AN railway locomotives, nor does the Commonwealth have any noise criterion standard for AN locomotives. (4) AN mainland locomotives purshased after 1977 have sound attenuation equipment fitted. This includes muffler boxeS or similar equipment on the locomotive exhausts and baffling to reduce dynamic brake noise. (5) AN is unable to advise the precise cost of fitting sound attenuation equipment to locomotives presently without· it but estimate that it would be of the order of several hundred thousand dollars for each locomotive .. (6) Yes. (a) DL class locomotives of an order for IS from Clyde Engineering remain to be delivered. 14 EL class locomotives from A. E. Goninan have been ordered. (b) Delivery of the remaining DL locomotives is expected to be cOl11pleted by August 1989. Delivery of the EL locomotives is due to start in August 1990, with the second due in October 1990 and deliveries thereafter at a rate of one a month. (c) Total contract price for the DL locomotives is $35 million; and $31 million for the EL locomotives. (d) Yes. DL class locomotives are fitted with muffler boxes al)d dynamic brake baffling to reduce noise, and EL locomotives will have similar equipment. Ranger Uranium Mine (Question No. 1579) Mr Milton asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: (I) Is it a fact that approximately half a million tonnes of low grade ore was wrongly dumped on the ""safe"" waste-rock dump at the Ranger uranium mine due to a malfunction in a discriminator; if this is correct, what are the details of the incident. (2) How much time is estimated to have elapsed before the malfunction was discovered. (3) What was the precise cause of the malfunction. ( 4) What checking mechanisms exist to detect malfunctions in discriminators. (5) Did those checking mechanisms fail on this occasion; if so, why. . (6) What is the' composition of the ore which was wrongly dumped. (7) Is it a fact that the discovery of the malfuncTerritory tion was not reported to the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy for over 80 hours; if so, why did Ranger take so 10'1g to notify the Department. (8) If the discovery of the malfunction was reported in less than 80 hours, how much time had elapsed before the Department was notified. (9) Did Ranger notify the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) of the malfunction; if not, why not. (10) If Ranger did notify the OSS, what time had elapsed between the malfunction and notification. .(II) Does the incident constitute an infringement of the environmental regulations governing the operation of the mine. (12) Has the Minister called for a full report on the incident; if not, why not. (13) Has Ranger provided a detailed report to the OSS; if not, (i) why not and (ii) when is the report expected. (14) What action will be taken to ensure that in future Ranger notifies the OSS immediately of any infringements. (15) Has Ranger undertaken to remove the material placed in error to the restricted release zone (RRZ); if not, why not. (16) If Ranger has undertaken to remove the material referred to in part (15), will this be completed before the onset of the wet season. (17) Has a new temporary RRZ been created to contain this material; if so, what steps have been taken to ensure that seepage of water from this RRZ does not leave the RRZ. (18)' Will it be necessary to include retention pond number 4 and its catchment in the RRZ as a result of seepage from the .waste-rock stockpile. (19) Is the Minister concerned that the recent release by Ranger of 10,000 cubic metres of water from the retention pond near where the material was wrongly dumped may be contaminated and cause environmental damage to Magela Creek; if not, why not. (20) Was the water released by siphoning over a not spillway to the Djalkmara Billabong which flows into Magela Creek; if not, what are the details. (21) Did the OSS specifically recommend against this method of release because the dilution levels cannot be measured. (22) Has biological testing shown that the water contained in retention pond number 4 can sometimes cause toxic effects even at comparatively high dilutions when added to the water of Magela Creek. (23) Did. samples taken in October 1988 show unusually high levels of uranium and radium in the pond . (24) Has the chairperson of the Northern Land Council, Mr G. Yunupingu, called on the Northern Minister for Mines and Energy to withdraw authorisation for the release of water from the retention pond because of the proximity of the contaminated material and the possible contamination of Magela Creek which is an important food source for Aborigines. (25) Is the Minister concerned that release from the pond may not be property monitored and may cause environmental damage to Magela Creek; if so, what action will he take to ensure proper monitoring takes place. (26) If the Minister is not concerned, why not.",103
141,Mr HOLDING ,CSIRO,"The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following response to the honourable member's question: (I) On 28 November 1988 Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd (Ranger) provided initial written advice to the Supervising Scientist, the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy, and the Northern Land Council that an unknown quantity of mineralised material containing uranium above the prescribed limit had been placed in error on the waste rock dump. Possibly up to 448 000 tonnes of this mineralised material might have been involved. (Material is defined as rock containing 'more than 0.02 per cent of uranium dry weight as measured on a truck or scraper load basis or by sampling of the relevant material in situ'). The cause of this incident is reported to have been a malfunction in the ore discriminator. (2) In its 28 November advice Ranger stated that the discriminator may have been malfunctioning for as long as six months. On 16 December 1988 Ranger indicated to my colleague, Mr Holding, that the erroneous placement of material may have occurred for up to three months but more likely for only one month. (3) The malfunction may have been due to an electrical fault in one of the four scintillometer heads on the discriminator resulting in a lower recording of the radioactivity of the truck loads of ore. (4) The Ranger operation manual states that 'the grade control system is under constant check. Checks are continually made during all stages of the grade control process by monitoring grade from the blasthole to loader to truck to discriminator and to dumping destination'. As part of this ore grade control, 'the discriminator operation is calibrated as required by the use of a standard load of known grade or by detailed radiometry of loads by a calibrated scintillometer'. The manual did not specify the frequency of these calibration checks (5) It is clear that the checking procedures failed on this occasion to indicate a malfunction either due to their ineffectiveness or to their not being properly implemented. (6) Ranger has advised the Supervising Scientist, the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy, and the Northern Land Council, that the average grade of the misplaced material determined from 65 assays taken from 16 sample holes drilled across the waste rock dump was 0.027% uranium, compared with the 0.02% limit defined for material. Gamma ray measurements carried out by OSS confirm that that part of the waste rock dump where the material was placed has a higher level of radioactivity than surrounding areas of the waste rock dump. (7) Ranger provided initial oral advice on Friday 25 November 1988 to the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy. It is not known precisely when Ranger first became aware of the malfunction. (8) See answer to question (7). (9) A written 'Report of Infringement' was provided by Ranger to the Supervising Scientist, the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy, and the Northern Land Council on the afternoon of Monday 28 November 1988. (10) The dates on which the malfunction occurred are indeterminate so that the period of time that elapsed between the initial malfunction and notification to the Supervising Scientist is unknown. (II) Under Environmental Requirement 7 all material must be stored within Ranger's Restricted Release Zone (RRZ). The waste rock dump is outside the RRZ and placement of material outside the RRZ is an infringement of the Environmental Requirements. On 26 November the section of waste rock dump containing the misplaced uranium material was incorporated into a redefined RRZ. A bund was constructed around this section to ensure that surface runoff drained into the RRZ. The question of whether or not seepage from this part of the waste rock dump has been prevented from leaving the redefined RRZ by the use of best practicable technology, as required under Environmental Requirement 7 (f), is still to be resolved. (12) See answer to question (13). (13) On 9 December 1988, the Acting Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Mr Holding, asked Energy Resources of Australia Limited (ERA) (Ranger's parent company) in writing a number of questions about the incident. ERA responded by letter dated 16 December 1988. On 16 December 1988, the Supervising Scientist advised Ranger to ensure that in its report to Government on the incident certain specific matters were dealt with. A further report has been provided to Government on 10 April 1989 that addresses calibration procedures used in grade control (see answer to question (4». This latest report still does not address all the matters specified by the Supervising Scientist and certain questions still remain to be answered. These include what is to be done with the misplaced material, and the measures to be taken to reduce seepage to outside the RRZ using best practicable technology. (14) Enforcement of the existing arrangements that require Ranger to notify the Northllrn Territory Department of Mines and Energy by telephone of any infringement, and as soon as practicable by confirmation telex copied to the Supervising Scientist and the Northern Land Council. (15) No. Ranger's response to date has been to redraw the boundary of the RRZ (see answers to questions (II) and (13». (16) See answer to question (15). ( 17) Yes; see answers to questions (11) and (13). (18) The Supervising Scientist advises that there is little environmental reason at this time to place Retention Pond 4 (RP4) in the RRZ as a consequence of the misplacement of material on the waste rock dump. It is necessary, however, that the release of water from RP4, which collects some runoff and seepage from the waste rock dumps, continues to be properly controlled and monitored to ensure that there is sufficient dilution of the released water in Magela Creek to avoid adverse effects on the aquatic environment of the Magela Creek system. (19) Yes. The Supervising Scientist has advised that the 1989 Wet season environmental toxicity tests have shown that waters from RP4 when mixed with Magela Creek water can produce toxic responses in certain aquatic organisms. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that these effects are related to the misplaced material. The Supervising Scientist has also advised that because the method of release that was used does not enable the dilution of the released water in Magela Creek to be controlled, he is not able to state with confidence that aquatic organisms in Mage!a Creek are unlikely to be affected. (20) Yes. Water was released from RP4 by siphoning over a spillway after which it flowed for a short distance into the nearby Djalkmara billabong which is connected to Magela Creek. Depending on the flow rate in Mage!a Creek and rainfall at the mine site, water in Djalkmara Billabong will eventually flow into Magela Creek but only at some indeterminate rate and after some indefinite delay. (21) Yes. The Supervising Scientist is of the view that this method of discharge is inferior to release from a pipeline direct to Magela Creek where rapid known dilution and dispersion can occur. The actual method used for release (siphon discharge and disposal into a billabong) draws discharge water from the bottom of the pond, does not allow the discharge rate to be readily adjusted, does not enable rapid dilution and dispersion, and does not allow a known minimum dilution ratio to be achieved in the waters of Mage!a Creek. Hence, the degree of protection of the Magela Creek ecosystem that is achieved cannot be accurately determined, but is less than the protection which could be achieved by use of the available pipeline. (22) Yes; see answer to question (19). (23) Uranium and radium levels in RP4 in October 1988 ranged from 300-400 ug/L and 300-600 mBq/L respectively. At the time of release of RP4 waters on 20-22 February 1989 the uranium level was about 50 ug/L; the radium level was estimated to be about 200 mBq/L. These concentrations are about the same as those measured in February in each of the past 3 years. (24) Yes. On 19 January 1989 the Chairman of the Northern Land Council issued a press statement in which he noted that ' Mr Coulter has issued an authorisation providing for release from RP4 this Wet season. This authorisation should be withdrawn until this whole issue is resolved'. (25) Yes. Senator Richardson is consulting with Mr Kerin about the appropriate means of ensuring that Commonwealth environment protection requirements are enforced. (26) See answer to question (25). International Monetary Fund (Question No. 1642) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 7 March 1989: (1) Is Australia supporting a new quota increase . for the International Monetary Fund (IMF); if so, what level of increase is Australia supporting. (2) Is Australia co-operating with the April 1989 deadline set by the Interim Committee of the IMF Board of Governors for agreement on the increase.",105
142,Mr KEATING ,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) During the ongoing Ninth General Review of Quotas Australia has consistently argued for a substantial increase in quotas to help preserve the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) central role in the international monetary system. Australia's position on this issue was reaffirmed by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer at the IMF's Interim Committee meeting held in Washington in April 1989. (2) In my statement to the September 1988 Interim Committee meeting, I expressed the desire for there to be an early agreement on the quota issue. While in the following months the Fund's Executive Board continued its work on the Review, it was not possible to reach agreement on the principal issues prior to the April 1989 deadline. Consequently, at its meeting in April 1989 the Interim Committee meeting urged the Executive Board to complete its work so that the Review could be concluded before the end of 1989. The end of year deadline has recently been formally endorsed by the Governors of the Fund. As Governor of the IMF for Australia, I voted in favour of that Board of Governors' Resolution. Nursing Homes (Question No. 1699) Dr Woods asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (1) Is it a fact that there is no time limit within which his Department is required to pay nursing home residents fees loadings. (2) Was there a statutory limit of two months for fees applications to be processed by his Department. (3) Are some nursing homes still waiting for fees loadings for the 1985-86 financial year and that many are only now starting to get approvals for 1986-87. (4) Why does his Department continue to spread loadings over extended periods. (5) Will he take steps to expedite payment of nursing home residents fees loadings. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. However, it has been the general policy to spread loadings over a twelve month period. If loadings were paid out or recouped immediately, this could have severe financial implications for those nursing homes with negative loadings, i.e. homes which had been over-funded and which were 'obliged to refund the amount of over-funding. There is also a need to' safeguard the position of certain residents who do not have Commonwealth benefits paid for them, e.g. workers' compensation and third party recipients. These residents pay the full nursing home fee, including any loading. A policy of immediate payment of loadings could impose a very large and unexpected lump-sum cost on such residents; These considerations have led the largest nursing home industry body to support the existing policy on duration of loadings .. (2) No. However, section 40AD (I D) of the National Health Act provides that, in the event of an application to alter the conditions applicable to a nursing home not being processed within two months of the lodgement, the proprietor may elect to have the application deemed to have been refused. Where these circumstances apply, the proprietor may request the Minister to review the deemed refusal under section 40AE (2) of the Act. (3) In some instances, the reconciliation of the 1985-86 financial statements (NH 19s) has been delayed owing to insufficient information being provided by the proprietor or where the Department has itself had to obtain additional information. While the processing of some of the outstanding cases will lead to positive loadings (i.e. additional payments to proprietors), others will produce negative loadings. Processing of the financial statements for 1986-87 is well under way and all claims for both financial years are expected to be finalised by 30 June 1989. (4) See (I) above. (5) Yes. Resources have already been allocated in all State Offices to expedite the processing of nursing home fee applications. Roads: Queensland (Question No. 1716) Mr Wright asked the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, upon notice,. on 4 April 1989: (1) What sums have been provided by the Federal Government (a) directly for roads and (b) indirectly to the State and local authorities in untied grants used for roads in respect of (i) the electoral division of Capricornia (ii) the Central Queensland (State) Main Roads District and (iii) the State of Queensland for each of (A) 1986-87 (B) 1987-88 and (C) 1988-89. (2) What increases have occurred in local government and State expenditure on roads for each year since 1983. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I)(a) In the case of sums provided directly for roads the figures shown in (i) and (ii) are individual project approvals ,plus local road allocations to Councils in the particular years. The figures shown in (iii) are actual allocations to the State shown in the Budget Papers.

Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Question No. 1725) Mr lIoliis asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 5 April 1989: Has the Minister's attention. been drawn to an article which was published in the Melbourne Herald of 27 February 1989 under the heading ""Harvey Barnett, ASIO's chief of staff from 1981 to 1985, believes we are under threat-He singles out China's activities"" and in the Brisbane Courier-Mail of 2 March 1989 under the heading ""Selling ourselves short to the Chinese""; if so, is the Minister able to say whether the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) undertook a pre-publication review of the manuscript for the article.",107
143,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,EXPENDITURE ON ROADS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that ASIO did not undertake a review of the article in question. An examination of the article indicates no reason why they should have done so. National Health Promotion Program (Question No. 1737) Mr Smith asked the Minister for Community Services' and Health, upon notice, on 6· April 1989:(I) What sum is granted under the National Health Promotion Program for the publication, the ""Body Book"". (2) In respect of that publication (a) when was it first published, (b) how often is it published, (c) how many copies of each edition are printed, (d) who receives copies, and (e) how. are they distributed. (3) Is he able to say whether other organisations provide funds for the publication; if so, what (a) are their names and (b) does each contribute? (4) Why did' the Government contribute to the preparation .of the publication. (5) Is he able to say to what degree the publication succeeds in transmitting its message to its target audience.",109
144,Dr BLEWETT ,EXPENDITURE ON ROADS,"-'--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Australian Medical Association (AMA) received a grant of $200 ODD, to produce the ""Body Book""-an update of a 1986 publication, 'Your Body-The Facts"". (i) (a) February 1989. (b) The '-Body Book"" has been published once before in 1986 as ""Your Body-The Facts"". (c) A total of 200000 copies of the ""Body Book"" have been printed. ' ., (d) Individuals and organisations. (e) Copies of the ""Body Book"" are currently being distributed by the Department of Community Services and Health when requested. The Department has distributed the -'Body Book"" to tertiary institu. tions, T AFE colleges, secondary schools, youth access centres, youth bureaux, counselJing services, church groups, the AIDS distribution network, and to individuals in response to requests. Other distribution points are the Youth Bureau, the Australian Medical - ssociation, Virgin Records retail outlets and 'Express Australia', a specialist youth media organisation that was contracted by AMA to produce the publication. (3) Funding for the publication of the ""Body Book"" was provided to the AM.A who have carriage of this project. I am, therefore, not in a position to identify other organisations who have contributed to this project. (4) The Government recognises that the young people of this country are its most important resource and believes it is important to provide information, vital to their health arid well-being, in a style which reflects youth culture. The AMA received funds to revise an earlier pubPublication lication ""Your Body-The Facts"" which, on evaluation, showed that most young people wanted reasonably sophisticated information presented in a fashion comparable to the type of magazines they read. The need for this type of publication, is in. response to an increasing incidem:e of suicides, drinkdriving accidents, and sexually-transmitted diseases· including AIDS, among young Australians. The ""Body Book"" covers important health issues. affecting young people today, i.e. nutrition and fitness, relationships and sex, coping with stress, drugs, AIDS and other illnesses. It also offers valuable information on sources of health and welfare assistance. (5) 'Express Australia' will be conducting research and evaluation in order to gauge its acceptance. Early indications suggest that there is great demand for a publication of this type in the community. My Department has received encouraging responses to the book, mainly from younger people. Importation of Wildlife (Question No- 1738) Mr Macphee asked the Minister' representing 'the. Minister for the Arts, Sport, the EnviroQment, TOUriSIll and Territories, upon notice, ,on 6, April 1989: J (I) Is it a fact that Mr W. Anderson, owner of Tipperary Station in the Northern Territory, has been' permitted to bring zebras, hippopotamuses and other exotic species into Australia. (2) Does the Wildlife Protectioh (Regulation of Imports and Exports) Act 1982 allow theimportation of these species; if so, under what conditiohS. (3) If Mr Anderson has imported these species contrary to the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Imports and Exports) Act 1982, will the Minister take action against him; if not, why not. (4) Has the Minister spoken personally with Mr Anderson about any irriportation of protected species; if so, what was the nature of those discussions. (5) What other species has Mr Anderson ported into Australia.",109
145,Mr HOLDING ,EXPENDITURE ON ROADS,"The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territo tories has provided the following answer the honourable member's question: (1) Tipperary Zoo is situated on Tipperary tion and has been accredited the status of a high security B Class Zoo by the Australian Quarantine. and Inspection Service (AQIS), subject to individual approval being given for each species applied for by Tipperary Zoo. Approval of the premises for. the holding of hippopotamus, Grevy's zebra and sitatunga at Tipperary Station was given by AQIS and the Vertebrate Pests Committee (VPC). The Grevy's zebra, sitatunga and nile hippopotamus were transferred to Tipperary Zoo from Perth Zoo and TarongaZoo. These zoos are approved to import these species and their transfer to Tipperary was subject to the necessary approvals of the facilities available for these animals being granted by the C""'bnservation Commission of the Northern Territory, VPC and AQIS. Other exotic animals present at Tipperary Zoo have been obtained from wildlife parks, B Class Zoos and deer farms in Australia. Mr Anderson has also been approved to hold Przewalski horses at his property 'Fernhill' in NSW. (2) Yes. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 requires specific matters to be satisfied prior to approval being granted to allow importation· from overseas. In summary, these are: import will not be detrimental to the survival of Rural Outreach . the species (Section 33); the recipient can confine, provide suitable care for Peer Education Continuation and will provide safe transportation (Section 34); People Living with AIDS Conference the recipient is approved to receive the specific species to be imported (Section II); and the animals will not be kept or dealt with in contravention of a law of the Commonwealth, or a State or Territory (Section 35). (3) See response to (I) above. (4) The Minister did meet with Mr Anderson to discl1ss the. importatio.n of. Przewalski horses. (5) As mentioned in (I) above, Mr Anderson, as owner of 'Fernhill'., Mulgoa NSW 2750, has been approved to import. Przewalski horses .from the United Kingdom to be kept at the 'Fernhill' prop-. erty. This approval was provided after the reql!irements, outlined at (2) above, had been satisfied and the importation approved by the VPC and AqIS.

This was in the nature of market research to assess whether the work should be done in-house by TSG or contracted out. (2) 15 expressions of interest were received from panel contractors and one from the National Freight Organisation. The same secure processes observed for the handling of domestic removals quotes were used to preclude the National Freight Organisation from having access to, or knowledge of, the panel contractors' proposals. (3), (4) and (5) The National Freight Organisation's proposal was competitive with those of the panel contractors. Accordingly, it was decided that the work should be performed in-house. Had it been proposed to invite formal tenders instead of the intended market research, the requirement would have been passed to the Purchasing and Sales Group within my Department which has responsibility for calling tenders and issuing contracts for such services and provides an effective independent and unbiased interface between Government agencies and the private sector. Housing Assistance (Question No. 1775) Mr Downer asked the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, upon notice, on 13 April 1989: (I) What grants for specific housing assistance, as required in sub-paragraph 43 (1) (a) (ii) of the Housing AssistaJ:lce Act 1984, have been allocated to (a) South Australia, (b) New South Wales, (c) Victoria, (d) Western Australia, (e) Tasmania and (f) Queensland in each year since 1985.

(2) Are the services directly in line with costs which Telecom must meet to provide those services. (3) Has the Government made any inquiry into the effect the increases may have on the viability of smalI businesses, many of which depend on such services for security systems and for computerised booking systems.",110
147,Mrs KELLY ,AIDS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Since 1981 Telecom has undertaken a number of cost studies into leased line tariffs. These internal and external studies of leased lines identified significant underpricing and consequently their poor financial performance, particularly for short-distance leased lines. The commercial basis for tariff increases on all Telecom private lines has two parts; that leased line local loop charges should approximate the basic telephone access tariffs for business services and that leased line charges in general should be increased in line with basic telephone tariffs. (2) No. Despite a closer alignment of leased line charges with costs Telecom considers that the charges still do not give it a satisfactory financial return on the service. $ million (3) No. Securitel Network (Question No. 1783) EmptyHere munications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 2 May 1989: (1) Does the Securitel .network operate only in $ million Sydney and Melbourne, and in Brisbane on a test basis. (2) When will Adelaide receive this service.",116
148,Mrs KELLY ,AIDS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows: (I) The Securitel service is currently available in Sydney and Melbourne only. It will be available in $ million the Gold Coast area from August 1989. (2) Adelaide will receive this service during the next phase of network expansion. This is currently scheduled for the last quarter of 1990. Industrial Research and Development Grants (Question No. 1789) Mr Smith asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 3 May 1989: ( I) How many (a) companies, (b) organisa tions, (c) institutions and (d) individuals were sent the green triangular package, which included a billiard ball, promoting industrial research and development grants. (2) What was the (a) unit cost and (b) total cost, including postage, of the package. (3) What was the (a) name of, and (b) sum paid to, the consultant who designed the packaging concept. (4) Why was it thought necessary for the information contained in the package to be presented in this way. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) (a) 1914 (b) 5 (c) nil (d) 1919 Note: A total of 1919 kits were circulated in the direct mail campaign. All kits were addressed to an individual in an organisation and more than 1 individual in each company may have received a kit. (2a) The unit costs were: Brochure $1.94, Snooker BalI $4.80, Wood Base $2.20, Rectangular Package $4.45. (2b) The total cost of the package was $19.97. This included the cost of packaging ($4.50) and postage ($2.08). (3a) Mark Sturgiss and Associates were the consultants who designed the packaging concept. (3b) $101,802.02. (4) The campaign was undertaken after a significant amount of market research and analysis had been undertaken, by the Industry Research & Development Board's secretariat, to assess industry's attitude to R&D and the uptake of the 150% R&D tax incentive. That market research found, among other things, that: Australian managers did not understand the need for R&D and there was little communication, by market directors to research divisions of Australian companies, on export opportunities that R&D can provide; although nearly 90% of leading executives were aware of the incentive, it seldom influenced their R&D investment decisions, due in large part to lack of knowledge of its operations; there was a high level of ignorance, disinterest and negative attitudes by tax advisers towards R&D and the incentive; the research community lacked the knowledge as to how the incentive worked and its generosity or applicability to them; there appeared to be insufficient emphasis, in industry, on high level or product research (in contrast to low level improvements or process R&D); R&D was perceived as a high-risk activity by non-performers; and R&D programs were linked to profit, rather than to a company's capital base. There remains a great need for Australian companies to invest in innovation as we still spend less than half the amount our overseas competitors spend on R&D. Australian business R&D represents about 0.42% of GOP, compared with an OECD average of around 1.2%. In its present structure, Australian industry expenditure on R&D should be about 1%. After consideration of the market analysis, the Industry Research & Development Board decided that there clearly was a great need to market the essentiality and benefits of innovation, and the government support available to Australian companies to become more innovative. Neither the Department or the Board had the expertise to develop a campaign to market the benefits of R&D to the target audiences-the decision makers in industry. Consequently, the Department, in co-operation with the Governments's information bureau (now the Office of Government Information & Advertising), sought to engage a contractor to advise on the campaign. After consideration of a number of marketing specialists, using the advertising agency register, four were short listed for the contract. Each was provided with additional information on the objectives of the campaign and each made a presentation to a selection panel. All proposed a media campaign and two included a direct mail campaign, although the remaining two recommended that direct mailing should be part of the campaign if we were to ensure penetration of our message. The panel selected Mark Sturgiss & Associate. The campaign comprised two components: a direct mail campaign, sent to industry decision makers, and a media campaign, aimed at raising public awareness of the benefits of innovation . .The direct marketing component included a billiard ball, with the Industry Research and Development Australia logo and contact number, and stand, so that it could be used as a paperweight, to provide a permanent reminder of the availability of R&D assistance, to fit into the campaign concept and to significantly increase the likelihood that the decision makers, the addressees of the direct mail packages, would focus on the R&D message being conveyed. The ""It's your break"" campaign aimed to redress the problems identified in the market research. The campaign promoted the benefits to companies of R&D: growth, sales, profits, new markets and new product lines, exports, quality and skills development. It gives a clear message that R&D must be a part of every Australian company's strategy if we are to increase our share of world markets. The campaign advised on assistance available to companies doing R&D, with the major focus being the 150% R&D tax incentive. It provided broad details and effective contact advice on Government programs to encourage Australian companies to become more innovative. When consideration is given to the total support for industry research and development through the tax incentive alone (around 1.5 billion) the cost of this innovative campaign is extremely small. Crude Oil Exploration (Question No. 1791) Mr Smith asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 3 May 1989: ( I) What proportion of Australian terri tory, onshore and offshore, has not been thoroughly explored for crude oil. (2) What is the history of the Bureau of Mineral Resources' estimates of undiscovered crude oil resources in Australian territory since 1950. (3) What factors have been responsible for any significant shift in the Bureau's estimates. (4) Is there any level at which the proportion of oil exploration risk capital going overseas would cause the Government concern, if not, why not. (5) What has been the level of Australian ownership of proven and producing oil reserves since 1950. (6) What factors have caused any significant shifts in Australian ownership. (7) Is there any level at which the proportion of Australian ownership of proven and producing oil reserves would cause the Government concern, if not, why not. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Australia as a whole has been only sparsely explored for crude oil compared with some more highly prospective countries, such as the continental USA. Australian sedimentary basins that BMR considers to have been moderately well explored by Australian standards are parts of the Surat/Bowen Basins in Queensland and the Cooper /Eromanga Basins in South Australia and Queensland onshore, and the Gippsland Basin offshore from Victoria and the Carnarvon Basin offshore from Western Australia. Other parts of these basins remain comparatively lightly explored. The more intensely explored parts of these basins total about 350,000 km2, which is about 4.7 per cent of the total area underlain by BMR's ESTIMATES of Australia's undiscovered oil resources Year of estimate 1979. 1983. 1984. 1986. These estimates are based on assessment of the Australian .continent and the adjacent offshore areas. They do not include Australia's external territories. They include only conventional oil that will be identified in new field discoveries, but do not include estimates of future additions to reserves in currently identified fields. Neither do they include estimates of Australia's undiscovered condensate resources. (3) Although each estimate covered a range of probabilities of occurrence, it is convenient for the purpose of comparing estimates to consider the average values of each estimate. It is clear from the above table that BMR's average estimates have not shown any significant shift since quantitative estimates were first published in 1979. The 1983 average estimate of 3000 million barrels is a little higher than the other estimates. This estimate is seen in retrospect by BMR to have been too high because it was partly based on early very optimistic company estimates of the size of the Jabiru oil field in the Timor Sea, and the expectation that large fields might occur in that region. Such expectations were not realised by subsequent appraisal drilling of Jabiru and further wildcat drilling in the sedimentary basins and 3.3 per cent of the total area of continental Australia and adjacent offshore areas to the 1000m isobath. Australia's external territories, which tend to be remote and difficult to exploit for petroleum, remain practically unexplored for crude oil, although BMR and some other organisations have carried out reconnaissance geophysical surveys over some parts of these territories. (2) The history of the Bureau of Mineral Resources' estimates of undiscovered crude oil resources in Australia (and estimates published by others) is summarised in a paper by Mr C. S. Robertson of BMR, published in the APEA Journal, 1988. As indicated in the paper, BMR officers published qualitative judgments about the relative prospectiveness of various parts of Australia as early as the 1950s, but BMR did not publish any quantitative estimates of Australia's undiscovered crude oil resources based on detailed scientific analysis until 1979. The following table shows the results of the 1979 estimate and estimates which have been published by BMR since 1979. The last estimate was made in 1986. Table I in millions of barrels (millions of kilolitres) 80 per cent 50 per cent 20 per cent probability probability Average probability estimate estimate estimate estimate 950 1800 2600 3800 (ISO) (290) (410) (600) 1900 2600 3000 3800 (300) (410) (480) (600) 950 1800 2600 3800 (150) (290) (410) (600) 1200 1800 2400 2900 (190) (290) (380) (460) area, and BMR's later estimates have been revised downwards accordingly. The fact that BMR's estimates made over the last ten years have not declined significantly, although several hundred million barrels of crude oil have been discovered in new fields during the period, indicates that BMR's assessment of Australia's ultimate crude oil potential (identified and undiscovered) has risen slightly since 1979. BMR is currently carrying out a reassessment of Australia's undiscovered petroleum resources which will take into account new geoscientific ideas and recent promising discoveries such as the Wanaea and Montara oil fields and the Echo gas/condensate field on the North West Shelf. It is planned to publish this new assessment during 1989. (4) An oil industry survey published by the Australian Petroleum Exploration Society (APEA) in December 1988 indicated that of the exploration expenditure planned for 1989 by companies operating in Australia, approximately 37% would be spent on activities outside Australia. The majority of this activity outside Australia is being undertaken by mature Australian companies seeking to spread their exploration risks-an approach essential to the survival of companies in this high risk industry. Rather than acting to the detriment of Australia's economy, successful ventures will contribute to its growth, as they will benefit the countries in which discoveries are made. Australia has also sought to take advantage of the practice of petroleum companies seeking to spread exploration risks by welcoming foreign investment in the Australian petroleum exploration and developrnent industry. The evidence to date in terms of new or increasing activity by overseas-based companies in Australia, points to success in this regard and supports the view that overall taxation levels applying to the petroleum industry in Australia are internationally competitive. (5), (6) and (7) The level of Australian ownership of proven and producing oil reserves has varied in the past as discoveries are made and the composition of joint venture groups with rights to those discoveries has changed. In February 1988, the Government removed the requirement in the foreign investment policy for at least 50% Australian ownership and control of petroleum development projects, unless contrary to the national interest. In announcing this decision, the Government recognised that Australia was guaranteed an appropriate share of the economic rent arising from petroleum development projects, through the secondary taxation arrangements of either resource rent taxation, or excise and royalty, as well as the general company taxation arrangements. No minimum level of Australan ownership has applied at the exploration stage and hence to proven reserves. Australian Bicentennial Authority (Question No. 1793) Mr N. A. Brown asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 3 May 1989: ([) Has his attention been drawn to the fact that the Australian Bicentennial Authority submitted, in proceedings before the Australian Industria[ Re[ations Commission (C No. 50228 of [988), that it is not a Commonwealth authority. (2) How is the Australian Bicentennial Authority legally constituted. (3) Did the Authority lose the proceedings referred to in part (I). (4) Has the Authority lodged an appeal to a Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission against the decision. (5) What has been the cost to (a) the Authority and (b) the Commonwealth of these proceedings so far. (6) What is the estimated cost of the appeal. '\ EmptyHere honourable member's question is as follows: ([) I am aware of the case. I understand that the Authority submitted to the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that it was not a Commonjust wealth authority within the meaning of s70A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904. (2) The Australian Bicentennial Authority was established by incorporation as a company limited by guarantee under the Companies Ordinance 1962 of the Australian Capital Territory, with its operations jointly regulated by the Ordinance and the Australian Bicentennial Authority Act 1980. (3) Commissioner Lewin found, in his decision of 22 March' [989, that the Authority is a 'Commonwealth authority' for the purposes of Division lA of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 and therefore the Commission had jurisdiction to hear the dispute. (4) A Notice of Appea[ was lodged with the Industrial Re[ations Commission but instructions have been given to withdraw the appeal. (5) (a) The Authority has advised me that the cost to the Authority of these proceedings has been $4,683.80 (b) No additional costs have been incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to these proceedings. (6) Not applicable. Skyhawk Aircraft (Question No. 1794) Mr White asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 4 May 1989: Does the Government intend to enter into an agreement with the New Zealand Government whereby NZ A4 Skyhawk aircraft would be used for RAN fleet support duties; if so: (a) when is the arrangement likely to take effect, (b) for how long is it expected to operate, (c) how many (i) NZ, and (ii) Australian defence force personnel will . "" be involved, (d) what' duties will be undertaken by the NZ aircraft, (e) how many hours per year are the aircraft expected to fly, (f) will Australian pilots be flying the aircraft, and (g) what is the cost of the arrangement in terms of: (i) aircraft costs, (ii) support costs, and (iii) provision of facilities and administrative and support costs for the NZ detachment.",116

However, the arrangements as currently proposed, provide for New Zealand to meet the costs of the first 400 'on-task' hours tog-ther with associated transit hours. ; (ii) The anuual cost to the Australian Defence Force of supporting the detachment under the currently proposed arrangements is estimated to be $1.3m in Budget 1,988 prices. ,Not included in this amount is a proposal for the estabIlshment of a stock of flight critical Skyhawk spares and rotables. The proposal is estimated to require up-front funding of $2.6f11. Arrangements to recover such fl,l,nds are yet to be negotiated but ar,e, expected to be based on actual - sage rates. (iii) T-e provision of facilities is estimated to cost the Australian Defence Force between $3.2m and $5.4m, in Budget 1988 prices, depending on actual facilities required. Administrative costs have not been quantified but are considered to be negligible. For support costs see (g) (ii) above. Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 4 May 1989: Is the Minister able to say whether international or, Australian law enforcement agencies were notified of crimin\ll charges against Mr B.. Pierson, who is w<lnted in San Diego, USA; ,if, so, was this information provided or available, to (a) the Victorian Police; (b) the COIl1monwealth Dep<lrtment of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs; or (C) State' government departments or offices of Immigration, where they exist.",119
150,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AIDS,"The Minister for Justice has provided the following answe- to the honourable member's question: Following a request by the Victorian Police to Interpol, 'the Interpol Bureau in Washington forwarded particulars to the Canberra Bureau on 4 December 1987, concerning criminal ,charges against Pierson for which he was wanted in San Diego by US authorities. On 23,February 1988 the Canberra Bureau was further advised by the Washington Bure-u that, Pierson had prior convictions for carrying a weapon and sex o,ffences against children., On 25 February 1988 the Australian Federal Police (AFP) was advised by the, J - egal Att-che with the US Embassy that Pierson was a fugitive from San Diego and that a warrant for his arrest was in existence for multiple counts of sexual offenc- with children. (a) Yes; , (b) and (c), Interpol's Canberra Bureau has advised that it does not know whether the Victorian Police, which originated the Interpol request on Pierson, 'disseminated the'inforrhatioil it received to Commonwealth or State Government' departments. Interpol policy is that when a' police, force reqiiests information through' Interpol, that information is provided only to the'requ'estin'g agency. TheAFP has also advised that on II Novemher 1987 a Passenger Alert was raised in relation to Pierson by the AFP at the request of the Victorian Police due to alleged fraud offences committed by Pierson in that State. This 'alert was amended and updated in February 1988 in light ,of the information provided by the Legal Attache'with the US Embassy. I am further <Idyised that the AFP did not specifically forward infqrmationto the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs as it was not the 'investigating agency in this matter. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs did; as a user of the system, have access to information of Pierson Which was placed on the Passenger Alert. ApprentiCeship 'Training in the Publi, Sector ' (Questio- No. 1797)",120

(2) Does the Agreement provide for a framework of setting rent for public tenants which meets the Federal Government's equity objectives. (3) What is the percentage of market rent recovered, under the agreement, by the housing department or authority of each State and Territory. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) Total funds for public housing received in 1988-89 under the Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement (CSHA) New South Wales Victoria Queensland Western Australia South Australia Tasmania 24,231 Northern Territory (b) Funds recevied per. capita in 1988-89 under the Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement.

Nu'clear Waste: Storage (Question No. 1827) EmptyHere Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 8 May 1989: (1) Was provision made in the 1988-89 Budget for a study of the feasibility of establishing a national storage of nuclear waste; if so, (a) what sum was allocated and (b) has any State or Territory taken up an offer by the Federal Government to fund such a study. (2) At what sites in Sydney's western suburbs is nuclear waste stored. . (3) What is the (a) type and (b) amoJnt of nuclear waste stored at each site. . (4) Will he consult with his NSW counterpart with a view to identifying a temporary State storage site away from population centres, pending the identification of a. suitable national site. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Funds were provided in the 1988-89 Budget for a feasibility study on establishing a national repository for low-level radioactive waste. (a) $\00,000 ($'000) (b) The Northern Territory Government has ex228,225 pressed interest in hosting a national low-level 164,480 radioactive waste repository and requested 116,161 $100,000 from the Commonwealth to conduct 69,680 a feasibility study into establishing such a 66,656 facility in the Territory. 30,567 (2) and (3) I refer the honourable member to Appendix II of the Report ""Investigation of National $700,000 Storage and Burial Facilities for Radioactive Wastes Arising from the Medical, Industrial and Research Use of Radionuclides in Australia"" prepared by a Commonwealth-State Consultative Committee. I understand my Department forwarded a copy of the ($) Report to the honourable member in October 1988. 39.93 A copy of the Report is also available from the 38.48 Parliamentary Library. (4) No. While the Commonwealth is co-ordinating efforts to establish a national low-level radioactive waste repository, each Government is responsible for temporary storage of radioactive wastes generated within its jurisdiction. The Commonwealth's lowlevel radioactive wastes are securely and safely held at their current storage sites 'where it is anticipated they will, remain pending establishment ,of a national low-level radioactive waste repository. I am not aware of any plans by the NSW Government to establish an alternative storage facility for wastes it currently holds in Sydney. (Question No. 1829) EmptyHere munications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 8 May 1989: (I) Does the existi-g model on ,Telecom'- Red Phone exp-rience problems with ,coins or other articles blocking the coin chute. ' (2) Hils a new model, called the Blue, Phone;, which, aqlong other fea-ures, does not have this weaknesS, been developed and marketed by Telecom. (3) If this model has been develbped and marketed, is it being manufactured overseas; if so, (a) in what country and (b) what is the (i) value of the imports of the model for 1988-89 and (ii) the projectedvalue of imports for theHfe of the model. (4) Was the model developed in Telecom's own workshop or elsewhere in Australia. (5) If the model was developed in Australia but is being manufactured overseas, why isn't it being manufactured in Australia.",122
157,Mrs KELLY ,AIDS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as f()l1ows: (I) Yes., This is ,a major fault problem. Apart from causing annoyance to users, ,rectification of faults wastes valuable technical labour. (2) Thi:'hew Blue Phone now being marketed by TeleCom throughout Australia is not prone to this problem. Also, if the coin tin becomes full the proprietor has access to the coin mechanism within the instrument to clear the coins. The instrument was developed by G. E. C. Plessey Telecommunications (GPT) of the United Kingdom and .the design, has been modified by, Telecom for Australian 'conditio'ns. (?) (a), The Blue - hone is initially being manufactured and assembled by GPT in the United Kingdom but after the first '10,000 units; all units will be assembled in' GPT's new facility atSilverwater, NSW using parts imported from the UK. The company's local assembly line has already commenced operations and the' intention is to increase the local content as expertise develops: (b) (i) The estimated value of imported Blue Phones in 1988-89 is $A3.5 million. (ii) The projected value of imports (complete units and parts for local assembly) for current supply contracts is $AI6.25m, not including customs duty and sales tax. The life ' of the model is naturally dependent on continuing market acceptance and it is too early in the product cycle to be definitive beyond June, 1990. Telephones (4) No. (5) Not applicable. Abortions (Question No. 1830) Mr Beale asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 8 May 1989: (I) How many abortions were carried out in Australia in 1988, ,2) What suIT! was paid under Medicare for those abortions. (3) How many of the abortions were carried out as a consequence of the mother's health. (4) How much of his Department's allocation' for 'family planning information, education, training, counselling, research and clinical activities' in '198889 is spent on (a) family planning information, (b) education, (c) training, (d) counselling, (e) research and (f) clinical activities. (5) What proportion of the allocation for clinical activities is spent to provide actual ,abortions.",125
158,Dr BLEWETT ,AIDS,"The answer to the' honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Data are not available/ on the total number of ' abortions carried out in Australia in 1988 as my Department does, not collect such statistics. (2) The medical service included in the Schedule to the Health Insurance Act which results in the termination of pregnancy appears in the Medicare Benefits Schedule as follows: 'Item 6469-Evacuation of the contents of the gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage not covered by Item 6460/6464'. "" In 1988, total Commonwealth Medicare benefits paid for services covered by, Item 6469, to patients on a fee-for-service basis was $6,518,120 covering 62,498 services. Services provided to public patients are covered by Medicare grants to the States and no charges are raised for such services. These are global amounts not related to particular types of services. (3) As no statistics are maintained on abortions, no information is available on the circumstances leading to the performance of abortions. In particular, as medical practitioners are not required to give reasons for carrying out medical procedures in,billing patients; there is no data on the reasons for performance of Item 6469. (4) It is not possible to apportion fully Departmental allocations for family planning services among each of the Categories nominated in the question. However, it is possible to disaggregate funding on the following basis: (a) irlformation, (b) education and (c) training . . . . . . . . . . (d) counselling and (f) clinical activities (e) research . . . . .' : . . . . (5) Nil. Crude Oil Transportation (Que-tion No-, 1834) Mr Smith asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 11 May 1989: (i) ,Is the Minister able to say what proportion of the world traffic in crude oil is transported by tankers; if so, what proportion of the traffic, in crude, oil is transported in (a) supertankers, being tankers in excess of 250 000 tonnes deadweight, and (b) medium sized vessels. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether the present fleet of tankers can cope with the projected demand for oil imports. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether any of the supertankers currently not in service could be brought back into service in the event of an increase in world oil trade. . ' (4) What proportion of the cost of imported oil to the Australian consumer' is attributable to shipping costs. (5) Has the proportion referred to in part (4) changed significantly since 1975, if so, in what way. (6) Is the Minister able to say whether reports that the world is on the verge of a tanker shortage which could quadruple freight rates are, correct. ' Mr Kerin-The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The BP Statistical Review of World EnergyJune 1988 indicates that 31 per cent of the world's crude oil production of 2 925.2 million tonnes in 1987 was transported by tankers .. (a) approximately 50 per cent. (b) approximately 50 per cent. (2) The authoritive John I Jacobs ""World Tanker Fleet Review"" .estimated the. world tanker fleet to total 239.4 million deadweight tonnes at 30 June 1988, of which 75.6 million tonnes was surplus to requirements. The surplus included 8:2 million tonnes of laid-up tonnage. A further 18.8 million tonnes of new tonnage was on 'order: New tonnage, in excess of tonnage being replaced, is forecast to be required before the year 2000 if the world demand for oil continues to grow. . (3) Some of the Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC's), being vessels)- excess of 160 000 dead$'OOOs weight tonnes, which' are currently laid-up could be brought back into service in the event of an increase in the world oil trade. However, some of these 1360 vessels are old and not well suited to today's require10086 ments and will need to be replaced. As a conse47 quence the ordering of new vessels is continuing and has in fact lately been increasing. 11,493 ( 4) ,The proportion of the cost of imported oil to the Australian consumer, which is attributable to shipping costs changes daily depending on a number of variable factors including; the price of oil, freight rates, the""availability of vessels at a given time, the size' of the' vessel, voyage distance and the exchange rate. ' , In March i 989 freight costs represented about 10 per cent of the landed, cost of petroleum hnports. (5) In. fiscal year 1975/76avera-e freight costs' represented about 8 per cent of the landed cost of petroleum imports. (6) Ocean Shipping Consultants;' in their latest report ""Tanker Demand and Profitability in the 1990's"" forecast that by the year 2000 average freight rates will be about one third above the preseht level, but with a much larger increase for VLCC's: than for tankers of smaller size. It should be noted that VLCC's are too large to enter any Australian oil terminal. '' Adult Literacy Action Campaign (Question No. 1840) Mr Smith asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Tra,ining, upon notice, on 23 May 1989: '(I) What funding under the Commonwealth Government's National Language Policy is' available to Tasrnania for the Adult Literac;y Ac-ion Campaign. ' , (2) When did the Campaign begin. (3) Will funding of - he Campaign cease in June 1989; if so, why. (4) What adult literacy initiatives will be funded' during 1990, International Literacy Year. Mr Dawkins-The lmswer, to the honourable member's question is as follow$: (1) Under, the national level project element of the Adult Literacy Action Campaign of the National Policy on Lang!lages, $25,000 WilS made available to Tasmania in, 1987-88 and $30,000 .inI988-89.

"" , (2)' 'Giv'-n 'the iric-easingly more favourable S-viet attitude towards foreign investment and t'rade, 'what prospects does he see for an improved trading relationship with the, USSR. Mr nufry---':'ihe 'answer - b the honoura-le member's que-tion is as follows: (I) The most 'recent st-tistics, for calendar year 1988, show the value of Australia's exports to the Soviet Union to be $A 709,9 million, compllfed with $A697.7 million in the previousi.year. Australia's imports from the Soviet Union in .1988 were valued at $A36.4 million, compared with $A 17.5 million in 1987.' ' "",' ' (2) TheAtistrali-n Goverl'1merit has indicated' its preparedness to develop broader and 'more constr'uctive relations 'with the USSRa'nd the areas' of trade ahd'ecdhomiCc60peration have been 'given priority by botli, Governments. The trade relationship between the USSR and Australia has a solid base, with many emerging prospects for' growth. The formal framework for the trade 'rela'tlonship' has been provided by AUstralia/USSR Trade Agreements, which are complemented by other agreements in the fields of Agricultural Cooperation and SCientific and Technical Cooperation. More recently, a Program for the Development of.T-ade and ,Economic Cooperation ' 1988-1995 has been signed to promote bilateral trade during that peri()d. Further agreements which will directly affect the level of commerce are currently under negotiation in the commodities and fisheries areas. ,With regard to the former, Australia has fot some years been presslrig for long term arrangements to overcome the fluctuations in Soviet purchases of Australian comfIlodities, which make up over 9% of our exports. An Australia/USSR Fisheries Agreement will, if signed, open up opportunities for Australian ports to provide servicing facilities to Soviet vessels. , ., Since Soviet joint venture legislation was introduced in 1987, several Australian companies have actively pursued investment opportunities in both the European and Asian regions of the Soviet Union, with at least three joint ventures already established with Australian capital and technology. Areas Of particular interest to Australia are agricultural co, operation, mine-as processing, fashion, manufacturc;d goods, Imd tourism. 'Th- Government continues to encourage companies to""examine c1c;>sely opportunities for joint' ventures in the USSR."" With emHliasis being given by the SovietJJo-ern­ j ment to the economic development ,'of the Soviet Far East, this region could assume much greater importance' for' Australian commercial interests.

(4) Does the Commonwealth hold a (a) head lease or (b) sub-lease on the new office space. (5) If the Commonwealth holds a sub-lease, what sum is the main tenant paying the property owner in terms of net rental per square metre. Mr West-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The AEC considered it necessary to relocate from Commonwealth owned premises at 101 Victoria Street, Bunbury for the following reasons; the building was old and despite modifications and repeated efforts to rufurbish and repair it was not possible to stop the roof leaking or to bring the premises up to an acceptable standard. the office was located on the first floor and access was by ari extremely steep stairway. Elderly or disabled patrons were advised to ring a bell at the ground floor so that Commission staff could come down the stairs to attend to their requirements. Installation of a lift was considered not viable. the office was converted from living quarters above what was originally a bank. A series of rooms did not provide a functional office environment and attempts to air-condition the space were only marginally successful.

' (3) What (a) scheduled fee and (b) Medicare rebate (i) applied to item No. 9411 and (ii) applies to item No. 9452. (4) Why was the rebate available for argon dye laser treatment reduced from $2 \0 to $81.60. (5) iDoes the scheduled fee for item No. 9452 take,into account the significant capital costs of establishing a laser clinic. (6) Why is there no distinction within the rebate schedules between photocoagulation using flash lamp pumped dye, argon dye and copper vapour laser techniques. (7) Is the treatment of port wine stains deemed to be cosmetic for the purpose of determining Med,icare rebate levels. (8) Why does item No. 9452 cover photocoagulation of the head and neck, but not the body. Dr BleweU-The answer to the honour. able member's question is as follows: (I) Medicare Benefits Schedule items 9410-9414 were rescinded on I February 1989 and replaced by outgoings estimated at $50 Schedule items 9451-9457. The new items were added psmpa-$200.82 psmpa to the Schedule to cover treatment of vascular lesions using lasers which produce light within the,optimum wavelength (5\0-600 nanometres) to treat such lesions. There are currently four types of lasers in use (i) Net Rent-between $61.00 and in Australia which fall within this range, namely $300.00 psmpa for accommoda- argon, argon-dye, copper vapour and flash lamp. tion available at the time. pumped dye. Items 9410-9414 only covered treatment using argon lasers. and $350.00 for accommodation (2) A session of at least 60 minutes duration including an estimated $50.00 involving laser photocoagulation of the head or neck psmpa for outgoings. using laser light within the wave length of 510-600 nanometres in the treatment of port wine stains and other severely disfiguring vascular lesions of the skin where individual abnormal vessels are visible at a (i) Net RentJ-Commonwealth 'distance of two metres, including any associated conowned accommodation was on sultation. a rent free basis. However AEC (3) (i) (a) $114.00 would have been required to (b) $96.90 pay rental commensurate with market rents as from I July (ii) (a) $96.00 1989 for this office. (b) $81.60 (4) The rebate of $210 prior to I February 1989 related to argon laser therapy for vascular lesions of the skin where the session took more than one hour but less than two hours. The post I February 1989 rebate of $81.60 relates to a session of at least 60 minutes duration involving laser photocoagulation of the head or neck in the treatment of port wine stains Medicare and other severely disfiguring vascular lesions of the (Question No. 1940) skin, including any associated consultation. The revised fee structure and levels were recommended by the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee (MBAC) which comprises nominees of the Australian Medical Association and representatives of the Commonwealth, all of whom currently are medical practitioners. The Committee recommended changes to the previous structure and fee levels of a number of factors, including: fees were originally set at generally higher specialist levels and subsequent experience has shown that the vast majority of services are performed by general practitioners; although laser therapy requires particular skills, the techniques can apparently be acquired in a few days, and therefore do not warrant specialist levels of rebates; and there was concern at apparent inappropriate use of the previous fee structure. However, in view of representations on this matter I have requested MBAC to re-examine the issue. (5) No. Fees for services of a therapeutic nature historically do not cover the capital cost of providing the service. ' (6) Medicare Benefits Schedule items 9451-9457 are based on the professional input to perform the services. There is no significant difference in performing therapy on the various types of lasers. (7) No. (8) . The Medicare Be.nefits Advisory Committee recommended that Schedule items 9451.9457 should be· restricted to vascular lesiol1s loc\lted on the head or neck I In making this recommendation th- MBAnoted that overseas experience was that treatment of 'port·wine' stains below the clavicle using argon las· ers was generally un'successFuL < Aboriginal Land Rights (Question No. 1942} .

MrHawke-The a-swer to tii-, 40nolJrable member's question (as at 14 June 1989) is as follows: (I) and (2) The Chief Minister and I have recently discussed the urgent need to advance the objective of improving the living conditions for Aboriginals in pastoral areas. The need first to arrange appropriate secure title for Aboriginals to living areas has been accepted by all concerned for some years, but nevertheless, negotiations to this end have been at an impasse since 1987. We agreed that further negotiations be held in a concerted effort to reach an early settlement to accommodate Aboriginal needs within a framework acceptable to both Governments. Arrangements in relation to pastoral lease exdsions and stock routes claims will be considered in those negotiations. (3) In Question No. 1943 Part (I) the Member for Bass also directed this same question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who will answer it. (4) The Commonwealth's strong preference is for a negotiated settlement. The question of legislation does oot arise while there is a firm prospect of a settlement through the further negotiations.

"", M-West:- The. answert- the honourable, member's question is as follows: i (1- Ele-tiio- For-si,-re now wiri-ed,'Pri-r to an electIOn to reduce storage problems and aVOid waste of superseded forms; bromides from which they are to be printed are held in Head Offices. Cardboard voting screens and ballot-boxes are manufactured shortly before an election to avoid storage costs; stocks of durable screens and boxes are held in some rural areas where storage costs are minimal. Sufficient supplies for by-elections are retained between general elections. (2) There is not a shortage of satchels. Additional review officers were hired when the time in which to conduct the review had been reduced, and some Divisions were instructed to purchase appropriate satchels. One State drew on the supply of another State. For the current review existing stocks of green satchels had been topped up with a new grey satchel which was more popular and this may have led to perceptions of shortages. A 6-8 weeks period was required to manufacture more of the standard stock satchels. (3) The Australian Electoral Commission is unaware of the supply of election forms running out or of any shortages of election materials during the Gwydir by-election. A daily courier service was maintained between the Commission's store in Sydney and the Divisional Office at Narrabri. The Divisional Returning Office ensured that more than adequate supplies were availa'ble at all polling places and has received no complaints concerning shortages. (4) In the mid-1970s a policy was introduced by the Electoral Office that Divisional Offices should hold at all times a complete supply of election materials sufficient for two House and Senate elections. This produced storage p-oblems for the Divisional Offices and led to waste when materials became obsolete as a consequence of legislative of procedural changes. The Electoral Commission has introduced a policy of utilising contempora.rypriilting and manufacturing processes to produce election materials when they are required. . (5) Where the practice existed it was stopped in July 1988 because' of scarcity of overtime funds. Enrolment forms and ORP envelopes are provided for issue to new citizens at the ceremonies instead. Additionally the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs provides lists of reo. cenUy naturalised citizens to the Electoral Commission; these are followed up by Divisional Returning Officers. (6) In August 1987 the Electoral Commissioner imposed a temporary freeze. on . filling permanent positions in Divisional Offices to minimise difficulties and cost of any staff who might be rendered redundant by regionalisation of these offices as a conSequence of the Efficiency Scrutiny then being conducted.' ' , (7) On 29 M-rch1989 the Electoral Coinmi-­ sioner removed the freeze in respect of most perm anent appointments of Divisional Returning Officers and ASO 2 officers in Divisional Offices and on 24 May 1989 in r-sl'e<;t of most Div.isional Clerks. ever the staffing level of D,ivisional Offices must correspond to the salary funds which the Electoral Commission receives, (8) Staff and materials resources adequate for the conduct of the next general election will be available at the required time. Amnesty International Report on Beatings (Question No. 1953) Mr Milton asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 1 June 1989: (I) Has his attention been drawn to an Amnesty International urgent action report of 4 May 1989 which stated that two Palestinians, Ra'ad Ahmad Mustafa' Adwan and Nidal Darwish Da'bi were severely injued at the end of April 1989 as a result of beatings while in the custody of Israeli' border police. (2) Has the Australian Government taken action to urge th- Israeli authorities to investigate this matter and bring those responsible to justice; if so, what action: . .",129
165,Mr DUFFY ,AIDS,The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following . answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes. (2) On 31 May 1989 the Australian Ambassador in Tel Aviv made representations to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs to express concern at the reported incidents and to request an Israeli Government response to the report. No response has yet been received. This action was consistent with the Australian Govetnment's policy of making representations on Amnesty International reports designated as requiring urgent action. Such reports are regularly passed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and How- Trade by the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International.,133
