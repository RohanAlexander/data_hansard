3,Mr CAUSLEY,COMMITTEES,"The report I tahle today follows the inquiry by the Standing Commitmation is needed. tee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts into the funding of community sporting and recreational facilities. This report was almost completed by the committee under the chairwealth manship of the member for Wide Bay (Mr grant Truss), beside me, and before my appointment to the committee and election as Chair. recommendations, conclusions and general findings therefore reflect the views of the committee members rather than my own despite views. But I do not necessarily disagree anything in the report. In recent years the only facilities that the funding Commonwealth government has funded have been for the Olympic Games in Sydney. It has not contributed any funds other standards. The committee learnt, during its visits to all the Australian states territories, that there is a strong demand Commonwealth funding for facilities of all standards to be restored. The committee not, however, recommended establishing general grants program like that which existed in 1994. The current situation is that local ment spends large sums of money each year on sport and recreation, and the state territory governments dispense funds for facilities through grants programs. The committee concludes that an appropriate role for the Commonwealth government is to enhance the effective use of those funds that are already available, and it has identified several ways of doing this. The first of these is that an audit of all sporting and recreational facilities in the country should be carried out, and the results made available on a database. More emphasis Report should be put on needs based planning, especially at national and regional levels. Educational institutions and Defence Force should be encouraged to share their facilities more effectively with the community than they do at present. Finally, information to all aspects of establishing and running facilities is to be providedstandards, design, planning, management, joint ventures between the private and public sectors and shared use of facilities were all nominated as topics about which more inforAs well as promoting the best possible use of the funds that are currently being provided, the committee concludes that the Commongovernment should also make some funds available for individual facilities in disadvantaged communities. The committee The considers that partial funding should be provided for facilities in these communities where facilities have not been constructed, the best efforts of state and local with government, the community and the private sector. The committee sees the supply of to these communities as being in keeping with the government's role of ensuring that all Australians have access to broadly for facilities of similar services. To avoid the problems that have bedevilled and past Commonwealth grants programs for for facilities, the funds should be dispensed in cooperation with state and territory governhas ments. The committee recommends that $50 a million should be made available each year for the next five years for the new grants program for disadvantaged communities and govern- for the other measures recommended. The report also discusses how more funds and might be made available for sporting and recreational facilities by means other than a Commonwealth grants program. The committee looked at the Australian Sports Foundation, which allows for tax deductible donations to sporting facilities, among other things. The foundation has not contributed as effectively as it should have to the provision of facilities, although it has the potential so. Its operations must be reformed and extended, and the committee recommends as much. An alternative source of money is a revolving loan fund, which the committee recommends should be investigated as an option. The committee suggests that a fund of $100 million might be established using funds raised by the Commonwealth government from the regulation of gambling associated with telecommunications and air travel. The committee does not support the introduction of these forms of gambling. But, if they are introduced, any revenue from such gambling should be hypothecated to sport and recreational facilities. In addition, the joint developopportunity ment of facilities by the private and public sectors should be made easier. The committee considers that the report's recommendations, taken together, will make a substantial contribution to a better supply of sporting and recreational facilities for the Australian public. I would like to acknowledge the contribution of all the members of the committee who have participated in this inquiry. I commend the report to the House.",13
4,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"The committee report, entitled Rethinking the funding of community sporting and recreational facilities: a sporting chance, which has been tabled this afternoon, is a welcome update on two previous committee reports on the same subject matter. The first, I think, was back in the early 1980s; and then the committee which I chaired in 1989 brought down a report entitled Going for gold-and I think the report on this occasion has surpassed even the work that was done then. At the outset I pay tribute to both the present chairman and also the former chairman, now the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss), for his outstanding guidance during the course of this particular work. Of course, as the shadow minister for sport and tourism, I was particularly interested in participating in the course of this inquiry because it did build on the work, as I say, that I did in the late 1980s. But it has always interested me to see how to do the Commonwealth should playa role in the provision of community sporting and recreation facilities-and, more importantly, how one pays for it. All of us in this place can stand up and say: 'There should be more community sports facilities in Australia,' but then we have to work out how the Commonwealth pays for its share of those facilities. What appeals to me is that we have made some recommendations in this committee report that go to the funding issue. The chairman just mentioned some of those a moment ago. I am particularly attracted to the idea of beefing up the role of the Australian Sports Foundation. With increased tax deductibility, for example, there is an for corporate Australia to donate funds which can then be directed towards the provision of sporting infrastructure in this country-and not just concentrate them in the Australian Institute of Sport, which is certainly necessary, but in regional centres right around this country. Equally commendable is the notion that there should be shared use of facilities. There is no point in each community or each sport having its own· little sports ground, its own shed or its own basketball facility somewhere. There should be shared facilities. We had a look at the way that schools, defence establishments and other places could be utilised for this purpose. We also looked at the issue of planning. Regional facilities were seen as being so important in this area. Again, there is no point in a local government saying that it wants a brand new tartan track athletics facility, a brand new aquatic facility, a brand new water based hockey facility, netball courts and so on. All those are important but if we are talking about major facilities we have to take a regional approach. Local government these days must have a regional focus instead of focusing on the parochial issues which seem to surround much of its activities in this area. Local government has the added burden that once state or Commonwealth governments come along and give them funds to construct some of these facilities they then have to pick up the wherewithal for the maintenance costs associated with that. These are important issues. In the process we have talked about in this committee report, of having a committee that plans with state, local and federal government involvement, you can go to the issues of maintaining the funding that is so necessary for the maintenance of all these facilities once planned. The idea of providing $50 million a year for each of the next five years is also appealing. We need to get away from the Sydney 2000 Games concept and think about the rest of Australia. Regional Australia cries out for sporting facilities and needs the impetus that can come from Commonwealth government funding. I used an example on a number of occasions in the course of this committee's work of an indoor sports entertainment centre in Wollongong. Had Commonwealth government funding been available for the extra few million that had been promised by Brian Howe's better cities program and regional facilities program we might have seen that facility built a little more quickly than it is being done at present. This report is a report of substance. It is testimony to the work of the committee secretariat, which worked long and hard to put it together. I thank them on behalf of the opposition. It is a report which will be an important element as the opposition prepares its policy on sport and funding for sports facilities as we go to the next election campaign. Fortunately, in this country sport is very much a bipartisan issue. Both sides of the parliament should endorse this report. I hope the new Minister for Sport and Tourism (Mr Thomson) is spoken to at length by his colleague the new Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) and that he gets hold of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and suggests that in the next budget money be found to facilitate the development of the projects outlined in this report.",14
5,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES,"It gives me great pleasure to comment on this report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, entitled Rethinking the funding of community sporting and recreational facilities: a sporting chance. It is a very important report, particularly given that sport is a vital part of Australian culture. Over an extensive period of time governments across Australia have invested, not hundreds of millions or even billions, but hundreds of billions of dollars in sporting facilities at the local, state and federal levels. One of the submissions to our committee indicated that around $8 billion is spent annually on the maintenance of sporting facilities across Australia at the local, state and federal levels. When you put your mind to it, it is easy to conceive of those sorts of sums being involved. There is a diversity of needs in Australia in relation to sporting facilities. That diversity has increased with the development of new sports over the last 20 years and over the last five years, in particular. Those new sports, which have significant consumer demand attached to them, require new and sometimes very expensive facilities. Sport is no longer simply taking a pig's bladder down to the local park and kicking it around. In many cases it extends to more capital intensive sports such as golf and other capital intensive sports. The standards required for Australian sporting facilities have never been addressed in any national fashion. One of the recommendations-which I am pleased to say I contributed to in this report-is an invitation to the government, as part of its role as the Commonwealth in this relationship, to set up a national standards system so that each sporting facility, from an international sports arena that caters for international rugby or cricket games and the Olympics right through to a locally maintained sports or cricket oval, is graded according to a consistent grading pattern across the country. Therefore, we will be able to determine as a nation and as a Commonwealth before we fund these facilities exactly what facilities are available, what standard they are at and whether those sorts of facilities are needed. There are certain circumstances where grade one, top· grade, facilities are built within 10 kilometres of each other and yet a grade one facility would not be located anywhere, for example, in regional or rural New South Wales. The demand is out there but the facilities and the money are not getting to those people. Funding is an issue that will continue to cause some concern to the Commonwealth, given that the states and particularly local government commit so much money to sporting facilities. There is a great opportunity for us at the moment to provide a one-off capital injection into the provision of new sporting facilities around Australia for those areas that are most in need. That, of course, is provided by the proceeds of the sale of Telstra. I would like to see some of those proceeds made available for capital infrastructure, which does belong to the Commonwealth, in a range of areas, including sporting facilities-just part of it because most of the proceeds are going to debt reduction. I might add that the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) has done a great job in relation to the privatisation of Telstra. Those funds should be available for some capital requirements and infrastructure needed by the Australian people. In relation to funding generally, I have grave concerns about any recommendations which may indicate that we are prepared to provide funding only on a tied basis. I am a strong opponent of tied funding. It is regressive and it does not necessarily mean that you are getting the sporting facilities to the areas of greatest .demand. The states, and local government in particular, should be responsible for identifying the funding needs of sporting facilities and they should approach us rather than us approaching them on where sporting facilities would best be placed. There are a couple of examples in my own electorate: the North Sydney Council together with some local community groups approached me about a basketball court and Lane Cove Council has come to me about a swimming pool. They are demand driven demands from the individual councils and ones which I, as a local federal member, would not be able to identify. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",15
6,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEES,"I too would like to make a few comments on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, Rethinking the funding· of committee sporting and recreational facilities: a sporting chance, which has just been tabled here in the House today. In so doing I WQuld like to place on the record my congratulations to the previous chairman and. now Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), and also to wish the now chairman of the committee, the member for Page (Mr Cl;Iusley), all the best in the future. More particularly, no matter how good we as a committee work in taking evidence, listening to inquiries or reading the substantial amount of written submissions that we receive, particularly in this inquiry, we would get nowhere without the excellent secretariat. I would like to place on record in this parliament thanks for the work done by the committee secretary, Mr Ian Dundas, and in this particular report Dr Sarah Hnatiuk, who is sitting in here listening to the debate, the senior research officer, Susan Cardell, and the administrative officer, Marlene Lyons. They not only worked very hard but also put together from a wealth of knowledge a tremendous report that did not require a lot of amendment at a committee level. . Naturally we all have different opinions about where we should be going with funding. While I sat and listened to the evidence in this inquiry-I have always believed that the Commonwealth should be involved in· funding particular sporting facilities-what came across very clearly is that the federal government must be involved in funding to provide and investigate options for greater provision of facilities in the sporting and recreational fields but particularly also to encourage more joint public and private sector involvement in the provision of better planned and coordinated sporting facilities. The Sydney Olympics, which the previous speakers have talked about, will focus pur population on the great many men and women-and so it should-who are champions in their own particular fields and who have had the opportunity of excellent training and facilities. But what concerns me, and think every member of the committee that attended during this inquiry, is the other per cent of our population in Australia wish to compete or play or just become involved in sport for recreation purposes but who have no opportunities because of lack facilities. There was evidence given by various the groups from remote areas as well as from number of sporting communities from metropolitan and city areas stating that without federal funding involvement they would never be able to provide even the most basic facilities. Women's sporting groups complained of and were able to provide proof of certain local government areas spending less on sporting facilities for women even when the need was shown to be there. What has also come across from this quiry is that there is a large unmet demand for more sporting and recreational facilities across Australia. We really are wasting government dollars as well as time by trying to educate our young people to become more active and more involved in sport when, the same time, we are not providing the appropriate facilities for them to do so. Governments of all political persuasions print many glossy documents. I am convinced that all that does is make them feel good because it is absolutely useless if we print glossy documents saying to people, 'Get involved, get active, look after your physical health; do you realise that if you take recreational time off you will be a lot better?' and yet at the same time provide neither facilities nor funding to assist become involved. We also too often hear how sport and recreation is an integral part of our Australian culture. This inquiry has shown that if you female you are certainly not included in that culture, if you are Aboriginal and live in remote areas then you are not included and you are disabled then you are certainly not included in what we now call 'our sporting culture of Australia'. There are a number of recommendations in this report and I personally believe that if they are acted upon they will greatly relieve I the anomalies that have now come to light. There has to be a very flexible and innovative 98 approach to sports funding and the lead must who come from the federal government. The recommendations identify a number of strategies that can very easily be put into place as of well as costings of future requirements of sporting and recreational facilities. I commend report to the House. I know that there are a a lot of speakers who wish to participate in and bodies this debate today.",16
7,Mr BILSON,COMMITTEES,"I would like to add my congratulations to all the members of the House of Representatives also Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts for producing an excellent report, Rethinking the funding of committee sporting and recreational facilities: a sporting chance. I would particularly like to acknowinledge the work of Sarah Hnatiuk and Susan Cardell of the committee secretariat who have travelled long and far with us, put up with a number of rather unusual ideas that we have discussed openly and frankly on the way through and have finished up with an excelat lent report that the parliament should pay particular attention to. I would also like to add my congratulations to the committee chairs. I say 'chairs' because there were a number of them. The member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) led the charge, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) acted in that capacity while the member for Wide Bay was called to higher duties and we closed off with the more member for Page (Mr Causley) at the helm doing an excellent job in bringing the report to conclusion. My congratulations to each and those people to every one of them. It is an important inquiry because sports funding with Commonwealth involvement has had a contentious history . We all know about are whiteboards and the sorts of things in the report of the Australian National Audit Office and the report of our predecessor committee if into that program, which identified many deficiencies, and I am convinced that this report deals with the vast majority of those deficiencies and maps a very practical and pragmatic way forward for the Commonwealth to be again involved in the funding of community sporting and recreational facilities. It is important that the Commonwealth reacquaint itself with this program, as the old program that the previous government ran was defunct and was wound up after the difficulties that those two inquiries identified. This was a significant inquiry. The amount of evidence we received was huge. We had the experience of everyone from all around the country, an enormous level of community interest and support for what we were doing and an excellent range of submissions. The input and case studies that we looked at as we travelled around the country, particularly in the Mornington Peninsula, where we went through the electorates of Dunkley and Flinders to look at practical lessons that we could pick up, have proved to be most helpful. What our travels also identified is that we have facility rich and facility poor communities throughout our country, and that is what this report seeks to target. It says that there is a role for the Commonwealth to support community access to appropriate facilities and in fact give people, as the report's name says, a sporting chance, an opportunity to develop those skills and be involved in recreation opportunities that many of us take for granted. It identified that facilities vary right across nation and that we need a planning framework and a bit of an audit to find out what we actually have. We understand that in educational facilities we have got recreational complexes that are underutilised and could be made more available to the community. We have also recognised that the federal government continues to provide funding through school funding, university funding and Defence facilities and that we should encourage the opening up of those to the community. The report also recognises that displacing private investment from the many people who run sporting and recreational facilities with government funding is hardly a sensible way to go, and that we should recognise that the private sector has a very legitimate and longestablished role in providing these sorts of facilities to areas of our community. It has also identified that, where there is a community service obligation, an option may well be for the government and its taxpayers, whether it is at a state, local or federal level, to buy space, to buy time and to buy access to facilities that taxpayers have already funded for private purposes, and then we can maximise the benefit of those facilities. There is also a role for voluntary organisations in the management of smaller facilities. That has been recognised and encouraged. But the need for professional management not captive to a particular sporting group in multifaceted facilities was recognised as a very important thing to have in larger facilities. That understanding says that feasibility planning is important. Let us not build white elephants; let us take the sporting associations and people with us so that everyone can make sure that the facilities that are being developed are needed and can enjoy a viable future. There is also acknowledgment of regional cooperation and multi-use as cornerstones of the things we can do and of the need for proper planning so that what you are actually building is what the community is looking for. I would like to close by suggesting that the report's approach is affordable. It is an approach that recommends a cooperative effort between states and local government, not the simply handing the money over, because we understand that the demands on governments might see a simple increase in untied grants go elsewhere. The report is saying that we should work with those levels of government and the sporting associations to produce better facilities to improve the access for everybody so that all Australians have a sporting chance. I would like to continue my remarks later in the Main Committee.",17

11,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I present the committee's report on concession card availability and eligibility for concessions entitled Concessions-who benefits?, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",19
12,Mr FORREST,COMMITTEES,"It gives me a great deal of satisfaction to table the first major report in this parliament of an inquiry by the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. The report just tabled deals with the availability and use of concession cards by Australians who rely on the concessions provided by the cards to access a range of health and other essential services. Concession cards assist in providing services to those whose financial circumstances may prevent such access. At the Commonwealth level, all concession cards provide access to the PBS safety net, and some cards give discounts on hearing aids and rail transport. States and territories provide additional concessions for electricity and water charges, as well as council rates and public transport. Almost five and a half million Australians use one or more of the three Commonwealth concession cards currently available. In addition, there are two repatriation health cards issued by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in recognition of the special status that veterans have in the Australian community and to provide them with free health care. The inquiry was first referred to the committee by the Minister for Social Security, Senator the Hon. Jocelyn Newman, in June last year. It was referred against the background that the current legislative and administrative framework for the Commonwealth concession system is unduly complex, leading to confusion for service providers and concession card holders, causing delays and duplication at the bureaucratic level. The major conclusion reached by the committee is that there are too many cards available, which means that there is a lack of clarity about the range of concessions attaching to a particular Report card and that card holders are not sure of their entitlements. For this reason, the committee favours replacing the three current cards with a single concession card, entitled the Commonwealth concession card. In assisting the effectiveness of the proposed new arrangements, the committee proposes that the new Commonwealth concession card contain a computer chip. This will enable service providers to confirm entitlements on line, assist card holders to update their information and access services more easily and allow governments at all levels to track concession expenditure and direct funds accordingly. A related recommendation is the adoption of an electronic pharmaceutical claims system, which would assist in more rational drug use and provide better health outcomes for individuals and for the Australian community. The committee, in its report, has made recommendations to streamline the current system, with primary responsibility for administration and management being transferred to the Social Security portfolio. This is to be undertaken in a manner which is sensitive to the special status provided to veterans in the allocation of their cards. The committee has also recommended the strengthening of existing fraud control mechanisms and, in the interests of equity, that the Department of Social Security undertake a thorough review of eligibility criteria, taking into account all of the issues canvassed throughout the inquiry. As part of the new streamlined administration, a recommendation has also been made that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments formally adopt a written agreement setting out national standards for concessions to remove the confusion. This should ensure a fairer system with greater transparency for recIpients and more cost-effective administration. A recommendation which greatly assists people in rural and remote areas, which is an issue addressed comprehensively by the committee, relates to transport concessions. There is a range of recommendations contained in the report, and time prevents me from discussing all of those, but the emphasis on providing equity and justice to rural Australians has been very prominent in the minds of the members of the committee in the preparation of the report. Even though I have been a member of the committee since its establishment in this parliament, I have occupied the position of chairman only since September this year. I would therefore like to take this opportunity  Slipper, the member for Fisher, for his hard work and dedication in steering the inquiry through the information gathering part of its activities. I would also like to thank all committee members and the personnel of the secretariat for their assistance in the conduct of the inquiry . We look forward to some positive outcomes as governments respond to the range of recommendations contained in the report. I commend the report to the House.",19
13,Mr QUICK,COMMITTEES,"I too welcome the opportunity to speak on the report of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs entitled Concessions-who benefits? As reports go, and we get to present a few in this place, this report is a very innovative and constructive approach to what for a long time has been a cause for concern not only to Commonwealth recipients but also to local, state and federal governments. How many of us in our electorate offices are bombarded by calls from people who are unsure of what concession is attached to what Commonwealth card, what entitlements flow from the possession of such a card and why the government has the temerity to place a threshold that discriminates against them. Hopefully, once the committee's recommendations are adopted by the governmentand this is a unanimous report-the position of the concession card in Australian society will change forever. For too long in this country we have had the farcical situation whereby Australian citizenship has been subjugated and state entitlements have taken precedence. If you happen to be a Tasmanian pensioner who wishes to visit the mainland states, you had better realise before you leave that travel concessions are not yours to claim once you enter the new state boundary. If you are a person with a disability and require transport concessions in another state, forget it, you are on your own. This report, as the chairman, the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), mentioned, has 26 recommendations for the government to consider. As I said earlier, this is an innovative report, and for its recommendations to be properly implemented there needs to be a very effective educational process undertaken. Recommendation 8 reads: ... before and during introduction of concession smart cards, there should be an extensive education campaign informing the target populations, particularly older people, how the new technology will affect them and how they can gain access to concessions. Why do I mention this recommendation first? Because we as a committee are putting to the government that there be a single Commonwealth concession card with smart card technology capacity to deal with all possible information. We are hopeful that, once the initial teething problems are ironed out and the concession smart card trials are completed, we will have introduced across Australia a single concession smart card to access all Commonwealth, state and territory concessions. This smart card will, thankfully, replace once and forever the current pensioner concession card, the health care card and the Commonwealth seniors health card. Some of us hope-and I know we might upset the veterans community-that the veterans card will also be incorporated. Hopefully, that will happen inevitably as time progresses, but I will leave that alone; I do not want to upset the veterans. Allied to this somewhat radical step is that the Commonwealth is to ensure that the relevant equipment-smart card readers, customer kiosks, information lines, et ceteraare available to all eligible Australians, irrespective of where they might live, whether it is in the Sydney CBD, the Mallee or in southern parts of my electorate in Tasmania. Recommendation 15 is also very important, as we are recommending that the Commonwealth and states formally adopt a written agreement on the following national standards for concessions. These are: horizontal equity-similar outcomes for households in similar circumstances; vertical equity-ability to respond to different household circumstances; clarity for recipients; cost-effective administration; flexibility to respond to tariff and price changes and differences across Australia; consistency with competition policies and practices; and a recognition that concessions should not try to compensate for deficiencies in the social security system. I would like to briefly mention recommendation 21, which is that the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development initiate a negotiation process with all state territory transport ministers to implement a national transport concession system on all rail and bus services. Recommendation 22 recommends that the mobility allowance be extended to allow disabled people to access all forms of transport in areas where there are no transport services specific to their needs. Finally, as time is running out, I would like to thank the committee secretariat, Bjarne Nordin and Bronwen Jaggers, who are both here in the House today. To the civillibertarians, who are going to jump out of the woodwork over this issue: go and hide. The recipients need it, want it and they are going to get it. Find something else to worry about.",20
14,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"At the outset I would like to thank the new Chairman of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), for his kind words on my role as chairman of the committee right through the inquiry process. I was very honoured when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) invited me to be Government Whip, but the downside was that it was necessary for me to resign as chairman just as the committee was about to consider the report, Concessions-who benefits?, which is now before the chamber. I was particularly impressed with the very strong support which this inquiry received from the community. Indeed, we received more than 44 submissions nationally. As happens with inquiries of this nature, the public hearings took place in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart and Canberra. This is a unanimous report, and I must say that the committee worked very well together. As we discussed the various issues, it was often difficult to know what the political allegiances of individuals were. I believe that the committee system, because it works so well, can restore the faith of the Australian community in the way the parliament works. So often on television, altercations within the parliament are portrayed, but the very good work of committees does not get the publicity and the profile that it should. There are 26 recommendations, and the key recommendation stresses the importance of and having a single concession card and also that we ought to take advantage of technology and have a smart card. I believe this is a very important initiative. As a committee we did receive recommendations that maybe we ought to cash out concession cards and that people who are currently in receipt of them ought to receive compensation in a cash form for the loss of cards. I can see some advantages in this proposal; however, the feeling generally was that what might be good policy certainly would not be good politics. Most of the evidence we received gave very strong indications that the client community was opposed to cashing out. Thus, instead, we decided to rationalise and improve the administration of the concession card system. Therefore, we will not have cashing out; what we will have is a maintenance of the situation where a concession card is available to those people who need it. I was particularly pleased that the committee recommended the acceptance of a Canadian Pharmanet system which will, I believe, bring about very great advantages for people who seek to have prescriptions filled. There will be benefits to the community in so far as overprescribing will stop. People will not receive too many drugs and indeed, if there are drugs to which people might have an adverse reaction, this certainly could be identified very early. So we do have a winwin situation: if the Pharmanet proposal is to be implemented, the win will be to the community and also to the individual patient. This is very important indeed. I would also briefly, in the time available to me, like to refer to the recommendations dealing with the extension of eligibility for the Commonwealth seniors health card. We did receive quite a lot of evidence indicating that independent retirees in particular were greatly disadvantaged by the very good work of the government in having five successive interest rate reductions since the time of the election. Many people who have planned their retirement with an expectation of a certain income are now finding it very difficult to live. The Association of Independent Retirees made a recommendation which it estimated would cost $9.5 million per year. But, when the Department of Social Security and the Australian Bureau of Statistics actually checked the figures, this cost was actually calculated to be $19.5 million. So what the committee has done is recommend that the eligibility criteria for the Commonwealth seniors health card be extended to include independent retirees whose income does not exceed, by more than 40 per cent, the income limit set for qualification of a part pension. Personally, I was attracted to the recommendation of the Association of Independent Retirees. I recognise the former national president, Mrs Maureen Kingston, in the gallery. I believe the recommendation of the committee does, however, go a long way towards ensuring justice to these Australians who have contributed so much to ensuring that we enjoy the freedom and way of life that we do in this country today. (Time expired)",21
15,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEES,"It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the report entitled Concessions-who benefits? by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. At the outset I would like to thank Mr Bjarne Nordin and Ms Bronwen Jaggers for their contribution. As always, the secretariat carried out very professional and supportive work for the committee. It is also perhaps of interest to point out that this has been the first major report for many members of the parliament. I trust they have found their contribution to public policy making of value. I confess that I am concerned at the moment that people are not attending parliamentary committees. I would draw to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to that of the Speaker, that all parliamentarians should be encouraged to partake as fully as possible in what is the most effective form of public policy making available to parliamentarians. The report has two main strands: the first consists of the concessions, how they work, who they should apply to and how they function; the second relates to the physical card itself or the technology, if you like. In terms of the first strand-and this point has been made by other speakers-there is a need to get a truly national system whereby people with concession cards, whether they live in Bourke, Launceston, Burnie or Broome, all have access to similar systems. What we have found is an absolute potpourri of concessions, rules and conditions. As the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) said earlier, people who come from Tasmania across to the mainland may as well be visiting another country, because people with concessions in their own state find those concessions are not available elsewhere. The report tries to give some leadership to the Commonwealth and to encourage the Commonwealth and states to develop a universal approach to it. It also points out that access to the transport card is strictly limited to those people in areas where there are public transport systems. Technically, there is no reason why such concessions could not apply to either private transport or home and community care and community transport, which are available in many places. In that way, those people who provide transport as volunteers could become part of a transport network. That would make it more equitable for. people living outside those relatively physically small parts of the country that have a public transport system. It also highlights the need for an information system. There is a great deal of confusion about concession cards, both Commonwealth and state, because of those massive variations. I think recommendation 17 is particularly important in that regard. The other recommendation of significance is the recommendation that Social Security takes over responsibility for concessions as a single department. At the moment, responsibility for concessions is between departments, and that leads to problems. If we are going to have universality, better information and a more seamless system then we probably need to have a single department administering, with other departments feeding into that. We expect that that single responsibility would help the system to work more effectively.",22

19,Mr HOLLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) recognises that 14 November 1997 was World Diabetes Day; (2) commends the Government for its recognition of the seriousness of diabetes in making it one of the five health priorities; (3) recognises that an increasing proportion of the Australian population is affected by diabetes, in that every twelve minutes someone, somewhere in Australia is diagnosed with this chronic disease; and (4) urges the Government to continue funding research into diabetes and the National Diabetes Strategy and to promote a widespread education campaign through Diabetes Australia to alert the population of the risks of developing the disease. split By the time the debate on this motion has concluded, three more people in Australia will be diagnosed with diabetes, because every 12 minutes someone somewhere in Australia is diagnosed with diabetes. This is a matter that should be of concern to all Australians, but especially to us as members of parliament. This disease is reaching epidemic proportions. An estimated 800,000 Australians now have the disease, with half of those people having non-insulin dependent diabetes and not even knowing it. Because of increases in the prevalence of risk factors and the ageing of the population, the prevalence of diabetes is expected to continue to rise. Unless something is done to slow this progression, 1.15 million Australians will have diabetes by the year 2010. New research has shown that early diagnosis of diabetes, good control of blood glucose levels and regular medical checks help people with diabetes to prevent, delay or minimise complications. Last Friday, 14 November, was World Diabetes Day, when diabetes organisations around the world attempted to raise public awareness of the serious impact diabetes is having on global health. World Diabetes Day links countries around the world in an international drive to alert people to the seriousness of diabetes, the risk factors for non-insulin dependent diabetes and the ongoing need for research in pursuit of a cure. Diabetes Australia played an important role in alerting people to the disease last Friday, World Diabetes Day. Reports from the recent International Diabetes Federation Congress in Finland estimate that 132 million people now have diabetes worldwide and that this will increase by 240 million by the year 2010. In 1990 diabetes was ranked 16th in global causes of death but now rates as the fifth major cause of death as it reaches epidemic proportions. According to Diabetes Australia, the rate of diabetes in Australia's overall population is following global high trends, and urban Aborigines have the fourth highest rate in the world. Migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds are also at high risk of developing diabetes due to changes in their lifestyles. Non-insulin dependent diabetes is a disease that is often triggered by lifestyle factors, such as unhealthy eating and low levels of activity. This is different from insulin ent diabetes, which is not caused by lifestyle. As countries develop economically, eating habits tend to change to include more high fat foods, and activity often decreases. It is important that people realise what can do to avoid diseases like non-insulin dependent diabetes through healthy eating plans and regular exercise. For people who already have the disease, the aim is to educate them so they can maintain good diabetes management. It is now clear that good control of diabetes can reduce the development of complications, such as blindness, kidney disease, heart attack, stroke, limb amputation and impotence. All people with diabetes should have a healthy eating plan, exercise regularly, test glucose levels daily and seek regular medical check-ups. Non-insulin dependent diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting 85 per cent of those with the disease. People most at risk of developing it are over 40, overweight, have a family history of diabetes, have high blood pressure and, if female, have given birth to babies weighing over four kilograms. As a group, because of our lifestyle, we as members of parliament are among the high risk categories of diabetes. At the moment there is no cure for diabetes, but there is excellent treatment available. Although diabetes cannot be cured by insulin or tablets, it can be managed with help and advice by doctors and other health workers. Having diabetes is no sentence to inactivity. People can maintain a normal lifestyle provided they watch their weight and exercise regularly. Australian governments, both state and federal, have recognised the seriousness of diabetes in that at the meeting in July 1996 Australian health ministers agreed to include diabetes as a fifth national health priority area. This has lifted the public profile of diabetes and paves the way for the implementation of some national strategies of real value to address the prevention, early diagnosis and control and management of diabetes in Australia. It should also result in an unprecedented level of cooperation between governments and diabetes organisations such as the International Diabetes Institute, Diabetes Australia dependand other non-government groups. In December 1996 the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Diabetes was established to provide high level, independent, expert advice to the Commonwealth on all issues relating to . they the development and implementation of a national diabetes strategy. Funding of $7.7 million over three years was allocated in the 1996-97 budget to implement a national diabetes strategy, first announced in the 'Health throughout life' policy document. The strategy has the objective of reducing the incidence, prevalence and impact of complications of diabetes in Australia, and the social, economic and health costs of this disease to the community. There are considerable costs, both direct and indirect, in regard to diabetes in Australia. The cost of the illness to people's quality of life is immeasurable. It has been estimated that one in every seven of our health dollars is spent on either diabetes or its complications. There are large in-patient costs, something like $280 million, and nursing home costs, something like $94 million, associated with diabetes in Australia. The largest contributor by far to the annual in-patient cost of diabetes is vascular disease, which costs at least $111 million per year. Pharmaceutical treatments such as insulin or oral tablets and physician visits cost about $70 million and $90 million respectively per year. Production loss from premature mortality is estimated at $377 million annually, based on average earnings and life years lost to age 75. . The real cost is very difficult to accurately state as so many people who have the disease or have non-insulin dependent diabetes are unaware of it and the illnesses they have. Time lost through work is often put down to some other cause. I must say that the current Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has played avery active role in raising the awareness of diabetes. I know, from·the many press statements he has put out and the commitment he has to that field, he is determined that the education of Australians will be raised in regard to diabetes. I urge the government to continue funding research into diabetes and the national diabetes strategy. It is essential that a widespread education campaign be promoted to alert the population to the risks of developing the disease. I commend Diabetes Australia for the work they do, the important role they play and, indeed, the activities that they arranged last Friday-World Diabetes Day. The ultimate goal must be for a cure for diabetes, but research must continue in areas which may improve quality of life for people with diabetes.",23
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Is the motion seconded? Ms ElIis-1 second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,25
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Before I call the next speaker, I commend the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). As a maturity onset diabetic myself, I think you and all of the speakers on this are doing a good job in publicising it. I am pleased to tell you I walked for over one hour this morning.",25
22,Mr COBB,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I note that the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay), who is at the table, is also a mature onset diabetic. I am pleased to support this motion moved by the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) relating to diabetes. I just note the outset that we are debating diabetes mellitus, not diabetes insipidus which relates to a lack of a hormone, vasopressin, released by the pituitary gland which controls fluid released from the kidneys as urine. The importance of diabetes mellitus, which we are debating, is best understood by examining its effects on the human body. The body is unable to properly use its main fuel, glucose, which then builds up in the bloodstream causing hyperglycaemia. Normally, when levels rise insulin is released from the pancreas which lowers the levels by enhancing the transport of glucose across the cell wall, allowing it to be utilised in the muscles as energy or the excess of it to be stored as glycogen in the liver or, by a more complicated mechanism, the storage of fat in adipose tissue. However, if it is allowed to build up in the blood instead of going into the muscles and liver, in classic formit spills out through the kidneys via excessive urination, leading of course to excessive thirst. The person so affected has a lack of energy and a loss of weight. If the muscles cannot access glucose, the liver often releases ketones to supply the deficient energy and this can lead to acidity problems. There are many reasons for low insulin output. Insulin is produced by the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. A deficiency of these cells will mean a deficiency of insulin, and this is what is classically seen with juvenile diabetes. There may also be a delayed or insufficient release of insulin, which is commonly seen with adult diabetes. There are also other more minor and complicated areas such as chemical in activators in the blood preventing insulin from carrying out its full role. Persistent high glucose levels in the bloodstream can be very damaging over a period of time, particularly on body organs. It can cause renal failure and vascular damage. It can cause arteriosclerosis of the large vessels. If that happens in the brain you have a stroke; if it happens in the heart you have a heart attack, such as a coronary heart attack; in the kidneys it causes renal damage, as I have at mentioned, or in the extremities of the body such as the limbs and feet it can cause ulcers and gangrene, ultimately leading to amputation in the most extreme forms. We can also have thickening of the walls, arterioles and capillaries to each organ. The most tragic, perhaps, is thickening of the retinal blood vessels in the eyes, which can lead to blindness. This is particularly tragic because it is easily preventable, as is damage to kidneys, muscles and skin. Hyperglycaemia, in a persistent form, can affect peripheral nerves leading to a loss of skin sensitivity in some areas. The most susceptible groups are those with a family history of it and those who are overweight. Sometimes it is picked up in pregnant women, particularly if they give birth to babies in excess of four kilograms. It often means you have a lot of glucose floating around in your bloodstream to nourish your foetus to that weight. The juvenile form affects about 70,000 people in this country, usually children under 15, though it may affect young adults. These are invariably insulin dependent. The onset is often sudden; they just do not produce enough insulin and the blood glucose levels of these victims must be monitored very closely indeed. They often have to have injections of insulin, at least one and up to several injections a day. Adult, or mature onset, diabetes, which usually occurs in the over-40-year-olds is often slow in onset. Some of those need insulin. The great bulk of them-80 to 90 per cent or more-are non-insulin dependent and they often respond best to oral hypoglycaemic drugs. I believe that everybody with diabetes needs a lifestyle audit. Each individual is different and must be treated and assessed differently. Diets must be adjusted for the number of calories and how those are derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins. A moderate exercise program should at least be determined because exercise utilises carbohydrates and reduces the need for insulin. But particularly important is early diagnosis. If we are going to prevent the damage that is done from chronic diabetes, which is a very insidious disease indeed, the importance of early diagnosis cannot be overstressed. A total of 430,000 people-2.4 per cent of the population-are diagnosed with diabetes in Australia now, but up to 700,000 or 800,000 may have it and not realise it. It is the sixth major cause of death from disease in Australia and the United States. There are 110 million people with it worldwide. That is estimated to double over the next 10 or 15 years. It is very worthwhile spending time assessing people with high glucose levels, working out diet and exercise and giving them an understanding and steering them in the direction of peer support groups. We must educate doctors in this country, remarkable as that may sound at first, as well as educating the general population, particularly the target groups that are susceptible to diabetes. I believe that we cannot spend too much money on prevention of this disease that is costing the community in excess of $1,000 million a year in nursing home fees, vascular disease treatment, drugs, doctors' expenses and premature mortality, not to mention the incalculable private cost to individuals and families that are afflicted with this disease. Only 0.1 per cent of the population under 15 may be affected but that rises rapidly to five to six per cent or more over the age of 45 and up to 8.9 per cent in Australia over the age of 75. Aborigines are particularly prone to diabetes. One study revealed a 16.7 per cent incidence in the Bourke-Enngonia area in my electorate. It is interesting that Aborigines have a very low incidence of juvenile diabetes, even though they have a high incidence of the adult form, probably due to a lower exercise status than they used to have before non-Aboriginal people arrived in this country and a constant diet high in sugar. Obviously, alcohol may also have an effect on the pancreas. I was very pleased that last year the budget allocated $7.7 million over three years to implement a national diabetes strategy to reduce the incidence, prevalence, impact and cost of diabetes. That program was linked in with Diabetes Australia, an excellent organisation, as well as the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Diabetes, MACOD, that the previous speaker mentioned, which was an initiative set up in December last year. It also links in with the National Health and Medical Research Council. They are already funding 10 projects. There is also a national health priority accorded to diabetes. Cardiovascular disease, injury, mental health and cancer were the first four and this is now the fifth. That was set up in July last year. That will give a greater focus on this disease. There is also joint funding between the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation of Australia, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International and the National Health and Medical Research Council, pitching in $2 million, $1 million and $2 million respectively over the next five years in research grants, doing things such as trying to identify genes predisposing individuals to juvenile diabetes. The NHMRC is also expending greater than $5 million for diabetes research now. A national diabetic services scheme has been in existence for 10 years. It is a Commonwealth funded subsidy scheme, operated mainly by Diabetes Australia. It provides syringes and diabetes glucose testing strips for 300,000-odd registered members. The Commonwealth provides 86.29 per cent of the cost of that and Diabetes Australia provides 13.71 per cent of the cost. I believe that there may be other initiatives that can be taken by podiatrists and in rural areas but the disease needs a greater national focus. (Time expired)",25
23,Ms ELLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It is definitely a pleasure to have the opportunity to second the motion proposed by my colleague the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) today. In doing so, I preface my comments by saying that much of the finer detail and the statistical information relating to diabetes already been referred to by the two previous speakers, the members for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and Throsby. I do not want to go on and repeat too much of that, but I think some of the points need to be reiterated, considering the severity of the disease in our community. Diabetes is definitely far too common in our community and it has too severe an impact on the lives of the sufferers of this condition to allow it to go unattended. I am not suggesting for a moment that it is, but we need to put into perspective what we are doing and what we need to do in the future. As the motion says-it is hard when I read these statistics to actually understand the enormity of it-approximately every 12 minutes somewhere somebody is receiving a diagnosis of diabetes in this country. That is quite an extraordinary statistic to reflect upon. There are several approaches that are needed when we talk about trying to address the impact of diabetes on the individual and the community. But we also need to look at what we are actually talking about when we refer to the question of diabetes. As has been said, an estimated 800,000 people are affected one way or the other with diabetes in this country. There are two types of diabetes in lay person's terms. Type 1, the juvenile type, is a very sudden onset form of diabetes. I think it is correct to say that it is always insulin dependent. It is very rare that it is not. That is in the minority of the cases, although enormous in numbers. Ninety per cent of the sufferers of diabetes in this country actually fall into the type 2 category. They are not always necessarily insulin dependent. This diabetes occurs in the older age group. Whilst not necessarily being insulin dependent, it can be and is much more insidious in how it can affect the individual. The complications can be devastating-and those complications occur in both insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetes. Those sorts of complications can include, as has been said: blindness; kidney disease; heart disease; stroke; limb amputation; and, in some men, impotence. I was interested to hear the member for has Parkes, the previous speaker, refer to the situation of diabetes in our indigenous people and the high incidence of diabetes that can occur in that community. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. That committee has only just begun an inquiry into indigenous health in this country. I know that over the next few months as we travel the country-and I know they will be very remote places in some cases-I am going to learn a lot more about diabetes within our indigenous community. I am hopeful that that inquiry may be able to shed a bit more light in that area should that be needed. When we talk about the requirement for research, research dollars are always very hard to get at what we would consider an adequate level. But, no matter where the government comes from in political terms, I think what we really have to do is grasp the nettle and say to ourselves, 'When we look at the dollars going into research, let's also look at the cost of the disease or the disorder that we are researching as well. Let's look at what it will really cost our community if we do not address these issues at the level of research adequate.' If we sometimes think about that a lot more carefully, we may find it in ourselves possible to get that extra dollar for research when we look at the cost. The national action plan for Diabetes Australia, which is now called the national diabetes strategy, in the 1996 budget got $7.7 million over three years, and it will have, amongst other things, a very strong education program at two levels. The first level is within the allied health professional area. The second level is the community at large and trying to make the community aware of how to avoid the disease in the first place and of how to alleviate the conditions and the severity of it for those who are unlucky enough to develop it in the second. One of the specific programs, which is called the high risk foot program, is a perfect example of an early alert program for those already suffering diabetes where certain things and strategies can be put into place to alleviate the-(Time expired)",27
24,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Boothby)(1.40 p.m.)Last year, the Economist reported Newt Gingrich as saying: You know, we could save $14 billion a year by reforming what we do on diabetes. He also said: You can save money and improve health by moving to preventative care. They are not radical ideas. The notion that preventative health care can pay dividends has been long recognised and is seen in this government's health policy by such things as: the implementation of the folic acid program for pregnant mothers to reduce the incidence of spina bifida; and also our focus on childhood immunisations. About half of the advances in lifespan that we have seen over the last 25 years have come from changes in lifestyle rather than therapeutic improvements. But what is new about his statements is the attention given to diabetes in public policy-and that has been reflected here in Australia. The previous speakers have covered a number of areas in diabetes-and I do commend the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) for raising this very important issue. In recent news in diabetes, the NHMRC and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation have joined that in what could be a new model for research funding-a government body and a not-forprofit organisation actually collaborating to deliver research funding. Together with the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, they will provide $5 million over five years in a research project which aims to find a cure and better treatment for juvenile onset diabetes. Recently, on World Diabetes Day, last Friday, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) announced that Professor Kevin Lafferty of the John Curtin School will receive $530,000 a year to study cellular processes in the development of insulin dependent diabetes, and that Dr Grant Morahan of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute will receive $470,000 to undertake genetic stHdies of insulin dependent diabetes. In Paul Zimmit and John Carter's article in the Medical Journal of Australia in July this year, a number of the improvements in public policy that we have seen in diabetes since this government was elected were highlighted. In particular, they also talked about some of the advances in diabetes. In 1993, the New England Journal of Medicine published a trial which showed that excellent control of blood sugar levels in people with non-insulin dependent diabetes reduced the risk of microvascular complications. In Scandinavia, a trial has shown that the use of Simvastatin in diabetics who have had one heart attack reduces the risk of a future heart attack by 55 per cent. In the area of end stage renal failure, which is a particular problem for people with diabetes, the use of ACE inhibitors, such as things like Captopril, can delay the onset of end stage renal failure. The importance of having a national diabetes strategy is to see that these sorts of advancements in research are actually delivered out there to medical practitioners and diabetes educators. The national diabetes strategy, which is going to be managed by Diabetes Australia, should improve the treatment and education of those with diabetes. Last Friday was World Diabetes Day. It is worth recognising the emphasis this governised ment has placed on diabetes by making of the five national health priorities-with insulin dependent diabetes, non-insulin deto pendent diabetes and gestational diabetes being targeted. The number of Australians with diabetes is rising. Any preventative health program must target, as the national diabetes strategy is targeting, those from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backMajor ground, those from a non-English speaking background, women who have a history of gestational diabetes, the elderly and those with obesity, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. . Under Labor, the 1993 diabetes action plan for adult onset diabetes was funded by a company and had minimal success. Last hand year's budget allocated $7.6 million for the development of a national non-insulin dependhusband, ent diabetes action plan. That will be directed to research, targeting high risk groups, education, care and prevention. It will also include things like funding to the National Associadedicated tion of Diabetes Centres Consortium and the community. Australian Diabetes Educators Association, which will improve coordination of education and care. The divisions of general practice will also have an increasing role in coordinating diabein tes care. After years of not knowing how many Australians have diabetes, we now have a national diabetes register for diabetics who are treated with insulin.",28

It is adjourned Dear Mr Hawker, Hello, my name is Brett Willoughby. I'm in grade six at Port Fairy Consolidated Schoo} in. Victoria. Lately in our music classes we've been singing a song called 'We are Australian'. My grade and I were wondering if you could do something to change our present national anthem to that song? I wrote to you because our music teacher said you'd be just the person to speak to, and no one else in my grade wanted the opportunity to write to you. So we're really hoping you can do something about our question. But we hope you don't have to too much trouble. Please write back soon. We'd really appreciate it if you could help us. Yours sincerely Brett Willoughby I, certainly have written back and given quite a lot of information about the current anthem and how it was chosen. I have also passed his remarks on to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who, I have no doubt, will respond in due course. I think it is great to see young Australians like this taking a keen interest in national matters. I hope that we can continue to encourage it. Nursing Homes",29

The meeting was held the day after the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced the plates, government's backdown on the nursing home accommodation bond. I pledged that I would bring back to this parliament the concerns older Australians have over the confused stopcient. start policies this government has on nursing home charges. It is clear that this out of touch government has listened to the wrong people when drawers ing up its aged care policies. It has listened wealthy nursing home owners like Doug Moran, but it did not seek advice from leaders of the aged community in electorates like Greenway, such as Ellen Long, President the National Seniors; Golda Zikan, Secretary of the Combined Pensioner and Superannuimporter ants Association; and Levy Lopez, of the Filipino Senior Citizens Association of Sydney. If the government had listened these leaders, it would have been told that its policies were wrong. Only seven per cent of the Australian population enter nursing homes. When they do they are usually very sick and do not want the worry of selling their own home or raising annual fees. As part of Australia's health system there should be a high standard of nursing home care for older people who go to cannot afford to go into private nursing homes. . I believe this government has finally hit the brick wall with its economic rationalist policies, and older people in Greenway have had enough. This government has removed exemptions for means testing of superannuation assets for over-55s; has increased user charges for home and community care; has demolished the Commonwealth dental health program-(Time expired) Motor Vehicles: Imports  Holden Hill and Windsor Gardens in my electorate of Sturt three small businesses specialising in importing motor vehicles have demonstrated ingenuity, initiative and determination. These small businesses come under of the low volume importers scheme of the Vehicles Standards Act 1989, which provides that a licensed low volume importer is limited to 25 vehicles, or 25 compliance per year. However, the niche market demand for these exotic motor vehicles is so great that the limit of 25 vehicles per low volume importing business is often insuffiTo import a greater number of vehicles would require these businesses to come under the provisions of the medium volume importscheme in the prescribed legislation. to Under this scheme converters are, understanda?ly and quite sensibly, required to mee,t hIgher standards of safety. The costs associated with meeting these higher standards are of sufficient enough to discourage low volume importers from moving to medium volume status and thus increase local emPresident ployment opportunities. With the Department of Transport and to Regional Development soon to commence a review of the Motor Vehicles Standards Act 1989, I would encourage the review committee to consider the necessity of supporting vehicle importing small businesses without sacrificing the integrity of the high standards of vehicle safety which all Australian road users expect and to which they have become accustomed. MACGregor State High School",30
28,Mr HARDGRAVE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to report on the good work of students and teachers at myoid school, MACGregor State High. MACGregor has always maintained a strong commitment to encouraging enterprise among students, developing programs to give students incentive and a taste of the working world beyond. In fact, almost 25 years ago MACGregor High encouraged students like me to build and maintain a project called 4MG, a lunchtime radio station. This gave a number of us a start in the media after we left school. These days MACGregor continues to encourage student success. Year 11 and 12 manual arts students work successfully under a corporate image called Macbuild. Macbuild students experience being an integral part of an engineering or construction company. They build commitment and gain encouragement as well as a sense of responsibility from being part of the team at Macbuild. Students wear the corporate logo on caps and shirts to enforce their valuable role at MACGregor High campus. They apply themselves to problem solving at MACGregor High. They have repaired and built new many things-handrails, picnic tables and lots more. Last week I helped Macbuild students to proudly unveil a wonderful and massive fourmetre high statue, Quin Quenium-Latin for five-year span-designed by art student Nigel Gallibu. The students also presented me with honorary Macbuild indentures. I salute MacGregor High's principal, David Edwards, manual arts teachers Don Foreman and Alan Burnie, as well as arts master Geoff Brewster. They are professional teachers with a real . commitment to their students, encouraging students to achieve through education and experiences caught, not just taught. Native Title: Western Australia",31
29,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Swan)"""""":""'I rise to inform this House and those many concerned Australians in the wider community that the native title mess continues to cause great anxiety and uncertainty. Importantly, it is stymieing the growth and future development of my state of Western Australia. In Karratha, in the north-west of Western Australia, the Roebourne Shire Council believes that two native title claims which surround Karratha and the hinterland have effectively stopped the local infrastructure development and the residential expansion of that town. There is the potential to have thousands of families move into this region to support the resource projects of Hamersley Iron, W oodside Petroleum, Dampier Salt and other organisations. The decentralisation of this kind is welcome in comparison to the fly-in and fly-out practices that are employed by many other projects in the area. The unresolved native title claims in this region are therefore a threat to the resource wealth of this country and the desired attraction which the decentralisation brings to this area. Combined with this are 66 native title claims in the City of Belmont, which is one city in my electorate of Swan, which covers such things as road reserves, river reserves, drainage reserves, kids' playgrounds-in terms of crown land-football grounds, rugby grounds et cetera. This native title vexatious claim business has to be addressed in the 10point plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), which will address this whole issue. In particular, I ask the ALP and the Democrats to stop playing games and political point scoring for the sake of this great country, Australia, and let us resolve this absolute mess which native title has cast on Australia at the moment. Native Title: Australia's International Obligations",31
30,Mr MELHAM,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"My challenge to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) today is to table in the parliament any advice he has received as to whether his Native Title Amendment Bill complies with Australia's international obligations. It is imperative that the parliament is told whether advice was obtained, from whom it was obtained, when it was obtained and when it was received. The government should table that advice immediately. In the Senate legal committee on Thursday, 23 October, Senator Bolkus asked the Solicitor-General: ... but was advice sought on whether in fact we have breached our international obligations, and was it sought from you? Dr Griffith said: I would be happy to answer, but I feel I should seek a direction from the Attorney before I do, because that deals with the matter of my acting counsel for the Commonwealth. My understanding is that advice has been sought as to whether that bill is in breach of our international obligations, and that legal advice is that we are if we pursue the bill. The only way this can be cleaned up is for the government to show some transparency in this arrangement. Dr Griffith is an eminent silk. We want to know who was asked for the advice and when it was given, and we want it tabled, because the situation is that there is a lot of misinformation out there. Dr Griffith was answering specifically a question he was asked. The government has claimed legal professional privilege in relation to two documents on the return to order motion in the Senate on 2 October to do with the Law Reform Commission. The government has claimed legal professional privilege from the Sydney Morning Herald on a freedom of information. The position is that they should table the advice. (Time expired) Electorate of Robertson: Exports",31
31,Mr LLOYD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to rise briefly this afternoon to highlight the achievements of yet another successful exporting company in my electorate of Robertson. Future School, a division of BKW Investments, is a totally 100 per cent Australian owned company which currently employs 20 full-time staff and some 15 part-time employees and occupies premises at West Gosford on the Central Coast of New South Wales. BKW Investment Future School is an ongoing development from their original company, Home Study Videos, registered in 1984 to develop, produce and market educational video programs. Over the past seven years they have developed interactive multimedia programs in both mathematics and English. The products are marketed to educational institutions and retailed for use by students in the home. Currently in excess of 200,000 students throughout the world access the HSV BKW program via one or both of these mediums. The interactive English and mathematics multimedia programs consist of 140 fully developed CD-ROMs and contain the assets of the system, providing audio, graphics, as animation and on-line printed worksheets. The entire system is in excess of 91 gigabytes of information and provides basic and advanced interactive education that extends from kindergarten to year 12. Already in 1997 Future School have won the 1997 Australian-British export award, the 1997 New South Wales Premier's exporter of the year award-(Time expired) Redmond, Mr Frank: War Service",32
32,Mr LEO MCLEAY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Thursday, 13 November,. I attended a function at the Narrabeen war veterans home to mark the 103rd birthday of Mr Frank Redmond. Frank Redmond is yet another example of an unsung hero. Frank served his country in both world wars and I would particularly like to draw the attention of the House to his service in World War I. Frank did not serve at Gallipoli; he served in the trenches in France. He, along with many veterans who had served overseas in World War I, was unfortunately overlooked when the 75th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli were commemoratednot that Frank would have minded; he is not that sort of bloke. He is just proud to have served his country and probably very grateful to have survived when so many of his mates did not. The celebrations for his 103rd birthday were organised in large part by the Penshurst RSL Club. In particular, thanks should go to Norm Sandstrom and Frank MCCrea, who were busy behind the scenes making arrangements for a bus to take club members and friends to the Narrabeen war veterans nursing home. The nursing home was most generous in making Frank's guests most welcome and Frank's daughter, Barbara Knock, joined in the celebrations. I am sure that Thursday's celebrations have gone some small way towards recognising the remarkable contribution that Frank Redmond has made to Australia It was very interesting to understand that Frank's view of war is that we should not have any more. For a person who served in both world wars and saw the terrible atrocities in the trenches in France, this is a very good statement about where we should be with wars. (Time expired) Cooked Chicken Meat",32
33,Mrs WEST,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise today to talk about the government's announcement relating to the importation of cooked chicken meat. My electorate of Bowman accounts for about 35 per cent of Queensland's chicken production. As a result, this generates hundreds of jobs which are important to Bowman's overall economy for both processors and producers. I congratulate the government on this decision. It has made an extensive assessment by AQIS",33

35,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) will be absent from question time today. He is in Melbourne for the listing of Telstra Qn the Australian Stock Exchange. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) will be very pleased to answer questions on his behalf. NA Nursing Homes,33
36,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister explain to the House why he performed his latest backflip on nursing homes without taking the matter to the cabinet, and why the departmental officials employed to administer the new policy only learned the details of it by sitting in front of a TV with a notepad . while he appeared on A Current Affair? Prime Minister, why is it that your government seems to spend more time trying to censor funeral orations and tearing down bus shelters than it does thinking about providing a decent nursing homes policy for elderly Australians that will not cost them their homes?",33
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--:A decent nursing home policy for retired Australians includes a number of elements. The first of those elements is a very, very significant ongoing contribution from the general body of taxpayers. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that, even making allowance for the contribution of people who will be required to meet the new annual accommodation charges, something in the order of 70 per cent-I repeat, 70 per cent-of the entire cost of maintaining such a person in a nursing home will be met out of the general pool of taxpayers' funds. The second observation I would make is that any decent nursing home policy requires that the quality of nursing homes be such that the elderly of Australia can live there in dignity and comfort. That is something that the Labor Party ruthlessly ignored because, in the remaining years that the Labor Party was in office, you ruthlessly and cynically and deliberately, and with no care at all for the welfare of elderly Australians, ran down that capital contribution. The third element of a decent nursing home policy is that it is fair for the rest of the community to ask of those and the families of those who are going into nursing homes that, if they can afford to do so, they make a contribution towards the care of their relatives in nursing homes. They are the three elements of a decent nursing home policy. I think those who are interested in the state of nursing homes are entitled to ask of both sides of politics which side is the more serious in delivering that policy. All the Labor Party has done is to deliberately scare the elderly of Australia. You have run around the Australian community, deliberately trying to scare elderly people. You know as well as we do the age demographics of the Australian population. You know that we can no longer afford to ignore, any of us-and I address that to all members opposite and to all those behind me-the ageing character of the Australian population. In the long run, a responsible government puts in place a policy that will get more capital into nurs.ing - omes. They will do it in a way that IS fair and balanced and just. They will do it in the teet.h of unfair, unfounded criticism and OppOSItion-and that is what we have done. When the Minister for Family Services speaks on this matter later this week, the Australian public will know that it has a - overnment that has a detailed, comprehensIve, long-term nursing home policy that will give security and comfort to the elderly, will give them comfort and dignity but will, at the same time ensure that there are proper capital cont;ibutions to the nursing home stock of this country. Telstra: Public Share Offer",33
38,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question and congratulations go to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the government's successful float of one-third of Telstra. How does today's listing on the Stock Exchange m-et and exceed the promises put to the AustralIan people by the Liberal and Nationalyarties at the last election? How have AustralIans taken up the public offer and, through the-r - ccept­ ance, how has mainstream AustralIa Judged the alternative proposals?",34
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I looked around for comment about Telstra, by far the most memorable, by far the most penetrating and by far the most relevant comment that has been made about Telstra in the last 48 hours was made not by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; it was made by the Leader of the Opposition. This is what he had to say on 4QR radio this morning: 'I'm sad that the Telstra float has gone ahead.' Doesn't that just encapsulate the miserable negativity of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is sad that 600,000 Australians for the first time have bought shares on the Australian Stock Exchange. The Leader of the Opposition is sad that Telstra is now ow,ned, as to 81 per cent of its shares, by AustralIans. The Leader of the Opposition is sad that the Australian taxpayer has got $14.2 billion for the sale of one-third of Telstra. The Leader of the Opposition is sad that, havinI? left a budget deficit of $10.5 billIon, we. are actually cleaning up the mess he left behmd. The Leader of the Opposition is apparently sad that four per cent of the shares in the float have gone to the employees of Telstra. . This is another magnificent example of my government having not only deliver-d in full but having over-delivered on a m-mstream election commitment. We promIsed the Australian people that we would sel! one thi:d of Telstra. This development is a mIlestone m the economic history of Australia. The sale of Telstra has underlined the fundamental sense of hope and optimism of the Australian people. It is a great investment by the mums and dads in the ownership of a great Australian enterprise. Well may those on the op-o-ite side be glum about this. AI-ost two mIll.lOn Australians now own shares m Telstra. It IS a magnificent demonstration of the willingness of mainstream Australia to invest their money in great Australian compan-es. And. what - s the attitude of those who SIt OpposIte? It IS negative, nitpicking, sad sack opposition. to the successful float of a great AustralIan enterprise. Well may the Leader of the Opposition be sad. This has been a triumphant success, underlining the hope and optimism .of .the Australian people. It is a wonderful vmdIcation of the policy that we took to the last election. We promised to sell a third. We have sold a third. We promised majority Australian ownership. We have 81 per cent Australian ownership. We promised that we would invest $1.2 billion out of the proceeds of the sale in the re-invigoration of the natural heritage of this country. And wh-t do we g-t from the Opposition Leader? He IS sad. He. IS sad about such goods news for AustralIa. Many Australians will be sad that the Leader of the Opposition is so demonstrably. out of touch with the sentiment and the emotlons of mainstream Australia. NA",34

41,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minster for Family Services. If a person rents out their home to pay your new $12 a day nursing home fee, will all the rent they get be exempt from the pensions income test or just $4,380 of it? Will a wealthy person who rents out their home in Sydney for $1,000 a week be able to use this arrangement to get around the income test and qualify for a pension?",35
42,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Prime Minister has just indicated, I will be making a statement in due course which will cover all of the issues that have been raised. Mr Bevis-Another one!",35
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Brisbane!,35
44,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I discussed the matter with the industry last Thursday. They were likewise of the view that a detailed statement would be appropriate. Mr Bevis interjecting,35
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Brisbane. Landmines,35
46,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Prime Minister to the government's commitment to reducing the tragedy of antipersonnellandmines around the globe. In the light of that commitment, could the Prime Minister inform the House of the government's position on the Ottawa treaty on landmines?",35
47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. I know that the honourable gentleman, as have many members on both sides of the House, let it be admitted, has taken a very keen interest in this issue. I am particularly proud of the that my government, my Foreign Minister and others have done in dealing with the issue of landmines. I would remind the House that this government took the initiative on 15 April last year, shortly after coming to office, of committing Australia to a global ban on antipersonnel landmines. We then suspended indefinitely their operational use by the Australian Defence Force. I am now particularly pleased to inform the House that· the Minister for Foreign Affairs will sign the Ottawa treaty on behalf of Australia when it opens for signature on 3 and 4 December. I thank him and the Minister for Defence and others who have been involved in the process of the formulation of the government's policy on this issue. The treaty, the full title of which is the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Antipersonnel Mines and on their Destruction, will mean that Australia will forswear the use of antipersonnel landmines and destroy its own stockpile of those landmines. The treaty allows only a small number of mines to be retained for development and training in mine detection, clearance and destruction techniques. The government is very disappointed that, despite the likely signature by over 100 countries, the major producers and exporters of landmines are not prepared at this stage to sign the treaty. We will work very hard now in other forums, notably at the Conference on Disarmament, to ensure that the norm established by the Ottawa treaty becomes universal and includes these producers and exporters. The government will also continue its strong support for de-mining and assistance to the victims of landmines. Since May of 1996 this government has committed over $19 million to de-mining operations in Cambodia, Laos, Angola, Mozambique and Afghanistan. I do acknowledge, as anybody who understands this acknowledges, that this decision does create some difficulty for the Australian Defence Force. Australia has never been associated with the irresponsible use of landmines but they have played an important part in plans for the defence of Australia. I emphasise in that context that we will be work focusing very much on finding and developing an alternative to them, and developing that alternative will now be essential in the overall defence structure of this country. The decision I have announced today that we will sign the Ottawa treaty will be widely welcomed throughout the Australian community. It is the humanitarian right way to go. The scourge of landmines, the devastation that they wreak physically, emotionally and in so many other respects on their helpless victims, is a poignant reminder of the brutality of man to man. I think the decision we have taken is the right one, and quite properly deserves the applause and support of the Australian community. Nursing Homes: Assets Test",35
48,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Is the family home still part of the nursing home assets test?,36
49,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After having conducted a scare campaign about the family home being forced to be sold, the member for Jagajaga is now continuing to raise this issue even in light of the announcements that have been made by the government and accepted by the industry. All the parties in the industry met with me last Thursday and they all agreed that the fundamental principles that underpinned the government's decision, which has just been outlined by the Prime Minister, were the correct way to go to address the problems that you chose to neglect when you were in government. Remember that 75 per cent decrease in the capital that needed to go into the centre? You did nothing about it. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: it was a very straightforward question. Is the family home still part of the assets test?",36
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,36
51,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, you were the ones who started the scare campaign. Mrs Crosio-Answer the question-yes or no?",36

59,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, the family home is safe.",36
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will resume his seat. I invoke standing orders 304A in respect of the member for Prospect.,36
61,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I do not dispute your right to put people who are disorderly out of this place, but the fact of the matter is that there was a chorusing going on on both sides of the House and I was on my feet for a full 30 seconds with a point of order before the minister actually sat down. You were attempting to call me and draw the minister's attention to the fact that he ought to seat himself when something like that is occurring. We have had a disorderly interlude in this House over the last minute or two, but the disorder has not by any means been on one side of it, and for one side of it to get punished is inappropriate.",36
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,l am well aware of the state of the House. I draw the attention of all members of the House to the disorder that is going on. I have warned a number of people already today. The member for Prospect was one of them. When encouraged to cease and desist she did not. The penalty has been paid. I now issue a general warning to you all. The honourable member for Prospect thereupon withdrew from the chamber. Economy,36
63,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. At the hearing 11 days ago of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Macfarlane, in commenting on recent events, said: We are in a much better position to handle the financial instability than we have been at any stage, I think, in the last quarter of a century ... Could the Treasurer please advise the House why Australia's economic fundamentals are so sound and how this puts Australia in good stead to handle the situations due to unforeseen events in regional economies?",36
64,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I acknowledge the fine work that he is doing as chairman of that committee and the way in which the committee is performing. It was one of this government's changes in relation to monetary policy-our determination to make the conduct of monetary policy more transparent and to set out an inflation objective-that has brought such benefits in relation to interest rates. When this government was elected the difference between the 10year bond rate in the US and the 10-year bond rate in Australia was 250 basis points. As a result of changes that we have put in place, they are almost the same, trading at maybe a margin of 10 or 15 points. The other point that the Governor of the Reserve Bank was making was that prudent economic managers will always ensure that they have at least a small margin-hopefully a big one-in order to weather external shocks. We have witnessed enormous volatility on world stock markets, we have seen enormous volatility on South-East Asian currency markets, and that has affected Australia to some degree, but the one thing we can say is that this government's prudent course to fix Australia's financial position bought Australia a level of comfort which it needed for an external shock like this. And we can say this: if the wanton irresponsibility of Labor mismanagement had continued, Australia would not be in the position that it is now. We now have the lowest level of inflation in Australia since the 1960s. We have the lowest home mortgage rates since man walked on the moon-since 1969. We have a budget which will go back into surplus next year. At the same time, this year Australclaiming is will not borrow and next year Australia will not borrow. This year Australia will be repaying debt. And that is a long way away from Labor's plan, which was to try to make Australia a debtor nation. Whenever you hear the Australian Labor Party up here, it is always the same: tax and spend, run up deficits, run up debt, run up interest rates. This is no new Labor; this is the old, failed Keating Labor. Can I also observe that Australia, of course, has played its part in relation to both Thailand and Indonesia to stabilise regional currencies. I welcome the support of the opposition in relation to that. But all of us would have noticed with shock the attempts of the Australian Labor Party when the volatility on world stock markets took place to try to talk down the Telstra float. One journalist said it was irresponsibility. It was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who went on the radio and tried to talk down the Telstra float. It was he who said on The World Today: They are going to think long and hard about selling down into the present market. That is what he said. He went on: Telstra should be in public ownership. The whole exercise has been misconceived. The hopes for windfall gains from this are now likely not to be realised in the present environment. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that. Listen to this: The government has only got itself to blame for creating expectations that the world is now not going to satisfy. That is what he said-and Telstra was floated. And not only was it floated at the top price of expectations but today on the Australian Stock Exchange it had risen 60c. Mr Gareth Evans interjecting",37
65,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is undervalued now, is it? Listen to this: The hopes for windfall gains are not likely to be realised. That was Garynomics two weeks ago. Now it is undervalued. This will appear in the first chapter of his book Garynomics made easy. He was joined by the Leader of the Opposition, who back in December of 1996 was on the radio that you could not sell Telstra other than in 10 to 15 per cent lots unless you were going for a fire sale. The ignorance on these issues from the Australian Labor Party knows no bounds. The Australian Labor Party would not have given ordinary Australians the chance to buy a share in Telstra; they were opposed to it. The Australian Labor Party would not have given mums and dads the opportunity to take out equity; they were opposed to it. The Australian Labor Party tried to talk down the price of Telstra; they were opposed to it. The Australian Labor Party, if it had any decency and if it were really opposed to the Telstra sale, would now say it was going to buy it back if it were ever re-elected. Is that right? We normally hear so much interjection from the Leader of the Opposition. The silence befits him. Nursing Homes: Accommodation Charge",37
66,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. What will be the interest rate charged by the banks to elderly Australians who now have to mortgage their homes to get a nursing home bed? Will this conflict with the Prime Minister's assurances on the Ray Martin show, where he said, 'You won't have to repay any of it while you are in the nursing home. You won't have to pay any interest'?",38
67,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the options that will be available to pay an accommodation charge will be the prospect of what is described as a reverse mortgage or a home style life payment.l'hat is one option. The other options I have already outlined previously include charging against the estate and the prospect of also renting the home and taking the rent to meet the accommodation charge. When the product of the banks is made available to the consumer market, the relevant rates that pertain to the relevant streaming of the funds to the accommodation charge will be made and it will be paid against that person's estate. There may well be, as there are in other countries, a range of products offered by a range of institutions with different arrangements. We will obviously be seeking from the banking sector the best product available to enhance the opportunity for consumers. I have consistently said that, and that remains the position of the government. Social Welfare",38
68,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to reports of a conversion to his principle of mutual obligation, particularly in the area of work for the dole and the coalition's other sweeping reforms to welfare? Does the Prime Minister believe such a conversion to be credible or utterly implausible?",38
69,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Clearly this question, especially the second half, is asking the Prime Minister for an expression of opinion. It is simply an opinion and therefore it is out of order.",38
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Prime Minister.,38
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think he is just asking me whether I have read the Sydney Morning Herald. I would never pass through a day without doing that. Can I say in response to the honourable gentleman that I have noticed with a great deal of fascination the efforts of the Australian Labor Party to simultaneously reinvent themselves yet pretend that nothing has changed. In the process they have engaged in a little bit of old smash and grab of political labels and political descriptions. One of the more fascinating of these, of course, and the member for Batman will know all about this, is the use of the expression 'reciprocal obligations'. That reminds me ever so faintly of a description that has quite properly been used by me for months and months about a number of policies. It really is built upon the notion, as I have frequently said, of mutual obligation. The notion of mutual obligation is that, if society is willing to look after people in their time of need, then to the extent reasonable it is only fair and proper that those who are looked after should give something back to society in return. I want to welcome the signs that those who sit opposite have embraced this very important description of what should be a fair balance between the citizen and the government as we move towards the twentyfirst century. Somebody interjects, 'Tony Blair.'",38
72,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, Working Nation.",38
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I were the member for Blaxland, I would not only read my Sydney Morning Herald every morning, I would also read my Australian. Mr Hatton- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, I was in fact referring the Prime Minister to Working Nation, where those terms were used, and not to Tony Blair.",38
74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,39
75,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would commend those people to read not only their Sydney Morning Herald but also their Australian. There was quite a perceptive article in the Australian this morning that made the point that, if Kim Beazley and Cheryl Kernot think that Tony Blair is a great bloke, they ought to have a look at the policies that Tony Blair is following. You will find that the policies he is following actually more closely resemble the policies of Margaret Thatcher and John Major and the policies of the coalition than they do the policies of any particular Labor Party around the world. The interesting thing is that the Labor Party has tried in a sort of a tailend Charlie fashion to pick this up and put its own particular label on it",39
76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order which goes to relevance: if it is relevant for the Prime Minister to discuss Tony Blair's views as allegedly a source for ours, would he allow me to table this document from W orking Nation, headed 'reciprocal obligation'?",39
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is testing my patience. Resume your seat.,39
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reality is that when the government sought to promote policies which are based upon the principle of mutual obligation, the reaction of the Australian Labor Party was a reaction of opposition and of stark horror.",39
79,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's rubbish.,39
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased to hear that there is now some kind of change of heart. I hope it continues. But when the work for the dole scheme was introduced, this is what the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate had to say: Despite the government's rhetoric this bi!l provides new and very wide ranging powers for compulsion ... What we say is that this is not acceptable ... Accordingly, Labor will be moving an amendment to delete the provisions of the bill which allow secretary to compel unemployed people to participate in the work for the dole scheme. If you are really serious about mutual obligation, you have to support a work for the dole approach. If you are really serious about mutual obligation, you have to embrace policies that say to people, 'When you are in need we will help you, but in return we expect you to do something reasonable to help the community.' In thrashing around for some kind of alternative visage, what the Labor Party have done is to stumble upon philosophies and attitudes of the coalition, just as they have seen their Labor counterpart in the UK embrace the philosophies of their predecessor. You haven't seen your great friend Tony Blair dismantling the industrial relations legislation of the Thatcher government. You haven't seen Tony Blair renationalising the privatised industries. He will no more renationalise British Telecom and British Airways than you would commit yourself to renationalising Telstra. If the sale of Telstra was such a tremendously bad idea, why don't you embrace the reacquisition of the one-third that we have successfully sold? The truth of the matter is that the notion of mutual obligation is fundamental to the philosophy and the approach of our side of politics. We welcome this conversion by the Australian Labor Party towards that approach. But, Mr Speaker, don't allow any member of the party that now sits opposite to pose in the Australian community as having discovered a new idea, a new sense of direction, a new momentum or a new philosophy, because it is the same tired old Labor Party. If it wants a decent idea it looks to the coalition for one. Drugs Tax",39
81,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Minister for Health. Isn't it the case that your new drugs tax is designed to save the government more than $500 million by cutting subsidies for medicines for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers and d-pres­ sion? Isn't it also the case that the chronIcally ill, the elderly and especially those in nursing homes will be hardest hit when they are forced to pay more for their essential medicines after 1 February? When asked in this the House about the authorship of the nursing homes policy, you first avoided the question, then you said you had not seen it until ERC, and then you finally blamed your colleagues. Is your mean and unfair policy on essential medicines your own doing, or is that someone else's fault as well?",39
82,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourwhen able member for his question. Clearly he not understand the policy. The fact is that every person will have an option of paying more at all by picking a referenced price drug. The whole point about referenced price drugs is that to get on the pharmaceutical benefits system in the first place the comment panies had to show that they were therapeutihas cally equivalent. So no-one will be required to pay more. They can choose a drug of higher similar equivalence that costs Employment,40
83,Mr MUTCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to is the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of progress with the at government's policies to address unemploymessages ment?

84,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cook for his question. What distinguishes this government from those on the other side of the House is that the government has been prepared to put in the hard yards in economic policy to lay the foundations for sustained growth in Australia. Members of the Australbusiness. Ian community have been heartened in recent months by a number of signs that job growth is now well and truly getting under way. In the last couple of months, we have had some 75,000 new jobs coming through, and there power are some very good indicators that suggest that this job growth, while it will fluctuate from month to month, is very likely to come through in very good numbers over the next year. The retail trade figures showed a 3.1 per cent increase in September, the largest terly rise since the series began. The skilled vacancy survey showed a 3.9 per cent rise October, the strongest rise in almost three years. The latest Morgan and Banks survey shows a two-year record in the proportion of companies seeking to increase their staff. The government is also putting in place major reforms to help long-term unemployed people get jobs by paying job placement agencies a job has actually been obtained. I am does aware that there are alternative proposals around to create jobs, and a document has no come into my hands called 'Economic first principles: well-being, jobs and growth', which I understand is the draft jobs platform from the Australian Labor Party. What this docushows is that the Australian Labor Party learnt nothing. This is a prescription for job destruction, because it is a prescription for spending, higher taxes and a return to not a cent more. Working Nation. One of the first things that strikes you when you read this prescription for jobs is that there absolutely no reference in this document to small business-the major engine of job growth in this country. There is no reference all to small business. There are, however, in here which small business in this country will read too clearly between the lines The first thing that strikes you is that there is a determination to restore the powers to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to restore the powers to unions to enter the workplace and to expand the right of trade union officials to interfere in small business. In other words, once again what we have here is the relentlessly sectional policies of the Labor Party. Its concern in clause after clause job is the promotion of union power against small Not every member of the Labor front bench believes that this is that way to go. The member for Werriwa has said: The union movement already exercises tremendous in the ALP, mainly through its support for the ruling faction in each state branch. undoubtedly In the same document he said: This decade the ALP will be forced to confront the fading relevance of its trade union affiliates. He was absolutely right on that point. But he has not got the message through to the memquarber for Batman. The member for Batman is, of course, the spokesman for trade union in power, and that is clearly reflected in this draft policy, which would destroy jobs and reinforce the policies of unfair dismissals which have destroyed jobs in small business. The other key feature of this policy is that it is going to restore the short-term training programs of Working Nation-the $10 billion failed program of the Labor Party. There is no commitment in here to programs to help long term unemployed people by rewarding agencies for actually placing them in jobs, there no commitment in here to the apprenticeship reforms of the government and there is no commitment in here to quality training; there is simply a commitment to the same old policies which led to the lowest number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships for three decades. This document reveals, once again, that the Labor Party is a policy free zone when it comes to employment. It has absolutely no credibility at all in creating jobs. It is a policy for more regulation, bigger spending, higher deficits and higher taxesand that is a policy for job destruction. Research and Development",40
85,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism say, at a recent function of the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce, that the Australian private sector was failing 'to pay its research and development bill'? Did he also say that private companies 'in no way match the contribution from the public purse'? What data does the minister have to support his claims given that private sector expenditure in 1995-96 on research and development exceeded public expenditure by $700 million?",41
86,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the honourable member, it is quite clear the Australian government's response to R&D is very strong. There is $3.5 billion spent or conceded by the government on research and development in Australia and we are very committed to it. On Labor top of that, the spending that we directly put in through the CSIRO is a very significant contribution which teams up with the private sector. I cannot comment on the figure that you gave but I can assure you that the figures I have indicate that the federal government's contribution to R&D far exceeds that of the private sector. Industrial Relations",41
87,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware of reports in the media about proposals to tum back the Australian industrial relations clock to the 1970s? Minister, considering the present global trading and economic environment, is what impact would such a proposal have on the Australian workplace and the prospects for Australian jobs growth?",41
88,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have seen reports and I do not think there is any doubt that if we were to tum back the clock in the management of industrial relations,41
89,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question was hypothetical and now he says, 'If we were to do this and that.' He is expressing an opinion of what would happen. Question time is not about hypotheticals, it is about the real facts of government.",41
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order; resume your seat.,41
91,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The real facts are that a policy that turns back the clock in industrial relations is going to cost a lot of people their jobs. It is going to mean reduced real wages for a lot of people, and low-income people particularly are going to be worse off, as they were when Labor was running the industrial relations system in this country over the last 13 years through until 1996. The policy announced by the Labor Party last week is the most regressive, out of date and unfair policy that they have announced the whole time they have been in opposition. It is no wonder that this policy has been condemned from one end of the country to the other. If you look at the various reports, the Victorian employers, for example, said: plans to turn back the clock in the industrial relations refonn to increase job security are illfounded and counter-productive. The National Farmers Federation said that the ALP's reported new industrial relations policy would take Australia back to the unproductive work practices of the 1960s. Why go back to . the 1970s when you can go back to the 1960s or further back? Another report said: The Australian Chamber of Manufacturers today warned that the ALP's Draft Industrial Relations Policy has the potential to deter investment and destabilise Australia's progress towards a more modem system of workplace relations. ACCI said: Proposing an increased role for the intervention in workplace employee relations by thir- parti-s, be they industrial tribunals or trade ulllons, IS not progress. Senator Andrew Murray, of the Democratsnot exactly a card carrying member of the Liberal Party-said: I just don't think the. A-P has. come t? terms with the massive changes m mdustnal relatIOns over the past decade. Their return to their pre-1992 policies will see the same cuts in workers' real wages and the same rise in casual and temporary work that characterised the ALP's first decade in power. The MTIA were critical of it, the Business Council of Australia have been critical of it and the HIA are critical of it, particularly those provisions which see the end of the trade practices ban on secondary boycotts. It is unbelievable that you would unleash some of these trade union bosses, not for the interests of the workers but just to shore up the political power and the entrenched position of a few members of the ACTU hierarchy. The Financial Review said: Cruelly, the only security this a-proach will deliver is to members of powerful Ulllons ... They are absolutely right. Even the Age, which is not exactly a front-running advocate for the coalition party, says that it is a policy that will do little to protect the jobs of traditional Labor voters and that it looks back to an era that cannot be recovered. The Daily Telegraph says: Despite Labor's comprehensive loss in the last election, Mr MCMullan apparently believes the best way forward is to perform an industrial relations Utum and head back to the 1970s. Ewin Hannan puts it rather weII: It is difficult not to be cynical about Labor's change of heart, that it is driven by populism. They accuse us of populism. Mr Fischer and I have been discussing that. We both agreed to say that on the day we both tum up here, sit on the front bench and have had hair transplants you can accuse us of populism. This policy has been roundly condemned. It deserves to be roundly condemned; it is a regressive policy. It is against everything that you yourselves said was necessary. when you were in government. No-one belIeves you. You have come to the conclusion that you think there is a quick vote in this. This is not in the country's best interests. Drugs Tax",41
92,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, can you confinn that more than one million Australians are taking the 110 drugs which are covered by your new drugs tax? In reference to your previous answer, where you criticised the opposition for not understanding your changes, have you seen comments by the Phannaceutical Society of Australia which caIIed on the government to release details of the new drugs tax immediately? Minister, why have you not yet released details about your new drugs tax, six. months after it was announced? Is this just another massive policy foul-up, or is it a deliberate attempt by this government to hide details of this disastrous policy by running a so-caIIed information campaign over Christmas?",42
93,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The policy does not start until 1 February, so there is still over 2Y2 months to go. That is the first point that I want to make. The second point is that I have always said since this was announced that we would take clinical advice. We have been prepared to do that. We removed bet-­ blockers from the original six therapeutIc groups on the basis of clinical advice. We are still taking clinical advice on a number of other areas. My parliamentary secretary, who looks after this on a day-today basis, has been consulting with various professional colleges about this issue. The fact is that in the end we will come out with a policy that is in the public interest, that maintains acc-ss to all medications and that allows us to bnng new medications onto the PBS. We will not have a scheme that is doubling in cost every four years, which is what you left us with. Iraq  the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of the government's position on the current situation in Iraq? Are there any Australians in Iraq? If so, what is the government doing to ensure their safety?",42
94,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his keen interest in international relations. As I said yesterday, Australia condemns Iraq's decision to expel the American UNSCOM inspectors. It is in direct, flagrant defiance a United Nations Security Council resolution, it is in defiance of the rule of international law, and it is in defiance of the wishes of the international community. The Australian government regards Iraq's behaviour as unacceptable. Australia, like the rest of the international community, is seriously concerned about Iraq's refusal to renounce its capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction. UNSCOM's latest report set out compelling concerns about Iraq's chemical and biological weapons program. The possibility that Iraq retains or persists in wanting to develop these horrific weapons of mass destruction poses a threat to peace in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East and a direct threat to international security, and it must be stopped. Iraq's behaviour is, moreover, a threat to the credibility of the United Nations Security Council. If it is indulged in any way, it will undermine the role of the Security Council. That, in tum, will have enormous consequences for the rule of international law and for international security. There is therefore no alternative to full and immediate compliance by Iraq, without any restrictions or conditions, with the resolutions of the Security Council. In causing this crisis, President Saddam Hussein has yet again demonstrated his contempt for the international community and his disregard for the suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of his complete refusal to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions. We understand that there are approximately 15 Australians currently in Iraq. Last Friday my department advised all Australians to leave Iraq, and some I understand have now done so. Consular officers from my department here in Canberra are staying closely in touch with embassy officers in Amman, in Jordan, and throughout the region in order to safeguard the welfare of Australians and New Zealanders who are still in Iraq. I note that communications within Iraq and between Iraq and the outside world are at times rather difficult. In conclusion, let me take this opportunity to salute the important work that has been of done by all the Australians who have served with the United Nations Special Commission during the years of its operation. Trust Losses",43
95,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Minister, I refer to your trafficking in trust losses legislation and the exemption for tax avoiders that you have allowed in relation to certain injections of income into family trusts. Do you recall telling this House in answer to my question on 29 October that no revenue would be lost as a result of allowing this exemption? How do you now explain the evidence of First Assistant Tax Commissioner Manoranjan at the Senate estimates last week that there would in fact be a revenue loss as a result of your exemption?",43
96,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to keep on going over and over this ground for as long as you allow me to do so, Mr Speaker, because they never make any progress. I am told that the reason they ask these questions is not that they are at all interested in trafficking in trust loss, but that they are desperately trying to raise the possibility of saying where they will get the revenue from for the ALP platform to repurchase Telstra, to change the nursing homes and to engage in all of the other expenditure reductions which they are promising.",43
97,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is a point of order raised in despair as much as anything else. There was a specific question asked of the minister on answers that he has been blustering his way through in the last couple of weeks as to whether there would be any losses from this. He has had a departmental official say there would be, and that was the question.",43
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I am listening very· carefully to the Treasurer's response.,44
99,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No point of order whatsoever-and to hear you talk about blustering, you of all people! You sit there and engage in this psycho-babble from the other side of the table every time you make an error, followed by hysterical laughter. There it goes again.",44
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will come back to the thrust of the question.,44
101,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The facts of the legislation are as I have always said, that the govern-ent announced in the budget that. it would ensure that its legislation dealt WIth trafficking in trusts. Do you know what trafficking in trusts is? Trafficking in trusts trafficking trusts to people outside the family or those who are presently entitled. That was the object of the legislation. The legislation that was produced was defective in two respects. First, as I said before, you were unable where you traded through trusts to set trust loss off against trust income where Y0.u had the same entitled beneficiaries, so that If you were an individual and you had income you were able to access the loss, but if you were an individual in a trust which had a loss you were unable to set it off against income which would come from your presently entitled trust. Nothing was clearer than that when the government engaged in consultation with the small business community. If you happened to have, as I said before, one trust which owned the property and another that conducted the business, you would be unable to set off losses against income. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. We have heard.all this before. The question today was: will there be a revenue loss associated with this particular exemption-not anything else; this particul-r exemption-for injections by non-benefIciaries? Will or will there not be a revenue loss? Did you mislead this House?",44
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,44
103,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You will hear it again and again if you ask the same question again and again. I will explain it to you patiently, because I do not think you understand the legislation. The legislation provided that if t-e beneficiaries of the two trusts were the famIly, whether the loss was made by the beneficiary or whether it was made through the trust you could set off the loss and the income. Enabling companies to do that had one effect. The corresponding effect was to cut down the number of family members that could be under the definition of 'family'. So we cut out former spouses, great-grandchildren and greatgrandparents, and limited the effect overall. Mr MCMullan-And you introduced nonbeneficiary rules.",44
104,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We did not introduce non-beneficiaries; wrong, absolutely wrong. You have to have the same beneficiaries. is What it allowed was that, where you had a loss in a trust, you could set it off against an income. That is perfectly clear; that is the effect of the legislation; that is the effect of the evidence from the Australian Taxation Office. One measure allowed increased flexibility for trusts, the other measure cut down the number and the definition of family. The overall revenue effect as the revenue estimates made clear was that, as a consequence of this, revenues increased. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, the question was: was there a rev-nu- loss asso-i­ ated not with the overall legIslatIOn but WIth this particular exemption? That is the question; that is what he said last time-no revenue loss. He has been contradicted in the last week; he should answer it.",44
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Trade Liberalisation,44
106,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. What are the main features of Australia's 1997 individual action plan that I understand the. - inis.ter will. be submitting at the APEC mInIstenal meetmg later this week in Vancouver? What can Australia expect from that meeting?,44
107,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Murray for her question. The meetings in Vancouver afford an opportunity to take APEC members, the Asia-Pacific grouping of nations, further towards the Bogor trade and investment goals. It is timely, given all that has been happening in Asia in October 1997 in particular, because a good outcome on liberalisation is in many ways the best response to the currency crisis that has hit APEC members. The government will be pushing for sensible trade liberalisation-winwin, job creation trade liberalisation. We will be doing so on a range of fronts involving the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me. The first is through the individual action plans. To assist members, I table the 1997 version of the individual action plan which reports on the further progress that the Australian government has made in that direction. Secondly, APEC ministers are aiming to identify sectors where liberalisation may be possible ahead of the Bogor goals of 20102020. Our priorities are food, energy, chemicals and non-ferrous metals. Perhaps, on behalf of the member for Cunningham, I should add in one new sector for consideration at APEC, namely, hair dye, but I will be tempted not to do that. Mr Martin interjecting",44
108,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No-one will ever accuse me of being able to dye my hair because I have none. I accept the honourable member's explanation. I think you should be aware of it, to be fair. He said, 'Never let your kids get to your bathroom.' That is a fair comment. We came into parliament on the same day; I do wish him well. Mr Martin interjecting",45
109,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He tells us it looked a whole lot worse before he got it half-fixed. These are key priorities. In fact, the Prime Minister, at an energy ministers APEC meeting last year, highlighted what we could gain from an energy sector priority. Along with food, chemicals and non-ferrous metals, there is much to be gained in a win-win, job enhancement circumstance here in Australia from moving down this pathway. Thirdly, we will be using Vancouver to push forward with the negotiations of the World Trade Organisation on a breakthrough on financial services. This is long overdue. I want to commend to the House the government's determination to get real leverage and incremental progress out of the forthcoming range of APEC meetings, which will also address a number of other issues, some including infrastructure and progress with electronic commerce. We have a modest agenda in many ways but one which has to be incremental and one which we must continue to push forward on because at the end of the day that will help guarantee further jobs here in Australia. Greenhouse Gases",45
110,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that his yet to be announced greenhouse package will do anything more than partly refill a funding hole he dug by cutting more than $100 million from Labor's greenhouse programs, including $37 million from abolishing the Energy Research and Development Corporation, $14 million from the national energy efficiency program and $20 million by scrapping the one billion trees program? Don't these cuts and the loss of about $300 million for the environment under the LEAP program dwarf any greenhouse gas initiatives you are contemplating? Will you give a guarantee that as a bare minimum all of Labor's direct greenhouse gas emission reduction programs will be restored?",45
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After that question, I think I will have to have a word to the Leader of the House, the chairman of the tactics committee. I did not know that a dorothy dixer was coming from him. I say to the member for Denison that on Thursday I will be making a detailed statement to the House which will deal with the detail of the government's stance on greenhouse gas emissions. It will remind the Australian public that throughout the whole of this issue it is the Liberal and National parties who have sought to defend jobs in regional Australia. It is the Liberal and National parties who have stuck up for the jobs of Australian miners. It is the Labor Party that has danced around the edges and pretended that all we had to do was roll over and say, 'Yes, sir, whatever emission target you require. Yes, sir, we'll do it to the member countries of the European Union.' I hope that the member for Denison may have spent half an hour yesterday watching that excellent coverage of the greenhouse gas issue on Channel 9's Sunday program, following a very good interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Being a careful inspectorial leader, I look at all of these interviews. I thought it was a very good interview. I thought the feature item on greenhouse gases was a reminder of just how complex this issue is. It is a reminder, above everything else, it would be a very foolish nation and a very foolish Australian government and a very foolish Australian leader who rolled over to the blandishments of the European Union or, indeed, the blandishments of any other country or group of countries. I can assure the Australian public that the measures that I will announce on Thursday and the statement. I will be making on Thursday will put into proper context again the stance that my government has taken, the success that we have achieved over the past few months, the way in which the position of the Americans has become more accommodating to Australia, the way in which the essentially self-serving position of some of the European countries has been exposed, the extent to which the Japanese have become more understanding of our position and the way in which the Australian government, originally derided by those who sit opposite as being a lonely, isolated government on this issue, over the past few months has very successfully been able to bring influence to bear around the community. I am very proud of the fact that on this issue my government stuck up for Australian jobs. My government stuck up for Australian industry. My government stuck up for an international regime that would involve a fair sharing of burdens. At the same time. I always said that my government would announce measures that would guarantee that Australia demonstrated to the world that whilst we were going to stick up for our interests, we were not going to be browbeaten by anybody but by the same token we believe that Australia should play her part and should make a fair contribution. On Thursday I will be announcing all of that. I can assure the honourable member for Denison that what I announce on Thursday and what I say on Thursday will demonstrate the undoubted credentials of my government on this issue. Domestic Violence",45
112,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for the Status of Women. The incidence of domestic violence in our community is frequently raised as an issue of that great concern to Australian women. How is the Commonwealth government responding to these concerns?,46
113,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forde for her question. It is a matter that concerns all Australians. We know from the Australian Bureau of Statistics women's safety survey that 23 per cent of womenalmost one in every four-who have ever been married or in a de facto relationship have experienced physical or sexual violence at some time during that relationship. We are concerned about the safety of these women. We are particularly concerned about the effects on children of witnessing these violent episodes. This has a profound effect on children and also promotes or creates a cycle of violence. Despite governments in Australia spending around $226 million a year on dealing directly with domestic violence, we still have a very major problem in this country. The united stand of all heads of government at the national summit on 7 November in condemning domestic violence sent a very powerful message to the community thaf domestic violence has to stop. Their commitment to work together in partnerships against domestic violence, a new initiative for testing new approaches to prevention of violence and the breaking of the cycle, will be underpinned by the Commonwealth spending a further $25 million on trying to break this cycle and prevent domestic violence. This is a down payment. We need to explore new ways of dealing with this problem and look at measures that work so that we can be better informed as to where our priorities lie in the future. A very significant outcome of the summit was the unanimous agreement by all heads of government to release for public discussion a model domestic violence law. This will ensure that there is continuity of law for victims across this country. To strengthen the initiative, the Prime Minister launched Business Against Domestic Violence on 12 November. This was co-chaired by Robert Champion de Crespigny of Normandy Mining and Paula Gerber of the law firm Maddock Lonie and Chisholm. Business Against Domestic Violence has been given a tax exemption status. It is a great opportunity for corporate Australia to invest in the prevention of domestic violence. Business can reach audiences that governments cannot. It can influence attitudes of employees and it can develop support programs for staff who are affected by domestic violence. Community groups have welcomed this initiative and the move to include all sections of the community in addressing the problem of domestic violence in our country. The leadership of the Prime Minister in making domestic violence a national issue is a first for Australia. It is vital that all Australians play their part to reduce domestic violence within our communities. Travelling Allowance: Papers",46
114,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that when he asked the Department of Administrative Services and the Attorney General's Department for access to papers relating to Senator Colston in 1983 the secretaries of both departments declined the request and that this approach was supported by the deputy secretary of his own department? Were the documents only released by these departments after they were informed that I had given my permission for this to be done? Why weren't copies of all the documents released to the Prime Minister also given to me, as required under the agreement made for the Prime Minister to gain access to them? Can the Prime Minister guarantee that neither he nor any members of his personal staff selectively released any of these documents or parts of them to persons not authorised to have access to them, including the media?",47
115,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, that at all times I gave instructions and I acted to ensure that access to the documents, so far as your own access was concerned, should be given in accordance with the rules. You seem to be under the mistaken impression that when you, as a Leader of the Opposition, give permission for certain documents to be accessed you can impose some general conditions. They have to be handled in accordance with the proper practices of convention. This issue relates to what could only be called the great 1983 cover-up. I know the documents you are talking about.",47
116,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister has been asked a series of specific questions here. They go to his cheap behaviour in denying the opposition some of that material which was released to him only as a result of the opposition's permission and then his leaking of it to other people. He ought to be asked to answer them specifically.",47
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Prime Minister is addressing the thrust of the question.,47
118,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If there has been any cheap behaviour, it was your cheap behaviour, and that· of Gareth Evans, in setting up an escape route for Mal Colston. You know that as well as I do. It is most beautifully demonstrated in the Evans minute of 7 September to you. This is what he had to say: I hope I have made it clear, both in this minute and in discussions with you, that I would certainly regard a police investigation as appropriate in the event that Senator Colston",47
119,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this Prime Minister is being caught out with those weaseling accusations he made to us under privilege. He now ought to be obliged to answer the questions he was specifically asked.",47
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat!,47
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This Leader of the Opposition and this Deputy Leader of the Opposition have both been caught out because what they decided to do was to get their heads together,47
122,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a further point of order, Mr Speaker, this Prime Minister has been allowed unprecedented",48
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am allowing the Leader of the Opposition reasonable courtesies in endeavour.,48
124,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, I will keep intervening on a point of order that goes to relevance. We have been permitted, on this side of the House, to be massively slandered in this place under oath. Now I am asking specific questions about the circumstances in which these documents were released. I think I am entitled to a clear set of answers on them.",48
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Thus far there is no point of order.,48
126,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The House ought to understand that what is involved here is the way in which the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition got together. What the two of you decided was that, provided Colston repaid the money and did not insist that he had a right to the money in the first place, you would not send him off to the coppers. I know a lot of people who would love that indulgent treatment. I know lots of Australians who would love that.",48
127,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance again. Let me go through them.",48
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, we are not going to go through them at all. The questions have been asked. The Prime Minister does not need any reminder of the nature of the questions.",48
129,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister is not within the standing orders on this-manifestly not. None of the questions went to the content of the documents-none of which he is dealing with here, I might say, the two particular documents concerned. They go to his behaviour in relation to the release.",48
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is, thus far, no point of order.",48
131,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The essence of this issue-and it is a very simple one-is whether certain documents, that the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues in any event have had possession of now for some weeks, cleared you and Evans. Those documents have not cleared you and Evans. That is what you are so angry about. Nothing can absolve you from the responsibility that after having got your heads together you decided that, this provided he pays the money back, provided he does not insist he was entitled to it, you would not send him to the coppers. I know a couple of my colleagues and a couple of my former colleagues who would have loved that kind of treatment. But we had better standards than you.",48
132,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,48
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Prime Minister concluded his answer?,48
134,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes.,48
135,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, yes; weaseling out. All the documents, sport. The evidence of your position on this is the fact you did not give them to us.",48

137,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what would the attitude of the government be to any Senate amendments to the Native Title Amendment Bill? How do admissions by the Leader of the Opposition and former minister Graham Richardson that Labor believed that pastoral leases extinguished native title contrast with Labor's current opposition to the bill? Prime Minister, what is your response to claims that the government is not interested in reconciliation?",48

141,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: is it possible for you to explain to the House under what circumstances there is a hypothetical question, as all these questions are hypothetical.",48
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Calwell.,48
143,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable I negoti-ted member for the question. Can I take the community opportunity of informing the House that, as I have said on a number of occasions, the government would be prepared to consider He went on to say: amendments to the Native Title Amendment Bill when it goes forth to the Senate those amendments promote the goals of the Let bill and in particular if those amendments are consistent with the lO-point plan bill was based. A number of amendments have already been canvassed in that context of a technical character, and I think it is to say that the amendments that we have in mind are amendments that do not alter the thrust of the bill. We believe this is a bill is essential to the future resource and tighter security of Australia. Because this is the first occasion since the order. parliament has met since some of the more extravagant and careless remarks in this debate have been made, I take the opportunity of repudiating on behalf of me and all of my colleagues the quite unfounded and dishonest racial motives that have been attributed to the government in this matter. I think some of remarks that have been made in this debate have done far more damage to those who pastoral leases. have made the remarks than those against whom the remarks have been directed. I think the real context of this debate was illustrated last week with what I might now say-and I never thought I would ever say it of himwas the timely intervention of my predecessor, the former Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating. That intervention really brought forth some very interesting comment and, juxtaposed with the remarks of Graham Richardson, threw some very interesting light on this whole debate. The reality is that, as everybody knows, the whole basis of the 1993 Native Title Act was the unconditional representation Prime Minister to the Australian community, particularly to the farmers of Australia, that the grant of a pastoral lease had extinguished native title. It was not in or maybe but an unconditional representation to the Australian community-no ifs or buts, no qualifications. Paul Keating on AM on 19 view. October 1993 had this to say: an agreem-nt between the Aboriginal and the NatIonal Farmers Federation on the question of pastoral leases and I think with a very good outcome. What it will mean is that native title will be provided extinguished on pastoral leases. me repeat that: 'native title will be extinguished on pastoral leases' . He nailed it down on which the without any doubt. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I raise a fair point of order as to relevance. The Prime Minister is addressing validated leases, not the normal run-of-the-mill valid leases, which are that the subject of this. He knows it and he is telling blatant untruths in his description of the 1993 situation.",49
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of,49
145,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is again wrong, wrong, wrong because the unconditional representations that were made and were echoed in the preamble to the act related to the generality of pastoral the leases as well as to the particular leasesMr Gareth Evans-It doesn't even refer to",49
146,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know about the particular leases that you are referring to, but that in no way altered the fact that the unconditional representation that your former leader made was about the generality of pastoral leases. As Graham Richardson quite rightly said, and I repeatMr Gareth Evans interjecting",49
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Withdraw that remark. Mr Gareth Evans-I withdraw.,49

Mr Gareth Evans-You know exactly what he means.",49
149,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you saying RichardOpposition) son is wrong? Mr Gareth Evans-Absolutely.,50
150,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, they are saying Richardson is wrong. You think Richardson is wrong, therefore you think your own is wrong, because this is what he had to say: We thought all along with the pastoralists that in all probability native title was extinguished pastoral lease. We thought that and we thought it in good faith. That is what Kim Beazley said. Why have said you remained silent for the last 3Y2 years? You allowed a debate to proceed on the basis of a misunderstanding that you could easily have ruled out. But the truth of the matter is that back in 1993 there was a general belief fuelled by an unconditional representation the former Prime Minister that the grant of pastoral lease extinguished native title. they regarded as the law then we are not major intending to give effect to by our legislation now before the Senate. What our legislation does is to confirm the principles laid down the Wik decision. Our legislation some people over the weekend have suggested, in any way disturb the Mabo decision. Our legislation confirms the fundamental principles of the Wik decision. Our legislation is non-racial in character. Our legislation achieves a fair balance between the rights of pastoralists and the rights of the indigenous community. I call on those in another place when the legislation comes forward, if they are interestorder. ed in future security of the management of landmass of Australia, if they are interested a fair balance, if they are interested in ennot couraging investment, if they are interested generating jobs in the resource sector, instead of lending their ear to false accusations racism against me and against my colleagues to vote it into law so that we can bring some stability, some predicability, some balance and a fair deal between all sections of Australian community. I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",50

155,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The first was in the on a rambling answer by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the so-called origins of my views on reciprocal obligation. The Prime Minister that my position on reciprocal obligation had been reached either via advice from Tony Blair or by imitating propositions that he had been putting forward. That is quite a false accusation. To demonstrate the fact that it is, I draw the House's attention to page 3 of the by employment, education and training portfolio a white paper initiatives, so-called Working What Nation-heading 'Reciprocal obligation': 'A feature of the job compact is the principle of reciprocal obligation.'",50

157,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The second place I was misrepresented was in the Prime Minister's last answer, where he slipped over a suggestion from ex-Senator Richardson to propositions that I put forward and indicated that the statements that I had made believed that the legislation actively ruled out. The propositions that I put forward were the correctMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of If he wants to say he has been the misrepresented, he has to say exactly where in he has been misrepresented and why. He is doing that. On both occasions this is just in the usual debating tactic of the Leader of the Opposition, whether it is a point of order or of a personal explanation.",50
158,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,There is no point of order. I am listening very carefully to the the Leader of the Opposition's comments.,50
159,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"What the Prime Minister went to, though he misrepresented it as indicating that there had been an active piece of legislation to rule extinguishment of native title on all pastoral leases, was simply the iteration of the preamble. The belief at the time was that there had been extinguishment, but it was a question to be tested in the courts. Had we gone down the road of actively doing so, as suggested by the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), we would have been in the position of the Prime Minister now, and that is putting in place a bill which requires massive compensation.",50
160,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Given the extraordinary liberty that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has been extended in relation to that personal explanation, and given the importance of the issue not only in this chamber but to the Australian community, I seek your indulgence to make a comment on the Leader of the Opposition's comment.",51
161,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am going to allow the Prime Minister indulgence. This is a very important issue. I have provided the Leader of the Opposition, as he well knows, considerable latitude on this issue. This is an issue on which we need to unify the country, not divide it. I am not going to allow wideranging debate on the issue, but I will allow the Prime Minister some indulgence on this very sensitive issue.",51
162,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"With regard to the questions of the representations that were made by the former government about the status of pastoral leases in relation to native title, the basis of the claim I have repeatedly made is that not only was that asserted without qualification in the preamble, but it was certainly asserted without qualification in correspondence that passed between, as I understand it, the former Prime Minister and some of the stakeholders and it was also the basis of remarks made by Aboriginal leaders, such as Noel Pearson on 10 November 1993 when he said: . . . I rule out the possibility in Queensland of people pursuing any rights in relation to pastoral leases owned by non-Aboriginal people. I rule that out categorically because there is a facility now available for us to purchase under the land fund and to convert into native title pastoral leases. In other words, not only did you have the preamble of the Native Title Act, not only did you have the unconditional interviews of the former Prime Minister, not only did you have other unconditional statements made by the former Prime Minister, but you also have statements made by Aboriginal leaders such as Noel Pearson. Until the Wik decision came along, there was a very strong belief in that department. To suggest that I have in any way misrepresented what the Leader of the Opposition said is wrong. But, worse still, I hope when the Leader of the Opposition gets to his feet, he, will dissociate himself from any claims of racism that have been made against me and my colleagues by members of his own party.",51
163,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, as I have been invited to exercise it",51
164,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I shall be listening very carefully.,51
165,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me make it absolutely clear that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) attempted to slip-slide from one point to another. He started off by a discussion of the notion of active extinguishment, which applied in fact only to the post-1975 leases, where there was a clear-cut problem established. In the preamble there is an iteration-not related, I might say, to pastoral leases but to leaseholding generallybased on the government's assumption at the time of the meaning of the Mabo judgment, that in leasehold areas, unless otherwise specifically provided for, native title had been extinguished. It was not an active measure. Indeed, if he wants recourse to the comments and quotes of the time, I suggest he reads the speech of the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and I suggest he reads the motions moved in the Senate by National Party senators who sought to convert that iteration into an explicit extinguishment. That was what they sought to do. That was refused by the government at the time. That was resisted, because the government at the time-while making that assumption in good faith and based on the legal advice that it had, that it knew the miners had and that it knew the pastoralists had-knew that that was the case. But it also knew it was being tested in the courts. For the government to have gone down that road at that time would have placed this country in precisely the position it is now. Had we gone down that road, we would have placed ourselves in the position where billions of dollars of taxpayers funds were at risk, and an issue that could be settled by sensible negotiation would have been taken off the table in that regard. So, Prime Minister, the way in which you tried to slip around this issue, suggesting that there was some form of active extinguishment then going on instead of the iteration of an understood legal position, does you no credit. But it also casts in our minds a severe doubt as to the intentions of your legislation. The Prime Minister wants to know what we think of his legislation. ¥.'e think natory-and we think it discriminatory on racial grounds. The Prime Minister wants to know what we think its chances of success are in the High Court. We think nil. That is what we think. We are for certainty for our people, and those are the amendments that we will be moving to deliver it.",51

172,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain pensioners, superannuants and retirees points out to the House that Government funding for the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation's national secretariat will cease on 30 September 1997. The Federation provides advice to the Government on older people's needs and concerns, publishes independent information for older people and works to ensure that older people have a say in decisions that affect their lives. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to direct the Government to provide funding to ensure that the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation can continue its valuable work for and it discrimiwith older Australians. by Mr Anderson (from 17 citizens), Mr Martin Ferguson (from 76 citizens) and Mr Warwick Smith (from 62 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their extreme concern at the proposal to charge entry fees for people needing nursing home care. Furthermore, the petitioners are extremely concerned that the charging of up front entry fees will force people to sell their homes in order to gain a nursing home bed. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives act to ensure that access to nursing home care is available on the basis of need and further that the family home is exempt from any asset test used to determine eligibility for such care. by Mr Latham (from 30 citizens) and Ms Macklin (from 1,310 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. This petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland expresses concern at the Federal Government's recent decision to cut funding to the ABC by $65 million over two years. This decision will severely compromise the role of the ABC as an independent, non-commercial source of news, sport, information and entertainment. The ABC is a widely respected Australian institution, recognised as a service committed to quality and excellence in broadcasting. The funding cuts which have been announced are the largest ever to the ABC since it was fonned in 1932. The decision contrasts completely with a commitment given by Prime Minister, John Howard, and Communications and the Arts Minister, Senator Richard Alston, prior to the election in March 1996. It was then promised that ""The Coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC."" We request the House to calion the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia to stand by their pre-election commitment, and rescind its recent decision to slash funding to the ABC. by Mr Bevis (from 83 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. The petition of certain residents in the state of Queensland calls to the attention of the House the Howard Government's proposed changes to nursing homes and aged care, which includes charging an entry fee or bond for entry into nursing homes. The Government's proposals are unfair and will discriminate against the most vulnerable, frail and sick members of our community. We request the House to call on the Howard Government to abandon their plans and to immediately restore full funding for capital assistance to nursing homes. by Mr Bevis (from 42 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia: This petition of certain members of the Australian community draws to the attention of the House our commitment to a culturally diverse Australian society which is unified by a common desire to see all Australians-regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, sex, age or ability-treated with respect and dignity. We recognise the contribution that all Australians have made to the cultural, social and economic development of our nation. In recognition of the need to debate these issues honestly and publicly, we request the House to call upon the Federal Government to mount a high profile anti-racism campaign (for which funds were provided in the 1996-97 budget) and fulfil its obligations to build and maintain a harmonious and united Australia. by Mr Bevis (from 13 citizens). Medicare Office: Sefton Park To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Adelaide draws to the attention of the House: that the Medicare Office situated in Sefton Park, Adelaide, South Australia which services 130-150 people per day, and provides cash reimbursements on medicare and child care rebates, will cease altogether from next year. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: allow the Sefton Park Medicare Office to function as it does now, allowing the people resident in this area access to cash rebates across the counter, and all the other services presently provided by this office to the local community. by Mr Martyn Evans (from 728 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament This humble petition of the under-signed citizens of the State of Victoria hereby object to the introduction of income tested extra daily fees for people in aged care and further object to having to pay an accommodation bond. We therefore ask that the parliament repeal these Draconian measures immediately. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House take note 'of this request. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Martin Ferguson (from 32 citizens). Racism Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The humble petition of the under-signed citizens of the State of Victoria hereby object to the introduction of means testing and deeming for aged care people and further object to having to pay an accommodation bond. We therefore ask that the Parliament repeal these Draconian measures immediately. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House takes note of this request. As your petitioners duty bound forever pray. by Mr Sercombe (from 55 citizens). Small Businesses To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of South-West Sydney draws to the attention of the extremely difficult trading environment confronted by small business in Australia. Many thousands of small businesses are suffering from harsh, unfair and oppressive conduct at the hands of landlords, franchisors, oil companies and large retail chains. As a result many hard working small businesses are being driven to the wall, inevitably leading to more un ;employment. We also draw the House's attention to the recommendations of the Fair Trading Inquiry which provides a solution to the aforementioned problems. We the undersigned therefore ask the House to implement these recommendations, particularly those which give legislative protection to small businesses. by Mr Latham (from 18 citizens). Forest Protection To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. For permanent protection of old-growth forests and all other areas of high conservation value, and for the implementation of tree plantation strategies. This petition from the undersigned respectfully points out that: there is an increasing and urgent demand from the people, to protect all remaining high conservation value forests which support flora and fauna unique to Australia, thus complying with the United Nations Biodiversity Convention to which Australia is a signatory. We have a responsibility to future and present generations, and· the necessary reasons, knowledge and technology to act now on the following achievable solutions. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives legislate to: Immediately stop all logging and woodchipping activities in high conservation value native forests; ensure intergenerational equity by planning for the rights of future generations, and protecting in perpetuity all biologically diverse old-growth forests, wilderness, rainforests and critical habitats of endangered species; facilitate rapid transition of the timber industry from harvesting high conservation value native forests to establishing mixed-species farm forestry on existing cleared and degraded lands, using non-toxic methods to protect ecological sustainability; maximise use of readily-available plantation timber for industry needs, using appropriate forestry techniques and progressive minimalwaste processing methods, such as radial sawing, and wherever possible, reuse and recycle wood and paper products; support incentives for nationwide employment in composting, soil remineralisation programs, and the planting of trees and annual fibre crops, inter-grown with appropriate fruit and nut trees and medicinal plants; encourage sensitively-managed, environmental education tourism in appropriate forest areas, with full respect for natural ecosystems, Aboriginal cultural heritage, sacred sites and other sites of significance; and progressively utilise technological expertise and resources transferred from the military sector, to help implement these tree planting solutions; and to motivate the international community to follow this example. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr Lawrence (from 550 citizens). Cooked Chicken Meat Imports To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned draws to the attention of the House the importance of preserving high quarantine standards to maintain Australia's clean food reputation and to protect native wildlife. Your petitioners therefore requestThat the House call on the Federal Government to maintain the ban on cooked chicken meat imports because of the threat it poses to Australia's chicken meat industry, and the risk of introducing diseases which would threaten native bird life.  Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We the undersigned pensioners and citizens of Australia hereby call upon the Australian Government to cancel the current charges for entry into a nursing home by frail aged peoples of Australia. We point out that over many years the Private Nursing Home Industry has distributed large profits to shareholders, neglecting the need to upgrade buildings and facilities. We further call upon the Government to publish the profits of the Private Nursing Home Industry, before tax, over the past five years. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to direct the Government to provide a system that ensures the frail aged Australians be free from the stress and strains of the huge environmental changes of lifestyle in entering a nursing home and the uncertainty of a better quality of life in their twilight years. by Mr Reid (from 18 citizens). SBS Television Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in the Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of Lyne draws to the attention of the House the strong case for funding to expand SBS Television services to the Lower Mid-North Coast through a transmitted on the National Transmission Agency site at Middle Brother Mountain, north of Taree. We the undersigned ask the House to draw this matter to the attention of the Minister for Communications so that he may pursue the matter as a high priority as part of the Federal Government's expansion program of SBS Television services across Australia. by Mr Vaile (from 165 citizens). Medicare Office: Wynnum Central To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division Bowman draws to the attention of the House the need for a Medicare Branch in Wynnum Central. Petitioners are therefore asking the House to support the moves, the office be maintained in its present capacity. by Mrs West (from 170 citizens). Petitions received. NA Rural Women's Census Data",52
173,Mrs BAILEY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) recognises the important contribution by rural women to the national economy and local community infrastructure; (2) acknowledges that census data does not accurately record the economic bution by rural women; (3) believes that this lack of accurate census data should be addressed by changes to the census form that will enable rural women to record the true extent of their economic and voluntary contribution; and (4) calls on the government to refer these proposed changes to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Mr Deputy Speaker, when you hear the term 'rural women', I would not be surprised if you, like so many, believe that the definition of rural women is 'women who live and work on farms'. But that definition is far too narrow and ignores the fact that more than 2Y2 million women live outside metropolitan areas. While increasing numbers of these women are the principals of farming enterprises and small businesses, they are also teachers, nurses, librarians, policewomen, and workers in factories, newsagents, supermarkets, et cetera. Their work is the linchpin that provides cohesion in all our rural communities. Their work contributes to the national economy, both directly through their paid employment and indirectly through their unpaid employment. The diversity of rural women's work is increasing each year as more women become involved in a range of activities from the innovative conceptual stage through to production and post-production marketing-and of not just responding to domestic and international demands for products and services, but initiating and developing niche markets in, for example, cheese products, wool and alpaca garments, flowers, herbs, fruit and timber products, and value adding to meat and poultry, to name but a few. Farm tourism is now a thriving rural industry, thanks to the organisation, .development and marketing skills of rural women. While the majority of rural women, like their metropolitan counterparts, are employed in the services sector, the number of women in the rural work force has doubled in the past 15 years. Women now comprise 32 per cent of all agricultural workers. Also, we now have 71,400 women who are farmers or farm managers, according to the Australian Farm or voluntary contri- Journal. We are able to know these facts because it is relatively easy to identify women in the paid work force data. It is, however, almost impossible to measure the total contribution rural women make to both the national and local economies, because we have no accurate means of measuring their real contribution. This is because our census data collection is grossly inadequate and, even today, follows the trend set back in 1893, when it was officially decided to exclude women's involvement in both agriculture and mining from the census. The census fails to accurately record the extent of rural women's work on two counts: it fails to identify rural women as a group fails to ask questions relevant to the working lifestyles of rural women. Currently, the census asks whether unpaid work is carried out in a family business. The 1991 census data revealed that 16,000 females described themselves as unpaid helpers in rural areas, but we have no clear understanding of the type or amount of work that unpaid rural helpers performed. But the problem is far greater than not understanding the true contribution of those identified 16,000 unpaid helpers. Many women do not regard being solely responsible for the general administration of the family business, whether that be a farm or a sports store, as work. We know that the vast majority of rural small businesses have women in these roles. This is not just from anecdotal evidence. A national forum on women in agriculture and resource management this year found that women generally take full responsibility for the farm book work, plus banking sources tell us that 80 per cent of cheques from farm businesses are signed by women. Added to this reluctance by women to regard this sort of activity as work, there is the problem of women who work offfarmoften, for example, for eight hours a day and then come home and update the computer records, et cetera. These women provide 68 per cent of all farm cash income. Sue Kilpatrick, a researcher from the University of Tasmania, has demonstrated that the increasing education levels of women and keeping up with the latest information through training make a significant difference to the profit of family businesses. Much of the work that ensures that rural small businesses survive is performed by women who regard that work not as traditional employment but as an extension of their role as wife and mother. This means that so much of the valuable work, not just in administration but in developing new ideas and products by rural women, remains invisible because there is simply no appropriate means of recording it. The reason why this appalling lack of information and, therefore, recognition has remained for so long is that our definition of work has traditionally been linked to the and payment of a wage. It is time that we re., assessed that definition because, by maintaining that strict definition, we are doing rural women a grave injustice and we are not providing an accurate assessment of the type and amount of work that contributes significantly to our national economy. Surely it is time that we designed questions in the census addressed specifically to those two and a half million rural women that would allow and encourage them to accurately record their real working contribution. Not only is this economic data seriously lacking but so too is the data on the amount of voluntary work performed by rural women. This work is absolutely vital in maintaining the infrastructure of rural communities. Community involvement has long been the hallmark of rural communities in local schools, hospitals, libraries, the Red Cross, and sporting and service clubs. We should remember that it is because of work done by the CWA and other rural women's groups that women are now admitted to all areas of education· and employment. The network of these groups and, increasingly, agri-business and agri-political groups weave the fabric of rural community life. Sadly, there are still many women in rural areas who do not count their voluntary work as work. I once asked a woman what type of work she was involved in, only to be told that she didn't work. However, it later emerged that a typical day for her was starting early to do the local voluntary bus run to school and then she worked at the local school as a voluntary helper with reading, music and tuckshop. Each afternoon she helped at the hospital, library, or nursing home, was a Girl Guides leader, assisted in the canteen for her son's footy team, gave lifesaving instruction at the local pool, did the flowers at the local church and was a member of several local community groups. And she did not believe that she worked! While some of rural women's outstanding work is recognised at the local level, limited recognition at the national level does not reflect the depth and breadth of the impact of their voluntary work. We need to get a much clearer picture. I stress that I am not advocatof, ing the collection of this data merely for the sake of it. It is my hope that this will encourgreat age more rural women to recognise their own contribution and will enable both government and industry to be aware of their significant contribution, both directly and indirectly, to the national economy. I call on the government to refer these proposed changes to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in order to bring about these much needed changes to recognise the invaluable work of rural women throughout our nation.

174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Nehl)Before I call for a seconder I would say to the honourable member for MCEwen, referring to the earlier parts of her speech, that she would be wise not to make assumptions about members' attitudes and that in her gratuitous judgment of my personal view of rural women she was totally wrong. Is the motion seconded? Mrs De-Anne Kelly-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",57
175,Mr OKEEFE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I have taken the opportunity to join this discussion on the motion moved by the member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) to commend the member for the points she has made arising out of the census. I also draw attention to some inconsistencies that those on the other side of the House may find themselves faced with-after having heard so many wonderful sentiments about the role of women-in regard to the effect on the lives of rural women of a number of the policy decisions that they are voting for in their party room. I come at this question not without some experience. I had great pleasure earlier this year in not only conducting the Victorian launch of the wonderful publication The many hats of country women, which is a history of the CW A written by Brenda StevensChambers, but also co-launching the book on that day with Jean Tom, the former president of the CWA---{)ne of the mothers of the CWA movement. At that gathering we had reason to talk about the number of times, in my experience in the last 13 years, rural women have been very strong in coming forward and raising issues that many of us were unaware putting the case on the table and making government listen and respond. It is to the credit of organisations like the CW A and the many other active rural women's groups-not only farm women, as Mrs Bailey has mentioned, but also the many other women in these groups-that they have made us look and listen. As we in this parliament develop our policies, I call on the member for MCEwen to be sure that she does not participate in what I call the 'hoax'. It is not sufficient to stand up here and mouth platitudes about what a wonderful contribution different people make if in fact you are participating in policy decisions that make things even tougher for those very people you are talking about. I would like to give a couple of examples of what I am talking about here. We have all seen publicity in recent months about the number of farm families who miss out on various components of the social security aid budget, be they payments under the former farm household support scheme, Austudy or whatever, because they have been unaware of their entitlement or, more importantly, because so much rhetoric has come from people who criticise various government programs that they have felt that it is too hard to apply, all too complex or that it is not moral or right to take handouts or benefits. I say this particularly to those members who now find themselves in government and who many times criticised former programs that were there particularly to assist issues that rural women had brought to our attention. I draw your attention to the sense of obligation there; it is not appropriate to go around bagging these programs as 'welfare', 'Labor budget breakers' or those sorts of things that you do in your political rhetoric when you are creating a mind-set that may mean that people do not even apply for benefits that they should be applying for. We have seen many situations of quite desperate rural families that needed assistance, whether in family or child support or a whole range of programs that the federal government now has responsibility for-programs which women have fought the case for and drawn to· our attention. We are going to go down the road of the GST-a policy path that the member for MCEwen herself is very familiar with and has been in the forefront of advocating in the past. I make it very clear that there is no group in Australia who have more to lose from the imposition of a GST than rural women. When you look at the offsets that the government seems to be talking about",57
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Nehl)Order! I am reluctant to interrupt the member for Burke in his flowing contribution, but I refer him to the content of the motion-a very specific four points, none of which really relate to the GST. I encourage you to stick to the motion.",58
177,Mr OKEEFE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"To the contrary, I may not have developed the point very well, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will endeavour to do so in order that you understand why I regard what I am saying as intensely relevant.",58
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,I thank the honourable member for Burke in his endeavours to assist my understanding. Please continue.,58
179,Mr OKEEFE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"We have here a motion about the conducting, by the Bureau of Statistics, of the census of rural women. I am saying to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we draw quite a lot of information from that census material. Among the range of material that it provides usMrs Bailey- Mr Deputy Speaker, lam very reluctant to take a point of order in this debate. I draw the shadow minister's attention to the fact that getting the information from the census goes to the very heart of this motion, which is wanting to gain that census information.",58
180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Thank you very much.,58
181,Mr OKEEFE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"In essence, the member for MCEwen is trying to use up my time with these points of order to prevent me making the point that the very people whom you claim to be advocating on behalf of, rural women-and you gave a lovely dissertation of how strongly you feel for rural womenare the people who will be most impacted by the GST. For the next 12 months the major policy proposal that you will bring forward from your side of the House to the Australian . people is the GST. Mrs Bailey-I have a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, on relevance to this particular motion. I am more than happy to debate that opposition member and any other on tax reform, but that is not included in the motion.",58
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,I have already spoken to 'the member for Burke about relev-nce and he has given me an undertaking that he is going to extend his statement so that we will know exactly where he is going. I invite him to continue.,58
183,Mr OKEEFE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The point that the member makes is right and the point I make is right. The census material that is evolved over time will show that the group of people who stand to be worse off-and it is not only budget cuts to services in various country areas, which we could go on with for much more than the time that is left after this little stunt, that will make them worse off; I counsel the member for MCEwen about this-from the imposition of a GST in the Australian economy is rural women, and I am signalling that we are going to be discussing this. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: there is no mention in this motion of a goods and services tax.",58
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,I am well aware of that. There is no point of order.,58
185,Mr OKEEFE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,This is totally unprecedented. I cannot recall a situation in a private members debate where those on the other side sought to close down a discussion of this nature in the way they have just done. All that tells me is that you do not want to talk about the GST. (Time expired),58
186,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am very pleased to second the motion today from the member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) on rural women's census data and commend her comments on the worth of rural women to the Australian economy. I would also like to share with the House the high standard of contribution of rural women in my own electorate of Dawson, which I have no doubt is reflective of many other electorates with rural constituencies. Their stories are similar in that they represent a deep seated commitment to not only their families but also to the development and fostering of the land which supports them. I would firstly like to speak of Mrs Rita Neilsen, of Septimus, west of Mackay, who was a regional finalist in this year's ABC Rural Woman of the Year award. Rita has been heavily involved in the sugar industry for much of her life; indeed, she is a fifth generation farmer. The pride she expresses for ment. both the land and the industry as a whole is evidenced in her strength of commitment. Not only did Rita raise a family while struggling against the drought that affected the Pioneer Valley in the 1980s, she played an instrumental role in the formation of the Canegrowers Network, a local organisation of farmers and canegrowing women who came together to address the social consequences following the devastating drought around Mackay in the mid-1980s. Canegrowers Network, which Rita has been instrumental in setting up, is a workshop for women to learn more about accounting, bookkeeping and all the other necessary to be successful in farming. As well as that, they have a forum. Canegrowers Network is now one of the most incisive critics of policy for rural women and rural areas. They regularher ly have speakers of note and are not afraid put the questions that need to be put·to leaders of rural industry. Rita's attitude has been to make the most of things and not to expect too much from that which you have no control over. Such resilience of attitude has enabled her to identify those issues affecting the women who form the backbone of Australia's rural industry and to lead the in addressing them and fostering the determi- sought. nation of others. I would now like to talk about Sandra Eatough, the first woman to be elected to the board of the Queensland Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association. Sandra is a mother, wife, cook and employer and grows about 600 acres of tomatoes around Bowen, in central northern Queensland. In her spare time-and it is hard to imagine that somebody like Sandra would have any spare time-she sits on the boards and committees of at least four rural associations and councils. For nearly 30 years she and her family have struggled as they have come to terms with the fact that as primary producers they remain at the bottom of the ladder in terms of their ability to effectively control the outcome of their efforts. Sandra remains confident that, by raising an awareness of those issues which unduly affect the industry and her role in it, she is actively contributing to its developI would now like to speak of Jeanette Hunter, who has largely had an academic background but is now the Chief Executive Officer for the Bowen District Growers Association. She has found the ultimate satisfaction in employing her knowledge within the horticultural industry whereby she hopes to train and empower the next generation. She has witnessed a metamorphosis not only within horticulture but across the whole of rural industry as women eagerly embrace the relatively new concepts of quality management and assurance and take the lead in fostering greater understanding and better skills relationships with government. Lastly, I would like to speak about Jeanette Gray. She is a partner in Gray's sawmill in Proserpine. She raises two beautiful girls on own and again in her spare time finds to time to be an adviser on the educational policy committee to the Queensland government and is treasurer of the Forest Industries Training and Employment Committee. She is a lady who is outstanding in her community, always giving time to the community and to rural endeavours. She is a lady very wise about primary industry matters and her way membership of organisations is eagerly These women are not unique. They exist in large numbers and potentially represent one of the most powerful sectors of rural industry. For this they certainly need to be recognised, and I believe that their contribution to the Australian economy needs to be quantifiednot only their work every day of their lives for their farms and their businesses but their wider contribution through community and industry organisations. (Time expired)",58
187,Mr ADAMS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I also agree with the words of the motion of the member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), although I do not believe that mere recognition goes enough in our consideration of the needs of women in agriculture. There are many aspects which the census would certainly pick up, but there are many it would not and women have been fighting to be recognised as equal partners in rural industries for some time. This government has taken away the little assistance that was available, especially in child care and many other aspects of the rural adjustment package as it affects women and families in rural Australia. . We have some exceptionally talented women, and Tasmanian women are no exception. I would like to take the opportunity of mentioning the contribution made by Jane Bennett, of my electorate, to Tasmania's rural economy. She was the ABC 1997 Australian Rural Woman of the Year and recently, although the honourable member for MCEwen was unable to be with us, the Standing Committee on Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs was able to visit her cheese factory in Elizabeth Town in my electorate. At 28 years old, this young woman was certainly due that recognition as Australian Rural Woman of the Year. Ms Bennett started in the cheese business about four years ago, and Ashgrove now produces about 100 tonnes of cheese a year and is the only producer in Australia of the signature cheeses that are made there. They are an English style of cheese which is pretty unique to Tasmania and to the palate, and I recommend to everyone that they have a taste of them. Jane studied dairy technology at Victoria's Gilbert Chandler College for two years and then spent two years working at several farmhouse cheesemakers in the United Kingdom before establishing Ashgrove. She is involved in dairy industry packages for school children from grades 2 to 12 and also for TAFE students. She is currently President of the Tasmanian Rural Industry Training Board, Secretary of the Meander Valley Enterprise Centre and is an executive member of the Dairy Industry Association of Australia. This motion picks up on several issues, and when the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) mentioned the hoax in rural Australia. I think he was quite right. This motion does touch on far the census issue, and there are many points that need to be picked up within Australia and rural Australia, including the lack of opportunities for rural woman to go to training and educational courses. There are also the women who do not actually live on properties but live in country areas-some of them on the coast-who do not have access to child care. It is very hard to get child care now in rural and regional Australia because it is all privati sed and there is very little government assistance in that area. So the women in my electorate have great difficulties in undertaking opportunities of part-time work because of the lack of child care that exists there. I am sure that some of the statistics that may come forward if this motion is carried and dealt with by government will be of assistance to them. The women who pick up the vegetables need child care at certain times of the year, the women who work in the splitting sheds need opportunitiesMr DErUTY SPEAKER (Mr HolIis)Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. Mr Adams-The light is still on, Mr Deputy Speaker.",60
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The light may still be on but, as you would well know, there are times allocated and I have been informed that the time allocated expired at four minutes past four. As you would know as an occupant of this chair, when that happens the debate is concluded. In fact, the light has gone out now. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Australian Sportsmen and Sportswomen",60
189,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) expresses its warmest congratulations to the many Australian sportsmen and sportswomen who have achieved so much recently representing themselves and their country to the highest levels; (2) recognises our world champions-Cathy Freeman, Michael Doohan and the mens under 23 basketball team-and congratulates them on their achievement; (3) congratulates our Pan Pac swimming team, the Australian cricket team, Karrie Webb, the Australian world athletics team and the Australian cycling team on their achievements; and (4) asks the Australian media to become more responsible when reporting sporting achieveClint ment and commenting about our sporting champions. There has been a lot of negative press around the country in recent times and not enough positive press about some of our sporting heroes. The West Australian is a bit opposite to that, and today they have a photo of all our triathletes who competed on the weekend in Western Australia. I think we should be celebrating more often the sporting achievements of our sporting heroes not only at an elite level but also at a local level. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, being a fine sportsman yourself, Australia has a proud modem history of sporting achievement. We are passionate about our involvement, we are great spectators and we also like to have a bit of a gamble on different results, whether they be flies up the wall or whatever it is. Australia has an outdoors lifestyle and we really appreciate those who get involved in sporting contests. Recent achievements include those of the triathletes in Perth yesterday: Emma Carney and Chris MCDermont. Of course Cathy Freeman, Michael Doohan and Louise Savage, a paralympian, are world champions. Other recent achievements include those by the Pan Pac swimming team; Karrie Webb, the golfer, who is also performing very well; the Australian cycling team; the Australianunder-23 basketball team, who are now world champions; the Socceroos, who are going to France next year; the Australian cricket team, which won the Ashes this year when all predictions were against them; and of course Patrick Rafter and Kirstie Marshall are also world champions. In Patrick Rafter's case, he is ranked No.2. There are many fine achievers and I am sure there are many more who are achieving a lot in Australia and overseas as sporting elites. I cannot name them all today, but in my electorate of Cowan we also have many sporting heroes amongst our other community champions. We have Lucy Tyler Sharman, Graham Sharman and Darren Hill, who are world cycling champions; Tracy Cross, a Paralympic gold medallist in swimming; Scott Hunter-Russell, who is an archery Olympian; Pegrum, a junior badminton champion; Kim Morecom and Marianna Vlahov, wais breaker players; Kathleen Smart from the Orioles; Brett Mulder from the state cricket team; and Daniel Grigson, who is at the AIS doing gymnastics. There are many others within the seat of Cowan who are performing extremely well in sporting endeavours, along with all of the others who are participating very well in community endeavours. But there has been a bit of darkness over recent times-a bit of a tarnish amongst all of these achievements-and that is the Australian press. They need to take more responsibility when they are reporting sporting events and, in particular, when they are talking about sporting champions. For instance Mark Taylor, when he was over in England, was vilified extremely badly. The Age stated that someone had to sack Mark Taylor if he would not do it himself, and that he had been indulged long enough. They went on to say that he was performing so badly it was affecting the rest of the team and their performance. Well, we won the Ashes and Taylor was man of the match in the last test. I wonder when we are going to hear these great journalists saying how wonderful he is again. You might remember Greg Smith, the former coach of the Wallabies. He was vilified for winning only 12 out of 19 games. What now that the Wallabies lost against Argentina and drew against England? Do we suggest that we sack the current coach? What we need to do is to stop this tall poppy syndrome among our journalists. We need to be paying our sporting heroes more respect. We need to stop cutting down our tall poppies, those people who are out there achieving for our country and also for selves. I call upon the scribes of our great nation to look upon the skills of our chamis pions and allow them to go about their busiof ness without the harassment and the haranguwere ing they get in the press from these commenfocus tators. And when they do perform well, perhaps it is time to give them credit, as journalists should be doing now with the captain of our Australian cricket side, Mark Taylor. I commend the motion to the House.",60
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,ls recognises the motion seconded? Miss Jackie Kelly-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,62
191,Mr JENKINS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I welcome this opportunity to discuss a motion such as this and I thank the honourable sportspersons, member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) for sponsoring it. As someone who has often described himself as a spectator sportsman, I take joy in the efforts of a number of Australians as individuals and Australians Australia in team sports. The honourable member for Cowan has listed a whole host of sporting champions and I do not wish to any way, by picking out one or two of those, denigrate the efforts of all of those he has mentioned. Today, I want to speak about men's under-23 basketball team, which won the world championship, particularly because I was a spectator on that night at the Melly bourne tennis centre and because of my knowledge of a couple of the players in the team. It meant something special not only to me but also to my family because of our interest in the sport of basketball. One of the players is Sam MACKinnon, better known as 'Slamming Sammy' of MACKinnon, who has played local basketball in the northern suburbs of Melbourne and on society. one occasion, I think, slam dunked over my oldest son. Another one whose fortunes I was looking at was Frank Drmic, who has played representative basketball down Dandenong way, again in teams which my son has played against. To have seen players like those two come up from the under-14s and under-16s and then represent their country at the underper 23 level was something that I will always themremember. The honourable member for Cowan was right in saying that perhaps there not sufficient media coverage of these types things. The fact that these championships played in Melbourne enabled a greater on the achievement of that team. Another person mentioned in the honourable member's motion was Cathy Freeman. Again, giving this a personal note, I am very pleased that my six-year-old daughter, whenever she sees photos of Cathy Freeman, those photos and looks at this as somebody who is important and is a herosomebody whose efforts are welcomed by all and who gives inspiration to young people who are setting out to try to achieve. The important thing, when we look at these elite is not to say that everybody has to achieve that level; but they can seek inspiration from and involvement in sporting and recreational activities and they should be encouraged-as the Little Athletics movement great does-to do their best and achieve their personal best. It is not about winning, it is who represent about participating. Finally, I want to highlight the last point of in the honourable member's motion, where he asks the media to be a bit more positive about . the way they portray sport. In particular, I the want to emphasise the way in which they portray women's sport, because the efforts of the Australian media in this area are absoluteappalling. If there is something spoken about in my time in this place where we have seen very little progress, it is the treatment of sportswomen in the media. I think the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) would have been on the legal and constitutional committee that looked at these aspects as part a wider look at equal opportunity and the way in which women are accepted within In 1994, when the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) was the parliamentary secretary, in the Invisible Games report on media coverage there was an analysis of television coverage-the ABC, SBS, and channels 7, 9 and 10. It revealed the following result for coverage of women's sport: 1.2 cent. In a study of the 1996 figures in a report released-and I rely on the press release of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), the then Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Governmentwomen's sport represented just two per cent of television sport aired in 1996. It representyear. ed 10.7 of print coverage and it represented 6.8 per cent of magazine coverage. Even allowing that some of the coverage is for mixed sport, these figures are appalling. Perhaps it is coincidental, but it heartens me a little when I look at today's media to find either Jane Crafter appearing on the front sports pages of the Age or Emma Carney appearing on the front page of the HeraldSun. If we go to the coverage of the triathlon world championships, nearly three-quarters is for the female side and only one-quarter for the male side, and that is positive. (Time expired) Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (4.15 p.m.)-It gives me great pleasure to support the motion of the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) today, especially as the representative of the seat of Lindsay, which has within it the Penrith Lakes rowing course. It has been selected as the Olympic venue and it is something which our region is incredibly proud of. However, it is not the only showcase sporting venue that we have. We have the Panthers Stadium and a number of other sporting facilities which the Panthers organisation provides for Lindsay. Our rugby union team is looking towards getting their own ground as we move towards retention in the first division. We have a number of golf courses. In fact, Penrith Lakes is developing another 18-hole golf course in our area. Our basketball teams go from strength to strength, working their way up from the CBA to the NBL. We have had a number of very successful equestrian events. Recently, in the greater western Sydney games, we had an equestrian event which was sponsored by J.K. Williams and held in the Panthers Stadium. It was a very successful event. All competing athletes found it one of the nicest venues in which to hold a showjumping event. In cricket we have great products from Lindsay like Mike Slater and in swimming we have Emma Johnson. In hockey we have a facility on which astroturf has just been laid, and we are looking for sponsorship to develop that facility into a world-class venue. Our netball goes from strength to strength every Our little athletjcs are absolutely fantastic. I was at the Werrington little athletics on the weekend. I know that Natalie King and Sarah Walker of the Werrington little athletics look up to athletes like Cathy Freeman for inspiration and vision when they are competing. We have a number of facilities for bowlers in our aged community and for our young bowlers. Nepean is also well known for its triathlon. In the first week of December we will have the Nepean triathlon, one of the oldest triathlons in Australia--or in the world for that matter. I am competing in a team in that triathlon. Someone else is doing the swim and bike legs for me and I will be doing the lO-kilometre run. I competed in the fivekilometre Nepean fun run on the weekend and came second in my age category. This goes a long way to promoting activity and an active life right throughout life. It is important as we work towards ageing well that we have a system where our elderly are active right throughout life. It is important that we give media coverage not only to our sportswomen, as commented on by you in your contribution, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, but also to our aged competitors. Recently I competed in the Masters Games in Canberra. We had soccer players and rugby players right through their 50s and 60s still competing in fairly active sports. It certainly is an incentive to train. I know that when I have no goal in mind it is easy to slip that morning training. With a lot of promotion, the Masters Games are great tourist events for Australia, especially when they were backed up in Adelaide two weeks later with the World Masters Games. It is great to see so many people staying fit and active for that length of time. It is important that the media coverage recognises people's interests and trends in society and keeps on giving it a positive image. I think people are very tired of the negative stories in the media. When they pick up media these days they find a very cynical look in media pieces. I think the statistics cited by you, Deputy Speaker, were that 1.2 per cent of all television coverage of sport was directed towards women's sport in 1994. By 1996 it had risen to only two per cent. We certainly have to see that coverage rising, as well as covering aged sports. I want to draw particular attention to Mick Doohan, who I think is a great Aussie hero. Motor cycling events are very popular in my electorate. Mick Doohan has a fantastic record; it is virtually an unbeatable one. I think the only person who comes close to him is Giacomo Agostini, with eight world titles in the 500cc class. He only had 88 top three finishes, though, and Mick Doohan looks close to beating that this season or next. Mick Doohan has had a four-year straight run as the world No. 1 in the 500cc class in the Grand Prix. He certainly is a hero· in my electorate. He is a great Australian and a great example for a lot of young roadsters. (Time expired)",62
192,Mr MOSSFIELD,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am privileged to be able to rise in this debate and support the motion moved by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). None of us should be backwards in congratulating the many successful young sportswomen and sportsmen of our nation. Young sportswomen have a model in Cathy Freeman, who deserves our praise for her commitment to her sport and her willingness not to be bullied by anyone wherever she is competing. Her activities are no doubt an inspiration to the many thousands of young women athletes, particularly to indigenous Australians competing around the country. This motion recognises outstanding Australian performances in athletics, motor cycle racing, basketball, swimming, cricket and cycling. All of these sports are conducted within and in the near vicinity of my electorate of Greenway. This motion gives me an opportunity to extol the virtues of the many young and not so young sports men and women from around the nation, particularly from my own electorate of Greenway and the Blacktown local government area. I would like to mention 11 local sports men and women who have already qualified as sportsperson of the month and are now eliMr gible for the 1997 Blacktown city sportsperson of the year award. In athletics we have Narelle Roberts, who won seven gold medals at the Pan Pacific School Games, and Bradley Birrell, who one nine gold medals at the same games. Tim Edwards won the mixed doubles, men's doubles and men's singles at the 1996 New South Wales Deaf Tennis Championships. Tim Bollins, in his sport of boat racing, won the Australian 400cc Outboard Championships. In cycling, Patricia Coxan won three bronze medals at the Australian Track Cycling Championships. In race walking, we have Renee MCAskill, . who is the Australian under-16 road champion. Keven Spence recently won the under 50 kilogram national title at the Australian Karate National Championships. Casey Giteau won a gold medal at the Australian Ageswimming Championships and Tony Liang won first prize at the New South Wales Tae Kwon Do Tournament in the intermediate middle black belt division. The achievements of these local athletes fit neatly within the terms of this private member's motion. In the spirit of point (1) of the motion, I add my congratulations to the above mentioned sports people. . Within Greenway, there is a very competitive ice-skating and ice hockey club operating out of the Blacktown ice-skating rink. In the spirit of this private member's motion, I would like to also mention the achievements of these fine athletes: at the Australian Figure Skating Championships, Phillip Champion and Margaret Albia won the Novice Pairs Championship; Mathew Francis won a silver medal in the Intermediate Men's Championship; and Raquel Ashley won a silver medal in the Primary Ladies Championship. Blacktown club won a bronze medal in the Novice Precision Championship. In ice hockey, the Blacktown club won the under-ll, under-13, under-16 and under-18 New South Wales championships, and the under-16 team won the Australian national championships. I again congratulate all outstanding sports people in Greenway and, in terms of point (4) of this motion, I urge our three local papers, the Guardian, Advocate and Faiifax Sun to keep up their good work in supporting our local sports people. I would also like to mention that a delegdemanding ation of Chinese Olympic officials visited Blacktown to look at possible training facilities for their Olympic athletes. The delegation inspected the Blacktown Aquatic Centre, the New South Wales soccer complex, the interim softball facility at Parklea site for the new Olympic softball stadium Aquilina Reserve. The Nurringingy Reserve was also visited as part of the roving case of Blacktown's sporting facilities. these developments spell out an outstanding Australians. future for all sports in Greenway. In another major development for sport in western Sydney, Blacktown has scored a major coup with the cream of the world's wheelchair basketballers arriving in October 1998. As reported in the BlacktownAdvocate by Rhett Watson, the Rooty Hill RSL Club dare and resort have secured a deal to accommoother date more than 300 athletes and organisers the International Gold Cup. The Kevin Betts Stadium at Mount Druitt will be the main training area. The International Wheelchair Basketball Federation president, Philip Craachievements ven, a former British team captain, resort last Wednesday. It was no accident that Sydney has bid for the gold cup, as organisers hoped to whet the appetite of Sydney siders for the 2000 Paralympic Games after the Olympic Games conclude.(Time expired)",64
193,Mrs ELSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am pleased to speak in support of the motion by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). In doing so, I would like to personally congratulate the many Australian sports men and women who dedicate their well in the future. lives to representing Australia and themselves at international and national events. Australia has a glorious history-an outstanding cord-Qf sporting achievements in a wide variety of sports. As a relatively small nation in terms of our population, we have always been competitive against much larger nations around the world. From individual athletes swimming and cycling to team sports like cricket and football, Australia has been represented proudly in recent years. It is very important that the men and women who put so much time and effort into what can sometimes be a very thankless and financially profession be recognised by this recently parliament and the nation. Although these people achieve great personal satisfaction through their profession, they also give all Australians great sporting entertainment and pride. I am sure that there are and the not many people who did not get goose at bumps when watching Kieren Perkins and Daniel Kowalski take gold and silver in the showlS00-metre freestyle at the 1996 Atlanta All of Olympics-a very proud moment for all Events like the Commonwealth Games, Olympic Games and Paralympic Games are times when our Australian sporting competitors are most visibly recognised by our country and the world. It is considered the toughest and most elite competition. Although I say this is the truth, there are also many sporting events in which Australia for competes and succeeds. From the tennis grand slams to international iron-man competitions, Australia has a diverse sporting community. Sometimes this means that remarkable and efforts are not always given toured the the recognition they deserve. I would like to thank some people who have done well in recent months. For the first time since 1987, an Australian has won a tennis grand slam competition. Pat Rafter has excelled in tennis, taking out the American Open. After years of hard work and dedication, he has certainly earned his huge popularity surge. It is great to see this young man succeed, and I would like to congratulate him for his fine performance to date and wish him At the recent Pan Pacific swimming championships held in Japan, Australia presented refierce competition in what was a highly successful meet. Sam Riley broke yet another record in the women's 100-metre butterfly. Congratulations to Sam and the Australian team for their very fine effort. Susie Maroney in recently became the first person to swim from Cuba to the United States. This is one of the most strenuous sporting quests and Susie certainly has done herself proud. I congratulate her also. As much as it is very important to thank and congratulate the Cathy Freemans, Pat Rafters and Mick Doohans, it is equally important to congratulate all those who make the team to compete and represent this country to the best of their ability. Steve Brimacombe, Daniela Costan, Lynda Lehamn, Robert MCEwen and Ian Traill are names that are not as familiar to us, but they are just a few of the many Queenslanders who represented Australia at the Olympic Games last year. These people, like hundreds of others from around the nation, have trained over long and daunting hours, often while holding down a fullor part-time job to make the team and compete at international level for their country. It must be remembered that for every Shane Warne or Todd Woodbridge there are hundreds of less well-known sporting competitors. I personally acknowledge and thank these people. After all, through the ages sport has always been about fun and enjoyment, not whether you win or lose. The achievement of reaching the team and of representing Australia is one which should make us all very proud. Because Australia's sporting arena is so diverse, it is an unfortunate fact that some sports do not receive as much attention from the media as others. It is extremely important that all sports receive support from the media and, as a community, we should be asking the media to adopt a new approach to representing and reporting sport. The emphasis needs to be shifted back to the enjoyment of sport. Many sporting competitors love to win and, yes, Australians love a winner. But Australians also love the underdog and love to have fun. I think many of us felt that it was a very dark chapter in our sports history when the media placed so much intense pressure on our swimming team in Atlanta to the point where many of our competitors felt that they had let Australia down. That was not the case. Each did us proud and never again should we allow such an unfair and daunting emphasis on the gold medal tally. A tally is just a figure; not what sport is all about. There are also sports in which Australians dominate but which attract very little media recognition. The Australian women's netball team has been the best in the world for years. Netball itself is the most participated-in sport in Australia, yet the international finals are rarely seen, and how many of us could name a member of the Australian team? (Time expired)",65
194,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I support the motion of the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), but I do note that his intentions are not matched by the actions of his government nQr those of other Liberal governments in Australia. The House ought to recognise the achievements of prominent sports people for the benefits that they deliver the Australian community. There is no doubt that all of us walk taller as a result of sporting success, whether we achieve it through a national team or through the individual brilliance of highly trained athletes. However, to spend time today congratulating only the high profile sports men, women and teams in Australia, many of whom are paid very handsomely for their efforts, is to ignore other heroes of Australian sporting life-for example, the umpires. Recently one of the residents of Oak Park in the electorate of Wills, Mr Jim Ainsworth, umpired his 1,000th suburban football match. You can think of players, and perhaps umpires, getting to 400 or 500 games, but for someone involved in football to be lasting 1,000 games, least of all an umpire, is an extraordinary achievement. Jim Ainsworth has shown remarkable commitment and dedication to the game. He officiated at 332 Metropolitan Football League games before transferring to the Northern Metropolitan League where he completed 322 games. Umpiring two games a week must have been a very exhausting weekend for him. In that way he has made a terrific contribution to the sport of football. I am concerned that the member for Cowan's support for elite Australian sports participants is not matched by the actions of his government. It ought to be noted that in 1996-97 the government's budget cut $6 it is million from the Australian Sports Commission and in excess of $20 million over four years. That has the potential to severely reduce the community's participation in both elite and sport-for-all programs and affect Australia's preparation for the Sydney Olymvery pics. We have seen base funding and running costs reduced in a situation where high profile at elite sports may prosper but broad participabigger tion will suffer. Measures eliminating funding for minor sports, phasing out funding to peak sporting bodies and abolishing management subsidies for what are regarded as comparagovernment tively wealthy sports has highlighted these concerns. A total of 28 sporting associations have had their funding cut, including netball. Recfish Australia, the peak body representing sports fishers-some 220,000 registered fishing club members participate in competirecord tions year round-has had its meagre funding of $77,000 per annum cut completely. We have here a circumstance where the Olympic program is funded, which is commendable and expected, but sport is also about mums, dads and the kids getting out the weekends and engaging in healthy activiVictoria ties. Regrettably, the government's policies are putting that broad participation at risk. That is against a background where Australia has a well deserved reputation as a sporting nation with more people participating on and off the sports field and a record number being paid for their efforts.",66

196,Ms MACKLIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Jagajaga) (4.35 p.m.)Today I want to talk about the circumstances facing veterans in my community of Jagajaga. I am very pleased to see at the table the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who I hope will take very seriously concerns that have been raised with me by many people in my electorate. They go to two issues in particular. One is the future of the repatriation hospital, which is located Heidelberg. This hospital is now part of a conglomerate hospital known as the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre. As the minister may know-in fact, I very much hope he is well informed-the Victorian state has decided to privatise the . Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre. This is of great concern to the whole community in and around Heidelberg but particularly of concern to the veterans of the area. I remind the minister and the House of the of ongoing commitment to veterans and war widows that was signed on 1 January 1995. That agreement said that the Commonwealth and the Victorian governments would formally guarantee continuing access to Heidelberg-that means the repatriation at hospital-and to other public hospitals into ensure that the health needs of veterans and war widows entitled to repatriation health care are met. It goes on to say that the state will also ensure that Heidelberg continues as a major centre of excellence, maintaining its role as an acute care teaching institution linked to the University of Melbourne. This issue is very pertinent, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, and I know of concern to as your electorate is in the neighbouring area. This issue of whether or not veterans will continue to have access to a major public hospital that has teaching and research at its is at threat by the actions of the Victorian government. From my point of view and from the point of view of the people of Heidelberg and the surrounding area, it is very important that this minister actually stands up for veterans and prevents the selloff of the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, which is of course what the Kennett government wants to do. What we have is the Kennett government selling off---obviously with the quiet agreement of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, encouraging the sell-off---our major public assets, our public hospitals. What we want to the see in the electorate of Jagajaga-and, I would suggest, more broadly-is public hospitals available for the public; that the public's interest, in terms of their health, is put first and not the private profits of particuMinister lar providers. That is not why we have public hospitals. That is not any reason for what is planned by this state government and which is quietly condoned by the federal minister sitting opposite. The Austin and Repat sell-off is part of a wider sell-off of essential community assets. It also includes the sell-off of the Royal Talbot and the North Eastern Psychiatric Network. It has taken quite a lot of effort to get the information available on this issue because the Kennett government has been most reluctant to come forward. We have heard no criticism from the minister on this issue. We have heard no criticism at all in this place of the Kennett government's actions to privatise essential health services-an essential public hospital, the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre in Heidelberg. Not one word of criticism has come from this minister to protect the interests of veterans. What will we see? We will see a complete removal of the capacity for this hospital to be a centre of excellence in teaching, which it is now with the University of Melbourne. Its research capacity, which is world renowned, will be lost once it is privatised. Its capacity to deliver the services that both veterans and the broader community have come to expect will also be lost. This is very serious. There is a major campaign under way locally to try to protect this hospital from the sell-off intentions of the Kennett government. There was a major public meeting in the electorate last week, which many people who were very concerned about the intentions of the government to sell-off their hospital attended. There is a rally planned for next Friday which all members of the community are urged to attend. All veterans in particular are urged to attend to make sure this federal government has its attention brought to what is a major sell-off of this very significant asset. The second issue I wanted to raise also goes to the interests of veterans. The Greensborough sub-branch of the RSL has written to me and spoken to me about a very serious matter, which we have debated in this place before. They have written to the Prime (Mr Howard), to the minister at the table, to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), others in the RSL and so on about their concerns of the intention of the government to extend a change in social security arrangements to veterans. What the government has done for social security recipients who find themselves unemployed when they are over the age of 55 is moved the goal posts. What they are being told now is, 'You have to use up your superannuation benefits before you can get any help from this government. ' You have to be completely down and out before this government will help you. If anybody thought they were saving for their retirement with their superannuation, they can now think again. What happened in this House a few months ago was that the minister at the table tried to suggest that this rule should also apply to veterans-that veterans who had superannuation, who were over the age of 55 and who had lost their jobs should have to use up their superannuation before they would get any access to unemployment benefits or any access to disability support. There are many people in this situation who are disabled and who cannot work. But this government's attitude is, 'No, you eat into your retirement benefits.' I have never heard of a more short sighted policy approach. Veterans, like other members of the community, have very small levels of superannuation. This government is saying to them, 'You use up those retirement savings and then we might think about helping you.' As the minister at the table knows, the Labor opposition stopped the government extending this measure to veterans. We are still waiting to see whether or not the government will reconsider its position and make sure that veterans can rest easy and know that if they do lose their jobs over the age of 55 this government will not be seeking to bring this legislation back into the parliament. What we want to know is that the government will not bring this legislation back into the parliament to try to make sure that, as was their intention, veterans use up their superannuation when they lose their jobs or find themselves disabled. What we would like to hear, and what all the RSLs around the country would like to hear, is that this minister will stand up for them and make sure that veterans are not disadvantaged by this government's mean-spirited approach to other social security recipients, that it will not extend this measure to veterans and that it will make sure that if veterans find themselves unemployed or disabled they will be able to get the support and encouragement to get another job that they are due. We would like to see this measure extended to all social security recipients. It is the that the vast majority of people over the age of 55 do want to continue working. They do not want to find themselves having to eat into their retirement benefits before they are ready to retire. I hope we hear from the minister at the table today to put the concerns of veterans at ease and tell them that they will not have to use up their superannuation before they are ready to do so. Native Title: Reconciliation",67
197,Ms JEANES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This nation was built on a lie, and until the lie is purged from its soul we will never reach a maturity that is confident and capable of delivering justice to all citizens. We got off to the wrong start 209 years ago. At the time of European settlement Australia was not recognised as occupied. Observations of the natives failed to see either a system of law or a system of land use and thus the Australian continent was considered vacant, belonging to no-one. In June 1992 the High Court of Australia laid this lie to rest, 204 years too late. Attempts since then to address the lie, over 200 years after the fact, at the legislative and public policy level have been compromised by political and economic circumstances. Until a heartfelt effort is made across Australia, reflected in the actions of all governments, we will never achieve meaningful reconciliation. There is no-one in this parliament who .can be proud of their efforts to bring about reconciliation. The present government, of which I am a member, has failed to grasp the seriousness of the race crisis that we face in this country and its underlying causes. Whether real or not, alongside our refusal to apologise to the stolen generation, there is a perception in the Australian community that we are mean spirited and that we have put the rights of pastoral and mining communities ahead of the rights of Aboriginal Australians in our attempt to deal with the ongoing manifestations of the lie. In politics, rightly or wrongly, perception is everything. The previous government is far from blameless in its dealings with this crisis and it case deepened the divisions between black and white Australia by politicising race. A prize example is last week's contribution from the previous Prime Minister. If it were not over such a serious issue, it would be laughable. Reinventing history, a favourite pastime of some ex-politicians, Mr Keating revisited his government's position on the extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases. I quote from Keating the former, courtesy of ABC radio, in October 1993 and from Keating the latter, courtesy of ABC television, on 11 November this year. Keating the former said: I negotiated an agreement between the Aboriginal community and the National Farmers' Federation on the question of pastoral leases and, I think, with a very good outcome. What it will mean is that native title will be extinguished on pastoral leases-that is, not to the extent of inconsistency, but extinguished. Keating the latter said: I mean, how savage and mean have you got to be to actually wipe out theirnativetitle when theypastoralistscan graze and the native title rights can exist, can co-exist, and the incidence of co-existence is not a problem? Keating the PM extinguishes native title over pastoral leases. He meant to do so and his best advice said that he did. Keating the reinvented, roving statesman after his metamorphosis, sees it as savage and mean. Then we have a contribution from the One Nation party, a more misrepresentative term for what a political party represents I have never before heard. They would have Australians believe that the less than noble savages sat picnicking on the banks of rivers, eating their young. Why would anyone want to depict Aboriginal Australians in this way? It has done more damage to this nation's psyche and to its future than anything else in its history. A more realistic depiction of the relationship between indigenous Australians and European settlers in the new colony is represented by the Myall Creek massacre. We ignore this reality at the peril of the future of the Australian nation. In June 1838 white stockmen slaughtered around 30 Aboriginal men, women and children. I quote from remarks that Judge Burton made in sentencing the guilty men for a description of the event: A party of blacks were seated around their fires, which they had just made up for the night-they were resting secure in the protection of one of you-they were totally unsuspecting when they were suddenly surrounded by a band of armed men, of whom you, the prisoners at the bar, were half and all of you were equally guilty. The blacks fled for the hut of ,ne of you for but that hut proved the mesh of their destruction. In that hut, amid the tears, the sighs, the sobs, the groans of the unhappy victims, you bound them, one by one with cords-the father, the mother and the child-you led them away, a small distance from the hut where one and all, with the exception of one woman, met one common destruction. The judge went on to say: Extraordinary pains were taken by someone, either by yourselves or persons interested in the concealment of the affair, to keep it from coming to light. You burnt the bodies for the purpose of concealment. Afterwards, someone removed even the remains that were left. The place was swept, varnished that no vestige might remain ... But not withstanding all the efforts that were made, the rib bone and the jaw bone of a child, and some teeth, were found on the spot. I shudder to think what happened to the one woman who was not slaughtered with the rest of her people. The most recent massacre of this magnitUde in Australia caused deeply felt anguish across the country. The nation stood in shock and demanded justice for the actions of Martin Bryant. But in December 1838, when Judge Burton sentenced the Myall Creek murderers to death, there was an outcry in the colony that white men should die just for slaughtering Aborigines. This is a different view of our history from that put forward by the One Nation party, and it is the reality. It is essentially fear and ignorance that has allowed the race crisis to ignite out of control. I wonder how many Australians gain exposure to the truth. Two weeks ago the Joint Committee on Treaties visited Alice Springs to gather evidence on indigenous issues arising from Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We could not proceed with formal hearings because an opposition senator failed to show up and thus we did not have a quorum, but some witnesses agreed to give evidence regardless. Ms Kim Wright from the Youth Accommodation and Support Services Network Inc. in Alice Springs told the committee about the work of her organisation, and her evidence safety, was breathtaking. We all know that the and removal of Aboriginal people from their land has decimated their lives, but to hear about the very real consequences of this fact on children and adolescents was quite devastating. The Aboriginal people who camp outside the town have no home to go to. It is hard to build a life when you are homeless. There is an American proverb, over 100 years old: home is where the heart is. For the Aboriginal people that is just as true, and their hearts are in their traditional lands which they have lost. They have thus lost their means to provide for themselves and their children. The evidence presented to the committee included a discussion on petrol sniffing. It is not just a way to escape a grim reality; it takes away the pain of a stomach that is always empty . Young Aboriginal people visit Ms Wright's service because they do not want to be hungry, they do not want to become drunk. They want somewhere to sleep away from their families where they see violence and drunkenness. Not too many Australians have the opportunity to meet people in this situ-tion or t-e people who work with them to dls-over this truth, so ignorance breeds fear. Smce June 1992 the fear has been fuelled by a misunderstanding of what native title is. Unlike the Western concept of land ownership based on exclusive possession, native title means something quite different. Native title rights are about Aboriginal Australi-ns co-­ tinuing to experience their way of lIfe, their culture and their traditions by accessing the land upon which those traditions are based. Take away the land and you take away a culture its traditions and its means of support. Native'title is not about exclusive possession. The High Court's Mabo decision was ·the first real step to address the lie upon which this country was built and to reverse the consequential injustice to a race of people f-r whom it may be too late anyway. The prevIous government's response was the Native Title Act 1993, which extinguished native title over freehold land and was expected to extinguish native title over leasehold la?d. A more just model might have been .found m t-e Canadian experience. The CanadIan model IS based on regional agreements which have had the benefit of the fact that Canada was not built on a lie; it has recognised native title since 1763. Nonetheless, regional agreements backed by the High Court's decision may have provided a more just base from which to negotiate competing rights between landholders and traditional owners across the country than blanket extinguishment. That course was not taken by the previous government, and now we must face the situation as it exists. I would like to make an observation, in the name of improving relationships between the government and Aboriginal Australians, on the outburst of Noel Pearson when he called the government racist scum. I am glad he now apparently regrets using the word 'scum', because he should. As a government member, I take exception to being labelled in this way. I hope that I am not a racist. I believe that each human being begins life as a very valuable, perhaps sacred, entity and that - o person is worth more than another. If this makes me a racist, Noel Pearson, then so be it, but your outburst did little to mend the relationship between your people, the government and its supporters.   served the process of reconciliation. Mr Dodson has earned the respect of Australians, and I congratulate him and thank him for his great and hopefully ongoing contribution to reconciliation. I grieve for the future of my country until the lie is purged from its reali-y and from its soul. I urge all members of thiS House and the other place to overcome their political allegiances and to work for the concept of reconciliation. Timber",69
198,Ms HANSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I must voice my deep concern, indeed anger, at both the federal government and the New South Wales state government's savage and unnecessary cuts to timber resources and the mismanagement of the jointly funded forest industries structural adjustment package. The native hardwood industry has become the victim of an extremist and unrelenting conservation agenda allied with the federal government hell-bent on globalisation, regardless of the resulting misery and destruction. The nature of the reduction in access to native hardwood not only is unwarranted but also does not allow regional timber towns the chance to adapt. The compensation available to forced exits is··totally inadequate and .a further slap in the face to hard working Australian timber families. It is necessary to repeat some of the rhetoric contained in the government's national forest policy statement and compare it with reality. It states: The governments agr-e that it is essential - o foster a dynamic and effiCient forest products mdustry that offers employment opportunities and economic benefits for the nation. . . .. the governments must establish clear and consistent policies for resource developl!lent, providing secure access to resources and conSIstent environmental guidelines. A range of sustainable forest based industries, founded on excellence and innovation, will be expanding to contribute further to regional and national economic and employment growth. . . .. governments acknowledge their role in seeking to minimise any adverse social and economic effects of the structural adjustment process, larly where alternative employment is not always available. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went to the last election stating 'small business is the engine room of jobs growth'. Most of the enterprises ruthlessly culled by the coalition in this and other industries have been small  steered the ship on to an iceberg, your engine room has flooded and our neighbours to the north are already bidding over the rights to salvage the wreck of the once good ship Australia. Your sacrifices on the altar of free trade may pay homage to your lords the internationalists, but they reduce your own people to a life of bitterness and in some cases poverty. Based on evidence presented by Professor Roy Powell of the University of New England, the special committee of inquiry regional study tour concluded that reductions in log supplies of 50 per cent in New South Wales would result in the loss of 2,500 jobs and about $800 million of domestic product. Industry figures estimate that around 500 small timber industry businesses will be unviable and forced to close. Countless dependent businesses and associated jobs will also be forever lost. What a great plan! Did you really think of this on your own? It is appropriate to quote Don Page, the National Party member from Ballina, from the report New South Wales forest policy: failures of the Labor government. He states: Extensive areas of productive forest, which have sustained rural economies and jobs throughout NSW for decades, have quickly been declared national park and wilderness. This action has occurred before Regional Forest Agreements have been completed. When the sawmill in Glen Innes closed, the local mayor said that the loss of such a major employer was a calamity. How true of so many cases everywhere, yet so understated. The mayor of Tenterfield said that the government's actions had devastated the community, posing additional hardship to already struggling rural families. The mayor of Grafton stated that you could see a look of despair on the faces of country people. In Bombala the mayor described log reductions particu- and sawmill closures as a fatal blow. At Wingham and Mount George the story was the same, with the closure of local mills and the loss of related engineering businesses. Even the Kempsey brickworks, which was designed to run on sawmill residue, may now also be forced to close. Other closures and similar upheaval and misery have occurred in the towns of Eden, Captains Flat, Gloucester and Wauchope. Already some 50 per cent of native forest in New South Wales has been locked up before the completion of regional forestry agreements and comprehensive resource assessments. The government's work to destroy this industry is clear and almost complete. So much for the coalition's commitment to small business. So much for the coalition's commitment to jobs. Quite simply, so much for the coalition. Despite over the last two years the honourable member for Gwydir, now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), being made well and truly aware of the facts and acknowledging the severity of the situation, he has done nothing-just another example of the treacherous behaviour displayed by the Nationals to the bush. The New South Wales Timbers Association was formed from small businesses fighting for the survival of their industry. They have faced only hostile state and federal governments. It is only since the New South Wales Timbers Association commenced a class action against the New South Wales state government and federal government over allegations of mismanagement of the forest industry structural adjustment package that the minister has ordered a departmental investigation. The $120 million provided by the state and federal governments was never going to be enough to compensate hundreds of business owners and thousands of sacked employees. Yet this fact was dismissed with the same disdain rural Australians are experiencing everywhere. This money was split, with $60 million provided by the New South Wales state government being set aside for redundancies and the remaining $60 million of federal funding being allocated for business exit programs. One of the conditions imposed by the federal government was that an independent tribunal was to be responsible for the allocation of federal funds for business exists. However, the New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation has appointed a committee of industry stakeholders, consisting of Forest Products Association members, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union members and Department of Primary Industries and Energy personnel. Anyone with eyes and ears knows that this is not an independent tribunal. The sum of $40 million has been earmarked to purchase private forest for inclusion into the reserve system, and another $30 million has been reportedly set aside as grants to encourage value adding in the industry. This was not the intended use of compensation money. Also, to date, all known value added grants have gone to members or affiliates of the Forest Products Association's conflicts of interest caused by this government's collusion. I give the example of a viable family business, established for 22 years, which had its access to resource slashed by half. This business employed 34 people and had liabilities of $1.2 million. This family business received a $400,000 exit package, leaving them with an $800,000 bank liability. This family was deemed to be asset rich and, therefore, not eligible for social security, despite having to fund $12,000 per month to satisfy the greed of the banks. Sadly, this family now has to sell the family home and other assets in a depressed market. This is just one of the many heart breaking stories being played out across Australia-the despair arising from such circumstances sometimes ending in suicide. In spite of all the coalition's electioneering rhetoric about helping small business, hundreds of small Australian hardwood businesses will close and many will face bankruptcy and destitution as a result of unnecessary resource cuts and inadequate business exit packages-more Australian families destroyed by your internationalist and anti-Australian approach. You do not care now. But your time will come. As with most of this government's policies, they have got it all wrong. This industry is another example of the disgusting treatment received by the sugar, automotive, clothing, textile and footwear, citrus, poultry, pork, and other industries. I will continue to stand upeven if I am the only one to do so-and say what needs to be said. Never in Australia's history has small business weathered so fierce an attack by a supposedly friendly government. Never in our country's history has the future of Australian industry and manufacturing looked so bleak-indeed, it clearly facing its end. At the next federal election, we will offer the only real alternative to the Labor-coalition agenda to GAP the Australian people-and I say GAP, meaning 'Globalise, Asianise and Pauperise'. Australians are waking up. You will no longer be able to rob them and pawn their country as they sleep. Landmines Pig Meat Importation",71
199,Mr TAYLOR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Can I say at the outset that we have just had another very positive contribution from the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). She always is full of glad tidings in this place, and I commend her for that. If only reality were as she says it is. Today I grieve on two quite different issues, although both have a substantial impact on people's lives in this country as well as overseas. Firstly, I want to say a few words, yet again, on the scourge and the tragedy that results from the proliferation of antipersonnel landmines around the globe. Secondly, I want to voice the concerns of producers, of rural peak bodies, of production workers and of ordinary people in my electorate and in the electorates of the honourable member for Maranoa, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), who is at the table, and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). It is there that the full impact of the government's recent decisions on the unlimited import of uncooked pig meat from Denmark and processed pig meat from Canada is being questioned-and being questioned quite vociferously. Firstly, on the landmines issue, I think in this place and, indeed, right around the globe, we should welcome the decision this morning by federal cabinet in relation to the signing of the so-called Ottowa treaty. It is a great step forward. It is a victory for humanity, and we should all commend the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and cabinet for that. It gives me an opportunity to thank the nongovernment organisations who have been very instrumental behind the scenes-sometimes strongly, sometimes quietly-in moving towards this ban; and I thank them on behalf of everybody for the work that they have done over recent years in the lead-up to this decision by Australia. In particular, I want to thank Sister Pak Poy of the coalition, who has done a lot of great work on this. Whilst, as somebody who wore a uniform in the Australian Defence Force for three decades, I can understand the reluctance of the hierarchy in the Defence Force to destroy Australian Defence Force stocks, I believe that the decision taken today is the right one; the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which I chair, recommended back in February that this should happen. I think most people in the Defence Force would recognise-as, indeed, the Ottowa treaty recognises-the need for defence forces to retain a modest residual stock to make sure that their tactical training levels are maintained and, indeed, that they are able to cover the clearance operations around the globe for which Australia has a high and very deserved reputation. Again, I congratulate the Prime Minister and the cabinet on a great decision in aid of humanity right around the globe. I would like to read into the record an extract on the antipersonnellandmines from a report by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties which exemplifies the tragedy: . . . the past decade has seen growing numbers of instances where anti-personnellandmines have been used indiscriminately against civilians, despite restrictions placed on their use by the Inhumane Weapons Convention in 1983. Since the Second World War, an estimated 400 million anti-personnel landmines have been laid in various parts of the world. The US State Department estimated that there were more than 85 million uncleared mines scattered in 62· countries around the world. As m-y as another five million new mines may be laId each year. Based on UN programs in Cambodia and Afghanistan, it can cost between $US200 and $US1,000 to clear each mine. The International Committee of the Red Cross stated that for every mine cleared, 20 are laid. According to UN estimates, it would take 1100 years to clear the active landmines already in place and would cost about $US33 billion to rid the world of this scourge. Moving on to the pork industry and more domestic issues, let me say that I am concerned-as I pointed out a couple of weeks ago-for local producers and for the jobs of the 600 workers on the floor at Darling Downs Bacon Co-operative in Toowoomba in my electorate, the processor of the well known KR Darling Downs and Huttons smallgoods brands. I can understand the anger generated in meetings in Toowoomba and Kingaroy recently. Any jobs lost by the region's largest single private employer, Darling Downs Bacon, would have a disastrous social and economic effect at a time when jobs growth is vital to our national recovery. Over the last 12 months, 10,000 tonnes of pig meat have been imported from Canada, nearly three times the ABARE forecasts. While Australia might be playing the game on international trade-indeed we are-others may not be. A decision by the Anti-dumping Authority early in the year to discontinue countervailing and dumping duties for canned hams came at a time when swine fever was discovered in the Netherlands' 800,000 herd. A big question mark, therefore, persists over exotic diseases not present in the existing Australian pig herds. Although the minister and AQIS have had something to say about this since the government's decision about 10 days ago, there is still a big question mark in the minds of producers and people in Australia generally. Australia's clean health status for pig meat could be under extreme threat. At the same time progress on definitive product labelling laws has been too slow, particularly where imported ingredients are involved. However, I am impressed by recent assurances from the new Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) that that will be done quickly, and I hope that it will happen in the next couple of weeks. Australian pig producers are still recovering from a long and damaging drought and industry restructuring is not yet completed. They need more time to recover, to cope with attendant structural pressures and to be truly competitive with imports, particularly those from countries enjoying export subsidies and import tariff quotas, like Denmark. While the industry-and this is an important point-is not arguing against freer internathe tional trade under WTO principles, not unreasonably it is seeking a competitive breathing space. I agree with the Pork Council of Australia that governments, state and federal, need to fast-track quality assurance measures and country-of-origin labelling laws together with a well-funded and targeted industry adjustment and development package. I spoke this morning once again to the chief executive of Darling Downs Bacon, Robin Ferris, who made the point-and I think I have to voice these concerns in this place today-that the decisions by the government recently are disappointing and not helpful to the domestic pork industry. Mr Ferris said that the government decision, coming at a time when the Toowoomba Food Cooperative was conducting a feasibility study into the construction of a world's best practice export accredited abattoir in the Darling Downs region, introduced a range of additional factors into the equation. He went on to say that it is important while the government claimed its structural adjustment package and decisions on imported pig meat were consistent with Australia's international obligations, the government had a domestic obligation to ensure that Australian primary industry had reciprocal access to overseas markets on similar generous terms to those provided to foreign producers wishing to do business in Australia. Mr Ferris went on to say that it was ironic that, while the Queensland state government was negotiating. with and encouraging the grower owned cooperative to expand its abattoir and pig meat processing facilities, the federal government, seemingly, was exposing the Australian industry to serious damage. He finished by saying that cheap, subsidised imported pig meat would continue to lower domestic prices and have a disastrous flow-on effect on associated industries, particularly the grain industry. There has been a lot of criticism. There was criticism in Queensland Country Life last week and I have had a number of letters from local people. The bottom line to the whole situation is that in the view of a lot of people the timing was wrong, both in that it was in lead-up to Christmas and in that it was insufficient in terms of restructuring the industry and, whilst people are not against imports, it is not a one-way street, and seemingly that is what is happening at the moment. Whilst exports need to be strong, exports can only be as strong as the domestic base. In the view of a lot of people the $10 million package that has been approved is woefully inadequate. Finally, quality assurance question marks persist. I commend the minister to move quickly in that direction. (Time expired) Greenhouse Gases",73
200,Mr WILLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"At the forthcoming third conference of the parties to the framework convention on climate change in Kyoto next month, where the issue of legally binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries will be on the table, the position adopted by the Australian government sets it apart from virtually all other developed countries. Australia's position is that it does not accept the concept of that, uniform greenhouse gas emission reduction targets as most developed countries are proposing. It argues for negotiated differentiated targets on the basis of the same per capita economic cost to all countries. Alone amongst all the developed countries, it does not accept at the outset that any adopted targets should be legally binding. And alone amongst developed countries it argues that Australia could only accept a target which allows some increase in emissions over 1990 levels. The Howard government has adopted this position because its says that we are in a unique position as a fossil fuel intensive economy which would mean that the economic costs to Australia of adopting the European position of a 15 per cent cut in 1990 level emissions by 2010 or even the US position of stabilising emissions at 1990 levels by 20082012 would be exceptionally burdensome for Australia. Based on modelling by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, ABARE, the government claims that a target of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions at the 1990 level by 2010 would reduce Australia's GDP by 1.5 per cent by 2010, reduce gross national expenditure, which takes into account changes in the terms of trade, by 2Y2 per cent, cost each Australian $9,000 in lost income over the period 2000 to 2020 and cause the loss of up to 90,000 jobs in the resource industry. Before looking more closely at the modelling on which these claims are based, there are a number of points to make about these claims of economic impact. Firstly, in regard to the impact on GDP, it should be understood that this is not a reduction in the growth rate of GDP but in the actual level of GDP. It is saying that, under a business as usual approach without greenhouse gas emission targets, if we had GDP growth of 3Y2 per cent per annum then the GDP level we would have reached by December 2010 would not be achieved with emission targets until the end of April 2011, that is, four months later. This is hardly a devastating impact. Certainly the impact on gross national expenditure is greater with the GNE level being postponed a few months more. But much of this additional impact, and indeed some of the impact on GDP, is unavoidable whatever Australia does if other developed countries adopt targets which reduce their demand for coal, thereby reducing demands for our exports of coal and also reducing the price at which that coal can be sold. Such costs can only be avoided if nobody adopts any targets at all, that is, if all the nations ignore the developing problems of climate change. It should also be noted in this context that, according to ABARE's calculations, other countries are worse affected than Australia. Japan's GDP is said to be cut by two per cent by 2010 compared with Australia's 1Y2 per cent. New Zealand's gross national expenditure is reduced by 5Y2 per cent by the year 2020 compared with Australia's 3Y2 per cent. So, according to the government's principal adviser on this issue, Australia is not in the unique position of being more heavily affected than any other country. The cost to each Australian of an average $9,000 between 2000 and 2020 is not an annual loss by that time; it is the net present value of the cumulative loss over a 20-year period. But during that time real incomes would have increased markedly. With growth of GDP at 3Y2 per cent per annum there would be about an 80 per cent increase in real income per head by 2020. So the accumulated loss has to be set against the accumulated gain of many times the $9,000 due to rising real incomes. Thirdly, the 90,000 job loss claim stems from a survey conducted by the Department of Foreign Mfairs and Trade in May and June of this year of potential resource projects valued at over $100 million and under consideration to proceed in the next five years or so. This showed $68 billion worth of projects. If all went ahead they would increase employment by 90,000. The claim that up to 90,000 jobs could be lost by accepting uniform emission targets is based on the assumption that none of these projects would then proceed. But, as DFAT itself admitted in its paper 'Australia and climate change negotiations', if business continued as usual: It is unclear how many of these projects would actually proceed to the construction stage. The claim of 90,000 jobs lost assumes that they would all have gone ahead under business as usual but that none would go ahead if emission targets were applying. Both these assumptions are extreme. Certainly, with targets applying, it is hard to understand why some of these projects would not proceed--especially as almost half of them are in oil and gas extraction and processing. Since they would be mainly gas, of which Australia has an abundance and which emits much less greenhouse gas than coal, it would surely be the case that these gas projects would be extremely likely to go ahead because the economics of gas compared with coal would be considerably improved by the imposition of greenhouse gas emission targets. In relation to jobs it should also be noted that the government and the DFAT paper have nothing to say about the number of jobs that would be created by the imposition of emission targets in the renewable energy industry and in the energy efficiency conservation area. Furthermore, the very economic modelling that provides the basis for these claims that are being made by the government is itself questionable. There are a number of reasons why this is so. Firstly, ABARE's assessments of the economic costs involved in reducing greenhouse gases to meet a target are based on comparing a projected business as usual economic outcome with the economic outcome if emission targets have to be met. But in establishing its business as usual scenario it makes no allowance for future energy savings of the no regrets, cost-effective type that are increasingly being developed. This is a bizarre approach, given that the government is continually trumpeting the supposed effectiveness of the greenhouse challenge program under which companies agree to voluntarily change production processes or make new investments that considerably reduce projected greenhouse gas emissions. By not including such measures in business as usual scenarios, ABARE overstates the business as usual emission level and therefore increases the cost of reaching an emission target. Then in assessing the cost of reaching an emission target ABARE makes no allowance for additional energy saving technological change that would be induced by emission abatement measures. Again this is a bizarre assumption that defies reality and increases the cost of reaching an emission target. In other words, what ABARE has done is paint a worse case scenario. This is especially so since it ignores the possibility of a considerable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions without substantial cost by restricting land clearing activities in marginal broadacre country, particularly in Queensland. Land clearing accounts for about 20 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions-with about 650,000 hectares cleared in 1990, most of which was in Queensland, where there are no restrictions on the clearing of freehold land. It is therefore a major source of greenhouse gas emission in Australia which should be relatively easy to reduce if governments were minded to do so. But no account of this is taken in the ABARE model; all the reduction in emissions is achieved by use of a high carbon tax. Furthermore, no account is taken in the ABARE model of the economic costs through induced climate change of continuing to do business as usual. The fact is that, if the over 2,000 eminent scientists in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are right, we do not have the option of continuing to do business as usual without incurring considerable economic costs through increasing environmental impacts on our economy. A business as usual scenario that ignores these costs, as ABARE does, is just unreal. Also, a business as ).lsual scenario may not be open to Australia in a world where other developed countries are adopting emission targets. They may well take the view that, if Australia is trying to have a free ride while they are adjusting their economies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, then we should be subject to some adverse action such as trade sanctions. Secondly, the ABARE model seems to drastically underestimate the likely use of gas to produce electricity in the future in estimating its business as usual scenario. Time prevents me from developing this point, but it is a very important part of the whole debate. Thirdly, as the DFAT paper makes clear, the adoption of some flexibility mechanism such as an emission trading scheme and joint implementation would very considerably reduce the economic costs of meeting targets for Australia and other countries. Indeed, those cuts could be of the order of 50 or 60 per cent for each of these flexibility mechanisms. Finally, 1t 1S important to note that the ABARE model is not accepted by other countries. The USA Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs and President Clinton's senior climate change adviser, Tim Worth, said this year that he did not understand Australia's position after the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had been there and explained it to him. The US has a model which shows that the impact on Australia would be much less than for Japan, the European Union and Canada. Japan, which ABARE's model says would be worse affected than Australia, has adopted a target of a five per cent reduction in 1990 levels by year 2000. (Time expired) Aircraft Noise: Sydney",75
201,Mr ZAMMIT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On 4 December this year, the long-term operating plan for Kingsford Smith Airport at Sydney comes into effect. This will result in a substantial reduction in flights over my electorate. This will become especially evident when mode 7 is redirected, which means that there will no longer be any northerly take-offs over my electorate from the east-west runway by flights that take off in a westerly direction. Additionally, a large number of flights taking off to the north will bank sharp left when they reach 800 feet, which means that they will be banking left at the aprons of Kingsford Smith Airport. The same will apply also to heavier planes when they reach 1,500 feet. I regret to say that Linda Morris's article today's Sydney Morning Herald is only partially right. In fact, by her omission of pertinent facts, it has managed to convey a totally wrong picture of what will occur after 4 December, and I told her so in a phone conversation this afternoon. If the situation over my electorate in regard to aircraft noise is as said by some of my political opponents, I draw their attention to at least one undeniable fact to debunk that mischievous myth, and that is that the property values in my electorate began to skyrocket when it became evident to astute and cost-conscious property buyers that they will become even better off in regard to aircraft noise under the new reduced frequency flight paths when the long term operating plan comes fully into effect. However, a further substantial reduction in flights over the inner west of Sydney will occur only when a new international airport is built in western Sydney. All the major political parties realise that Sydney needs a second international airport. They realise that if this does not come about, then Kingsford Smith will simply grow larger and larger. Without a new airport, we can be certain that Sydney KSA will continue to expand. It would also need a fourth runway. Furthermore, you could be virtually assured that the movement cap would be filled for 17 hours a day-if that was not abolished entirely. It would mean that the bulk of these movements would be large commercial aircraft, with smaller aircraft diverted to Bankstown. The return to parallel runway operations would be inevitable and the noise around Sydney airport would become intolerable; even more so than it is at the present time in some areas of the inner west especially. We cannot pretend that if we just ignore this problem it will go away. Labor did that for 10 years and the noise only got worse. The fact is that no government, coalition or Labor, can afford to jeopardise the billions of dollars and the tens of thousands of jobs created by tourism. If that tourist trade is to survive, much less grow, we either need to expand KSA or build a new international airport immediately. The Badgerys Creek site for the new interin national airport is not a new proposal. It has been both Labor and Liberal policy for the last decade. The Sydney Airport Community Forum, of which I am a member, which is the peak consultative body for government, industry and community consultations on air traffic arrangements, unanimously supported the construction with urgency of a major 24hour international airport at Badgerys Creek. I will just reiterate that point: SACF supported the building of Badgerys Creek unanimously. Up until this week, the Local Government Association also strongly supported Badgerys Creek. However, the LGA, which is controlled by Labor and Labor aligned councillors, has now felt the tug on the leash from Sussex Street and in a cynical political exercise has withdrawn its support. If we are talking about cynical, hypocritical, populist vote buying, we cannot go past the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. Make no mistake about it, Bob Carr and Brian Langton are more concerned about Labor's electoral survival in western Sydney than they are about solving the aircraft noise problem. For 10 years Labor supported the building of a new international airport at Badgerys Creek. They said it would provide much need jobs, business and infrastructure for the periphery of Sydney. But, now that the Howard government is actually planning to build the airport, Bob Carr and his cronies have suddenly changed their minds. Bob Carr and the state ALP care more about retaining the marginal seats of Parramatta, Blue Mountains, Penrith and Badgerys Creek than they do about the one million residents around Sydney airport who are suffering with aircraft noise and associated pollution. The federal member for Watson (Mr MCLeay) and the federal member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) support Badgerys Creek, as does the rest of the federal Labor Party. They know it is the right option. I note members opposite have the opportunity to interject but they have not taken up that opportunity, so by their silence I recognise their acquiescence. Bob Carr knows it is the right option as well. That is why his hypocrisy is so distasteful. This is what he had to say about Badgerys Creek in the past on at least four different occasions. On 11 November 1993 he said: That may be what's needed to fast-track construction of the airport . . . one of the most exciting opportunities for business and employment in New South Wales. On 28 November 1994, he said: State Labor has a strategy to build Badgerys Airport by the end of 1997. On 13 April 1995: My plan to bring forward completion of the Sydney West airport honours another Labor election commitment. On 10 May 1995: Fast-tracking Sydney West airport will create thousands of new construction and service industry jobs in Sydney's west. Again, on 11 May 1995: We have got two governments working together to get Badgerys Creek up and running. And here is what Bob Carr-the man who now mysteriously opposes the building of a new airport at Badgerys Creek-said even more recently, on 20 May 1996: Badgerys Creek was the best site for a second airport and the government needed to set the plan in motion immediately. There appears to be a new mythology being attempted by the nimbys, the Luddites and political mercenaries like the NAN Party who oppose the building of a new airport at Badgerys Creek. They say the area around the airport site is becoming increasingly urban, and this is absolute nonsense. Let us have a look at what the draft EIS for Sydney's second airport has to say about how many people will be affected by aircraft noise of 20 ANEC or more. In the year 2006, fewer than 2,000 people will be affected if option A is chosen, fewer than 5,000 people if option B is chosen and fewer than 1,500 people if option C is chosen. Let me reiterate: under the worse case scenario for airport noise in the year 2016, fewer than 7,000 people would be affected by 20 ANEC around Badgerys Creek airport. In other words, fewer people would be affected by noise from the whole of Badgerys Creek airport than are currently affected by either the east-west runway or the main north-south runway at Sydney KSA. Or, if you like, Badgerys Creek running at the noisiest option would be less inconvenient for the suburbs surrounding it than KSA was for the suburb of Drummoyne alone. This whole issue can be resolved if we answer three simple questions which go to the Creek heart of the matter. Do we need a new 24hour international airport for Sydney? The answer must be categorically yes. Is there currently a viable alternative for Badgerys Creek? Again, the categorical answer to that is that there is no viable alternative. Can we afford to spend another decade on site selection processes to try to identify another location and to do yet another environmental impact statement? The answer to that must be no. All this means only one thing: we need to build a 24-hour international airport at Badgerys Creek, and we need to start building it now. Bridgewater High School",78
202,Mr QUICK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am delighted and very proud to rise tonight in this grievance debate to acknowledge a very special high school in my electorate, Bridgewater High School. Anker Fulsang, the acting principal, and his dedicated staff are working tirelessly to challenge the students at Bridgewater High School to go that little bit further. With this in mind, I and other guest speakers have taken part in an extension program for 20 students in years 9 and 10, who were set the challenge to write essays on their thoughts on Australia as it currently is, what directions it might take and their role in its future. Tonight, I am proud to have the winners, Shelley Jones and Kristy Cooper, along with their teacher, Fiona Comby, sitting in the gallery to hear their thoughts read into Hansard. Their school is very proud of them, their parents are very proud of them, and so am I. Shelley Jones's essay reads: Australia is known as home to many nationalities, for a life of freedom from oppression, for the luxurious scenery and for the great spirit of the blue Aussies. Many people from around the world see this country as the land of new opportunities and change in lifestyle. Opportunities exist for all people to share the benefits that arise from the quality of our achievements and ideas. Equal rights has been a controversial issue. People just don't seem to understand how easy and important it is to treat all men, women and children of all races and cultures with the same amount of dignity and respect that they would wish to be treated with. It should be our responsibility to take care of one another, helping all when help is needed. People should learn to respect one another's culture and religion. They don't seem to consider the fact that without other nationalities, Australia would be boring. So it's about time Australians stopped being narrow minded and one sided. People should also be learning to respect each other, accepting others for who they are, taking the time to see what they have to offer, not only contributing to individual growth and development but to the country as a whole. Australians should be realising the ability of tourism and trade to produce more money., This leads to the creation of more jobs. This means all Australians benefit from the freedom of choice to work and live in a wide open space comfortably. Australia is known as a democratic country. We have the right of freedom of speech and the right to live in peace. The problem that has developed over recent years is that there is a little too much freedom of speech. This is not giving people who come to Australia from other nations a chance to show what they have to offer. People who migrate sometimes get degraded to a lower level of humanity because of their colour, race and religion. Different groups have the right to live as they please, but in a country as large as ours tolerance is necessary. This should be known as a place which they can now call home. Many Australians wouldn't be able to handle being in a foreigner's shoes for a day. They couldn't imagine some of the pain and torture they go through each day of their lives. Australians couldn't imagine what it is or could be like to live in fear for their lives. Each day waking up, wondering when it will be their tum, whilst losing people around them for whom they care deeply. People of other ethnic backgrounds have the right to live in our country which should be known as the land of freedom for all humanity. Yes, Australia is very much a land of opportunity and freedom. All Australians whoever they are, should be sharing our glorious country. We have true plenty to share for all people. Instead of concentrating on all of the negatives of other cultures living in Australia we should be realising all of the positives such as business, trade, cultural richness and also tourism. These are just a few of the wonderful things that foreigners have to offer Australia. Many believe that God created all men equal. This unfortunately seems to be the one proposition some Australians are ignoring. Australians and new Australians have the right to live in peace and freedom no matter what their colour, race or religion. Kristy Cooper's essay reads: Australia is a great country, perhaps one of the best in the world. We are superb in a lot of ways, but we also have problems that bring us down. Unemployment is our biggest problem at the moment and needs to be solved quickly as it is a catalyst for other problems such as youth suicide and pollution. People need to realise that issues such as unemployment can be solved if federal, state and local governments plus' the community itself unite to work towards solving our major issues. If a problem is ignored for long enough it will not go away by itself, rather it needs help. As we enter the 21st century we will need to approach the unemployment problem, with assistance from government at all levels, the private sector and most importantly, the aid and assistance of the community. If the government were to give more financial incentives, that is, less payroll tax and a fairer way of dealing out the national wealth, it would go a long way towards helping the private sector make more positions available. Perhaps ideas such as of job sharing, earlier retirement or more part time type of employment could be investigated. The community would have to accept some of these new formats without referring to the ways that we have done things in the past. They would need to accept that we need to have shorter working days which would mean that we would have less money, but this would be only for short term, as there would be more persons working we would have fewer people to support on social welfare systems. Therefore the government could set up new ways to add financial support to those wishing to set up their own business, which is another way of getting people into the work force. Youth are the future of our country and we need to give them all the help we can. With these times of computers and technology based industries, secondary and tertiary schooling is vital. Government and private markets need to get together to assist with finding solutions. That will mean more money and the people and equipment needed to facilitate what our youth need. Not all of us want to be computer whizzes, doctors or scientists, therefore we need to be able to introduce our youth to the work place as soon II;s practical. It is lutely useless asking for a 16 year old to be experienced for a certain position, they need training. Maybe we could set up trade related schools rather than the old system of apprentices and trainees. These schools would be funded by the trades and manufacturers that require the labour and by the community, via the government through taxes, perhaps a goods and services tax. Through such things as these we could prevent the current waste of our future through youth suicide and other self destructive activities. If the youth of Australia had something that they could aim for and be sure of obtaining, not just something that they may get if they are lucky, then the need for such useless crutches as drugs and alcohol would be lessened, if not forgotten completely. When the youth of this great country of ours is used in a meaningful way, we would eradicate problems they, as an idle population cause, like vandalism, which costs all of us great sums of money. There always will be a litter problem but with more people working we could use some of these people to work out better ways for recycling, employ task forces to maintain and get better and/or cheaper ways of heating. If just some of these ideas work towards establishing more econornically viable solutions to the pollution problems, we could sell these ideas or systems to overseas markets, reducing our debt, increasing wealth and also increasing our chances of a longer existence on this planet. As a country we need to stick together to overcome our problems. It is absolutely useless if one of us comes up with an idea that will help it improve our situation, be it unemployment, social services, housing, poverty, youth suicide or pollution, if ten more of us sit around trying to put the idea down without even giving it a fair hearing. We also need to embark upon some new ideas to see if they will work. It seems useless to spend a million dollars on studies and commissions, when the idea may only cost ten thousand dollars to get up and running. If it doesn't work the Australian community have saved money, if it does work we all win: more employment; more money; and a greater standing in the eyes of the world. With more forethought and less arguing and fighting we could make this great nation of ours even greater than it is now. We all need to help each other out. Get rid of unemployment and we get rid of a large proportion of youth suicide. Protect our youth and they will protect our future. Community Values and Standards",80
203,Mr NEVILLE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In my grievance today I want to make an appeal to all levels of our society for leadership to protect our institutions and symbols, and to abso- send a clear and unambiguous message to our young people that, as a nation, we have standards and limits of behaviour. Daily in our media, frequently in this place and-I doubt if other members' experience is any different-not infrequently in our electorates we lament the loss of values and the direction of our youth. But I wonder if this is the fault of youth or if these three groups I have mentioned-the parliament in its leadership role, the media in its commentator's role or the community in its value system-are to blame for the mixed and inconsistent signals they send out to our youth. There is a great deal of debate raging in our community regarding drugs. On the one hand there are those who would strengthen surveillance and beef up our prison sentences while on the other hand there are those who propose heroin trials, shooting galleries, counselling and decriminalisation of certain drugs. Some might agree that the two concepts are not necessarily in conflict, but our young people are left with no sense of where the boundaries are and where our national vision for them might be in a drug free Australia. To the extent that the recent national illicit drug strategy outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) addressed those matters of education, research and the like, I very much commend it; but I feel the certainty of a wider national vision is necessary . We must, for the sake of our young, extend these matters well beyond prevention. The approach to the X-certificated videos leaves a lot to be desired. Sadly, this grubby trade has become part of the revenue base of the ACT and the Northern Territory. It raises $34 million a year for the two governments. While I am not an advocate of general censorship, I believe there need to be constraints and limits, especially in those sections of the media, be that print or electronic or film, that have demonstrated a lack of self-regulation. A public which has been promised the elimination of X-certificated material has the right to expect that it would be so and that this substandard trade in pornography would not be allowed to flourish under a mollified classification of non-violent erotica. The presumption is that, if you remove violence out of the equation, then somehow it is all right. That says nothing of the demeaning of women. It says nothing of the role the exposure of this type of erotica plays in sex crimes-a point clearly made by Canada's Fraser Commission on Pornography. It also says nothing of the fact that the retention of the NVE certificate gives this substandard sleaze the economies of scale to survive and push its tentacles out by way of postal services into other states. What message does this send to our kids about the standards being set for them by our society? We are currently involved in a debate on the future of our democracy as to what type of republic or monarchy we want. Let me take you back just a couple of years to the statue 'Down by the lake with Liz and Phil'. Another level of standards was assaulted, as much by indolence as by anything else. Young people must have wondered whether this was smart, artistic, offensive, debasing our institutions or whatever. There was no clear leadership or message from government. This none-too-exciting attempt at sculpture was a thinly veiled representation of our head of state and her consort in the nude. Hardly a great work of art, it was a great vehicle for ridicule. Whether one is a monarchist or a republican, it should not have eluded us that it was not the individuals who were being ridiculed but our own institutions. The sculpture stayed there for several days with various weirdos and vandals being attracted to it. I pose the question: what would have been the public's reaction and the government's action if, for argument's sake, the sculpture had depicted a nude head of state and spouse from one of our northern neighbours? I suspect there would have been outrage. It would have been removed in a matter of hours, there would have been a flurry of diplomatic activity, and profuse apologies to the country involved would have followed. Those heckling know this only too well. However, this is not the case for our own institutions; they are open season. I ask again: what sort of message does that send out to a younger generation groping for values? Let me turn to the Serrano photographic exhibition in the National Gallery of Victoria. It is one thing to take the mickey out of the pomposity of the clergy, as Dave Allen was wont to do in his TV programs, but it is totally different to depict the foremost symbol of Christianity in an immersion of urine. We have no established religion, quasi or otherwise in this country, nor would I advocate it for one moment. Yet it would be fair to say that many of our laws, our legislative procedures, the conduct of our universities and our military traditions all have their genesis in the Christian tradition or, more broadly, in the Judaeo-Christian tradition. While this should not be lorded over citizens who are atheist, humanist or from other religious traditions, it is entitled to be treated with equal respect. I ask for no more. I am sure the House will recall the unfortunate incident during the Gulf War in 1990 when sailors from the HMAS Success' in a of navy sanctioned video were shown in a lighthearted, if not insensitive, mock religious ceremony. This caused great offence to Arab nations and brought a swift response in the form of an apology from the navy. I have no argument with this. If a particular religion or tradition was offended, then an apology is appropriate. As a cartoonist from my area found to his surprise, he was chastised for stereotyping Jewish businessmen in a cartoon. Again, this is quite appropriate. To go further, we have rightly seen David Irving excluded from obtaining a visa to this country because we believe his views offend the Jewish people, in particular, and humanity at large in his false treatment of the holocaust. All these actions are seen as reasonable. They demonstrate to the young and old alike that there are constraints and limits to human behaviour when it grievously offends sections of our society. That makes the exhibition of the Serrano depiction of a crucifix in urine all the more incomprehensible. What could be more offensive to 70 per cent of our population, who profess Christianity as their belief system in a census, than such a photograph? What is worse, the National Gallery of Victoria is heavily subsidised from the public purse. It first vehemently defended this exhibition and then, after two acts of vandalism, closed it citing weakly the risk of harm or even fatality. What sort of director of any art gallery in Australia would allow his patrons to be even put in that position if he thought such a photograph would provoke such public and community reprehensible treatment? I seldom disagree with judges, but I have found Justice Harper's rejection of Archbishop Pell' s claim of blasphemous libel hard to reconcile. His contention was that there was no church-state relationship in Australia-as distinct from the English situationand that this removed the circumstance in which blasphemy could occur. I find that very hard to accept. I would have thought that the concept of blasphemy existed regardless of the church-state relationship. I find nothing more offensive than the prime symbol of the Christian religion being treated in a plainly profane and degrading way. Did our leaders speak out? Yes, they did. A premier spoke out to defend the gallery-would you believe it?-and the media went into a frenzy to try to justify it. Again I ask: what signal does this send out to our young who are searching for truth and certainty in our society? I was talking to a priest in my electorate the other day who had just come back from a pilgrimage. He said that he noticed a mood change in young people; that they had gone away from the idea that they had to be treated with warm and fuzzy concepts. He came back with a distinct feeling that young people were looking for certainty and the hard and historic truths of society and religion. They are not going to get them from the sort of mumbo jumbo that we have had here over recent times. I would like to conclude on something that I found very profound this morning at the national prayer breakfast in Charles Colson's address.

209,Mr WILLIAMS,LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL,"I move: That Senate amendments Nos. 2, 3, 23, 28, 35, 37,40 to 46,48 and 50 to 53 be agreed to. The Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 will implement the most significant reform of the delegated legislation process since Federation. It expands and enhances the parliament's supervision and control over legislative instruments. Successive governments have accepted the desirability of redressing the balance between the executive and the parliament to increase the role for parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation. The bill has had a long history. The first recommendation for such legislation was put forward in 1992 by a report of the Administrative Review Council under Professor Cheryl Saunders. Since that time there has been a very large measure of bipartisan support for the necessary reforms it proposes both withln this House and the Senate. However, as previously noted by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in the Main Committee on 11 September 1996, this is not a bill which could be described as sexy or as likely to excite public interest. Nonetheless, the bill is important. It matters and it will impact directlyon the machinery of government and the interaction between the citizen and the government. Members of this House do not need to be reminded that we live in an age where the volume of legislation passed by parliamentary processes continues to expand. The difficulty for the public is knowing exactly what laws apply to their circumstances. There is a pressing need to do something about the proliferation of subordinate legislation. This bill, while increasing accountability to parliament, will also dramatically improve the public's accessibility to the laws which apply t6 them. The bill has undergone significant reworking since it was first presented to the House il1 1994. It has been the subject of in-depth analysis by both House and Senate committees. It incorporates the commitments that the government made as part of our policy statements on law and justice and a new deal for small business. The bill contains a definition of legislative instrument which provides greater certainty as well as subjecting .a wide range of instruments to parliamentary scrutiny which have previously been exempt. The bill ensures that only instruments registered with the federal register of legislative instruments maintained by the Attorney-General's Department are enforceable. The bill requires mandatory consultation for instruments to ensure that delegated legislation is necessary and relevant. The bill provides for sunsetting of delegated legislation, the bill increases the power parliament to scrutinise subordinate legislation and the bill requires instruments to be lodged with the parliament within six sitting days, not the current 15 days, accompanied by an explanatory statement. The bill and the government's amendments contain some exemptions to the normal operation of the bill. I will deal with those exemptions when I come to move the government amendments. The amended bill which we propose to pass today is the version of the Legislative Instruments Bill which the government is ready and committed to implementing as soon as possible. Let me be very clear on this for the benefit of both the House and the Senate, which will shortly receive this a second time. The government is fully committed to the passage of these important reforms. The machinery to handle these new arrangements within the Public Service have been largely implemented. However, the government will not accept, and consequently nor will we implement, a modified form of the Legislative Instruments Bill which does not reflect the government's policy determination of what is the appropriate balance between the parliament and the executive. We recognise that other views will exist and subsequent governments may take a different opinion on what the balance should be. That is their right, but as the government we have the responsibility of implementing the legislation that we believe is necessary. We have carefully considered and determined what are the appropriate boundaries between parliament's right to scrutinise subordinate legislation and the executive's right to government. Our assessment as government of the day is that in our bill, with the amendments we move today, we have achieved the right balance. The government calls on the opposition to support the early passage of the bill, for which there is general acceptance of the importance of the reforms it offers.",88
210,Mr MEL HAM,LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL,"Banks) (6.04 p.m.)Unlike the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), I do not have a photographic memory. It is getting to the stage where I am starting of the to have nightmares over the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996. I can recall that I did head the House of Representatives committee in the last parliament on which the Attorney General (Mr Williams) was a member. Other members in this chamber were also members. We looked at this important legislation. As I said in the Main Committee, it is not sexy legislation but it is important legislation because it goes very much to the role of the executive and scrutiny by the parliament of executive action and regulatory action. It is a detailed and complicated bill and that is why there is a rider. I do not have a photographic memory and I cannot say that I am totally across the impact of some of these amendments, particularly the government amendments which will be moved later. It is a pity that we did not get more notice because I can indicate obviously in relation to these 18 amendments-there are 18 amendments that the government has accepted from the Senate-that we will be supporting those amendments because they were amendments that the Labor Party called for in the Senate with the other minor parties. One-third of the amendments-18 out of 54-have, been accepted by the government. Most of them are largely technical, and we think they improve the bill in any event. That is obviously why the government picks them up as well. We agreed to the procedure proposed by the Attorney-General earlier-that is, we will pick up the accepted amendments. Then there will be the other amendments that the government is not accepting and then there are fresh amendments. We did not get much notice of the fresh amendments. I will indicate at this stage that in relation to those amendments, the Labor Party will reserve its position until get through to the Senate. I am going through those amendments at the moment. I might be able to give an indicator, but Senator Bolkus will detail our position on those later. What worries me about what the Attorney has just said is that there is a suggestion if we insist on the other amendments that are to follow the government is going to hold the line on this. I think it is about time, with or without the subsequent amendments, this bill was passed. I can remember being in committees, and I can remember being in government, and saying that we were going to give it a start-up date of such and such. That date was deferred. We had a House of Representatives committee on the matter and the Senate has now looked at it. But I do not believe that the other amendments the government is not accepting are so fundamental that the government needs to insist upon rejecting them to the stage that we will have a double dissolution trigger or that 'It is all or nothing, we are only going to accept these 18 amendments'. I think some of the debate is at the margins. But I do welcome the fact that the government is accepting these 18 amendments. I would ask the Attorney and his office to liaise with the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus, before this bill goes back into the Senate. It may well be that we can reach agreement on some of these other amendments and we might be able to sort some of this out. But I do know-and I will talk about that in the next round of amendments-that some of the other amendments we do regard as fundamental. I support these amendments that the government is now moving. They are amendments that we helped originate in the Senate. We believe they do improve the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative.",89
211,Mr WILLIAMS,LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL,"I move: That Senate amendments Nos 1, 4 to 22, 24 to 27,29 to 34,36,38,39,47,49 and 54 be disagreed to. In the main, I suspect these amendments can be dealt with in broad terms. The principle issues that have arisen in the context of the they debate in the Senate have involved some issues that were known and raised at earlier stages, but others were just raised on the day. They seemed to have been generated from not only the Labor Party but also the Australian Democrats, the Greens and maybe even that Senator Harradine-I am not sure about him. There was no coordination in the work that was done by the opposition in the Senate. If somebody had a good idea, they moved an amendment and tried to persuade the opposition's support-and in many cases they did. . This is, I believe, a reprehensible process to be adopting in relation to a bill that has been developed over such a long period and which has been subject to such in-depth analysis.",90
212,Mr MELHAM,LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL,What about your amendments you are about to move? We have just got notice. of them.,90
213,Mr WILLIAMS,LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL,"The amendments that were moved by the government were the subject of careful consideration. The amendments proposed to be moved by the government in this House simply reflect those that were moved in the Senate and rejected by the Senate in the debate-a debate in relation to those amendments, I suggest, that took much the same form. In some respects, the amendments were moved with good intentions. In other respects, I would suggest that they were moved in ignorance of what was being sought to be achieved. The result really was a vandalistic approach. I do not propose to debate the individual amendments involved in the current motion one by one. There really are far too many of them. I suggest that the issues have been, to some extent, canvassed already in the Senate. The view of the government has been con-eyed in the Senate. I do not think there would be much point in delaying the House in the process of seeking to reject those amendments.",90
214,Mr MELHAM,LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL,"It is not often I defend the Senate, but I just say, in terms of the so-called vandalistic approach of the Senate in this instance, that part problem is that we are dealing with a complicated bill. I believe that those amendments that were moved by the minor parties in the Senate were moved in good faith. Again, we have this problem, even this evening, where the government is moving amendments and the first we heard of them was a short time ago. I am not saying they are not amendments moved in good faith. But I think on a lot of these issues you would not get to the stage where you might be moving things in ignorance if there was communication from both sides. The onus is on the government because the government needs to sit down and explain. The Legislative Instruments Bill has a long history. No-one can say that either side of the parliament has been trying to frustrate it. I know that the then opposition were attempting to be constructive. I know that a number of things have happened since we were in government. I know that a number of those amendments were moved because they might have reflected a position that we took as a parliamentary committee that was not totally picked up by the government. When I chaired the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, my duty was to the parliament and not to the executive. Often we brought down reports where the executive was not too happy. We did not just tum around and rubber-stamp legislation. I say to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) that I know he might be a little frustrated in relation to this. But I think between now and when it gets to the Senate, if you say that some of the amendments are ill-conceived, I suggest that a process be set up to talk to honourable senators before it hits the Senate next time. The trouble is that there is no trust on both sides of the House at the moment. That is just a matter of a fact; that is calling it as it is. This is not about this Attorney. This is an honourable Attorney; the trouble is he cannot get his submissions up in cabinet because he gets rolled all the time. So he has to run briefs that he does not necessarily agree with, and he does it to the best of his ability. In relation to these amendments that the of the government is now rejecting, this could become a repetitive debate. I do not have a photographic memory, so I concede that I am not fully across a lot of these amendments that were insisted upon by the Senate. But I say to the Attorney and his officers that Senator Bolkus, who has carriage of this matter in the Senate, and the other senators should be consulted before it goes back to the Senate. I fear that as a result of the Attorney's comments senators might, quite rightly, want to dig their heels in and say, 'We don't believe our amendments are vandalistic, and it's up to the government to prove that they shouldn't be pursued.' I just give that caution. I accept that the government has the numbers in the House of Representatives, so I will not be calling a division. I just put on the record that Senator Bolkus will continue to have carriage of these amendments in the Senate, and I suggest to the Attorney and his office that lines of communication be opened up between them and Senator Bolkus and other senators before these amendments hit the Senate. This debate did occur in the Senate. The Senate is not a chamber that will just rubber stamp government proposals. It is just like the situation with the native title bill. We know that the government is sitting on advice that it is in breach of its international obligations. Table the advice. Let us have some transparency. You say that these amendments do not improve the bill. If there is material that you can convince the opposition of, we will look at it on its merits. This is not an ideologically driven set of amendments. These amendments were moved in the Senate by all the minor parties in good faith. I do not believe it is a vandalistic approach. I do not believe in the approach that automatically the Senate or this House should just rubber stamp everything in the executive. I know that the Attorney-General's Department officers have a more generous view of some of the proposals than do Prime Minister and Cabinet, Treasury or some other departments. I know that this bill was a compromise that came out of cabinet discussions at the time. I know that Attorney General's took a more progressive role. (Time expired)",91
215,Mr WILLIAMS,LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL,"I want to reply briefly to some of the things that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has said. One of the problems with communicating with the opposition in relation to matters like this is that there is no communication in this House at all. When the bill was debated we did not know what the opposition, the Labor Party, position was on the bill. It is the regular practice of the Labor Party in this House simply to defer to the Senate and, in particular in matters affecting my portfolio, to whatever Senator Bolkus might do. If Senator Bolkus does not get his act together, we never know for the duration of a debate in this House what the Labor Party's position is. In fact, on this particular issue we did not know what the Labor Party position was even when the matter came on for debate in the Senate. The Labor Party, regrettably, simply does not have its act together, and Senator Bolkus in particular seems to be incapable of forming an opinion on a matter in relation to sensible proposals. I will give a couple of examples of the sort of vandalistic approach that I suggest has been adopted. Very extensive consideration was given by the House of Representatives committee in relation to the 1994 bill on the subject of sunsetting, and the unanimous report accepted what was proposed by the then government. Without reference to the government, the Labor Party eliminated the sunset provision. What is going to happen? We do not know what is going to happen because it was not dealt with by Senator Bolkus in the debate. It was simply a motion to delete the relevant provisions. Another provision that was deleted in the Senate was the exemption in relation to national schemes of legislation. There is no arrangement in place as between jurisdictions that would enable the operation of this bill t6 deal with national scheme legislation. But thqt did not stop the opposition in the Senate simply eliminating the exemption, leaving np machinery in place. That is vandalism and it is reprehensible. If the opposition wants to be taken seriously and to be communicated witp, that sort of approach must stop. Question resolved in the affirmative.",92

Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 19B At the end of subsection 7(6) Add "", not later than 7 days after the making of that determination"". These amendments are in fact simple replicas of amendments that were moved in the Senate and rejected. The purposes of the amendments are to provide an exemption from disallowance for legislative instruments other than regulations made under the provisions of parts 1, 2 or 9 of the Migration Act or of regulations made under that act. They are to continue the exemption from the act of instruments determining particular terms and conditions for persons employed in the public sector, members of the defence forces and members of the Australian Federal Police but at the same time preserve the present provisions for parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance for some instruments which are statutory rules. The amendments effect minor technical and drafting changes. The principal amendment is No.1 relating to the Migration Act. The amendment is to meet the government's policy objective of maintaining the status quo of no disallowance for a range of migration control instruments that might otherwise be disallowable as a consequence of the enactment of the bill, but it does not extend the range of instruments to which the exemption from disallowance applies. The other principal amendments are Nos 4, 5 and 6, relating to the public sector employ- the Senate. ees. Amendment No. 4 makes a number of drafting changes to remove unintended limitations to the range of instruments that are not legislative instruments for the purposes of the bill. It is to be noted that, although the making of such instruments does not require compliance with the provisions of the bill, the current requirements for tabling and disallowance of some such instruments under other legislation are respectively maintained by other amendments. Amendment No.5 is to replace section 58C of the Defence Act. The new provisions are designed to ensure that any determinations of terms and conditions made in respect of members of the defence forces are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance under the new section 46B of the Acts Interpretation Act to the same extent as currently applies to such instruments under the existing section 46A. In relation to amendment No.6, the first amendment is to effect the same type of change in respect of parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance of public sector determinations made under the Public Service Act as made by amendment No. 5 in respect of the Defence Act for the same reasons. The other amendment inserts provisions into the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 specifying that any determination made by the tribunal is to be provided to the minist-r within seven days of its making. This amendment will give effect to previous undertakings given to the Senate Standing Committee qn Regulations and Ordinances to make an appropriate amendment to the tribunal act ilt the earliest appropriate time. I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum.",92
217,Mr MELHAM,LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL,"I indicate quickly that the opposition will not divide on these amendments. If they were moved and rejected in the Senate, I anticipate that that debate will resume again in the Senate on these matters. These are not amendments that the opposition will be supporting at this stage. We will need to be convinced in the Senate. If we opposed them in the Senate, I anticipate we will oppose them again in the Senate. But we will not divide. I put that on the record. That debate will resume again in . Question resolved in the affirmative. Committee of Reasons Motion (by Mr Williams) agreed to: That Mr Slipper, Mr Hicks and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreeing to amendment Nos 1,4 to 22, 24 to 27, 29 to 34, 36, 38, 39, 47, 49 and 54 of the Senate.",94
218,Mr WILLIAMS,LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL,"On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendment Nos 1, 4 to 22, 24 to 27, 29 to 34, 36,38,39,47,49 and 54 of the Senate, I present the reasons, which have been circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsSenate Amendment Number 1 The amendment proposes the insertion of a definition of gender specific language for the purposes of Senate amendments numbers 5 and 25. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment because it is unnecessary. Since the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Clearer Commonwealth Law drafters have been ensuring that gender neutral language is used in all new provisions and any amendments of existing legislation. Senate Amendment Number 4 The amendment inserts an additional parliamentary mechanism for review of determinations by the - ttorney-General under clause 8 of the Bill as to whether a particular instrument would be legislative or not. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment as the determination by the Attorney-General is a legal opinion and the proper method for review of such a decision is the normal judicial review mechanism in the Federal Court. Senate Amendment Number 5, 22 and 25 This amendment adds an additional paragraph 17(3) requiring the Principal Legislative Counsel to ensure that legislative instruments are not drafted with gender specific language as defined by amendment number 1 unless there is a specific need to identify persons by their sex. Amendments numbers 22 and 25 make similar amendments to clauses 42 and 52 respectively of the Bill. The House of Representatives does not accept these amendments as they are unnecessary for the reasons explained for amendment number 1. Senate Amendments Numbers 6, 20 and 21 Amendment number 6 substitutes subparagraph 17(l)(a)(i) and extends the ambit of instruments to which the mandatory consultation processes of Part 3 of the Bill applies to nearly all legislative ments rather than restricting the process to instruments affecting business. Amendments numbers 20 and 21 make similar amendments to clause 34. The House of Representatives does not accept these amendments because the provisions of this Bill already impose quite onerous"" compliance requirements on rule-makers and it is considered that some experience with those requirements should be gained before consideration is given to extending the ambit of consultation. In its Report on the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs acknowledged that for such a requirement to be effective, it was crucial that it be accepted by all departments and agencies before it comes into force. Clause 72 of the Bill establishes a statutory review of the legislation and that review will consider the suitability of the ambit of consultation being extended. Senate Amendments Numbers 7-9,11,12 and 15 These amendments are consequential on amendment number 17 and as the House of Representatives does not accept that proposed amendment for the reasons set out below it cannot accept these proposed amendments. Senate Amendment Number 10 This amendment substitutes a new paragraph 21(2)(c) to specifically include environmental"" considerations in the statement of costs and benefits that a rule-maker must set out in a Legislative Instruments Proposal. The House does not accept this amendment Under Commonwealth environmental legislation there is a detailed consultation process on proposals affecting environmental·issues where the costs and benefits are relevant factors. The House of Representatives does not consider it necessary to duplicate those requirements. Senate Amendment Number 13 This amendment omits from paragraph 27(3)(h) references to sub-paragraphs 28(1)(a)(iv), (v), (vi), (vii) or (viii) as a consequence of amendment number 17 which significantly limits the circumstances in which compliance with the mandatory consultation requirements is not required. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment for the reasons set out in respect of amendment number 17. Senate Amendment Number 14 This amendment omits from paragraph 27(3)(j) a reference to paragraph 31(2)(b) as a consequence of amendment number 19 which omits subclause 31(2). The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment for the reasons set out in instrurespect of amendment number 19. Senate Amendment Number 16 This amendment omits from paragraph 27(4)(i) a reference to paragraph 31(2)(b) as a consequence of amendment number 19 which omits paragraph 31(2). The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment for the reasons set out in respect of amendment number 19. Senate Amendments Numbers 17 and 18 Amendment 17 substitutes a new clause 28 which significantly reduces the circumstances in which a rule-maker is not required to comply with the mandatory consultation requirements set in clauses 20 to 25 inclusive. Amendment 18 omits clause 30 and is a consequence of the restructured amendment number 17. The House of Representatives does not accept these amendments. The consultation regime in the original Bill was based upon the agreement between the States and Territories in the Council of Australian Governments in respect of consultation on a range of national schemes of legislation. To alter that approach in respect of legislative instruments under this Bill would result in confusion because there would be different consultation regimes applying to delegated instruments made in the States and Territories and, also, differences with consultation requirements in primary Commonwealth legislation. In addition, the significant effect that the removal of a large number of exemptions from consultation will mean that many instruments which are needed urgently will not be able to be made in time because of the requirement for compliance with the consultation regime. This could have a serious detrimental effect on the proper running of Government and could be adverse to the community at large. In particular, the removal of the exemption in respect of instruments which implement a budget decision that has already been made would be unnecessary and usually ineffective as consultation would not lead to a changed decision. The omission of clause 30 which enabled a rulemaker not to comply with the mandatory consultation requirements but had the effect that any such instrument would have a maximum life of only 12 months will bring an unnecessary and unwarranted burden to the making of instruments having a very short life. In anyone year there are a large number of such instruments. Senate Amendment Number 19 This amendment omits subclause 31(2) which provides that there is no need to comply with the mandatory consultation requirements if the enabling legislation providing for the making of the instrument contains a level of consultation comparable to that required under this Bill and the regulatory review body established by the Bill has so certified. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment. The House of Representatives considers that the Parliament having established a specific consultation regime for a particular area of interest, that regime should be able to continue where the general scheme under this Bill would not improve consultation. Senate Amendment Number 24 This amendment is consequential on amendment number 31 which removes the provision for the sunsetting of legislative instruments affected by the Bill. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment for the reasons set out in relation to amendment number 31. Senate Amendment Number 26 This amendment inserts new subclauses 61(IA) and (IB) to empower the Parliament to disallow a part of an instrument. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment. In its Report on the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs specifically considered this issue. The Committee noted the proposal that provision was being made for disallowance of a provision of a legislative instrument which would avoid having to disallow an entire instrument when only some of it was objectionable. The provision was drafted so that it would apply to some discrete and self-contained part of an instrument that can be severed quite neatly and stands alone. This House agrees with the Committee's views on this matter. Senate Amendment Number 27 This amendment omits subclause 61 (7) which exempts from disallowance legislative instruments made under enabling legislation to facilitate the operation of an inter-governmental body or scheme involving the Commonwealth and one or more States. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment. The House of Representatives acknowledges that inter-governmental schemes are becoming increasingly important to regulate particular forms of conduct or activity across jurisdictional boundaries. Such schemes require. legislation in each of the jurisdictions involved and that legislation is, of necessity, a compromise of the interests of all of the participants in the scheme. The effects of disallowance of instruments under such schemes, in any of the participating jurisdictions, would significantly impair the operation of the scheme. The House of Representatives is aware of the work being undertaken by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Chairs of Review Committees of the States and Territories to develop a basis for scrutiny of such schemes. The current proposal under consideration is that one jurisdiction would undertake the scrutiny function on behalf of all jurisdictions. However, that development is not yet at a sufficiently advanced stage to formulate specific proposals for consideration by Governments and until that occurs this particular exemption is necessary to avoid confusion. Clause 72 of the Bill establishes a statutory review of the legislation and that review can consider a proposal along the lines of amendment number 27 having regard to the further development of the proposals in this matter in the interim. Senate Amendment Number 29 This amendment omits references in paragraph 61(8)(b) to subsections 66(7) and (9) as a consequence of the omission of the sunsetting provisions in Part 6 of the Bill. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment for the reasons set out in amendment number 31. Senate Amendment Number 30 This amendment omits paragraph 61(8)(d) which provides for exemption from disallowance of Proclamations made under a number of provisions of the Quarantine Act 1908. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment because such Proclamations provide specific control mechanisms to prevent the entry into, and the spread of disease and pests affecting humans, animals and plants in, Australia. Typically the detailed conditions under which importation of a particular commodity from a particular country or region may be allowed are set out in protocols developed by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service within the scope of the relevant quarantine Proclamation. Each set of protocol conditions is developed on the basis of consideration of relevant scientific information and risk analysis. Quarantine Proclamations have never been subject to disallowance by the Parliament. This approach will continue, on the basis that it is not appropriate to task the legislature to consider whether to disallow such highly technical instruments. Remedies for alleged procedural defects in the making of these instruments are available under administrative law mechanisms. Senate Amendment Number 31 This amendment omits Part 6 from the Bill. Part 6 provides for the sunsetting of legislative instruments starting five years after the commencement of the Bill. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment. The House of Representatives notes that the issue of sunsetting was considered by the House of Representatives Standing Cominittee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in relation to the 1994 Bill and recommendation 23 of that Committee's Report was that a sunsetting regime be introduced in relation to all existing and future legislative instruments as soon as possible. The Committee also made a similar recommendation in its Report Clearer Commonwealth Law. Part 6 of the Bill implements the recommendations of the Committee and the House is satisfied with that regime. As with all other provisions of the Bill the statutory review of the legislation established by clause 72 will consider the operation of the Part. Further, an additional review of the Part is required, by clause 73, to be undertaken after the sunsetting regime has been in operation for 2 years. Any difficulties with the operation of the Part would be identified at that time and remedial action suggested. Senate Amendment Number 32 This amendment is consequential upon the omission of Part 6 of the Bill and provides an alternative to sunsetting to ensure that unnecessary delegated legislation is removed from the register. This would be done by each Minister reporting to the Parliament on a yearly basis on the review of delegated legislation in his portfolio responsibilities. For the reasons outlined in respect of amendment number 31 the House of Representatives does not accept this amendment. Senate Amendment Number 33 This amendment makes a drafting change to subclause 72(3) to replace the word 'chairman' with the word 'chair'. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment. Senate Amendment Number 34 This amendment omits paragraph 72(6)(c) as a consequence of amendment number 38. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment for the reasons explained for amendment number 38. Senate Amendment Number 36 This amendment is consequential on amendment number 31 and omits clause 73 of the Bill which provides for review of the operation of the sunsetting provisions of the Bill after five years. For the reasons stated for amendment number 31 the House of Representatives does not accept this amendment. Senate Amendment Number 38 This amendment omits item 14 from Schedule 1 of the Bill. This item provides that certain instruments relating to public sector terms and conditions of employment are not legislative instruments for the purposes of the Act. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment. The House notes that under the recent industrial relations reforms there will be greater flexibility for employers and employees to determine matters such as terms and conditions at the workplace level. The actions .of the Government in relation to its employees should mirror the policies and practices that the legislation requires of other employers. On that basis it would be inconsistent to subject determinations relating to public sector terms and conditions of employment to scrutiny under the Bill other than to the extent that such terms and conditions are presently subject to tabling and disallowance. Senate Amendment Number 39 Item 15 of Schedule 1 of the Bill provides that instruments made by a Tribunal to give effect to a decision by a Tribunal following a hearing process are not legislative instruments for the purposes of the Bill. This amendment would not apply that exemption to instruments made under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. The House of Representatives does not accept this amendment because there is no difference in principle between determinations made under the Remuneration Tribunal Act and decisions made under other hearing processes. Senate Amendments Numbers 47, 49 and 54 These amendments are consequential on amendment number 17 and as the House of Representatives does not accept that proposed amendment for the reasons set out above it cannot accept these proposed amendments. Motion (by Mr Williams) agreed to: That the committee's reasons be adopted. NA National Crime Authority Committee",94
219,Mr SERCOMBE,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the report of the committee entitled Security at the Adelaide office of the National Crime Authority in 1994. Ordered that the report be printed.",98
220,Mr SERCOMBE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I intend to be very brief, in the interests of progressing the business of the House and to give my committee colleague the member for Moore (Mr Filing) the opportunity to make slightly more detailed comments with respect to the particular circumstances that give the committee some concern. The summary of the document says: ,The purpose of this report tee, with the benefit of perfect hindsight, to be critical of the state of physical security in the NCA's Adelaide office prior to March 1994. It will properly be the role of the Coroner to examine the matter ... The Committee is reporting to the Parliament its concern about the failure of the NCA to provide it with a fully reliable explanation of the state of security prior to the bombing. Given its statutory role as the body that monitors and reviews the NCA on Parliament's behalf, the Committee was entitled to expect that the advice received from NCA in October 1996 was reliable. Committee members are embarrassed to now leam that advice which they had specifically sought ... was fundamentally flawed. The circumstances of the operation of the NCA are subject to some controversy. By and large, members of the committee actively support the National Crime Authority having the special powers that it needs to carry out its vital work on behalf of the Australian community. Part of the trade-off for those special powers conferred on the National Crime Authority is its accountability to this parliament and its accountability for the accuracy of the information it provides to the committee of this parliament that has been established to monitor it. I do not, as I said before, intend to go into the specifics. I will leave it to the member for Moore to outline briefly the specifics of where the committee is concerned that it was provided with inaccurate inforination. The Report facts are that it is important when occasions like this arise-particularly with an organisation that does have special powers on behalf of the community, special powers that extend beyond those available to a normal law enforcement agency-that, commensurate with those special powers, considerably higher standards of accountability are required to ensure that balances are preserved. That is why the committee on this occasion has come into the parliament to draw to the parliament's attention that it has had a situation where the advice it has received has been less than adequate. I simply refer, in conclusion, to the final point in the summary: The Parliament is informed that the Committee will be pursuing in detail with the Authority its explanation as to how this incident and such a gross misleading of the Committee could have is not for the Commitoccurred. I emphasise those words and put them into some context as to why the committee regards this matter as particularly serious.",98
221,Unknown,COMMITTEES,Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.,98
222,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report entitled Security at the Adelaide office of the National Crime Auththe ority in 1994, tabled on behalf of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, is provided to the parliament under subsection 55(1)(b) of the National Crime Authority Act, which places on the committee a duty to inform the parliament of any matter appertaining to the authority or connected with the performance of its functions to which, in the committee's opinion, the attention of parliament should be directed. At the outset, I would like to stress, as did the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), that this is not a report about the investigation of the bombing which took place at the NCA's offices in Adelaide in March 1994, which led to the tragic death of my former colleague Western Australian Detective Sergeant Geoffrey Bowen and the injuring of NCA lawyer Peter Wallis, who suffered the permanent loss of an eye. It is a report about the committee's expectations that, if it is able to effectively undertake its statutory duties, it should be able to rely on the advice of the NCA on matters of such importance as the level of security which was in place in the NCA's Adelaide offices at the time of the bombing. The report sets out advice it received from the NCA immediately after the bombing in 1994, in 1996 and, most recently, last month. The committee held a public hearing with the then NCA Chairperson, Tom Sherman, a little over one month after the bombing, essentially to seek answers to such critical questions as: how could such a thing happen at arguably Australia's prime organised crime-fighting organisation? What security measures were in place to protect the lives of NCA personnel from such threats? Were they considered adequate? At that time, the committee was reluctant to push the NCA too hard for answers, to avoid any suggestion of interference in the South Australian Police Service's investigations and any subsequent jury trial or coronial inquiry. There was also a concern that, if the poor state of the NCA security system were given wide broadcast, such information could be put to use by those with a grudge against the authority. Mr Sherman was frank in his admissions to the committee about the state of security in Adelaide, and he indicated that the incident had prompted considerably increased attention to be paid to physical security issues. He informed the committee that the level of security was in line with what prevailed in similar law enforcement bodies at the time, but which was now recognised as deficient. These relatively brief admissions met with the committee's acceptance at the time. The committee naturally expected early progress with the police investigation and an early prosecution. Now, three years later, and still no prosecution, we know better. The report outlines how last year the committee received information, from a source other than the NCA, that there were a number of security reports, both internal and by ASIO, which stressed that the NCA's security in Adelaide was deficient. The knowledge of to be those reports, and the lack of management action on them, was naturally a cause of concern for employees. The committee put a number of questions to the NCA and received the advice of current NCA Chairperson,· Mr John Broome, in October 1996. Mr Broome informed the committee that there had only been one report, which related to the consideration of x-ray screening equipment, which was not acted upon for size and cost reasons. However, after revelations in the Australian last month, in articles written by Jamie Walker, Mr Broome provided updated advice to the committee to the effect that there had been several protective security reviews undertaken in the years prior to the bombing. These indicated that the need for physical security improvements was well and truly recognised but, mainly for funding reasons, no purchases of better equipment were made. We are all wise after the event, and the committee is not seeking, with the benefit of perfect hindsight, to be critical of the state of security of the NCA's Adelaide offices. The intent of this report of the committee is to inform the parliament of the committee's concerns that it was given by the NCA less than reliable information, the accuracy of which it had relied on in subsequent dealings-and relied on by its members with constituents. The committee will pursue the issue with the NCA at an early opportunity to seek to establish what went wrong. These are the questions that require answers: did the chairperson of the NCA act solely on the advice of officers in the NCA's Adelaide office? If so, has he lost their confidence, or was there a simple oversight of relevant material during a period of high workload? Why did no-one notice the errors in the advice to the committee until the media reports? Have the budget cuts so lessened efficiency in the NCA's regional offices that there is now no institutional memory? More fundamentally, the incident demonstrates that, if the committee is to effectively perform the functions asked of it by the parliament, it must be able to access the NCA's confidential documentation, rather than having to rely on NCA advice. This issue has been a bone of contention with the NCA since the earliest days of the committee's operations, and it seems likely that only an amendment of the statute will put the matter beyond doubt. I would add to that by saying that, having been a member of the committee since 1990, I am well aware of the history of the relationdone ship between the committee, the NCA and the legislation that governs the committee's activities. Time after time the committee, in all its previous incarnations, has recommended to the then government that there ought to have been amendments to the NCA Act in order for the committee to be able to more effectively do its job. Unfortunately, that matter has been ignored by governments of both complexions. That, of course, has led to the situation in which we are today with this report being tabled which, in effect, says that, having relied on the word or the information provided by the NCA, the committee has found itself to be in a position where the information was deficient and ought to have been better and, to a large committee has been misled. This is a matter of serious in the exercise of its powers, there are a number of areas of scrutiny, the most prominent of which is the work of the committee as the oversight body responsible for overlooking the activities of the NCA. Given those extraordinary powers, it is incumbent on the NCA to be forthright, open and accountable to the committee, within the bounds of the NCA Act. On reflection, I believe that this report illuminates to the parliament the work of the committee, and I congratulate other members of the committee. This committee has gone to extraordinary lengths to try to act in the most move: forthright and rational way to ensure that the NCA does have that valuable oversight when exercising those extraordinary powers under its legislation. In the articles which appeared in the Australian on 11 October it was pointed out that there was no security of the car park where the NCA officers left their vehicles. I cannot for the life of me understand how this state of affairs came to pass. It is extraordinary, considering we are dealing with some of the most hardened, desperate and dangerous criminals in Australia, that the NCA officers were obliged to park their vehicles in unsecured car parks where, presumably, these criminals, their colleagues or accomplices could have had access to the vehicles and what they liked to damage them, alter them or placed devices in them that could have led to the death of the officers yoncerned. Obviously, with the benefit of hindsight it is easy to be clever. Nonetheless, there was a lack of security measures at the NCA Adelaide office. It was a matter of concern. The fact that we were given deficient information in the committee is a matter of more serious concern, something that I hope will be rectified. I hope that at the conclusion of our dealings with the NCA chairman we will have the fullest possible information with which to conclude our interest and our dealings in relation to what has been one of the most serious attacks on a law enforcement body in extent, the Australian history.",98

225,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Is the amendment seconded? Mr O'Connor-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,101
226,Mr LATHAM,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"My starting point with the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 is to argue for welfare state reform. My assessment is that the design features of the post-war welfare state have in many respects become moribund. There is a new set of issues on the political agenda, serious issues of entrenched economic and social exclusion, that require strong elements of welfare state reform. I am one of those on the left of centre who believe in thinking the unthinkable when it comes to the future of the welfare state. But, having said that, this legislation represents a poor way to reform welfare. This legislation breaches each of the principles by which welfare state reform should be guided. The welfare state needs reforming. We need to move from a residual system of income' support to whole-of-life support. We need to move from passive to active systems of welfare, active systems that empower citizens and develop skills and capabilities to deal with the challenges of a post-industrial society. We need to entrench a genuine two-way street of reciprocated responsibility, a system that encourages risk and rewards effort as well as providing those all important skills. This legislation is not the way to go about those tasks. This legislation is the worse possible example of welfare state reform in the 1990s. It makes two fundamental errors that cast this legislation as a poor piece of public policy. The first is that it tries to defy diversity. One of the problems of the design of the post-welfare state has been that it has been based on the principle that one size fits all, that government is able to plan and provide for all citizens as if their needs were identical. That has been one of the historic failings of the welfare state as our society has become so much more diverse. This legislation tries to treat all 18to 20year-olds as if their relationship with their parents was identical. The Minister for Social in the Security, Jocelyn Newman, in announcing this provision somewhat reminded me of someone who is recalling the circumstances of the Brady Bunch family-that every family in Australia would be happy, would be embracing solidarity and would have sound financial circumstances and constant contact between parents and their children. That is not the reality in Australia. As much as those who engage in acts of social engineering and who want to wind the clock back to the 1950s and 1960s might hope it would be otherwise, it is not the case. The prospects of this parliament redesigning the family unit in Australia are absolutely remote. There is no way back to the family unit of the 1950s and 1960s. There is only the way of government catering for and accommodating diversity. Government can no longer plan for a single family type and its needs in Australian society. Government needs to cater for and accommodate diversity. Diverse family arrangements are very much the reality in Australia in the current era, and will grow. If you look at all the statistical evidence, all the census material about the changing nature of family types in Australia, diversity is not only here; diversity is growing. There is no one single family type. There is no Brady Bunch model that the government can plan and provide for in Australia in the current circumstances. So to commence the parental means testing of unemployment benefits for 18to 20-year-olds is a foolish measure which tries to take welfare principles back to the idea of one size fits all. One size no longer fits all when it comes to the diversity of Australian family types. Government needs to move into the enterprise of customising its support, to identify individual needs, to find the flexible systems of public provision which allow customisation to take place. So Senator Newman, as with so many other members of the coalition, lives in a fool's paradise, the fool's paradise of thinking that every Australian family is like the Brady Bunch-they all dine together every night, they talk together, they share their money around, they look after each other in every conceivable circumstance. Some families are like that, and I wish them well; I grew up in one. But I also recognise that other families go through all sorts of social stress and pressures where, against their strongest emotions and most positive feelings, they cannot hold that unit together. The government needs to recognise the diversity of those families in those circumstances and to customise its systems of income and social support to cater for such diversity. This measure of parental means testing of unemployment benefits for 18-to 20-year-olds will cause untold hardship around Australia. It will force people back into circumstances from which they hoped to depart. It will force families into circumstances which are not of their free choosing. Why does the Liberal Party, a party that once had small '1' Liberal values where people had the right to choose their own circumstances in life, eng!l ce in these acts social engineering? Why impose your own values upon all other citizens? Why not have the decency and the liberty in our society to allow people at the age of 18 to 20 years old to make choices that, in other circumstances, government would allow them to make? These are young Australians who in some circumstances go to fight in wars. They are young Australians who are expected to take the responsibility of voting and who are treated under the laws of this land as adults. But they are not, under this provision, young Australians who have the freedom to achieve and choose their own circumstances in the relationship that they have with their parents if they are unfortunate enough to be unemployed. This is a regrettable piece of legislation for that reason alone. Beyond that, there is a second breach of the sound principles of welfare state reform. This legislation is taking away a form of income support without substituting other forms of social opportunity. And that is a fundamental breach of sound welfare reform. We should not be taking away support without creating new opportunities. I had an interesting reminder of this and also of the folly of slogans in politics when the Prime Minister (Mr' Howard) in question time was talking about mutual obligations. This is a Prime Minister who has no history but who is fairly intent on trying to lay claim to a concept 'reciprocated responsibility' which in Australian public policy started in Working Nation in 1994. Since then it has been developed in the United States, Britain and elsewhere. It is a long way round for John Howard to think that he has invented this concept. Be that as it may, the concept itself deserves serious scrutiny-not the sort of scrutiny it received from Glenn Milne in the Australian article this morning, which· the Prime Minister was happy to quote. From time to time Glenn Milne is remarkably well informed, but this is not one of those occasions. It is a poorly informed piece which essentially takes a slogan 'mutual obligation' and does not look under the surface or scratch around and examine the sorts of mutual obligations and systems of public policy that of might flow from it. There is one reality in public life, and that is slogans never make for good policy, for good journalism or for good public policy analysis. You need to understand that there are many forms of mutual obligation that government might apply. In my understanding of these issues I would try to define a negative form of mutual obligation and a positive form. The negative, of course, is the coalition way of taking away social support without replacing it with social opportunity. That is what this government is doing in this legislation for 16and 17-year-olds-taking away the unemployment benefit without replacing it with an expansion of the education and training system. It is taking away support without replacing it with opportunity. That is the negative path of the coalition in its reform of welfare and its understanding of mutual obligation. I ask the basic question: where is the mutuality in government saying to young people, 'I'm taking something away from you'? That is not a mutual exchange. There is no reciprocation in that. That is government exercising the worse form of coercion and authority in welfare reform that could possibly be exercised. It is not a mutual obligation for government to tell people what to do. This is why the Labor Party's positive sense of mutual obligation is so important. It says that the mutuality lies in government taking away a benefit and replacing it with opportunity. The mutuality comes from government in this instance trying to minimise the number of young Australians on unemployment benefit and move them into the benefits of education and training to deliver the skills of lifelong learning and opportunity. That is the difference. This is more than a slogan 'mutual obligation' that can be bandied around this chamber and elsewhere. It is a serious item of public policy that deserves serious analysis. And a serious journalist would conclude that there is a vast difference between the coalition and the Labor Party on this particular question-the negative obligations imposed by the coercive powers of the coalition government as opposed to the Labor Party's positive path of building opportunity as a substitute for transfer payments. Our positive sense of responsibility was perfectly reflected in Working Nation. That was not a program that decided to take away benefits from Australians without at the same time replacing them with a raft of labour market programs and opportunities for education and training. That is the difference. This legislation is to be condemned for its failure to create any worthwhile form of opportunity as a substitute for the abolition of the unemployment benefits for 16and 17-year-olds. This is a government that has reduced university grants by $840 million and abolished some 21,000 growth places around the Australian university sector. This is a government that has cut TAPE funding by $250 million and each year 60,000 Australians are missing out on a TAPE course-equivalent to half the people in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, missing out on their entry to a TAPE course. It is also a government that has made a $270 million cut to government schools through the enrolment benchmark adjustment and a further $400 million cut indirectly through the Commonwealth's reduction of financial assistance grants to the states and territories. So how can this government for one moment pretend that it is broadening the horizons of lifelong learning? How can this government possibly pretend that for all those young Australians taken off the unemployment benefit there is a viable alternative being created in education and training? If the figures from the budget documents are not stark enough, then I present to the parliament the advice the government itself has received from its own department. Earlier this year, before his coup d'etat on Senator Vanstone, the then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, presented to toe cabinet a departmental document that set out the information as follows: The increase in retention rates will impact particularly in the government school systems. Students who remain at school as a result of the YA are likely to have characteristics similar to those students currently considered to be 'at risk' of leaving school early ie: low levels of school achievement due to low literacy levels, family dislocation, itinerancy, violence or abuse, poverty, homeiessness, truancy or substance abuse. To make, schooling more relevant for these students, maintain their motivation and engage them in learning while minimising any disruption they may cause to other students, school authorities will need to expand the provision of VET in schools, involve industry in its delivery and develop specific programmes. The departmental submission went on to conclude that some 27,000 young Australians would be forced back into the schools system because of this measure before the parliament, and this would make it incumbent upon the Commonwealth to provide funding of the order of $140 million to the states and territories. Not only is the government failing to do that, it is wilfully negligent in its duties. The government made the decision to go ahead with the common youth allowance knowing that these would be the consequences. This was material that was before the Howard cabinet prior to its decision to move forward with a common youth allowance. So the government is not only taking away opportunity and not only failing in the sound principles of welfare reform, it is doing it in a wilful fashion. It is happy to allow the states and territories to pick up the tab for this particular measure. What does that mean in the schools sector, particularly the government schools of the states and territories? For every young Australian student studying hard right now, for every young Australian student sitting down at their desk doing their homework studying for an exam that might just be coming up, what they will get next year is fewer resources. This government is willing to see an extra 27,000 students-students who require higher unit expenditure in education-come back into the school system and is not willing to provide one extra cent for that purpose. So all those students working and studying hard now will get less, because the only way in which the states and territories can cope with this measure next year-they are the ones who will have to find the $140 million-is to take it out of existing programs. They will have to take it out of vocational education programs in the electorate of Longman and take it out of literacy programs in the electorate of Braddon, take it out of all the other school programs that are needed in every single electorate in every single part of the country. That will be the reality in 1998 because of this measure's enactment. It is not only the loss of resources; one also has to ask this question: if we don't provide the teachers and we won't provide the schools with the extra resources needed to cope with these special needs as students come back into the system, will there be disruption in the classroom? I think every educationist would tell you that that is likely. It is likely not because these are necessarily bad people coming back into the school system but because they have special needs-special needs identified in the government's own departmental submission. Ms Macklin-They would rather not be there.",101
227,Mr LATHAM,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As the member for Jagajaga points out, they would rather not be there. That is the element of choice; they would rather not be there. For schools to cope with students who would rather not be there takes a special effort and special programs. At risk students require special programs and· resourcing; the sorts of initiatives that in many areas the government has cut out. The sort of initiative that the former government had up and running was the STAR program. This government, in its manic determination to make education and training the No. 1 target for so-called fiscal consolidation, has cut this sort of program away. The impact of this measure will not be even around the country. It will be the weakest neighbourhoods with the highest unemployment which feel the greatest impact. It will be schools like those in Mount Druitt, and Campbelltown in my own electorate, that will have the concentration of students coming back into the school system. Of course, there are newspaper front pages this morning pointing out the spatial disparity in rates of unemployment around Australia. Unemployment is not evenly spread geographically. Some areas have a very high concentration of youth unemployment in particular. Those areas and their neighbourhood government school will struggle more than most to cope. Let me just provide some of the statistics from my own state of New South Wales. In Mount Druitt, in the electorate of Chifley, there are 282 16and 17-year-olds who will be forced back to school because of this measure. They are presently unemployed. In my own electorate of Werriwa, in the suburb of Campbelltown there are 226 such students. Let us go to the North Shore of Sydney. In my absence recently I think the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) was crying poor about these things: 'Don't beat up on the North Shore; we have the begging bowl out as much as anyone else.' In the suburb of Manly in the electorate of Warringah there are three unemployed 16and 17-year-olds who would be forced back into school; in Cammeray, one; in Killara, in the electorate of Bradfield on the North Shore, one. This is such an uneven spread that one really does start to wonder how a high school in Campbelltown or Mount Druitt in the western suburbs of Sydney is going to cope. It is bad enough not to have the resources allocated by the Commonwealth, it is bad enough for teachers to have to cope with students who would rather not be there; but the concentration is enormous. Two hundred and eighty students in Mount Druitt is the equivalent of half a new high school. So where is the money coming from? Where is the commitment by the federal government to back up this common youth allowance with the education resources that provide learning opportunities? Ms Macklin-There is none.",104
228,Mr LATHAM,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"There is no commitmentjust cut after cut after education cut. What should we be doing? What we should be doing as a parliament and as a nation is to embrace Labor's positive path. With its positive sense of mutual obligation, Labor would be expanding education. Our historic task, whether it be the Whitlam, Hawke or Keating governments in the great continuum of Labor governance, is all about education expansion; it is all about broadening out opportunities through the power of lifelong learning. That is the record that we would be continuing in the next Beazley Labor government. That is our historic charter. It is needed in Australia more than ever. But not only do we need expansion and the historic broadening project in education but also, as I mentioned earlier, we need to cater for diversity. It is an interesting thing that, people talk about the sorts of changes our society has been through in recent decades, most of the focus comes onto the economic. You would find that in most of the debates in the parliament as people talk about the movement from an industrial base of economic activity to post-industrial or information age. But I have been looking at some material recently that has argued, I think persuasively, that many of the changes are as much social as economic. Some authors are talking about the movement from a traditional society to post-traditionalism. I think it makes sense. I think back to my own time growing up in the 1960s and 1970s. Young people in those postwar decades had most of their choices in life determined for them by the traditions of the family unit, community and society. The choices were fairly well pinned down to the fact that women would not necessarily work; they would raise children in the home. A young male would probably aspire to the career path that his father held. Those are the sorts of traditions which society at that time embraced. But they are traditions now long past. They are traditions that are no more likely to return to Australia than the six o'clock swill or the FJ Holden. They are traditions that are part of an era gone by. For whatever reason, whether it is technological change, the power of education or changes in the values and attitudes in society, we need to recognise that we have moved very much into this post-traditional era. Young Australian adolescents going through those sensitive years have a smorgasbord of choices ahead of them in life; not necessarily traditions which narrow and guide their path but all the choices that arise-from the information highway to the whole vast range of career opportunities they might pursue. This, of course, is one of the great causes of youth distress and problems in Australia, because in those sensitive years it is not always easy to cope with this smorgasbord of choices. What positive role can government play in assisting that process? You can help people cope with change. You can help people learn and be educated to take their best choice in as life, which is not necessarily learning off the curriculum or from a vocation but is often learning about life and for life. That has got to be the role of government in assisting young Australians to cope with this posttraditional era of choice. It is very important to not only broaden education opportunities but cater for diversity. As I mentioned, not every school curriculum will fit all sizes. Not every school will be able to cater for the whole range of choices, values and inclinations that young Australians might hold. I know you involve yourself in these issues as well, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, and one of the interesting things I have found in my seven months as shadow minister with the responsibility for youth affairs is the immense, rich and enjoyable diversity of young Australians. Some of them are 13 going on 23 while others are 18 and just out of nappies-with all the different values, moralities and aspirations that you might find in our pluralistic society. We should not think for a moment that the education system we constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, the so-called comprehensive education system, can possibly cater for all that diversity. I believe there is a role for fundamentally rethinking many of the policies and programs we have in place for secondary schooling. It is often said that the major issues in schooling are literacy and numeracy in the primary school years. They are absolutely critical. My suspicion is that the sleeping issue in education is in the secondary schools with the 13to 16-year-olds who find themselves alienated from the formal school learning environment. Educationalists tell me that more males than females go through this experience, drop out of school and become the youth problem headline of tomorrow. We need to think about that difficulty and start catering for those diverse learning needs. I am a great believer in setting a goal in public policy for secondary schools; that by catering for diversity every young Australian adolescent would be able to continue to engage in a positive learning experience. It might not be from the academic curriculum and it might not even be vocational. It might be in the creative arts, it might be something with their hands or it might be something that people of my generation have not even thought of. But we should be catering for those diverse youth needs and learning inclinations. There is no general theory of learning in our society. There are many forms of intelligence and they express themselves in varied ways. The important thing is that if 13to year-olds can engage themselves in a positive learning experience, they will value learning. They will want to continue a lifelong experience of learning in order to skill themselves up as much as possible. Last week I had an excellent example of what this might mean in practice when I visited the Launceston Student Workshop in the electorate of Bass. It is a traditional manufacturing work environment where 14and 15-year-old students-mostly males, but a couple of females-work in a.very practical fashion. They do one week there, developing· their practical skills, and one week back in the school. They are enriched by the experience. They are doing things in metal fabrication and woodwork that I would find beyond my horizons. My form of intelligence is different to theirs but I valued very much the excellence and passion that they brought to their work. I think it is a great example of how we should regard the school these days-as a hub of resources for traditional forms of learning with a whole series of learning and work experiences running off the hub to cater for diversity in learning inclination. We should have a student workshop of that nature in every town and suburb. We should have a creative area for the arts and multimedia, if that is what it takes. Let us cater for diversity as much as possible and totally rethink the attitudes that were brought to bear with the development of so-called comprehensive schooling. The Labor way is to create opportunity, not just by broadening but by accommodating this all-important theme of social and learning diversity. Labor acknowledges that in the new economy there are few, if any, jobs available for unskilled teenagers. For this reason it is highly undesirable, both for society and for the recipients themselves, to have young Australians on unemployment benefits when they should be realising the benefits of education and training. Labor wants to see young Australians off welfare but not in the way being proposed by the government with its common youth allowance. To abolish unemployment benefits 16for 16and 17-year-olds while slashing educational opportunities is the wrong way to reform the welfare state. This is the negative approach of a government more concerned with winding back the role of government than creating new opportunities through the possibilities of education and training. Labor's approach reflects a positive commitment to the principles of reciprocal responsibility. That is the role of young Australians in making best use of the opportunities available to them in education and employment while also ensuring the government provides the essential public services that the private sector alone will not provide or maintain. This is why the ALP is determined to broaden the availability and range of opportunities in education and training, particularly for teenagers. While the Howard government has quarantined some parts of the Commonwealth budget from funding cuts, it has made education and training the major part of its fiscal consolidation program. The ALP's priorities could not be more different. Our first priority will be to invest in the skills and insights of the Australian people. Our starting point will be to ensure that beyond the mandatory years of education, and even before, all young Australians have a suitable range of education and training options available to them. I tum now to the nature of some of the funding cuts which will be relevant with the implementation of the common youth allowance. I am always a little curious when I hear the minister for education, Dr Kemp, telling the parliament and other forums that it is not necessary to worry about the 40 per cent of young Australians who aspire to a university education. Normally in public life 40 per cent is a pretty decent share of society and its interests. I know the reason why Dr Kemp says that. He probably gets the same research information that the Labor Party gets about the damage the government has brought to bear with its university funding cuts, so I know why Dr Kemp would love to hear the Labor Party talk of nothing but non-university education. That is not going to happen but, just the same, Dr Kemp needs to be brought to account in terms of his own record when it comes to TAFE and VET funding. He is a bit like the Prime Minister because he has no history. The minister comes to the parliament trying to position himself and parade himself as a broadener in education. I have gone to the trouble of checking his form, and I say: judge him by his deeds, not his words. It is interesting to look at the pattern of Commonwealth outlays on vocational education when Dr Kemp was the head of Malcolm Fraser's prime ministerial office, between 1979 and 1982, in 1989-90 prices. They fell from $422 million dollars to $398 million. He was there, the head of the Prime Minister's office, slashing the Commonwealth contribution to vocational education and training. And he is at it again. He is .the minister with responsibility, since the last election, for a $250 million funding cut for TAFE. There are 60,000 young Australians who cannot find places. So he has got a real hide to talk about broadening access in areas where, under Fraser and under Howard, he has been the main slasher. He has been the Slasher Jack of education and training for young Australians. Compare that to the record of the Hawke and Keating governments. On the same lists of funding in those 1989-90 prices, when the Hawke government was elected in 1983, $414 million was spent on VET. When it lost the last election, in 1996, that figure had almost doubled to $717 million. So our record, in judging us by our deeds and not by our words, is firm. It is rock solid and diametrically opposed to Dr Kemp's record of cuts not once but twice-the great Slasher Jack of VET funding under Fraser and then Howard. Those things need to be placed on the record, as does the Labor Party' awesome concern about the provisions of this bill. I have tried to address the education and training consequences and set out Labor's positive alternative. I look forward to the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), my colleague, addressing some of the social welfare implications and some of the social distress that will be caused by this provision. I would certainly recommend to the House the amendment that has been moved on behalf of the Labor Party.",105
229,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Longman) (8.40 p.m.)Before I get into the detail of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill, I think it is worth having a bit of a look at what the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is promoting here as far as the amendment is concerned. He says, 'Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading'in other words, let us agree to give it support-'what we want to do is condemn the government for those points for which we want to draw a line in the sand.' This amendment is quite pitiful. It 'condemns the government for withdrawing support for 18to 20-year-olds in families with an income as low as $23,400 per annum' - that is just not the case; once again you have totally misrepresented it right from the start-and for 'abolishing payments for 16to 17-year-olds while also slashing education funding, labour market assistance and job opportunities'. Once again that is not correct. If you happened look at the paper last week you would have found that 20 per cent of companies in Australia believe they are going to employ in the next 12 months, which is the highest rate for three years. What was it again? You oversaw an unemployment rate of 11 per cent. Ms Macklin-Not 16and 17-year-olds.",107
230,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The member for Jagajaga interjects. We can always get a loud noise out of the member for Jagajaga. That is about all you are good for. When it comes down to substance you are deathly quiet. You spent $2.7 million in your last year in upgrading nursing homes, and then you bleat when we tried to do something about it. You are going to get up here with another scare campaign, run around and take responsibility off the individual that is supposed to hold that responsibility because you do not have any answers. That is the bottom line. As soon as you are challenged you go quiet. You said we are 'abolishing payments for 16and 17-year-olds'. That is not the case. The member for Werriwa stated that we were going to 'force back into school' young people who could not get a job. Is this not a Labor Party that talks about trying to give job opportunities and education to young people? I put it to you: if you cannot find a job then perhaps there is something wrong with either your level of education or your training to enable you to fit into the job market. Therefore, forcing these young people back into school, as he puts it, would seem to me to be quite a reasonable proposal. We are saying to people, 'If you do not have the skills that work force requires then let us do something about assisting you to get them. The safeguards are there. If there are no positions available in the school or if there are no positions available in traineeships or any other form of education or training then there is financial support available to you.' But let us not let the facts get in the way of what I am sure will become another one of your scaremongering stories. This is available and it is available in the electorate of Longman. The member for Werriwa quite wrongly points out that, because I was sitting in the chamber at the time· listening to his diatribe, Longman was going to be one of those areas where there were not going to be sufficient opportunities. Through the activities of this federal government and the business community and the schools, we have put together one of the most innovative programs in this country: it is called the CASILS-Caboolture Area Schools Industry Link Scheme. I am hopeful that, in the next few days, ANTA will announce $400,000 for a unique program to mount six schools in a cluster to provide the students not only from those six schools-Deception Bay, St Columban's, Morayfield, Tullawong, Bribie· Island and Caboolture-but also from other schools, maybe even interstate but certainly within Queensland, to access and immerse in technology which is going to take them into the next century. This is going to be available through funding that has been made available by this government to a community that wants to assist its young people. This piece of legislation is about mutual obligation. In recent days we have heard the term 'reciprocal responsibility' mouthed by those in opposition. When you marry that statement with this amendment you see that what they are trying to do is get the best of both worlds. Let us tell the people out there that we are telling young people-as we say on the front of the Bulletin this week-who want the dole and who want to make the best of it while the rest of us pay that, yes, we want to make them responsible. Let us tell Australia that the Labor Party has a bit of responsibility at last. But, at the same time, let us show that the flip card is, 'No, we do not believe the individual can be responsible or that the family can be responsible.' The member for Werriwa stated that there is a myriad of opportunities and different family situations. That is exactly what this piece of legislation suggests. We do not believe that a family that has a young person who is unemployed should be treated totally differently from one that is trying to put young family member into an educational training situation. Obviously those opposite, and the member for Jagajaga in particular, believe that should be the case. They believe it is better to see someone sit unemployed without skills, without training and without education and give them financial support in order to do that rather than give them some extra resources to better themselves. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is a fallacy and it is extreme foolishness. On the one hand, they promoted the fact that we were getting a much greater level of education in Australia, that we had more students attending through to year 12. That was very commendable and the previous government should be congratulated for it. I have no problems with that. However, when you have the member for Werriwa saying that we are going to force young people back into school, you really have to question their credibility. You have to question whether or not they really believe this or whether it is rhetoric which they are starting to mouth. I am quite sure, and it has been proven, that a young person's opportunities are enhanced if they spend an additional two years in education or training. I would like to explore that for a minute. This is not saying to young people, 'The school system failed you. You didn't do very well and you weren't going on to university; you weren't going to be one of the 30 per cent. Get back into school. Get in there and listen and read your school books because that is what is best for you.' That is not what we are saying at all. We are opening up opportunities in vocational education, through such things that CASILS is operating in my electorate of Longman, where young people can spend one day a week in the work force and four days a week in school or can do a traineeship or any other form of training which could lead to work and which is going to better equip them to get into the work force. Those opposite are telling us that that is not right. They are telling us, 'Let the person stay unemployed,' or, better still, 'Put them onto one of our mickey mouse training courses that we had in place in our last years of government.' their Some $2 billion was spent, and what did it attribute to the working part of Australia? Very little. Mr O'Connor-Ask the kids who got jobs.",108
231,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Yes, ask the people who got jobs. And for how many of them did you build up their hopes and then pull the carpet out from under them, all in the form of expediencies? What we are trying to do is target the taxpayer's dollar so that it is best used and so that when it is spent people actually have jobs at the end of it. There are jobs. One thousand young people could have started apprenticeships. Mr O'Connor-Unemployme.nt has gone up under you.",109
232,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Excuse me, it went up under us? I remind you that it was 11 per cent. There were over one million people unemployed and now there are 770,000. Perhaps you are one of the people who Dr Kemp talks about when he refers to literacy and numeracy. The last time. I looked 770,000 was a heck of a lot less than one million-plus, which is what you added to the unemployment levels. When you start to get that basic fundamental right, you will start to understand why you were rejected at the last election. Mr O'Connor-Look at what your Prime Minister left us with.",109
233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Order! The member for Corio will have his opportunity to contribute to the debate.,109
234,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Another point that the member for Werriwa made was that of the post-traditional age. That is a good term: 'post-traditional age'. When did the tradition of families looking after their own disappear? I will tell you what: it has not disappeared in my house and I hope that it has not disappeared in most Australian homes. People, first and foremost, must be responsible for their own actions. If we move away from that basic fundamental, then we will become a socialist state. We know where the member for Jagajaga stands on that account: she has no qualms in talking about being a committed socialist. In that case, let the state provide. But that is certainly not the way that I believe things should be or that we on this side believe things should be. This social security system should be about providing for those people that the individual, the family and wider society are unable to assist. Then the government steps in, and this measure allows that. Let us look a little more at students and what is available for them. One of the anomalies under the previous system was that you could have a family on relatively low incomes who, when you worked out the figures under Austudy, could get up to $999. But, because they did not break that magical figure of $1,000 which Labor had put in place, they did not get a cent. So $20 a week to a battling family which was trying to send a student to university was told that it did not get it, it was just too bad. That $20 might well have been the difference between that student going to university, moving out of the style of life that they may have been accustomed to and going further up the pecking order, which is what education is supposed to be about: providing opportunities not only for the individual but also for the nation. We have now made that available. If you are able to access as little as $1 of what would have been Austudy under youth allowance and you are studying, you now have rental assistance available to you. For young people in regional Australia-and we are not talking about the back of Bourke; we are talking about people in my electorate at Esk who have to travel two hours to get to the closest university which is 100 kilometres away-being able to access rental assistance will enable them to better themselves and improve their lot in life. Surely that is what we as a government should be about. With those opposite, it was not as though they did not have rental allowance available for people. They did. But for whom was it available? Young unemployed people who we heard on several occasions had three, four, five and six people in one household-all sharing one accommodation bill and all receiving rental allowance. I do not despise them, I do not feel it is wrong that they should have some sort of financial assistance when it is needed if they are homeless, but how can you discriminate against young people who are trying to be educated? You are supposed to stand up for social righteousness. That is exactly what you did, and you continue to do so with your actions on this bill. It is time that you woke up to yourselves and realised that young people who are trying to better themselves deserve a better go than you were providing for them. This youth allowance bill will do just that. One of the criticisms levelled by the opposition is that we are withdrawing support for 18-to 20-year-olds in families with incomes as low as $23,400 per annum. If you were a young student and you were earning above $23,400, under the Labor Party what did you get? You know very well that what we have done here is bring into line both an unemployed person and a young student so that one is not discriminated over the other, so that no-one is better than the other, so that there is no class system because someone is studying and someone is unemployed. But that is what you wish to promote. You in the opposition call on the government to introduce education. Correct me if I am wrong-please feel free to do so-but I believe that every university place in Australia was oversubscribed this year. Am I correct? I am quite sure that I am. I note that you deliberately decide not to answer that every university place was actually oversubscribed. Where is the lack of education? Where is the lack of places? The member for Werriwa talks about the figure of 40 per cent, or whatever he quoted. The fact is that about 30 per cent of young Australians will go on to university. Yes, we think it is great that they do, but let's not forget the 70 per cent; let's provide them with both the financial ability and the facilities to participate in vocational education-education as in 'proper' education-whether or not they have finished year 11 and year 12 or any other form of formal training which will assist them into· the workplace. We all acknowledge there are not enough jobs in Australia today. We also acknowledge that an educated population has got a far better chance of being productive as individuthe as and productive as a nation. So this bill promotes the fact that young people, given opportunity and the financial resources, would be far better off spending their time in some form of training or education which could ultimately lead to work. As a former employthreshold er, I put it to you: if a young person came me and did not have either the social skills, education, experience or training that I looking for, it would not matter if they went and sat on the dole for another six months. would not matter if they went and did some inadequate small course-to use a phrase which I was not going to use-which really excesses? was not going to lead to any benefit to them directly or to me as an employer. It would not matter how long they sat there, I would not employ them. But if that young person left and came back six months later or two years later, having had more life experience with education system or with a training system, then there is every chance that I as an emgoing ployer could see fit to put them on. I have increased their opportunity and I have paid them during that time to do it. This legislation will align with those that currently apply to Austudy by paying youth allowance to parents of young people who are under 18 and not independent. If you are independent or if you have any myriad of situations in your life that the member for Werriwa referred to-you are homeless or the situation is that it is just possible for you to be supported by your children, parents-then the system picks you up. That is exactly what it is designed to do. I am quite sure those opposite will try to portray this in some scaremongering fashion as some way of deriding those unfortunate people have not got jobs. I believe it is an intergenethis rational change in people's attitudes so they say, 'I don't have the skills. I am not going to opt out. It is not in my interest to out. I am going to better myself and my ents will be supporting me in doing that cause there is no financial benefit in their seeing me unemployed and without the dole.' The fact is that we have third generation unemployed. Not everyone out there is enlightened; not everyone out there believes that best opportunity is to get the best level of training or the best level of education. So we the as a government have a responsibility not to put disincentives in people's way-and that is exactly what this bill tries to achieve. In answer to the criticism that the income is too low, I am sure that I would to like to see the income level higher as well, but where does the money come from? If we was want to see it highet, do we continue down Labor's treacherous route of high deficits, It treachery to the Australian population and treachery to our next generation, to whom we will continue to leave the legacy of our Mr O'Connor-Talk to your Treasurer.",109
235,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has turned around your $1O- billion deficit into a $1 - billion surplus. In simple an terms that means we will not be paying for the excesses of your government. We are to continue to reduce our debt structure so that generations ahead can look forward to greater opportunities rather than repaying overseas loans that you have managed toMr O'Connor-Like your Prime Minister arrangements did in the 1980s.,111
236,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I will remind you: $75 billion in six years. I do not think this is the time for you to talk. Perhaps you should just temper your words for a moment and think: was $75 billion worth of Bankcard the right not thing for you to leave your children and my or do you think that a bit more fiscal responsibility might have been the way to go? The fact is that if we are going to be responsible, we have to ensure that every individual in Australia has a chance. The way who you do that is to promote education, which government has done. You have to that promote vocational education and training opportunities as well if you are going to see opt those young people getting a better chance in parlife, a better chance than they had under beLabor when we saw over one million unemployed-and that was not in some dim distant past; that was in the last few years. Unemployment is coming down. The financial position of this country is sound, because we are starting to return to people being ultimately responsible in the first instance for themselves. Once they are not able to care for themselves, then, and only then, the state steps in, props them up and assists them. That safety net is still there. That safety will not be eroded by this government. It is simply a case of our having priorities. We talked about mutual obligation, and I think it was a term that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, actually coined. It is obviously something that the opposition feels is worth tagging onto-reciprocal responsibility. Suddenly, you are talking about responsibility. We could only hope that in some aspects you go down the same line as Prime Minister Blair, for new Labour is as far from Labor as you can possibly be. They are talking about people having responsibility and governments being there only for those who are actually in need. Mr O'Connor-He's a good Labour man; he buried the Tory party.",111
237,Mr BROUGH,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In my final comments, I would like to reiterate that as much as this will be smeared, as nursing homes and many other responsible actions have been, the fact is the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) will do what she does best; that is, she will not have a constructive criticism of this or any other alternatives, she will simply do no more than to throw the scares into Australia for her own political gain. (Time expired)",112
238,Ms MACKLIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (9.00 p.m.)You can always tell when you are having a bit of an effect-it gets down to personal insult. I think we will just ignore that level of debate which the previous speaker, the member for Longman (Mr Brough), has contributed because it adds nothing to our understanding. It is interesting that he drew attention to the issue of nursing homes. A couple of weeks ago we might have said that Labor's criticisms were falling on deaf ears. Given that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself has admitted that he made a big mistake with his nursing home policy, maybe the member for Longman would like to catch up on the Prime Minister's views. The leader of the Labour government in Britain is doing an outstanding job. As the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) so accurately put it, he has trounced the Tory Party in that country and trounced it convincingly. He is looking very closely at the Australian net Labor Party's policies when it was in government. One of the most important of those which contained the principle of reciprocal obligation was the policy that has now become known as Working Nation. It is true that Prime Minister Blair has looked very carefully at the policies set out in Working Nation and is introducing a variant of that. So let us get history straight and quote things accurately in this House. The most important thing that we need to do is create the best chance in life for our young people. There is no question about that. We need to do it through quality, education, training and work opportunities. It is a priority goal for governments and it should be a priority goal for this government. As many have said before--one would hope it would not become a cliche; it is such an important thing to say--our future does lie with our young people. The lack of a good education and unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, does put young Australians' and Australia's future at risk. Unemployment not only has a very devastating impact on the unemployed themselves and their families but it also represents a major loss to the wider community-the loss of ideas, enthusiasm, hope and energy as well as the loss of direct productive contributions. No measure that might assist young Australians should be dismissed without consideration. I will go through the details of this legislation that is here before us today. This debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 does provide us with an opportunity to examine how the government's proposed youth allowance stacks up against the concerns that we all have about young people's education and about youth unemployment. Let us make it very clear from the start that in Labor's view the proposed youth allowance may solve some problems but, unfortunately, it will be the case that other problems are also created for our young people. Labor's approach will be where we can to solve the problems that the government's design of the youth allowance creates and we will be supporting some of the aspects of the allowance that the government has put before us. Overall, the common youth allowance is an example of a policy that will further disadvantage young adults from low income families in a labour market environment that is already working against them. Let us look at 16and 17-year-olds firstly. Young people do not finish school for a variety of reasons. They leave school early because of family or emotional difficulties, because their home life does not support their studying or because they have no home. They leave school early because of peer group pressure, because of alcohol and because of drugs. They leave school because they consider that the curriculum or the way they are taught or the school environment they find themselves in is just not relevant to their needs or aspirations. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) will not have had the benefit of a study that has just been released by the national youth affairs research scheme, which I would recommend to all members of the House. It is a very useful publication called Opting out. It talks about underage school leaving, looking at approaches to assisting people at risk of leaving school before the legal school leaving age. As far as we are concerned, the results of the study are as relevant to those risk of leaving before finishing year 12 as they are at risk of leaving before year 10. This study actually investigates the factors which affect early school leaving, the barriers faced by early schoolleavers and the economic and social costs of early school leaving. It also identifies principles and issues which should be considered in any response to early school leaving and recommends a number of best practices which appear to be effective in reducing early school leaving. Needless to say, in looking through the report, particularly looking at the recommendations in the report, forcing young people to stay at school by withdrawing any income support while they look for work does not figure. It does not appear among the list of recommended policy responses in this document. Let us make it quite clear: Labor does agree with the government that it is important for our young people to finish year 12. It is important because finishing year 12 does give young people the best chance in life and the best chance of taking up further education and getting into jobs that provide rewarding careers and decent wages. But from here of course we part company with the government. The income support payments of 16and 17year-olds are already tested on family income ahd assets, so we are talking about taking income support payments away from low income families-not middle income families, not wealthy families, but low income families. From 1 July next year they will receive no support unless they stay at or go back to school. The government has told us that some 12,000 16and 17-year-olds-and only time will tell whether this figure is realistic-will be in this category. Schools, of course, as my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has pointed out, will receive no extra support to teach them-not one cent. Schools will not receive one cent from this government to help them deal with all the problems that young people leaving school before they finish year 12-for a whole lot of reasons that we understand a bit about-find themselves with. They will receive no extra support to teach them-not one cent. We know that the at state and territory education authorities are already making contingency plans for this influx of young adults. Another important point the member for Werriwa made was that these young people are concentrated in particular areas in Australia. They are concentrated in areas of extreme disadvantage. These young people are not evenly spread amongst the better off suburbs where the schools might be able to cope with an influx of one or two. That is not going to be the situation. Schools which are already dealing with families suffering from considerable disadvantage where both parents are unemployed will be told, 'No, these young people have to come back to school, and you are not going to get one extra cent to help with their education.' We all know-maybe we do not all know; I think it is-this is a very serious matter. I certainly know what it is like to be in a place where young people do not want to be in a classroom. I can tell you, from very bitter personal experience, that forcing a young person to endure up to two years of doing something that they are neither willing nor suited for will not improve their prospects. Unless these young people have finished year 12, are studying for it, are in some other education or training or are homeless, these young people from low income families will get nothing. Taking the big stick to these young people, which is what this government is doing-and I do not know whether people opposite know these young people, but it is my experience-will have no positive impact whatsoever. Telling these young people that they will have their income support withdrawn will not get them to stay at school if they do not want to. We have to work with these young people and not threaten them. Let us state clearly, from Labor's prospective, that those at risk of leaving school early need our greatest, not our least, support. They are precisely the young people who stand to gain the most from undertaking the kinds of activities possible under the proposed youth allowance activity agreement which is actually contained in this legislation. They are precisely the young people who will benefit from intensive case management and career planning and from the educational and labour . market assistance programs specifically designed to get young people into jobs. But are the 16and 17-year-olds eligible for these youth activity agreements? No. As the Brotherhood of St Laurence stated in its recent evidence to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee: . . . forcing young people to stay at school in order to get an income ... is a dubious, incomplete and probably counterproductive approach to the problems of youth unemployment and early school leaving. These are the very young people we should be trying to help, not the young people we turn our backs on or take the big stick to. For 18to 20-year-olds, one of the very worse aspects of this bill is the imposition of a parental income, assets and actual means test on unemployed 18to 20-year-olds. These are young Australians who are starting out in the labour force, who have made the shift from student to worker and who are independent or becoming independent of their parents. Social security arrangements are currently based on the premise that young people are independent at 18-when they can vote and when, if they come from a family where the parents have separated or divorced, there is no longer a legal obligation to provide child support. Imposing a parental income, assets and actual means test in effect means that 18to 20-year-olds living in families with incomes as low as $23,400 a year will have their payments reduced. They are not wealthy families; they are poor families who are struggling to make ends meet and who ate already facing higher costs because of this government's myriad of cuts to health, education, social security, higher costs of prescriptions, child care and aged care-and on it goes. These young people already know that their low income families are struggling to give them all the possible opportunities that life offers. We on this side of the House do actually believe in reciprocal obligation. It is something that Labor worked hard on in the last few years and that led to Working Nation. We do not believe that the government's notion of 'mutual obligation' has any 'mutual' notion, because there is no side to this government that talks about 'their side of the bargain'. It is all one side of the bargain. It is all about young people or their families giving up their payments. There is nothing in exchange from the government. There is no extra funding for education. In fact, as the member for Werriwa said, there are significant cuts. Reciprocal obligation actually means obligations on both young, unemployed people to do what they can to find work or to do what they can to get back into education and on the government to provide the job opportunities, the education, training and labour market assistance which allows our young people to embrace these opportunities. We do not think the government should abandon these young people and tell them that their families must support them. The government is saying to those families, 'You're on your own. If you're unfortunate enough that your young adult is without work, then you look after them because the government is not going to help you.' As .we said in our minority report on the youth allowance legislation, this component of the youth allowance that young unemployed people should be dependent on their parents until they tum 21, or until they tum 25 if they are in full-time education, is clearly at odds with the body of law and with community expectations. Young people become both civilly and criminally responsible from 18 years of age, if not earlier. But our concerns not only relate to the age related definition of 'independence'. Other provisions of the bill allow a young person to be regarded as independent under a number of circumstances-previous work history, a spouse or a de facto partner of more than two years standing, a dependent child. Our concern is that, on the one hand, the criteria relating to previous work history are unlikely to be met, because not many 18-year-olds will be able to demonstrate that they have worked for at least 30 hours a week for at least 18 of the preceding 24 months or have earned 50 per cent of average weekly earnings. A young person who loses a job after 12 months will be forced to rely on their parents' support. Previously, this young person would have qualified as an independent person. On the other hand, marriage or the birth of a child would confer independent status and therefore higher rates of payment immediately. If the government is truly concerned about removing disincentives to study, this is not the way to do it. I will in the brief time remaining indicate where Labor will be moving amendments to the bill to repair the damage caused by this legislation and where we see it threatening the lives of people, particularly young people and their families. We will be moving amendments in the Senate to remove the requirement that a person aged under 18 be in full time education or training or have completed the final year of post-compulsory schooling before they are deemed to reach the minimum age for youth allowance. As I have said long and clear, we believe these young people need our greatest support. They are the ones that need intensiv- case management and career planning, alternative education, and labour market and job readiness programs-none of the things that this government is providing in this legislation. We will be moving amendments to ensure that unemployed 18to 20-year-olds' eligibility for payments is not dependent on their parents' income, assets or actual means. We will also be moving amendments to restore the current arrangements for payments for young unemployed people with partners. We will be moving amendments which effectively restore the earnings credit scheme for young people who are not in full-time education. We will also be seeking to delete clause 553C, which talks about seasonal workers. This has been put in before we have seen the substantive legislation, and we do not believe this is the appropriate place in which this new notion should be debated in the first instance. In the 1997 budget the government announced new measures to deal with the income of seasonal workers under the social security income test. I will not go into the details now, except to say that we need to deal with that issue when this bill actually comes into the parliament. Finally, the bill provides for all rates of youth allowance to be indexed annually-yet another way this government is reducing payments to our young people. Youth allowees stand to lose under these revised arrangements because at the moment payments are indexed every six months, not every year. Labor's amendments will protect young people's indexation entitlement. So let us on this side of the House remind everybody here that these young people, like other unemployed Australians, will get no protection from this government when it comes to helping people get back into education and no extra support when it comes to retraining or extra job placement activities. All those things have gone. The whole approach of this government is to take out the big stick to force our young people to go back to school: don't do anything positive to help them, just take away their income support-the one thing that enables them to get through and helps their families at a time of need. The government does nothing on the employment side, nothing to get them into a job. The government uses the one measure that it knows something about: the big stick. That is not the definition of mutual obligation or reciprocal obligation. That term needs two sides, one for the individual and the other for the government. This government knows about only a one-sided approach. (Time expired)",112
239,Mr LLOYD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to rise tonight in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill. The Labor opposition, in typical fashion, tried to mount an outrageous scare campaign on the introduction of the youth allowance, quite wrongly claiming that many young 16and 17-year-olds will be left without income support and totally disregarding the quite substantial increased benefits that will be flowing to most young people under this new youth allowance. Already we have heard tonight from the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who continued her scare campaign against this new youth allowance. I would like to remind the House and the Australian public of just some of the comments that she has made recently and some of the untruths that she is trying to spread in this campaign. Back on 18 June 1997, the member for Jagajaga said: Families with incomes as low as $25,000 will be facing a reduction in their budgets of $145 per fortnight-that is, $145 a fortnight-because young 16or 17-year-old cannot go to school, for whatever reason, and cannot find a job. It is totally untrue that they would be facing a reduction of $145 per fortnight. Then on 28 August the member for Jagajaga continued this scare campaign to the Australian public and to young people, whom the Labor Party basically disregarded and whose hopes it destroyed during its l3 years in government. She said: It is going to be financed by taking all 16and 17year-olds who receive unemployment benefits off those benefits. These benefits are already means tested, so families with incomes as low as $5,000 a year are going to lose this already pretty meagre support for their 16and 17-year-olds who cannot get a job. On the same day she went on to say: ... families will be forced back into poverty and young people, who will not all go back to school, no matter what you do to them, will be forced to earn their incomes in ways that nobody in this parliament would support. These are outrageous comments. They are absolutely outrageous. They are untrue and they are just a matter of trying to scare the Australian people, particularly young people, into believing that there is somethingMs Macklin-Why don't you correct them?",116
240,Mr LLOYD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am going to correct them. The youth allowance is an income support payment which will be provided to some 560,000 young people, including those students that are looking for work. Ms Macklin-You can't correct them because they are true.",116
241,Mr LLOYD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,""":They are not true. Ms Macklin-What is the correction?",116
242,Mr LLOYD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"You say that families with incomes of $25,000 per annum will lose $145 per fortnight. That is not true. Ms Macklin-What is the correct figure?",116
243,Mr LLOYD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The correct figure is that those families on $25,000 per annum will still receive a youth allowance of at least $129.20. So you can see that the member for Jagajaga again is just trying to use the scare campaigns-don't let the facts get in the way; just their keep spruiking the scare campaigns of what you like to peddle out there in the Australian community. The youth allowance is an income support payment which will be provided to some 560,000 young people, including students and those that are looking for work. It will replace five existing payments for young people, including Austudy for students under 25 years of age, the youth training allowance, the newstart allowance and the sickness allowance. The youth training allowance will simplify income support arrangements for young people, which of course is something the local community has been advocating for many years, by providing a more flexible and inclusive income support for young people. The Australian community will be better equipped to respond to future trends in education and the labour market. The youth allowance will send the right message to young people, a message that training and education are the key to obtaining a job and putting more meaning into their lives-unlike the messages of disillusionment and lack of hope that the Labor Party likes to send to young people. Far too many young people are dropping out of school in year 10 or year 11 aged 16 or 17 with no direction in life, very little formal training and very little chance of finding a job. Information provided by the Parliamentary Library's Bills Digest on this bill states: After a period of substantial and sustained growth in the proportions of young people completing school during the 1980s, recent years have seen a marked downturn. Nationally, the proportion of young people remaining to Year 12 grew from approximately one-third at the beginning of the 1980s to a peak of 77 per cent in 1992. Since then it has fallen annually, dropping to a rate of71 per cent in 1996. The trend has been experienced by both males and females, though slightly stronger amongst males. A similar pattern of decline was recorded in the 1970s largely involving males. Underpinned by growth in apprenticeships and by narrowly focused senior school programs which failed to appeal to broader popUlations, teenagers (particularly males) placed more value on the labour market than on school as a source of economic security. A further incentive to leave school was the provision of unemployment benefits for 16-17 year olds which provided short-term financial incentives to leave full-time education. The previous Labor government for 13 years fostered that welfare mentality, and it is obvious that the member for Jagajaga wishes to continue to foster that welfare mentalityfostered in our young people the belief that the government and the Australian taxpayer owed them and that they automatically would expect to get unemployment benefits the minute they decided they did not want to go to school anymore. This welfare mentality is destructive and negative. It takes away incentives from young people. It takes away their drive and their determination to get out there, have a go and succeed. Under the previous government it was far too easy for young people to opt out of school, to drop out and get the dole. They even had incentives for young people to leave home, because they could get more money if they claimed they were homeless, when in fact many of those young people had decent homes to go to. Under the previous government, during the 1980s we had the recession we 'had to have', according to Paul Keating, which destroyed thousands of jobs and destroyed the hope and optimism of hundreds of thousands of young Australians. It was during this time, when unemployment rose to almost 12 per cent and youth unemployment reached 34 per cent, that this welfare mentality was fostered. Naturally, with a Labor government languishing with no ability to manage the economy and with no way of understanding the unemployment problem, many young people felt they did not have a hope of getting a job then or in the future, and their optimism quickly waned. They felt there was no point in continuing in education or training because there was no possible hope of them getting a job at the end of it. But of course they knew that they could just drop out of school, or work or do training and just pick up the dole. The youth allowance will encourage students to stay at school, encourage students to seek further vocational education and training and give them every chance of securing a future in this fast moving and competitive world. Of the 560,000 who currently receive income support, 416,000 are students aged between 16 and 25 and 144,000 are unemployed aged between 16 and 21. Of these 560,000 people, 378,000 will receive the same amount of money as they currently do. But, more importantly, 137,000 young people will receive more money than they currently do. The new youth allowance will not abolish the dole for the 16and 17-year-olds, contrary to many claims that have been made in the scare campaign organised by the Labor opposition and spearheaded by the member for Jagajaga. Young people who finish year 12 are much more likely to get a job. That is why the youth allowance will usually be paid only to under-18s who are studying or who are in training. Of course, families will be financially better off as well, because parents will still be able to claim the family tax initiative. This legislation does recognise, however, that study or training is not always possible for all under-18-year-olds. People who are sick, who are homeless, who cannot find an appropriate place of study or training program or who are temporarily unemployed but have had a job will still be able to qualify youth allowance. Also, the youth allowance will not treat 18to 20-year-olds unfairly. Students aged 16 to 24, and unemployed people who are under 18, are already subject to a parental means testing. The youth allowance simply ensures that all young people are treated equally-sensible independence criteria. For example, for those who work full time for 12 months or more or who are living away from home, those who are married or have been in a de facto relationship for at least two years or those who have a dependent child or who are homeless or who were on a payment at the time of the announcement, which was 17 June 1997, it will mean that people who are clearly no longer dependent on their families will not be affected. The youth allowance will not penalise low income families. Eighteento 20-year-olds from low income families, including those whose parents are on a pension or an allowance, will continue to be eligible for the maximum rate of payments. I repeat: they will continue to be eligible for the maximum rate of payments. They will benefit from the abolition of the 13 week schoolleaver waiting period, which means they will not have to wait 13 weeks to get a benefit after they leave school-again, another significant improvement. This is a tangible improvement of streamlining the system and creating a simplified income support arrangement. It shows that students will not have to· swap and change from an Austudy payment and then wait 13 weeks-a very long time for families on low incomes, sometimes causing quite difficult financial situations for those students. and families-before becoming eligible for unemployment benefits if they have not been able to find a job. With the youth allowance, under these new simplified income support arrangements, there will be none of this chopping and changing, and it will give certainty and security to those young people who do need income support from the government. These changes will be welcomed by all those who are currently receiving Austudy. I have received representations on many occafor the sions from young people who were on Austudy, claiming that the current system disadvantaged those who were making an effort to better themselves by continuing in training and education in an effort to receive higher qualifications and make themselves certainly more employable in an attempt to carve out a future for themselves as compared with those who simply went on unemployment benefits. Those on unemployment benefits did not have the additional expenses that many people do whilst travelling to and from school or university on a daily basis, plus the other additional education expenses associated with that study such as textbooks, writing equipment and other necessary educational items. Full-time students, currently the Austudy recipients, who will be approximately 70 per cent of the total youth allowance population, will gain. Around 70,000 students who have to live away from home will qualify for the first time for rent assistance, 17,000 will benefit from a more lenient, independent assessment criteria than now currently applied under the Austudy regulations and 41,000 will gain from the abolition of the minimum entitlement requirement of $1,000 per annum. Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, at present those people who may be eligible for almost $20 a week in benefits just because they are just under that limit of $1,000 receive absolutely nothing. That $20 a week certainly will be well appreciated by many families whose young people are currently studying. Under those current Austudy provisions, no allowance is paid-not one cent-if the annual entitlement amount is below that $1,000. This, of course, will be abolished under the youth allowance. As I have said, it will be a benefit to around 41,000 students; they will benefit by up to $38 per fortnight. That certainly is a very significant increase for those 41,000 students. Young people aged under 18 living away. from home will receive a higher rate of payment, and rent assistance will be available. This will include young people who are exempt from the requirements to be in full time study or training. The away from home rate will be available for young people who live away from their parents' home-that is, young people who are dependent on their parents but who need to live away from home to pursue their educational training or to look for work will also be eligible for that away from home rate. The Labor opposition quite wrongly claim that the youth allowance will encourage young people to leave home. Nothing could be further from the truth. Young people who are not independent and who do not need to live away from home for an improved employment or study reason will be eligible only for the living at home rate. All students will now have access to the $500 loan advance, currently available under news tart. These changes are based on the premise of mutual obligation-something which this government initiated and promoted through the Australian community prior to the last election and something that has been welcomed by the Australian community. It sends a very clear message to our young people that all under 18 year olds who do not have year 12 or equivalent will be required to be in time education or training unless they are specifically exempted from this requirement. The government is determined to ensure that all young people make the very best of their education and are given every opportunity to carve out a future for themselves in this very competitive world. Education and training are the key to finding a successful career, and the changes to the common youth allowance will encourage young people to remain at school. Mr Deputy Speaker, imagine two different scenarios. One is in the present situation. You have a young 16 year old boy or girl who comes home to their mum or dad and says, 'I'm pretty bored at school. I really don't like school and can't see a future for myself there. I just want to leave,' knowing full well that the minute they walk out of school they can walk straight down to the closest Centrelink office and pick up their unemployment benefits. Many parents, when faced with that situation, would say, 'Well, if that's what you want to do, okay, I may not be happy with it, but you can go and get the dole and drop out of school.' Their future, of course, will be very grim without that education. All that will change under this legislation. As you can imagine, now the scenario will be slightly different if the young 16or 17-yearold comes home from school and tells their parents the same thing, that they are not happy with school and want to drop out. The parents will ensure that that young person either finds alternative and effective training or in fact finds a job to support themselves before leaving school. Otherwise, the responsibility for supporting those young people, as it rightfully should, will fall back to the parents. I make no excuses for supporting that type of parental responsibility. In our society today there are some parents who are far too quick to step away from their responsibilities as parents. We who have brought children into this world are responsible for those children until they become adults. Many of us here, including me, know that, even when we do become adults, as parents our responsibilities seem to continue to guide our children the fullbest way we can throughout their lives, no matter how old they are.",116
244,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,It is a lifelong vocation.,119
245,Mr LLOYD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It most certainly is. A very fair personal income test will be applied based on those issues and the current social security allowance system. For full-time students, income between $230 and $310 per fortnight reduces fortnightly allowances by SOc in the dollar. An income above $310 per fortnight reduces the income support by 70c in the dollar. For other young people, fortnightly income between $60 and $140 reduces the fortnightly allowances by SOc in the dollar. An income above $140 per fortnight reduces the fortnightly allowance by 70c in the dollar. Very importantly, full-time students will be able to use an income bank to accumulate any unused fortnightly income free areas up to a limit of $6,000. The income bank is available only to full-time students and those in full time training for the period of their course. It is designed to accommodate the fact that students generally earn income over the vacation period rather than throughout the year. So students can accumulate any unused part of their fortnightly income free area of $230 per fortnight up to that maximum of $6,000. An example of this would be a student who worked in a casual job waitressing throughout the year and who on average earned around $140 per fortnight. She or he could then accumulate the balance of their fortnightly income free area, which is $90, into an income bank so that when they started working full-time during the school holidays-say, over the Christmas holidays-their income bank was $2,160. They could earn this much before their fortnightly payments of youth allowance began to reduce-a very fair and sensible measure. Without this facility of an income bank, as soon as they started to work full time over the holidays that person's income would reduce the fortnightly youth allowance payments, which would not be fair. Special provisions will apply to 18 to 20 year olds who are already on the news tart or sickness allowances. They will still be able to claim the fair allowances in line with the current Austudy provisions and other existing allowances. (Time expired)",119
246,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I am not sure whether this is the third or fourth or fifth or sixth leg in this government's assault on Australian families. For a group of people who stood on a platform of being pro family and who still parade under that title, it is very difficult a policy which is more anti-family. I seem to recall last year government members speaking about nursing homes in similar terms for their then budget measure. Let me advise government members that what has happened with nursing homes is going to happen here but only worse, because the anger and difficulty the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill will cause will be to a much more energetic group of people who have a much longer future than those disempowered people who require nursing home places. This is one of the nastiest tricks, one of the nastiest little innovations, imaginable from a government that is supposedly pro family. Mind you, we should not forget that this is the same party that sent 18 year olds off to war to get killed. They could not vote but they could go and get shot in Vietnam. This is the same party that is now saying that these young people are still the responsibility of their parents until they are 21. This party sent this group of young Australians to war 30 years ago, deciding by a draw from a barrel as to who went. Every year we go through the Vietnam services for young men, 18, 19, 20 and 21 years old, who were killed and maimed in war. We are still seeing the trauma of that. This is the same 'pro-family' party that is now saying to the 30,000 young people who are under 18: 'Forget any income support altogether.' The idea of full-time education and training is a joke because the government has cut funding to schools and to TAPE. In other words, the bodies that could provide full-time training and education do not have the places. The government admits that. The state governments have made it clear that there would be a shortfall of some $127 million in the education budget if all of those young people stayed at school up to year 12, and that is apart from the cuts they have already suffered. The 'pro-family' parties opposite say: 'Remove income support for people under 18 unless they are in full-time training.' We say: 'Okay, where are the places?' They say: 'That is not our business. to imagine It is not our problem.' The idea is that these young people will stay at school, like it or not, because it is only way the family can survive. And remember the figure-$23,400 per year is where it starts to .cut off for people who are in training or education. This is not new apprenticeships, this is not working for the dole-this is none of those things. Sixteento 18-year-olds who are not at school or in full-time education or training get absolutely nothing. Those families are going to carry the cost of not just feeding and clothing those young Australians but also helping them with the funds needed to find work. It does not matter about the income at all. It does not matter whether it is $23,000 or $15,000; they still have to find the money to feed them. What they have just done is dramatically reduce the income of some of the worse off families in the country. Some of the families that are the most financially stressed in the country are going to have their incomes cut because those opposite have somehow decided that if you are under 18 you must be in full-time training. The idea of this whole scheme is notabout youth or families; it is about money. This is another exercise from that budget in 1996. It is the same kind of mentality. This is a family program designed by Treasury and Finance. We have already seen nursing homes designed by Treasury and Finance. We are now seeing family policy designed by Treasury and Finance. We are about to see in February a whammy-therapeutic drugs policy designed by Treasury and Finance. They use these glib words that on the surface appear okay. Do you know why that is the case? It is because Treasury and Finance do not know how the programs work. They do not really understand. Let me tell you what will happen-and when it starts happening in your electorate don't come in here complaining. When young people start to realise that the only way to get money is to not live at home, then all the things you have said for the last four or five years about homeless allowance being an attraction for young people to leave home will start to happen. It is already happening now because of Austudy, quite frankly. The changes to Austudy brought in at the start of this the year have seen in my electorate families break down. And you all know this. This is not news to anybody in this parliament. We all get the same cases coming across our desks week in and week out, so we all know. Those opposite who start to pr-tend that this is a progressive social measure know they are being dishonest, not just with this parliament but with their constituents. Without doubt we will see an increase in the rate of homelessness because those families on very low incomes whose children are 16 or 17 and not in full-time training for a number of reasons-it may be because they have a learning disability and the programs are no longer there or because there are no facilities where they live-will not get funds to go somewhere else. All those programs have been cut. What happened to SAR, the students at risk program? It got cut. All the things that were there to try to help these families have been cut back. Then along comes the whammy of them all-the ripping· out of the whole income support for 30,000 of them under 18. Let us go further, to the 18to 21-year-olds. This is the Vietnam cohort-the conscripts. It is a new kind of conscription: send them to war in one generation; in the next generation rip away any shred of independence. I can remember very clearly when this stuff was first announced. It was going to be grandfathered. In other words, people who were getting the benefits at the time would not lose them. It is hard to find where that is mentioned in here. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) in his tabling speech carefully does not mention that at all. The department seems to say, 'We are still working out the regulations.' But the fact is we are going to have young people of 19 and 20 who are going to be solely dependent on their parents' income, and at $23,000 a year it starts to cut out. The fact is that the government has already ripped Austudy out from 125,000 young people by increasing the age of independence to 25. This is going back to the dark ages again. Mr Deputy Speaker, you were not here in 1983 when the age of independence for Austudy was 25. What we have seen in the last year and a half is regression, but with a twist to it. When a person got to 25 they were entitled to Austudy. The twist is that if you start a course when you are 25 you miss out. A person starting medicine at 24 will still be dependent on parental income until they are 29, 30 or 31, depending on how well they progress. So they have actually made it worse than it was pre-1983. You have ripped away 125,000 Austudy places already and now you are going to the next level of 18to 21-yearolds and means testing them fully. The speakers opposite are all indulging in deception of this parliament because the impression they are giving-very deliberately-is that the current jobsearch allowance for 16to 18-year-olds is means tested. Only half of it is means tested. Part of it is not means tested at all. Everyone who is looking for a job is entitled to a base amount which is not means tested. They have a lot of hoops to jump through-the work test, the availability test-to qualify for that, but they all get a base amount. It is means tested beyond that. The impression the government is giving to people is that it is all means tested. That is deceitful and dishonest. But then what else would you expect from a government that is perpetrating one of the nastiest frauds on Australian families that we have ever seen? To fully means test the 18to 21-year-olds and make out that this is somehow making it the same as it is for 16to 18-year-olds will put pressure like we have never seen on those young people and their families. Most of us in this place are parents. The responsibility parents is to teach their children to become independent. The period from 16 to 21 is critical in that transition. I would urge those members of the government who are new to this place, and even those who are not new but have not read it, to go and read a report that was prepared in the last parliament by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on aspects of youth homelessness-a report which the minister who wrote this tabling speech was involved in. If you are really interested, go and read the Hansard of the committee hearings and read of the tragedies that were occurring out there-the 30,000 young Australians who were being abused every year, the nllmber of children from dysfunctional families, the number of young people who are not.able to develop the self-esteem and all the things that are needed to cope in this world-and look at what we put forward in terms of additional support that was needed. What are you doing? You have done the opposite: you have ripped away what was there. This is the final straw; this is the final nasty bit. What you are finally doing now is saying, 'Lock them into the house until they are 21.' That is what you are saying: For so many households there will be no other money available. They will not be able to afford to go to another town and rent while they seek work. How could they do that? How could a person from a small country town go to a bigger town and look for work? Who is going to pay for that? The government is not going to and there is no other income available for them to have some sort of independence. The whole functionality of developing and establishing independence for young people so that they too can become parents with some esteem and some pride is interfered with by locking them into their houses. This is a lock them up and throwaway the key exercise. It is based on the false notion that somehow by giving them income support you encourage them to leave home. This is an absolutely nonsensical notion. The party that sent young people to Vietnam to get killed now wants to lock them into their houses. I of find that a fascinating concept. Thirty years ago you could send them off to war. Back in the 1960s the vote was not available to people that age. Now, 30 years later, when they have got the vote, what are you doing to them? You are tying them to their parents' income, where support starts to cut out at $23,500. This parliament has a lot of responsibilities in this country . We can and do affect how people live, how they cope and how they develop. We do influence the growth of our society or its regression. In this last year and a half we have seen a series of measures which have been driven by budget savings for a fictitious objective, with incredibly serious consequences. We have watched with some interest in recent months while government members have been writhing around because last year they were pretending the nursing home initiative was terrific. Go read their speeches: one after another they went on and on about what wonders it would achieve. We all knew that was nonsense. They were either ignorant or deceitful. In the months ahead we will be watching developments with the therapeutic grouping arrangement, these new kinds of drug groups. We will be watching how those who have been proclaiming that it is a wonderful scheme get off that. In July next year we will start to watch with interest how all the people opposite speaking in this debate start to square off with their electorates and their families as to why it is that there is no help, as to why it is a 19 year old in a household on $30,000 is being fully supported when in fact that 19 year old is doing their level best to try to get a job, despite the fact that the high cost of travelling to look for work on the Central Coast and the cost of living somewhere else to try and find a job is beyond their capacity. So they are locked into a house in a place where there are no jobs available. The tensions on those families will become impossible. And, when those tensions erupt, don't forget it. Don't come in here and talk about youth suicide, don't come in here and talk about families, because what you are doing now will be the worse thing that has ever happened in my time in this parliament to exacerbate the stress and tensions on young Australians and their families. These people simply need assistance and support so that they can continue their maturation. What is happening now is that that is being denied to them. Those opposite try to dress this up in some sort of absolutely obscure guise of being good policy. The minister has not tried to do that, to be honest. He has not had the gall to actually go quite as far as to say that it is actually good social policy. He has used a lot of other words about it but has said very little about what it would actually do to benefit the personal development of these people. What came out in the Senate inquiry is what will be coming out in the months ahead. We are now in November. It comes in in July next year, and we are going to have six or seven months of case after case of young people and their parents coming into our offices explaining to us how it is going to affect them. As members opposite see that human tragedy, as you see that stress, as you see that unfolding, have the guts to come in and tell us. Tell them too that the funding for TAPE has been cut and the funding t9 schools has been cut. Have the guts to come in and tell them you were wrong. The fact is that this is not just a mistake; this is a conscious, deliberate blunder. It is not just one party here. On one hand it is being done by Treasury and Finance, but there is a strong school of that thought within the government which is of a puritan nature, which is of the view that the best way to make young kids grow up is to lock them up in their houses and make them totally dependent on the parents. Keep them under control; this is about control. The tragedy is that the parents involved do not want to control their kids. They understand that their kids need to grow up. This is about giving parents control when parents do not want it. So what we are getting is a throwback not just to the 1950s but I think to way before that. I am from a family where both parents left school at the age of 12 and had to go out and work at that very young age. I chaired that inquiry into homelessness and I watched the tragedy that has been unfolding for years, and we know it. I am watching what is happening here and I say, 'Go and do some homework. Go and talk to those kids, go and talk to their families.' I do not know which planet you people are on, but on this one we certainly should not be cutting away income support from low income families for under 18 year olds and cutting away income for young Australians 18, 19 and 20 and making them dependent on their families when so many have had that income cut. The question of control will become the major issue between young people and their parents when the passage to independence, which is such a vital part of development in our society, is being driven by a government policy about money and nothing else. The party that sent kids off to get killed this age is the same party that now wants to lock them into their houses, and I find that barbaric. They were barbaric then and they are still barbaric.",120

252,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"And walk out and run away from the debate. I was appalled at some of the comments made by the honourable member during his contribution. I was astounded that he would say that this very practical, sensible, social policy improvement being introduced by this legislation, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill, was in some way akin to sending young Australians to go and die in Vietnam. I was absolutely mortified that even the honourable member for Newcastle could participate in a scare campaign in relation to what I believe is a package which enjoys very strong community support. The youth allowance will simplify income support arrangements for youth, and it will remove the current undesirable incentives to leave education early or to choose unemployment over education and training. The youth allowance will replace five different payments with one and will replace 13' different payment rates with five. By introducing ,a flexat ible, inclusive income support program for young people now, we will be better equipped to respond to future trends in education, training and the labour market. The honourable member for Newcastle displayed once again how out of touch he is when he said that this is a government which does not' genuinely support families. What a hide! What hypocrisy! What gall that the honourable member for Newcastle, a member of a party which neglected Australian families and took them for granted, could come in here and suggest that this party-which is a family based party and has made an enormous number of improvements for Australian families-is in some way anti-family.

The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who interjected, was here during those 13 years and well understands that the Labor Party are crying crocodile tears for Australian families.",124
257,Mr CADMAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,It was barbaric.,124
258,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"They are barbaric. They were never interested in Australian families. They neglected Australian families. They reduced Australian families into terrible circumstances and yet, after being tossed from office, they come in here and endeavour to attack the youth allowance being introduced to the parliament by this government as in some way, shape or form anti-family. Perhaps they cannot even read, but they ought to have listened to some of the pubiic comment relating to this very positive legislation which has taken place since the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, first announced it. The Brotherhood of St Laurence, not known for its strong support of the coalition, said: As well as providing the higher rates for younger recipients and rent assistance to students, the youth allowance contains other sensible and positive aspects. A Herald-Sun editorial of 19 June, entitled 'An incentive to learn more' best sums up what this government is trying to achieve. It says: The federal government's refonns to youth welfare payments are welcome. But given the high unemployment among young people, it was inevitable the moves would draw critics. Equally predictable are opposition attempts to score points off the government over its attempts to come to grips with this sensitive issue. On cue, minority senators threaten to water down the refonns. But many Australians with first-hand experience of the problem of teenage unemployment will agree that the government deserves support in its attempt to instil a sense of purpose into the young and to equip them to take their place in an increasingly sophisticated workplace. Not the least of the anomalies in the system today is the fact that, in some cases, young people are paid more to stay on the dole than to go on Austudy. This absurdity ignores the reality that young people with the least education face the biggest hurdle in getting jobs. That says it all. Another editorial, in the Daily Telegraph on 18 June, quite appropriately says that this legislation: . . . redirects the responsibility for looking after children away from the state and back to the family. Those opposite expect the government to look after people from the cradle to the grave. The editorial goes on to say: It should not be the government's duty to make it easy for adolescents to waste their lives, or for parents to avoid their responsibilities. The government's role is to encourage-even force-young people towards the education and training they will need to make themselves contributing members of society. It is the role of mothers and fathers to be involved in that preparation for later life, even if only by paying for them when required. The Australian Financial Review had an editorial on 19 June, and it states that the legislation we are debating here today should be: ... vigorously applauded. So should its move to replace a range of youth benefits-including unemployment, Austudy and family allowancewith a single payment, and its efforts to push the young jobless to improve their skills rather than remain idle ... Together, these changes help engender a culture of self-improvemen.t rather than the welfare-dependence and dole culture which has crept into Australian life. It is obvious that what many of those newspaper editorials and the media community, which are not traditionally supporters of this government, have done is stand up and say, in the public arena, that this policy is right, it is fair and it is just, and that we are removing the disincentives for young Australians to be expelled from the education system and thrust into unemployment queues. This is legislation of which our government is extremely proud. I believe that everyone ought to congratulate the Minister for Social Security on bringing this legislation about and for making a very positive social policy reform. I am confident that we will receive the strong support of this parliament. People ask: what is the youth allowance? It is an income support payment to around 560,000 young people, including students and those looking for work. It replaces five existing payments for young people: Austudy for students under 25 years of age, the youth training allowance, the newstart allowance and the sickness allowance for under-21-yearoIds, and the more than minimum family payment for secondary students aged 16 to 18. What we are doing by bringing in this legislation is assisting young people to make key decisions about their future, education, training and employment by making income support arrangements simpler and more flexible. What we seek to do is to encourage young people to complete and further their education. I would hope that the honourable member  the government in this matter. In some areas he has shown himself to be a forward thinker, but I suspect his party allegiance will ensure that he stands up and delivers a 20-minute speech in which even he does not believe.",124
259,Mr CADMAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,On airports he was forward thinking.,126
260,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"He has been forward thinking, but I suspect that he is going to go back to the ice age in his contribution in relation to this particular legislation. Some people suggest that as a government what we are seeking to do is to cut money and save money. The honourable member for Newcastle was one of those who suggested that this policy was being driven by a desire to cut costs. The reality is that this is not a savings measure. The program costs, not induding running costs, will mean an additional spending of $25 million in the first year. Clearly, we are prepared to spend this money as an investment in the future of our young Australians. We all ought to always understand that young people are our nation's future, and this government has had the intestinal fortitude to bring forward a policy which will improve outcomes for young Australians. It is eminently regrettable that those ite, once again, are playing politics. Those opposite are refusing to face reality. Those opposite are participating in a scare campaign and a campaign of deception of the Australian people. The honourable member for Newcastle accused us of being an anti-family party. Has he forgotten that it has been only a few months since we delivered the $1 billion a year family tax cut in full and on time? Australian families are now more than $34 per week better off. We have delivered the lowest home loan interest rates in 30 years, and that is a saving in interest of $330 a month for the average home buyer.  buy a home.",126
261,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I challenge you, my friend, to come over here and support this legislation.",126
262,Mr CADMAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Hear, hear!",126
263,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I would urge you not to make idle, ridiculous and stupid interjections in my speech. I would urge that you be statesmanlike-that you buck the party forces on your side of the chamber and that you support what this government and what this party are seeking to do for Australian families. We have also delivered a tax cut of up to $450 for private health insurance, as promised. We have delivered a tax cut on savings of up to $450 per taxpayer per year. We have delivered a safer community by reducing the number of firearms, along with banning semiautomatic firearms. I must say that the opposition did support us on that one. We have delivered more apprenticeships to create more jobs for our kids. We have delivered a crackdown on welfare cheats that Labor was too weak to do. We have saved over $1 billion in taxpayers' money. We have delivered fairer new workplace relations laws that allow Australians to find a better balance between work and family commitments. I know the parliamentary secretary at the table has supported the minister in implementing this legislation. We have delivered the largest environmental package in Australia's history to make Australia a better place for all Australians. We have delivered a plan for better literacy skills for our kids. And we have opposdelivered a government for all of us. I would urge the honourable member for Newcastle to go back and look at what this government has done. I would urge him to maybe come back and apologise for his accusation that we are an anti-family government. What absolute nonsense. The simple fact of the matter is that we have the runs on the board, and we do not apologise for this youth allowance package, which we believe is a very positive package. Under the youth allowance, unemployed young people aged 18 to 20 will be subject to a parental means test and treated in the same way as full-time students. This arrangement will require families to support their children until they have achieved financial independence, where they can afford to do so. I see that as being eminently supportable. Having children is a lifetime vocation. I find both abhorrent and repugnant the notion we have heard from those opposite that somehow, when young people attain the age of 18 years, parents no longer have responsibility for them. Another element of the youth allowance will mean that payments to young people under 18 years of age who have to live away from home will be increased and that rent assistance will be extended to students, both measures benefiting particularly those from rural areas. The education legal waiting period will be abolished, ensuring that young people in lower income families are not left without income support for up to three months after they leave school. The independence criteria which allow the parental means test to be waived will be more realistic, and special safety net criteria will ensure that young people aged over 18 with work force experience will not be disadvantaged. The Austudy minimum payment of $1,000 per annum will be abolished, and the flexible activity test requirements will encourage young people to remain in education while enabling support for those for whom full-time schooling is not an appropriate option. The honourable member for Newcastle suggested that we were, in effect, throwing young people out of education and we were not making provision for those for whom education was not a viable option. That is simply an enormous departure from the facts. As I have said, there will be costs in the first year of $25 million. This is a very generous action by the government. Some 122,000 students will benefit from the alignment of rates and access to rent assistance. I think that is a very positive action and I believe it is strongly supported by the Australian people. Some people have suggested, particularly the honourable member for Newcastle, that parental means testing is in some way inappropriate. The legislation will ensure that the impact of parental means testing on 18to 20-year-old unemployed young people will be reduced in a number of ways. It will be reduced by the special safety net criteria, under which those disadvantaged in education or the labour market will be granted youth allowance free of parental means testing if they have worked full time for 12 months or more and are aged at least 18 years and living away from home. It will be reduced by the fact that young people can qualify as independent if they are married or have been in a de facto relationship for at least two years or have a dependent child or are homeless. It will be reduced by preserving the entitlements of those on payment at the time of announcement of youth announcement until they turn 21 years of age, and by the abolition of the education leavers' waiting period to ensure continuity of income support between completing school and starting work. It will also be reduced by the continuation of maximum rates of payment to children from low income families, including those whose parents are pensioners or beneficiaries. All of these facts contained in this package point out that the honourable member for Newcastle and other Labor speakers are involved in an absolutely shameful and indefensible scare campaign reminiscent of the appalling use of politics which we saw recently over nursing homes. This is a very positive initiative by the government. This is good policy. It is a good social policy reform. It is fair, equitable, decent, right and proper, and it is backed strongly by the Australian electorate. By opposing our youth allowance package, the Labor Party once again is showing how irrelevant it is to Australian politics. We all remember that Labor was reduced to 49 seats at the last election. We all know that the Liberal Party has 76 seats and that the National Party has 18 seats. Together, as a government, we are strongly governing this nation with 94 members of parliament. Instead of saying that they got it wrong at the last election, instead of saying that people rightly rejected them, they limp into the parliament bill after bill after bill announcing their opposition to our attempts to repair the situation that we inherited. They were in office for 13 years and they did absolutely nothing to benefit this country in any major way. Yet they are proving themselves to be the great knockers of Australian politics. Instead of engaging with us in a constructive policy debate, they are coming out and opposing every initiative which we are seeking to implement: I think the Australian people are sick and tired of politicians who merely play negative politics. I think they would prefer the Labor Party to say they have looked at this particular legislation and they either support it or reject it for reasons. However, the Labor Party is taking the view that, because the government has announced the youth allowance, because it is government policy, because the Labor Party is close controlling the Senate in certain circumAnderson stances, it can get away with this shameful departure into playing party politics. The future of our young people is far too importacknowledge ant for the Labor Party to seek to destroy being involved in a deceitful and despicable scare campaign over the youth allowance.",126
264,Mr CADMAN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,Thank goodness Cheryl has gone.,128
265,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Cheryl has gone from the Democrats, and I strongly suspect that she will not make it into the House of Representatives as a representative for Dickson. To tum back to the legislation, this package has very strong community support. It will simplify income support arrangements for young people. It will remove current incentives for them to leave education. It will ensure that parents continue to look after children when this is fair, right and approprithat ate. I think this is great legislation. I want to take this opportunity to pause a moment to say that the Minister for Social Security ought to receive the congratulations of everyone. This is a well thought out piece of legislation. It is an outstanding social reform, and Australian youth will be infinitely better off when it ultimately becomes law. commend the bill to the House.  Deputy Speaker Nehl, I am sure you will extend the same great latitude to me that colleague the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) enjoyed in his contribution. Firstly, I have apologise for disappointing the member for Fisher. I am under no great party threat; my own decision not to support him and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bi1l1997. I would like explain why. In doing so, I will refer to a couple of bipartisan examples. A parliamentary committee that I was that pleased to chair brought down a report in March 1991 on student financial assistance. these One of the key recommendations of that report was that we ought to lower the age of independence for Austudy from 25 years to 21 years and that it ought to be done progressively. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be to pleased to know that your colleagues John and Bruce Scott supported that recommendation, as did all members of the then opposition, to their great credit, and I their contribution. It is a pity by that the member for Fisher did not elaborate in his contribution as to why now, some six years later, we have this great backflip. I went through the report again before I was due to speak, just to check the recommendations-I thought it was one of the recommendations. I do recall that the then opposition, now government, members were making the point that they were very concerned about students who went on to senior years of education, that is, years 11 and 12, with the sole purpose of collecting Austudy. They felt that there ought to be some hurdles involved. Whilst we did not make a recommendation their around that, I do wish to acknowledge that view was not dismissed and was respected by the committee as a whole. What do we see now? There has been a detailed study in for five high schools in my electorate. I can report to the House that in New South Wales the average retention rate in years 10, 11 and 12 is 66 per cent. The best of those five schools has a retention rate of 50 per cent and, if my memory serves me correctly, one I of them dips down to about 35 per cent. I am trying to say that there is a majority amongst those five high schools of students who are actually leaving. When this youth allowance your came in and was designed to take away from the numbers of people who were unemployed, to that is, ages 16 and 17 not in schooling, I calculated-and I regret correcting the honit is ourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham)that it was not some 200-odd students that would be affected in my electorate but some to 320. Again, I say to the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), who is so enthusiastic about this package, that even the department recognised that if you are going to have 320 students in my electorate forced back into school, as this legislation is clearly designed to achieve, then schools will need extra resources. I think it is a little disruptive to have so many students going back into 12 high schools in my electorate with probably the single purpose of collecting that allowance. It is not good for them and I think it is even worse for the students that are actually there. Do not take my figure, Mr Deputy Speaker, the department calculates that there will be 27,000 students so affected and schools need $140 million to cater for this extra increase. There is not one dollar extra allocated in this bill to cater for this-not one dollar. I said I would refer to two reports. I must say the first report I was associated with was called The Restless Years, an inquiry into year 11 and 12 retention rates. It is very clear from this report that student needs are changing over time. I think it is the first report parliament to actually recommend senior high. schools with feeder junior high schools, which I think in electorates like mine have a great utility. Indeed, probably New South Wales is the most under-represented state as far as public senior high schools are concerned, and I would like to see that changing. There is one thing guaranteed about education and that is that you may feel that there are very sharp divisions between high schools, TAPEs and universities, but over time they are going to blur quite significantly. We really need flexible structures. In my own electorate I have championed for the past 10 years, together with my state parliamentary colleagues, the cause of having a senior high school in Mount Druitt. We are very close to getting it. Again, the campaign 10 years ago resulted in St Mary's Senior High School, the very first public senior high school in New South Wales, but without feeder junior highs from years 7 to 10. For this senior high school, I am strongly advocating a few propositions. There should not be merely vocational subjects that may have T AFE accreditation, that is, vocational subjects designed by the department of education. I believe that we have a unique opportunityto place TAPE courses in the high schools. We also have the opportunity to have flexible hours for the school. Why should senior students, in years 11 and 12, operate merely from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock? The experience generally' speaking is that many students to survive in years 11 and 12 take part-time jobs. I do not think this is a bad thing; I think it is a very good thing. But whether you think it is a bad thing or a good thing, students are doing it and we ought to take note of it. The other issue that I would like to take up is the real need to give students second chances at education, but not by compulsion. The real problem is that we have to make schools attractive. It is not a problem with independent schools. They have a retention rate of 100 per cent. I think Cammeray is burdened with one student in that suburb going back under this legislation where there are 320 in my electorate. You do not have of the to worry about independent schools. I am talking about the poorer independent schools and certainly public schools. We need to make them attractive to students, and we need to make relevant what is being offered to students. For those that slip under the wire, we need to give them second chance opportunities. Indeed, we need to encourage adults back into schools. This already occurs, but they ought to be encouraged in greater numbers. There is nothing in this legislation that is going to facilitate that. It is all about compulsion; it is all about telling these things to students who, for whatever reason, have left school. The students that leave in years 11 and 12 are not the students that I have the greatest concern for, although we should be concerned for them. The students that I have the greatest concern for are those that leave in grade 6, year 7, year 8 or year 9. They are the ones who are dropping out of the system. Debate interrupted. NA",128
266,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Second Sydney Airport",129
267,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"In the adjournment debate tonight I would like to comment on the growing campaign that is now happening in western Sydney against the construction of the international airport at Badgerys Creek. This is a campaign which represents the true aspirations and concerns of a great majority of the 1.4 million people living in western Sydney. This is a campaign which has at its roots ordinary peoplepeople not concerned about politics or about winning elections but people concerned about their health, their lifestyles and the safety future of their children. This is a campaign which we have only just begun to fight. It is a campaign which has barely begun to pick up steam. If the federal government thought the political stink kicked up by the community groups in Sydney's inner city over the third runway was big-if they thought that campaign created a political headache-wait until they see what will happen if they persist in ramming this international airport down our throats. It is also a campaign which is no longer simply limited to the suburbs of western Sydney. Just a few short weeks ago we saw a welcome escalation in the fight against Badgerys Creek when the city councils which make up the anti-airport Western Sydney Alliance led the NSW Local Government Association Conference in a resolution which saw it remove from its policy statement on transport any support for Badgerys Creek. Previously, the official policy of the NSW Local Government Association was that 'local government support the construction of Badgerys Creek airport to international standard.' Such a policy no longer exists. The question of supporting an airport at Badgerys Creek has now been referred to the LGA's executive, which will discuss the matter again once the EIS has been handed down. 0 f course, this is a major victory-a major first step in the grassroots campaign against B adgerys Creek. I am proud of the way in which all the councils in Sydney's west, bar Liverpool City Council, are now working together on this issue. Through their solidarity and their shared concern-a concern which is, as I have said, above party politics-they have managed to convince other councils throughout NSW that Badgerys Creek is not the way to go. Since I am talking about Sydney's west, it is a continuing cause of concern for me that while the councils, which are members of the Western Sydney Alliance, are actively representing the concerns of their constituents in relation to Badgerys Creek and while members such as myself and the members for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) and Chifley (Mr Price) are regularly standing up in this House and and expressing our constituent's objections to Badgerys Creek, we still have an almost deathly quiet on the subject when it comes to the Liberal Party members for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), Macquarie (Mr Bartlett), Macarthur (Mr Fahey) and Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron). The councils in each of these member's electorates-Penrith, Parramatta, Blue Mountains, Camden and Wollondilly-have all joined the fight against Badgerys Creek. Each of these councils know and understand the feelings of the people they represent and are speaking out accordingly. The question must then be asked, 'If this is the case, why aren't we hearing anything on this subject from the federal members who represent these areas?' In not speaking up about what is worrying their constituents in relation to Badgerys Creek, these four members are not fulfilling their duties as representatives of this parliament. They are, for all intents and purposes, ignoring their constituents. Why? Is it because they do not care one way or another? Is it because they just have not got around to talking about it yet or is it because they support Badgerys Creek? Their constituents want to know; in fact, we would all like to know. The member for Lindsay was saying in one of her local papers the other week how she was going to mail out a survey to each of her constituents in order to gauge their opinions on Badgerys Creek. The member for Lindsay should save her postal allowance. She should send her constituents a Christmas card instead. For the price of a local telephone call I or anyone of her constituents could quite easily tell her that the people of Penrith-the people of western Sydney-do not want an airport at Badgerys Creek. Perhaps the member for Lindsay, along with her western Sydney colleagues, has not seen the contour maps for Badgerys Creek options A, B or C and how they will send screaming jumbo jets over the heart of her electorate 24 hours a day. Perhaps, as relatively new members, they are still learning the ropes and have not been able to organise themselves into finding the time to come into this House and let their constituents know their opinions on Badgerys Creek. Or perhaps it is the other alternative I mentioned earlier. By their silence on this matter, are they giving their implicit support for a 24-hour international airport at Badgerys Creek? I think the next stage of this campaign should be getting these members to state clearly and unambiguously their positions on Badgerys Creek-to nail their colours to the mast. Their constituents do not want to hear excuses. They do not want to hear them making justifications. They want a simple answer to the question: do you support an international airport at Badgerys Creek, yes or no? The longer these four members fail to come clean on this very straightforward question, the sooner their constituents will come to the only conclusion left open to them-that is, their federal representatives want to build a 24-hour international airport at Badgerys Creek. Let these members tell their constituents at Parramatta, Penrith, Wollondilly, Camden and the Blue Mountains what they truly think of this particular proposal. I believer that time is of the essence. We must come out united on this so that our constituents know that we are fighting the fight for them. (Time expired) Cricket: Possible Strike",130
268,Mr TONY SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"We all know the phrase 'It's just not cricket.' It seems though that some have forgotten what it really means. Did I actually hear a serious suggestion that members of the Australian cricket team intend to strike? Apparently, yes. Just over 20 years ago, coinciding it would seem with the introduction of the Packer circus, we saw the commencement of a decline in the standards of cricket etiquette. Now the pace has quickened to an ever rapid downward spiral. Where once the only sound on a cricket field was an appeal or bat on ball or bat on pad, snick, and generally a genuine one, or a complimentary nod or word just of approval or some byplay, we have now become accustomed to seeing cricket become an arena for the nasty and the horrible in sport. In fact, it seems a trend across a lot of sports but it is almost intolerable to see it on the cricket field. As someone who has followed and played the game all my life, it is not a nice thing to witness. Sir Donald Bradman has touched on this, as have others, including the late great Alan MCGilvray. They referred to it as 'sledging'. For that I substitute 'cheating and boorish behaviour'. I am ashamed to say that Australian cricketers at a senior level have become past masters of it. We now see it in junior cricket. Some years ago, I was umpiring cricket at the junior level. I must say that it was something that I felt was an absolute blot on the game. I would no-ball a bowler who came in and had the rest of his team talking to the batsman before he had delivered the ball. That was not in the rules of the game, but it cut it out. Now we have the suggestion of a strike. I do not mind saying with absolute unequivocation that the people who are playing cricket for Australia are grossly overpaid now. To hear some commentators extolling the current Australian cricket captain for his ability to let balls go outside the off stump merely serves to highlight my point-and he is the highest paid of the lot. The Australian Cricket Board, in my view, needs to take a very firm stand on this issue. I am sure there are plenty of excellent cricketers around this country who would don the baggy green cap for nothing. When we think of the great Australian cricketers that have gone before the current brace, some of them should look into the history books and examine their current behaviour. The Australian cricketers, by their behaviour, in my view, shame the memory of the great Australian cricketers who did just that for their country and the game. That was cricket. This behaviour is simply not cricket. Cooked Chicken Meat Mr FITZGffiBON (Hunter) (10.39 p.m.)The last time. I rose in this place to speak on the adjournment debate was 29 October. On that occasion, members will recall that I was having a little stoush with the member for Paterson (Mr Baldwin) over a stunt he had run on the cooked chicken meat importation issue. Members will recall that the member for Paterson lodged a private member's motion for 27 October. The motion was a strongly worded condemnation of the proposal to import cooked chicken meat into this country. But, as I said at the time, the motion was a stunt because the member for Paterson knew, as I knew, that there was not a hope that that motion would get on for debate before the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) made his announcement on the decision-something everyone knew was imminent. Members will recall that the opposition gave the member for Paterson the opportunity to have his motion debated on 29 October, but he declined the offer. Surprise, surprise! On Friday, 7 November, just nine days after he was given that opportunity, the minister for primary industries announced his decision to allow Thailand, Denmark and the United States to import cooked chicken meat into this country. Despite all the posturing and loud noises from the member for Paterson, who promised to cross the floor on the issue but when given the opportunity flew the coop, the decision has now been made. But my electorate office is receiving lots calls. People in my electorate are confused. They do not understand why on that evening on NBN and Prime television the member for Paterson was popping the cork and drinking champagne, celebrating the minister's decision. They cannot understand why the bloke who was going to cross the floor was celebrating. 'Hasn't the government approved the imports?' they ask my office. The member for Paterson's newspaper column did nothing to clear the matter in their eyes. Let me read part of his column to the House. He said: If you haven't yet heard, my Herculean fight to protect the chicken industry, our region's largest rural income earner, has been vindicated. He went on to say: In a ground breaking announcement last week, the Federal Government, via the nation's quarantine authority AQIS, has blocked any cooked chicken meat imports from Thailand. But when you read the AQIS media release, it clearly says: Imports of cooked chicken meat from Denmark, the USA and Thailand will be allowed into Australia. That is a direct quote from the AQIS media release. So here we have evidence of the member for Paterson misleading the people of the Hunter region once again. He is on the news popping the champagne cork as if he has blocked cooked chicken meat imports and in his columns he said those things. Let me give another quote from the same column. He said: Let me repeat, the chicken industry, our supermarkets and sandwich shops will continue to wholly and solely stock Australian chicken. What an extraordinary claim to make. This is blatant misleading of the electorate-an electorate that relies so heavily on the chicken growing and processing industries. The member for Paterson will be in here in the adjournment debate tomorrow night, no doubt, responding. He will say that the more stringent cooking requirements the government has imposed will mean that less chicken will come into this country. For the sake of the argument, and for the sake of moving on, let us grant him that for the moment, let us just humour him for a moment. What about the hygiene issues? What about the human of health issues? What about the fact that we know that none of the Thai plants nominated have HACCP systems in place. That is why the minister will not release the report of the delegation that visited that country. We do not know what is the situation in Denmark and the USA because we have not had any delegations go there. But, that aside, the main point I want to make in the House tonight is this: the Howard-Fischer government has now said yes to the importation of cooked chicken meat into this country. Attempts by the member for Paterson to convince his constituents that that is not· the case is nothing short of fraud. I think, in the longer run, his constituents will be a wake up to that. (Time expired) Native Title",131
269,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise as a member of the federal government accused by the chairman of the Cape York Land Council and Aboriginal advocate, Noel Pearson, of being 'racist scum'. I rise also as a human being, an Australian who holds the view that, whatever else this nation achieves, if there is not an improvement in the health and living conditions endured by indigenous Australians we will have achieved nothing. Native title is new for Australia. It is a concept to which we are only beginning to adjust. It is as complex as it is unpredictable. This generation has a moral responsibility to right as much as practicable the wrongs of the past. Central to any legislative or cultural response to the Wik postscript to Mabo is the eternal question: how would I feel if this were done to me? The traditional Aboriginal bond with land is said to be unlike that experienced by any other group of people-a deep and enduring love, conservation and celebration of the country, which has frequently been described to me as 'mother'. Only one other group come close-people who see the whole of their lives, both cultural and physical, as being bound up in their relationship to land. They are people who, despite years of natural disaster and negative incomes, occasionally have to be removed at gunpoint by creditors who 'don't understand'. They are called pastoralists. Out of this modem tragedy for our country, pitted against one another at times, are two groups of people who have a relationship with the land that I will never begin to understand. Native title is being upheld by the government. Of concern is not the principle of the High Court's decision in Wik but the way it relates to the retrospectively flawed Native Title Act. What good will it do the most impoverished and most disadvantaged people in this country, Aboriginal Australians, if the battle for one-sided native title law is won but the war against preventable disease and existential despair is lost? With almost three-quarters of Australia now potentially under claim, and with it wealth generating potential from which those with neither power nor influence ultimately benefit, economic certainty for primary industries is security for us all. Who could not feel a sense of anguished shame at the injustices of the past-acts that must be understood if reconciliation is to mean anything at all? I think an unembellished recounting by Aboriginal people separated from their families forcibly in past generations to a joint sitting of the federal parliament would be a good start. All of us, both black and white, and all of us from all political parties have a great responsibility to forge with restraint the future which is now upon us. Reconciliation will not ever be found in a statute; nor will perfection ever be seen by all parties in the lO-point plan. Two hundred and twenty years of European domination, settlement and property law cannot be unravelled easily, whatever the nobility of the cause. The time has come for reason to prevail in recognising that our responsibility is as much to the future as it is to the past. But in doing that we need to understand and be reconciled with our past. Those who use the word 'racist', whomever they are, do so to diminish the currency of their message. Those who lack restraint frequently fail to achieve their own goals no matter how worthy they may be. Those who covet greatness without restraint will not ever succeed. Sometimes we all have to rise above our own self-interest and the perspective of our own position and seek to understand as best we can the position of others. The nation is at a turning point in its history at the moment, and we have a great opportunity and an enormous responsibility to see that we come to terms with one another and our past. We need to support those things that serve the long-term interests of the nation. This is one such time, and I call on  industry and I call on people in this place to give some thought to their responsibilities to the future. Stockton Rifle Range  p.m.)-On a southern coastal boundary of Paterson electorate lies Stockton Rifle Range, where thousands of troops were trained during World War II. The range is in good order, the mounds are well maintained and the mechanism for raising and lowering the targets at the butts is immediately behind a wall of shifting sand dunes. Sufficient of the targets are maintained by various rifle clubs that use the range. Regrettably, the army, over time, has removed some of the target mechanisms. Immediately adjacent to the northern edge of the rifle range are four anti-aircraft gun emplacements and several above-ground slit concrete trenches that led to' the command post during wartime. Slightly further to the north beyond the hind dunes is a heavy weapons proof testing area and several concrete gun pits that were positioned to repel a possible beach landing by the Japanese. The weapons are gone but the gun pits, the heavy concrete access road, building foundations, a strong room and sections of various buildings remain among the wattle brush and amongst the foliage in that area. Together they constituted the northern perimeter defence of Port Newcastle, with its vital steel, shipbuilding and coal industries. These heritage assets belong to the people of our region. The Department of Defence has a responsibility to protect them, not to destroy them. I am advised that the Department of Defence has advised the rifle clubs that they must vacate the rifle range by 14 December 1997 so that demolition of structural or built impediments to development of that range can begin immediately. We must not allow this to happen. The proof range area I mentioned is under the control of the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service. Adjacent to it on the western side is land for which rezoning is being sought for housing purposes. I believe that this land will not be rezoned but ultimately will become part of the Stockton Bight National Park. The Hunter coastal defence system began at Swansea Heads in my electorate. Aboom net was in place across the entrance to Lake Macquarie. A little further to the north, at Cold Tea Creek, was the Belmont anti-tank ditch installation, which was designed to halt the northward movement of Japanese should they land on the beach north of the entrance to the lake at a place called Blacksmiths. The anti-tank installation was a southern perimeter defence of Port Newcastle, having been constructed in mid-1942. Some of the soldiers who participated in this construction are alive and with us today. From Swansea Heads to Belmont, the continuing beach defence barbed wire system, Shepherd's Hill, Fort Scratchley and Fort Wallace, Stockton Rifle Range, with its antiaircraft guns and the northern perimeter defences, stretched a comprehensive defence system of Port Newcastle. Stockton Rifle Range and its anti-aircraft gun emplacements are vital items of our defence heritage that were built in a time of great crisis at the only time in our history that our region was attacked by enemy forces. The shelling of .Newcastle by a Japanese submarine in June 1942 is testimony to the perils of that time. Every resident of our region, every ex-serviceman and every ex-servicewoman is entitled to see the rifle range and the gun emplacements retained for future generations as part of our defence heritage. I ask the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) to give an assurance that no demolition of any kind will take place at Stockton Rifle Range or nearby. I ask the minister that these heritage assets be fully protected until a comprehensive heritage assessment is carried out of the range, the butts, the target mechanism and the anti-aircraft gun emplacements nearby. The range can be maintained free of cost by the members of the clubs that use it. As a rifle range and a defence heritage asset, it can be a valued part of our tourism infrastructure. Few people in our region know the butts in the proof range and the northern perimeter defence systems; they do not know they exist. They have never heard of the anti-aircraft gun emplacements. They are concealed by the wattle foliage and the vegetation that has grown through the area since World War II. What is there belongs to the people of our region. The dunes behind the butts are mobile and would have to be stabilised at considerable cost before any development could take place. It is ironic that a few weeks ago the chief of the defence forces, General John Baker AC, was at Williamtown air base seeking the support and cooperation of business and community leaders for the participation of their employees in the part-time defence forces. I ask now the Minister for Defence and General Baker to respect our defence heritage assets and ensure that they are retained for future generations to help them understand the peril in which our region was placed during World War II. Job Placement, Employment and . Training Program",133
270,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"On Friday, 24 October, I had the very great pleasure of launching a job placement, employment and training project in my electorate of Makin. The project in Makin will be administered by the Salvation Army Ingle Farm Community Service. One of the most very important jobs of this government is to facilitate the creation of jobs, particularly our young people. Unemployment is the most pressing social problem Australia currently faces and the successful resolution of this issue must remain our main aim. The JPET program will help more than 8,000 young people throughout Australia. This employment growth initiative will create 90 nationwide programs at a cost of $11 million. I believe this is money wisely spent to help young people find employment and give them that opportunity to control their own destinies. The project in my electorate has received from the Howard government funding of $107,980 to provide assistance to the young homeless. Members on this side of the House understand the difficulties faced by some young people in gaining the necessary skills and experience needed to find employment. For those of our young who are homeless, finding employment without assistance is almost impossible. That is why I was so pleased to be able to be part of something as positive and as practical as the Howard government's JPET scheme. Unlike previous programs, JPET provides real opportunities for the unemployed by assisting those who have been working with the young homeless people and who know first-hand the difficulties and the pressures they face. The Salvation Army is a magnificent institution which deserves the full praise of each and every member of the House. I am extremely proud of the people involved with the Salvation Army Ingle Farm Community Service. People like Colonel Alan Walker, who came from interstate, and Captain Casey participated in the launch of the Pooraka JPET project, as did other members of my local community who have demonstrated their commitment to the community in which we live-people like Pat St Clair Dixon, the former mayor of Salisbury, who is now working in a volunteer capacity to help the carers of the north and north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. I would also like to thank Counsellor Peter Panagaris, Deputy Mayor of the City of Tea Tree Gully, and the Hon. John Dawkins MLC for their support for the JPET project in Pooraka. The Pooraka JPET project will provide for young homeless people of Makin with assistance to find a safe place to live and help them to rebuild their confidence and self-esteem. Too often our young people lose hope. John Howard's JPET program restores their hope and their pride in themselves. The Pooraka project will involve such things as adventure camping and various other outdoor activities which will lift the motivation of the participants and assist them to develop interpersonal skills through team activities. There will also be referral to drug-alcohol rehabilitation and support programs for those who need it. Work experience and training will also be part of this project. Past governments created expensive programs which did little to solve the tragedy of unemployment but which gave their instigators a warm inner glow. The JPET program, however, is something different. It provides funding for the community so that the community can work to resolve the problems it faces. With a grant of $100,000, the Salvation Army can do more practical good work than a thousand centralised bureaucratic programs with fancy names and glossy programs. At the end of the day, JPET will provide real hope and real jobs for those young people who are most in need of our support. New South Wales Liberal Party",135
271,Mr MUTCH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to place on the public record some concerns about the current state of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party and to demand a democratic plebiscite for the bona fide members of the Liberal Party in the federal electorate conference of Cook-that is a vote of all financial members-to determine their candidate for the next federal election. I am the only federal Liberal member in New South Wales to face preselection. This is despite the personal intervention by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and an agreement, subsequently made public, which has been blatantly disregarded. Despite the best efforts of the Prime Minister, the currently dominant faction in the New South Wales Liberal Party, known as the 'group', has shown no regard for the stability of the party or respect for his authority. Although I for one acted in good faith on the agreement, to my own detriment, I should perhaps have realised the perfidy of these people. Over the last few years their disregard for the democratic procedures of the party has become endemic. I have written a report entitled Winner take all, which is an account of the misuse and abuse of the rules and procedures of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party in the federal electorate conference of Cook. The report sets out the manner in which the 'group', using Young Liberal activists, other willing opportunists and many dupes, has manipulated loopholes in the rules and procedures of the division to gain control of the federal conference. My report deals with, among other things, Young Liberal double dipping, pre-AGM branch stacking, central payment of memberships, the inappropriate rejection of memberships and intimidatory and offensive behaviour. The New South Wales division is unique in the Liberal Party in its tolerance of these rorts, which are generally outlawed in other divisions. The unwillingness of the division to rectify these wrongs is a reflection of the fact that the effectively governing body of the division, the state executive, is under the control of 'group' operatives. Despite the fact that I have raised serious complaints that my wife has been physically harassed and slandered and that supporters have been abused and intimidated at meetings, including elderly members, my complaints have fallen on deaf ears. For a party that presumes to stand for decent behaviour, this apparent lack of concern has been profoundly disappointing. lam not prepared to tolerate the orchestrated abuse to which my wife and I and our supporters have been subjected at ordinary Liberal Party meetings. It astonished me that it took the management committee of the division three weeks to overturn one crucial meeting that was",136

Hawke by the Kimberley Land Council (KC) in his capacity as administrator of Kimberley Aboriginal Pastoral Association (KAPA). (2) What sum has been paid to Mr Hawke in total by the KC.",136
273,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PAPERS,"The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has provided the following information to the J..f)nourable member's question: (1) I have been advised by ATSIC that in 1996/97 Mr Steve Hawke received $41,445 before tax, from the Kimberley Land Council (KC) for his services as a consultant administrator of the Kimberley Aboriginal Pastoral Association (KAPA). (2) I am advised that Mr Hawke did not receive any other payment from the KC during 1996/97. Essendon Airport (Question No. 1729) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 15 May 1997: (1) Further to the answer to question No.1044 (Hansard, 14 May 1997, page 3557), is it a fact that the strobe lights in place on the approach to runway 34 at Melbourne Airport failed to provide the pilot of a Lufthansa 747 with the intended warning on 24 February 1991 when the aircraft descended to approximately 300m in preparation for a landing at Essendon Airport. (2) Is it a fact that the crew of the aircraft referred to in part (1) later admitted that they have seen reflections near Essendon airport which they mistook for strobe lights. (3) What action was taken by the Federal Airports Corporation or other bodies to rectify NA deficiencies in the strobe light warning made apparent by this incident. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) According to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) Aircraft Occurrence Report 9101112 into this incident, the weather in the Melbourne area at the time was clear, with good visibility. Runway 34 was in use and visual approaches were required. The aircraft, which was approaching Melbourne Airport from the west, was radar vectored onto base leg and descended to 3000 feet. At 1704 hours Melbourne Approach Control advised the crew that their position was nine miles. south-west of the field. They were asked to advise when they had the runway in sight and also to say when the runway 34 lead-in strobe lights were sighted. Shortly after, the crew responded that they had the runway and strobe lights in sight. Approach Control gave the crew their position as six miles south-west of the field, told them to make a visual approach and not to descend below one thousand five hundred feet until established on final. At 1706 hours the controller told the crew they were approaching the runway extended centre line. The Approach Controller noted that the aircraft was passing through the extended centre line and had not turned to line up with runway 34. He promptly issued instructions to the aircraft to climb to 2000 feet. At about the same stage the crew realised that the runway they had been looking at was too short for their operations and also decided to go around. Further radar vectors were given and the aircraft subsequently landed normally on runway 34 at Melbourne Airport without any other problems. (2) The BASI Report finds that Runway 35 at Essendon Airport was the runway sighted by the pilots. It does not have lead-in strobe lights. The crew indicated they must have seen reflections near Essendon which they mistook for strobe lights. On the approach the crew had seen a runway from a long way out, which they thought was the north/south runway for Melbourne Airport, but was in fact runway 35 at Essendon Airport. In the must lighting conditions at the time they did not see Melbourne Airport, until on the go around. (3) BASI has advised that their investigation into this incident did not find any breach of safety procedures, such as a breakdown in separation, nor did the investigation make any recommendations  advised that no further action was taken after this incident. Fuel Tax Increases (Question No. 1731) Mr Cobb asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 October 1997: On what dates, and by what figure, were federal fuel taxes increased each year since 1983.

Fuel excise rates have also been changed due to such factors as changes in the Crude Oil Import Parity Price. In addition, under the previous Government the rates were also changed for Budget revenue purposes. The attached tables detail the changes in fuel excise rates for the period 1983 to May 1997.

274,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The only Medicare data available to my Department on the use of alternative therapies by general practitioners is for attendance at which acupuncture is performed. A table of services and benefits paid under this item since 1992 is attached. (2) The number of general practitioners billing Medicare for the acupuncture item since 1992 is shown in the attached table. There are no other items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule for alternative therapies. (3) The Medicare Schedule fee for acupuncture (Item 173) is $21.65. Doctors are free to set their own fees for all items on the Schedule. (4) No. (5) The Government is not providing funding for the proposed national centre for the teaching and research on alternative medical techniques. Its composition is a matter for the alternative medicine industry. . (6) The question of extending Medicare benefits coverage to a wider range of allied health care, has been considered on a number of occasions in the context of periodic review of the national health care system, including Medicare. However, the previous government decided on each occasion that it was not possible to extend these arrangements and in the current climate of economic restraint this is' still the case. .

(2) What direct steps is the National Strategy Against Violence and Crime taking to prevent residential burglaries in Australia. (3) Is it a fact that there is an established between residential burglaries and other crime to drug addiction and drug abuse; if so, must the National Strategy Against Violence and Crime combat drug abuse to have any success in reducing crime; if not, why not. (4) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to figures produced by Mr R. Marks of the Australian Graduate School of Management in 1991 which estimated that drug use was the root cause of (a) 63% of Victorian house burglaries, (b) 50% of break-and-enter crimes in NSW and (c) 46% of armed robberies in NSW; if so, what is his response. (5) Further to part (4), is the Minister able to provide more up-to-date figures on the number of (a) residential burglaries, (b) armed robberies and (c) assaults carried out in Australia in which drug abuse and addiction are the motivating factors; if not, why not. (6) What parts of the National Strategy Against Violence and Crime target reducing drug abuse and addiction as a means of fighting crime. Mr Williams-The Minister for Justice has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) On 5 June 1997 the Prime Minister officially launched the National Campaign Against Violence Providers of Acupuncture Services, Number of and Benefits Paid, Australia 1992·1996 Number of Services Benefits Paid 2,816 644,355 $11 ,350, 102 2,885 684,144 $12,520,109 2,927 682,554 $12,506,764 3,009 690,688 $12,744,405 3,072 734,298 $13,550,577 and other medical practitioners. Family Services-Medicare data files. and Crime. He announced a commitment of $13 million to the Campaign over 3 years. One of the Crime Campaign's priorities for its first year is residential burglary. (2) The National Campaign Against Violence and Crime has commenced work on a Residential Break and Enter Project. In consultation with jurisdictions and experts in the field, the National Campaign Against Violence and Crime is determining the most appropriate project design for implementation. Funds will be provided to a jurisdiction to implement a demonstration project. It is hoped that the demonstration project will reveal the most costeffective strategies to prevent residential burglary, link which can then be implemented nationally. (3) While it is accepted that some burglary and other crimes are perpetrated by offenders who abuse drugs, I am advised that it is not correct to say that there is an established link. This is due, in part, to difficulties associated with establishing motives for such crimes and reporting procedures. Co-ordinated by the Department of Health & Family Services, the former National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, now the National Drug Strategy, was established in 1985 and involves the non-government sector and all governments working together ""to minimise the harmful effects of drugs on Australian society"". Since 1993 the Commonwealth Government has provided $200 million to states and territories under a cost-share arrangement for a wide variety of treatment and prevention programs on alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs. In addition, the Commonwealth has given $66 million to national drug programs and also contributes significantly to health and law enforcement programs to address drug and alcohol issues. Given the existing resources available to agencies to combat drug abuse, the National Campaign Against Violence and Crime will not duplicate existing efforts. The main aim of the Campaign is to develop and encourage best practice nationally, across a broad range of crime areas, through liaison with jurisdictions and informed community awareness. The Campaign will work towards reducing crime by developing a series of demonstration projects in each jurisdiction, which actively work towards and promote best practice for crime prevention in several areas, including residential burglary. (4) My attention has been drawn to the paper by Mr Marks of the Australian Graduate School of Management on the estimate of the costs of Australian Drug Policy. As advised, the report does not establish a direct link between burglary and drug addiction. Nevertheless, research is continuing into the causes of criminal behaviour and programs such as the National Campaign Against Violence and Crime are being developed which aim to reduce crime through best practice. (5) I am advised that the little data crimes motivated by drug misuse is drawn largely from interviews with convicted heroin users. The 1997 Evaluation of the South Australian Methadone Program provides a few figures on drug related crime. The Evaluation cites a 1993 report detailing that 90% of methadone applicants had been convicted one or more times, 78% for property offences. A 1992 study found that methadone treatment helped lower crime rates, with 25% less property crimes occurring during methadone treatment. Other than the above figures I am unable to provide more up-to-date figures because, as stated in the 1995-96 Australian lllicit Drug Report, ""there appears to be little research in the field of drug related crime"". For the reasons given in (3) above, figures such as those produced in 1991 by Mr Marks, are not available at this time. In a 1996 report, I am advised, the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission suggests that while heroin users commit more fraud, burglaries and robberies than non-users it also states that not all Member Administrative Review Council Justice JH Mathews Ms PJ Smith Mr AD Rose AO Mr SFM Skehill Prof I Lowe Ms JP Anderson Ms HR Williams AO Mr WJ Blick Ms CP Charles Mr WS Martin QC source their addiction through crime. Furthermore, heroin users only make up a small proportion of drug users overall. (6) The National Campaign Against Violence and Crime does not, at present, have specific projects aimed at reducing drug abuse and addiction as a means of fighting crime. Nevertheless, the Campaign Unit is aware of the correlation of drug and alcohol problems with crime and will be looking at these issues through some of the current projects where drug abuse and addiction may emerge as an issue to be addressed. These include Early Intervention and Developmental Approaches to Crime Prevention, Domestic Violence Prevention, Domestic Violence Perpetrator Programs, Preventing Violence & Crime at Public Events, Negotiating Young People's Use of Public Space, and Violence in that exists on Indigenous Communities. Attorney-General: Boards, Councils, Committees and Advisory Bodies (Question No. 1949) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Attorney General, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: (1) What boards, councils, committees, and advisory bodies fall within the Minister's minis7 terial responsibilities.

(4) Will he release the draft report for public examination. (5) Will the agencies be required to certify or endorse the final report. Mr Vaile-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have not yet seen the draft report of the Jandakot Airport noise study nor the responses to . the draft report of any of the agencies referred to. (2) I am advised that the agencies referred to in part (1) met with the FAC in Canberra on 2 May 1997 to consider an incomplete draft report. The views of those agencies were noted by the FAC at the meeting. The National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL), a division of Australian Hearing Services, also provided a detailed written response to the FAC on 24 April 1997.  written response to the incomplete draft report totalled 15 pages. (4) It is proposed that the report of the study be released to the public by the FAC when completed. (5) I am advised that the views of the agencies referred to in part (1) will be taken into account by the FAC in the preparation of the final report. National Drug Strategy (Question No. 2080) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Health and Family SerVices, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Was he approached by the Channel 7 program Witness to appear as part of a debate on Australia's heroin problem filmed at the television station's studios in Sydney on 15 June 1997 and broadcast on 17 June; if so, did he decline to attend; if so, why. (2) Was he approached by the Channel 7 program Witness to be interviewed by that show's  on 24 June 1997; if so, did he decline; if so, why. (3) Further to his answer to question No 1696 (Hansard, 16 June 1997, page 5346), is the National Drug Strategy unable to provide him with 1995 data on the amount of opiate-related deaths in Australia. (4) Is the most recent data available to him from the National Drug Strategy on the amount of opiate-related deaths in Australia five to seven years old.

281,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: a b $158,481 $322,227 $59,403 $197,884 $10,355 $36,257 $22,659 $44,755 $15,903 $11,646 nil nil $74,912 $170,506 $2,273 $5,161 in each State and Territory capital city from March accommodation, meals and incidentals for guests Australian officials. The figures in column 'b' are are derived from the last eighteen months of the the State Occasions and Guest of Government for this is that the existence of a relevant dependent child affects the amount of child support payable. (2) The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues made no recommendations in relation to paragraph 76(2)(d) of the Assessment Act. However, as part of its proposed reforms to the Child Support Scheme the Government intends to discontinue the current requirement of disclosing names and dates of birth of relevant dependent children to the payee, effective from 1 July 1998. The payee will only be advised of the number and age grouping of any relevant dependent children. This will require legislative amendment. Gold: Sales and Reserves (Question No. 2201) Mr Cobb asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 September 1997: (1) What quantities of gold have been held by the Reserve Bank of Australia since it adopted a policy of holding gold reserves. (2) What were the (a) nominal and (b) real (i) purchase and (ii) sale prices for the gold referred to in part (1). (3) From which organisations or persons was the gold purchased and to whom has it been sold. (4) Was gold sold in 1997; if so, (a) for what purpose are the proceeds being used, including the interest, (b) who made the decision to sell the gold, (c) when was the decision made, (d) why was the gold sold, (e) were persons outside the Reserve Bank informed of the decision, induding the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, himself and the Cabinet; if so, when, (f) did any person outside the Reserve Bank have input into the decision; if so, what and (g) was due regard given to the effect the sale would have on the share price of gold stocks, including the impact on the ability of smaller stocks to raise capital. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In 1959, when it was established, the Reserve Bank held about 120 tonnes of gold. This increased to about 240 tonnes by 1969, and to about 250 tonnes in 1979. The Bank's holdings did not change materially thereafter, until it sold 167 tonnes in the first half of 1997. (2) The Reserve Bank's gold holdings were acquired over a period of time up to 1979, and at a variety of prices. The average stock cost in the Bank's accounts at the time of the sales was $46.49 per ounce. The Reserve Bank estimates that this is equivalent to about $254 per ounce in 1997 dollars. The average price per ounce for the 167 tonnes which the Bank sold forward in 1997 was $455.42. (3) Until 1976, gold was obtained by the central bank, under part IV of the Banking Act 1959, from gold producers in Australia. In 1977 and 1978, a small amount was obtained from the International Monetary Fund as part of a general disbursement of about one third of its gold holdings. Sales of gold in 1997 were made generally into the gold market through an agent. The Reserve Bank has no information on who the ultimate buyers were. (4) 167 tonnes of gold was sold in 1997. (a) The proceeds have been invested in securities issued by the governments of the United States, Germany and Japan. (b) The decision to sell the gold was made by the Board of the Reserve Bank. (c) The decision to sell the gold was made in December 1996. (d) The gold was sold because, in the assessment of the Reserve Bank's Board, it was difficult for a country such as Australia to justify holding a substantial part of its official reserve assets in gold. In addition, the reinvested proceeds should yield higher annual profits for the Reserve Bank than if they have been retained as gold. (e) The Treasurer was informed of the Bank's decision when the Bank sought his approval for the Bank to use the funds for reinvestment in other reserve assets. This approval was give!}. (f) No. (g) In taking its decision, the Bank considered the benefits to Australia would outweigh costs through any short-term impact of the decision on the behaviour of the price of gold. By 1 October 1997, the price of gold was above the level it reached just prior to the bank's announcement of the gold sales.

Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) A comprehensive NSW industry wide agreement has been satisfactorily concluded and most NSW registered clubs not exempt from income tax have entered into the agreement. (2) (a) The agreement recognises that Keno commissions, Club TAB commissions and other commissions are all fully assessable income receipts and are not subject to the principle of mutuality. This position is reflected in Draft Taxation Detennination 97/D5 which issued on 25 June 1997 and is in accordance with the existing law. (2) (b) The commission income derived by registered clubs has always been fully assessable under the tax law. This means there is no retrospectivity. (3) The tenns of the industry wide agreement are, at the request of the industry participants, strictly confidential. The ATO is therefore precluded from providing any information about the tenns of the agreement, including amounts payable by the clubs. (4) (a) As discussed above, the industry wide agreement also recognises that TAB commissions are fully assessable and not subject to the principle of mutuality. (4) (b) & (c) As previously stated, the tenns of the industry agreement are strictly confidential. No details of revenue collections can therefore be provided.

(4 )(a) $83.150m and (b) $94.527m. The program is a voluntary one and progress, and consequently the amount to be spent in the electoral division of Barton in 1997-98, depends on the speed at which home owners and owners of eligible public buildings take up the Commonwealth's offer of insulaInsulation tion assistance and the details concerning the works can be agreed.

They are: C.58 Minimum Age (Sea) (Revised), 1936; C.69# Certification of Ships' Cooks, 1946; C.73# Medical Examination (Seafarers), 1946; C.92# Accommodation of Crews (Revised), 1949; C.133# Accommodation of Crews (Supplementary provisions), 1970; C.135 Workers' Representatives, 1971; C.156 Workers with Family Responsibilities, 1981; C.158 Termination of Employment, 1982; C.159 Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled Persons), 1983; C.160# Labour Statistics, 1985; C.166# Repatriation of Seafarers (Revised), 1987; C.173# Workers' Claims (Employer's Insolvency), 1982. The Conventions marked n#n were ratified on the basis of implementation by Commonwealth laW and practice alone. The second group is made up of other Conventions which the Commonwealth has considered since 1987, but has not ratified. While the prospects for ratification of these Conventions has been examined (in consultation with the· States and Territories where appropriate), this does not imply that ratification is necessarily a viable option for these Conventions. They include: . C.53 Officers' Competency Certificates, 1936; C.81 Labour Inspection, 1947 (Part II and the Protocol); C.97 Migration for Employment (Revised), 1949; C.108# Seafarers' Identity Documents, 1958; C.119 Guarding of Machinery, 1963; C.120 Hygiene in Commerce and Offices, 1964; C.129 Labour Inspection (Agriculture), 1969; C.134 Prevention of Accidents (Seafarers), 1970; C.138 Minimum Age, 1973; C.139 Occupational Cancer, 1974; C.140 Paid Education Leave, 1974; C.141 Rural Workers' Organisations, 1975; C.143 Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions), 1975; C.145 Continuity of Employment (Seafarers), 1976; C.146 Seafarers' Annual Leave with Pay, 1976; C.147 Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards), 1976; C.148 Working Environment (Air Pollution, Noise and Vibration), 1977; C.149 Nursing Personnel, 1977; C.151 Labour Relations (Public Service), to 1978; C.152 Occupational Safety and Health (Dock Work), 1979; C.154 Collective Bargaining, 1981; C.155 Occupational Safety and Health, 1981; C.161 Occupational Health Services, 1985; C.162 Asbestos, 1986; C.164 Health Protection and Medical Care (Seafarers), 1987; C.167 Safety and Health in Construction, 1988; C.169 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, 1989; C.170 Chemicals, 1990; C.174 Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents, 1993; C.175 Part-time Work, 1994; C.176 Safety and Health in Mines, 1995. The Convention marked n#n is for implementation by Commonwealth law and practice alone. (2) The approach to ratification of Conventions by Australia is that this occurs only where two preconditions are satisfied, that is: law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions is in compliance with the Convention in question, and all State and Territory governments have formally agreed to ratification (except for those Conventions whose subject matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Coinmonwealth Government alone). Furthermore, consistent with the requirements of Convention 144, Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards), 1976, which was ratified by Australia in 1979, the Commonwealth also consults with the most representative employer and worker organisations (ACCI and ACTU) on matters relating to the adoption, examination and ratification of ILO Conventions. The procedure outlined above was carried out in relation to the ILO Conventions ratified by Australia since 1987, with two exceptions. When the Commonwealth ratified Convention 156, Workers with Family Responsibilities, 1981 in March 1990, it did so without the formal agreement of New South Wales and the Northern Territory. There was compliance with the provisions of the Convention at the time of ratification, and the Commonwealth wished to ratify on the 15th anniversary of International Women's Day. The two jurisdictions subsequently provided their formal agreement to ratification. Convention 158, Termination of Employment, 1982 was ratified in February 1993. Law and practice was not fully in compliance with the provisions of the Convention, and the Commonwealth legislated using the external affairs power to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Convention before it came into force. None of the States and Territories provided formal agreement to ratification either before ratification or subsequently. The then Minister stated that ratification was a ""special case necessitated by the removal or possible removal in a number of jurisdictions of previously accepted employment conditions"". (3) In future if a Convention is ratified it will be done so according to the usual procedure. Furthermore, the requirements of the Government's new treaty making policy which was announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in May 1996 will be taken into account. Briefly, this will require text of any ILO Convention proposed for ratification to be tabled in Parliament for at least 15 sitting days before the Government takes action to bring the treaty into force. A National Interest Analysis (NIA) must also be prepared, in consultation with interested parties, and tabled prior to ratification. The Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties may inquire into and report on treaties (including ILO Conventions) and NIAs that are tabled. (4) There is no timetable for ratifying the remaining Conventions. The Commonwealth and States and Territories continue to meet and assess the position regarding each Convention but there is no obligation or commitment to ratify. (5) The members of the Australian delegation to the 84th (Maritime) Session of the International Labour Conference (ILC) in October 1996 were: Mr D Holmes, Department of Transport and Regional Development and Mr C Blower, Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Government Delegates) Mr L Payne, Australian Shipowners Association (Employer Delegate) Mr F Ross, Australian Maritime Officer Union (Worker Delegate). The members of the Australian delegation to the 85th Session of the ILC in June 1997 were: Mr T Fisher, Department of Industrial Relations (Government Delegate) Mr S Moore, Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Government Delegate) Mr B Noakes, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Employer Delegate) Mr J Sutton, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (Worker Delegate). (6) The 84th (Maritime) ILC in 1996 adopted the following nine instruments: Convention 178 and Recommendation 185, Labour Inspection (Seafarers), 1996 Convention 179 and Recommendation 186, Recruitment and Placement of Seafarers Convention (Revised), 1996 Convention 180 and Recommendation 187, Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of Ships (Revised), 1996 Protocol to Convention 147, Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards), 1976. The 85.th ILC in 1997 adopted the following two instruments: . Convention 181 and Recommendation 188, Private Employment Agencies, 1996. (7) At the 84th (Maritime) ILC in 1996, all four delegates voted for all nine instruments. At the 85th ILC in 1997, the voting was as follows: (a)Both Government delegates voted for the Convention and the Recommendation. (b) The Employers' delegate voted for the Convention and abstained from the vote on the Recommendation. (c) The Workers' delegate voted for the Convention and the Recommendation. (8) Yes. Each geographical sub-region is entitled to vote for a certain number of ILO Governing Body members for a three year term. Australia is part of the Far East Asia and Pacific sub-region, which is entitled to vote for one member and one deputy member. In June 1996, the ILC elected the Republic of Korea and Mongolia as the member and deputy member respectively for the sub-region. (9) The ILO Governing Body has adopted a new format of ILO regional meetings, including provision for only one standard agenda item concerning the ILO's regional activities. The Report of the Director-General to the 12th ILO Asian Regional Meeting to be held in Bangkok will serve as a basis for discussion at the Meeting. The report generally covers major developments in the labour and employment fields in the face of the challenges posed by globalisation and economic liberalisation in the region, and the ILO's response to those challenges. (10) Yes. Australia will be represented at the Asian Regional Meeting by a tripartite delegation. The delegates are: Mr T Fisher and Ms D Hawgood, Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business (Government Delegates) Mr B Noakes, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Employer Delegate) Mr W Mansfield, Australian Council of Trade Unions (Worker Delegate). Inhumane Weapons Convention (Question No. 2312) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 1 October 1997: Did the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommend that the Australian Government take advantage of every opportunity, especially in the South East Asian and Pacific regions, to encourage other nations to sign the Inhumane Weapons Convention and all of its Protocols; if so, did the Government take steps at the 28th South Pacific Forum in Rarotonga on 17 to 19 September 1997 to encourage Forum nations to sign the Convention and Protocols; if so, what. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties Report ""Restrictions on the Use of Blinding Laser Weapons and Landmines"" recommended in Paragraph 3.130 that the Australian Government take advantage of every opportunity, especially in the South East Asian and Pacific regions, to encourage other nations to sign the Inhumane Weapons Convention and all its Protocols. The Australian Government ratified revised Protocol II of the Inhumane Weapons Convention on 22 August 1997 and encouraged its Forum partners at the 28th South Pacific Forum in Rarotonga on 17 to 19 September 1997 to do likewise. Australia also contributed language to the Forum Communique which urged all nations to work strenuously towards the promotion of an effective global ban on anti-personnel landmines in all relevant fora, including inter alia the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament, regional ILO organisations and groupings, and the review conferences of the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects. Taxation Task Force (Question No. 2313) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 1 October 1997: (1) How many officers of his Department have been assigned to his taskforce on tax. (2) Are any members of his personal staff on the taskforce. (3) What expenditure will the taskforce incur. (4) Will he maintain the taskforce for other investigative work after its initial report has been completed. (5) Will the taskforce be in contact with the  Burn from the Business Council of Australia. (6) Will Senator Gibson have a role in the tax taskforce; if so, what. (7) Will the taskforce consider the Mortimer report on industry assistance.",162
282,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No officers from my Department are working full-time on the taskforce, although one officer is a member of the taskforce. A small number of other officers are involved as required. (2) No staff from my office, but Mr David Stevens from the Cabinet Policy Unit is a member of the taskforce. (3) As the work of the taskforce falls within the Treasury portfolio I would ask that the honourable member direct his question to the Treasurer. (4) The Government has made no decision on this at this stage. (5) The taxation taskforce will report to the Government. By and large consultation with the public and interest groups will be undertaken by Ministers and the Government Members' Taskforce. That Government Members' Taskforce will also take public submissions. (6) None is presently proposed. (7) The taxation taskforce will be mindful of the recommendations of the Mortimer Report (Going for Growth: Business Programs for Investment, Innovation and Export) and the Government's response to specific recommendations in its investigation of tax reform. More generally, of course, the establishment of the taskforce is perfectly consistent with Mr Mortimer's call for ""a fundamental review to determine how to best re-orientate the taxation system to make it more growth friendly and therefore conducive to investment, exports and employment. "" Taxation Reform: Research (Question No. 2319) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, oli 1 October 1997: (1) Is the Government conducting research on different forms of taxation, including a goods and services tax (GST). (2) If so, what would be the impact of a goods and services tax on (a) Australia's unemployment rate, (b) Australian employment, (c) Australia's inflation rate, (d) Australia's balance of trade performance, (e) Australian interest rates (f) retirement incomes and (g) national savings policy. (3) Is he able to say what has been the impact of a GST on aspects of the New Zealand economy, including (a) the unemployment rate, (b) employment, (c) inflation rate, (d) balance of trade performance, (e) interest rates, (f) retirement incomes and (g) national savings policy, Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) & (3) The Government is preparing options for the reform of the taxation system. In giving broad guidance to the reform process the Government has indicated that consideration should be given to a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes. The matter will be fully debated once proposals are released. Social Security and Austudy Recipients: (Question No. 2322) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 1 October 1997: (1) Is the Minister's Department able to correlate the value of private property belonging to recipients of social security and Austudy benefits. (2) Can the Minister identify how many recipients of social security and Austudy benefits reside in the postcode areas of (a) 2030 and (b) 3142. (3) Can the Minister identify how many recipients in the postcode areas referred to in part (2) have property values in excess of $1 million. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The information sought is detailed and is not collected by the Department. This Government is not prepared to authorise the use of the considerable resources of time and money that would be involved in assembling the information requested. (2) (a) There are 1525 Social Security recipients and 182 Austudy recipients in postcode area 2030. (b) There are 1136 Social Security recipients and 179 Austudy recipients in postcode area 3142. (3) No, for the reasons given in reply to part (1). Australian Electoral Office: Port Pirie Office Relocation (Question No. 2324) Mr Wakelin asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 1 October 1997: (1) Is the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) divisional office in Port Pirie, SA, being relocated, if so, (a) why, (b) what are the total costs of relocation and (c) what proportion of costs related to (i) staff, (ii) rental, (iii) transport and (iv) other costs. (2) Are there other costs to the Commonwealth other than that incurred by the AEC. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) Yes. The office is to be relocated to Port Augusta to improve service to clients in the Division of Grey. The 1996 Census shows a population of 125,129 for the Division. Of this population 55,842 (45%) live west of Spencer Gulf and 33,709 (27%) live in Port Augusta and to the north of the Gulf. The location of Port Augusta at the top of the Spencer's Property Gulf makes it the transport and communication hub of the west and north of the State and the Division of Grey. The number of Commonwealth electors in the Division at 22/9/97 was 83,546. Of these 65.5% live in Port Augusta or to the west and north of the city. When these electors commute to Adelaide they pass through Port Augusta and many therefore rely on Port Augusta for Government service provision. The Division serves remote aboriginal communities. The State Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission have located their Northern Regional Offices in Port Augusta and AEC service provision to aboriginals will benefit from collocation in Port Augusta with these other government agencies. (b) 91,533 (c) (i) Staff-severance payment-30,987. (ii) rental-net savings (approx.) over 3 year lease(1,000). (iii) transport-2,454. (iv) other-59,Q92. (2) I am not aware of any other costs to the Commonwealth. Fine Particle Pollution: Australian (Question No. 2326)  the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 1 October 1997: (1) Is the Government developing an Australian standard for fine particle pollution; if so, will the standard reflect world best practice; if not, why not. (2) Is he able to say which country and what standard reflects world best practice for fine particle pollution. Mr Anderson-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1 ) Yes. A national standard for fine particles being developed by the National Environment Protection Council as part of the proposed National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM) addressing ambient air quality. A draft of the proposed Measure, which will include a standard for fine particles, and an accompanying impact statement, will be released for public comment before the Measure is finalised and adopted. The proposed fine particle standard is anticipated to reflect world's best practice. Table 1 Existing International Ambient Air Quality Objectives for Fine Particles (Measured as PM IO) Country/Authority Type Australia NHMRC goal WHO guideline UK guideline New Zealand guideline US EPA standard under review  (Question No. 2328) Dr Southcott asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (2) It is difficult to define what constitutes world's best practice in relation to the establishment of standards for managing fine particle pollution without considering the objective involved in setting the standard. The national standard currently under consideration in Australia is being established to protect Standard human health and well being. With respect to the protection of human health, guidelines - developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) are widely considered as indicators of world's best practice. However, it should be recognised that WHO 'guidelines' are not equivalent to 'standards,' a fact explicitly acknowledged by WHO which states: ""The guidelines are intended to provide background information and guidance to governments in making risk management decisions, particularly in setting standards. It should be strongly emphasised that the guideline values are not to be regarded as standards in themselves."" In the case of fine particles, WHO have not established a guideline because of the absence of is a threshold below which there are no identifiable adverse health effects. Research into the adverse health effects of exposure to fine particle pollution is ongoing. However, some countries have established air quality objectives for fine particles, and these are summarised in Table 1. With the exception of the United States, the objectives for fine particles reported in the table are expressed in terms of goals and guidelines only.

(2) Has Mr Conlon taken leave during the period 15 September to 1 1 October 1997; if so, is the leave paid or unpaid. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Mr Conlon ceased his employment as an electorate officer on the staff of Senator Bolkus on 19 September 1 997. (2) No. Snelling, Mr J. (Question No. 2329) Dr Southcott asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) Is Mr J Snelling employed as an electorate officer on the staff of Mr MJ Evans MP; if not, when did Mr Snelling cease employment with Senator Bolkus. (2) Has Mr Snelling taken leave during the period 15 September to 11 October 1997; if so, is the leave paid or unpaid. Mr Fahey-The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Mr Snelling ceased his employment as an electorate officer on the staff of Mr Evans on 15 September 1997. (2) No. F -111 Fly Past: Costs (Question No. 2336) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) What was the cost of the F-l11 fly past at the 1997 Super League grand final.

(4) Flying Officer; the ground coordinator for the fly past. Tasmanian Public Hospitals: Beds (Question No. 2341) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 2 October 1997: (1) Is he able to say how many beds were available in Tasmanian public hospitals on 1 May (a) 1997, (b) 1996, (c) 1995 and (d) 1994. (2) Is he able to say how many staff were employed in Tasmanian public hospitals on 1 May (a) 1997, (b) 1996, (c) 1995 and (d) 1994. (3) Is he also able to say how many persons were waiting for surgery in Tasmanian public hospitals on 1 May (a) 1997, (b) 1996, (c) 1995 and (d) 1994. (4) Is the number of beds available in Tasmanian public hospitals at an acceptable level with regard to the Medicare agreement between the Federal and Tasmanian Governments. (5) How many beds does the Tasmanian Government need to make available for it not to be in breach of the Medicare agreement. (6) What are the minimum conditions that the Tasmanian Government must achieve with regard to the provision of public health services to meet the requirements of the Medicare agreement.",178
283,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Available beds numbers in recognised public hospitals under the Medicare Agreements' are supplied to the Commonwealth by the State and Territory health authorities. The following table shows bed numbers supplied by the Tasmanian Department of Community and Health Services. Available recognised public hospital beds(l) in Tasmania Not available 1,392 1,396 1,453 Number of beds is, of course, not an appropriate appropriate indicators include total bed days in Year (at 30 June) 1997 1996 1995 1994 (2) The Commonwealth does not hold this data. Responsibility for the planning and provision of public hospital services, including the staffing of public hospital facilities, is vested in the State and Territory Governments. (3) The Commonwealth does not hold this data. However, it should be noted that waiting lists are a poor indicator of hospital and health system performance which do not necessarily provide an accurate indication of problems relating to access to elective surgery. Many hospital admissions, including elective admissions, occur without the patient ever being on a waiting list. Some period of waiting may be appropriate, depending on the clinical urgency of the case: waiting lists provide a mechanism for scheduling admissions so that the most urgent cases are treated first; and the clinical urgency of cases on the waiting lists is therefore more critical than the number of cases. Because of these factors, it is accepted by both Commonwealth and Statefferritory health authorities that it is more appropriate to focus on admitting people to hospital within clinically appropriate times than on the number of people waiting at any point in time. This is reflected in the arrangements introduced under the Medicare Agreements in 1995-96 whereby States have access to bonus funding if they achieve bilaterally agreed performance targets. Four areas were targeted initially: admitted and nonadmitted patient activity; and waiting times for elective surgery and emergency departments. For elective surgery, the incentive is not based on the number of people on waiting lists but on the length of time people wait on the list before admission to hospital.3. The National Health Data Dictionary defines three categories of clinical urgency for patients requiring elective surgery: category I-admission within 30 days desirable for a condition that has the potential to measure of access to public hospital care. Other more public hospitals where the Tasmanian figures are: Total bed days in Tasmanian recognised hospitals Not available 505,163 (Provisional) 425,167 440,647 deteriorate quickly to the point that it may become an emergency; category 2-admission within 90 days desirable for a condition causing some pain, dysfunction or disability but which is not likely to deteriorate quickly or become an emergency; and category 3-admission at some time. in the future acceptable for a condition causing minimal or no pain, dysfunction or disability, which is unlikely to deteriorate quickly into an emergency. (4-5) The Medicare Agreements negotiated by the previous Labor Government do not stipulate public hospital beds numbers and do not link funding to the number of public hospital beds. Rather, funding is provided to the States who, under the terms of the Medicare Agreements, agree to ensure that eligible persons have access to a comprehensive range of inpatient, outpatient .and accident and emergency services free of charge in both metropolitan and rural areas on the basis of clinical need. The only funding under the Agreements which is directly related to activity levels is, as previously mentioned, some bonus funding which is linked to performance in the areas of admitted and nonadmitted patient activity and waiting times for elective surgery and emergency departments. (6) There is a range of other detailed provisions contained within the Medicare Agreements. Copies of the Medicare Agreements between the Commonwealth and the States are available in the Parliamentary Library. Apart from the bonus. funding arrangements mentioned in (3) above, the previous Government did not link funding to specific outcomes or performance targets. ABC: 7.30 Report (Question No. 2386) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, upon notice, on 21 October 1997:  Report promoting a new book written by Adams; if so, in what capacity was Mr Adams offered the opportunity to appear on the program. (2) Since 1 January 1996 has the 7.30 Report produced stories on a new book (a) on how many occasions, (b) who was the author and (c) what was the book. (3) Is Mr Adams' book being sold through ABC shops; if so, why. (4) Does the ABC charter allow promotion literature by employees of the ABC on television or radio current affairs programs. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Act Communications, the Information Economy· broadcast and the Arts has provided the following as follows: answer to the honourable member's question:  story on the subject of talkback 13 October 1997. He did not ""promote"" his book, although the fact that he had written a book about talkback radio was mentioned in Kerry O'Brien's introduction to the story. Mr Adams was invited to appear on the program as a well known radio personality and someone known to be critical of the power of talkback radio, as well as in his capacity as the author of the book. The story was about the relative power and attitudes of Australia!s talkback radio stars, of whom Adams is generally critical. The ABC endeavoured to ensure that Mr Adams' views were tested and balanced with those of talkback stars. John Laws, Alan Jones and Stan Zemanik were all approached to be interviewed, but declined. File shots of them, overlaid with audio of their shows were used. Two talkback personalities who appeared were Steve Price (Melbourne was critical of the book, and Howard Sattler (Perth 6PR) who was highly critical of both the book and Mr Adams personally. (2) (a-c) Since 1 January 1996, the 7.30 Report has produced stories on 21 books. These are: Natalie Jane Prior-The Demidenko Diary; Goldsworthy-Honk If You Are Jesus; Andrew Reimer-The Demidenko Debate; Evelyn Lauraise. Runaway Diary Of A Street Kid; Christopher Milne-Naughty Stories For Good Boys and Girls; Gordon Chater-Memoirs; Doreen Kartinyeri-Ngarrindjeri ANZACs; Dinka Beglerbegovic/Matthew Roden-Books For Children By Children; David Malouf-Remembering used.

(3) Yes. Mr Adams' book is sold through ABC Shops as it is considered to relate to ABC programming activities as defined at Section 16 of the ABC's Editorial Policies (ABC Enterprises Product Charter). This includes product deemed to be ""high of quality work which would stimulate debate on contemporary issues particularly in Australia"". (4) Section 31(1) of the Australian Broadcasting 1983 provides that the Corporation shall not advertisements. However, this is qualified Section 31 (2) Sub-section (1) does not prevent the Corporation, if the Corporation thinks fit, from radio on Monday broadcasting: (a) any announcement relating to any activity or proposed activity of the Corporation; (b) a program supplied by any organisation or person engaged in artistic, literary, musical or theatrical production or in educational pursuits; or (c) a program supplied by any organisation or person other than a program that is, in the opinion of the Board, being used as an advertisement. Sheep Sale Transaction Tax (Question No. 2388) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for radio Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, 3AW), who on 21 October 1997: (1) Has he considered a proposal to introduce a transaction tax on the sale of sheep; if so, was the proposal discussed with (a) levy payers and (b) selected peak bodies. (2) Has his attention been drawn to a proposal by the WA Livestock Salesmen Association of a modified, simple to operate, slaughter levy; if so, Peter has he taken action on it; if so, what. (3) What sum would the new transaction tax (4) Does the proposed legislation comply with the Government's 12 point principles; if not, do the principles no longer apply. (5) For what precise purposes would the levy be (6) Who would determine the priorities. (7) Was there a $20 million tax loss associated with the failed Fututech project; if so, will tax concessions be applied to projects that add value to primary products; if not, why not. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have agreed to introduce a transaction based levy on sheep, lambs and goats at the request of the Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Goat Industry Council of Australia who have demonstrated to my satisfaction the proposal has clear majority industry support and satisfies the Government's levy principles. The matter was widely debated and all views considered prior to the decisions being taken. The Sheepmeat Council of Australia advises the proposed transaction levy was discussed with representatives of potential levy payers including Wool Council of Australia and all major Statebased farming organisations. The levy was also discussed with other peak industry bodies including the Australian Poll Dorset Association, the Australian Corriedale Association, the Australian Texel Stud Breeders Association, the Australian Meat Council, the National Meat Association of Australia and the Australian Council of Livestock Agents. (2) The Secretary of the Western Australian Livestock Salesmen's Association wrote to me 9 September 1997 advising of their support for a slaughter based levy collected by livestock agents and processors, but paid for by producers under a ""pass-back"" mechanism. No action was taken on this proposal as it is clearly the majority industry decision that tion based levy be introduced for sheep, lambs and goats. In addition, the national representative body of livestock agents, the Australian Council of Livestock Agents, are strongly opposed to the suggestion. These members would be responsible for collecting almost all the producer levies under a ""pass-back"" slaughter levy. I am also advised that a ""pass-back"" slaughter levy was in place briefly in the early 1970's, but was abandoned due to administrative difficulties. (3) The Sheepmeat Council of Australia expects that the transaction levy, subject negotiations aimed at lowering operative rates, will raise approximately $16.5 million per annum. (4) Yes. (5) The funds collected from the transaction levy will be used for four purposes as designated in the legislation; marketing and promotion, research and development, animal health and the national residue survey. (6) The Sheepmeat Council of Australia and industry will determine the funding priorities in consultation with Meat and Livestock Australia Limited. . (7) The Meat Research Corporation (MRC) has advised they estimate the tax losses could be in the order of $20 million. They also advise that these losses are unlikely to be available for use once MRC has ceased to exist. In any event, the chances of MRC being able to obtain value for these losses has always been minimal. MRC itself is tax exempt and it has no prospect of generating sizeable taxable earnings via subsidiary companies in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the transfer of tax losses for value to a third party business entity is subject to extremely tight rules which are, in practice, very difficult to satisfy. The Government and industry clearly support the development of high priority value enhancing technologies through research and development. To this end, the Commonwealth already provides matching funding on eligible research and development expenditure.

Industrial Action by the Maritime Union of Australia (Question No. 2415) Mr Tanner asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 23 October 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 2214 (Hansard, 20 October 1997, page 9293) concerning allegations of produce left rotting on wharves as a result of industrial action by the Maritime Union of Australia, (a) in which ports did the incidents occur, (b) in which months and years did the incidents occur, (c) was the produce (i) fruit, (ii) vegetables, (iii) seafood, (iv) meat or (v) other produce and (d) what was the value of the produce lost.",185
286,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As indicated in my response to question No. 2214 of 20 October 1997, the Government is aware of a number of cases where farmers' produce has either spoiled or rotted as a result of practices and industrial action by the Maritime Union of Australia. As the honourable member is already aware, the agricultural companies involved are fearful that public attention to difficulties connected to the activities of the Maritime Union of Australia will lead to retribution by that trade union. As the Government does not have the permission of these companies to publicly outline such cases, I am unable to provide specific examples. I am simply not prepared to betray the trust placed by companies who have suffered under inefficient waterfront practices.",185
