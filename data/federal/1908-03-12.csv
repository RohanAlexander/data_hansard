1,Mr HUTCHISON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desire' to ask the Postmaster-General whether he upholds the position taken up by the Public Service Commissioner that an officer of a union, who is not a member of the service, shall not take part in a deputation - to the-head of the Department?'",14
2,Mr MAUGER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The question cannot be answered by a plain ""Yes"" or "" No . "" There are some dozens of unions, and if they all had an unofficial secretary the work of the Department would practically be rendered impossible - I have expressed the opinion that if these unions were united-on e for each section of the service-the work would be so great that an ordinary oflScial could not attend to it, and that - some one who would do the work thoroughly would have to be recognised by the Commissioner.",14
3,Mr ARCHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I would ask the Postmaster-General, in further reference to the question that I put to him yesterday regarding the delay in the transmission of telegrams from the southern States to Queensland and the north, what steps have actually been taken to duplicate the lines r",14
4,Mr MAUGER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Preliminar y steps have already been taken.,14
5,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have a question to put. to the Postmaster-General. Mr Ben Tillett has brought - under my notice that, whereas the postal parcels office closes at 12 o'clock, and the money-order office at .1 o'clock, on Saturdays, officers are kept in attendance at the General Post Office, Melbourne, until 6 p.m., to deliver letters addressed there. As most business places in the city are closed on Saturday afternoon, can the Minister see his way clear to give these officers a half-holiday ?",14
6,Mr MAUGER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It has been my policy . to close as many offices as possible at 6 p.m., and to extend the half-holiday principle, but I find. that, the public are exceedingly unreasonable. We have just received a petition to extend, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., the closing hour of a telegraph office at which, in those hours, during the last six months, only, two telegrams have been lodged. I shall certainly extend the half-holiday principle as far as possible to all the employees of the Department. PARLIAMENT AND FOREIGN ' MERCHANTS. STATEMENT BY MR. O. C. BEALE.",14
7,Mr JOHNSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has seen the following statement, attributed to Mr O. . C. Beale, in the report of an interview with that gentleman, which appeared in the Sydney Morning - Herald of 13th December lastThere is one matter that calls for a very searching investigation, that I should like to refer to, and that is, that a large Sum of money has been subscribed in Australia by Foreign merchants in the Piano Trade, for the purpose influencing Parliament, by representations or - otherwise - DEFENCE POLICY . As this is a serious reflection on Parliament, amounting to an indirect charge of corruption, against honourable members, w i ll the Prime Minister call upon Mr Beale to make a direct charge for the purpose of investigation, or to apologize for his base insinuations against the integrity of this Parliament ?",14
8,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I had not seen the statement referred to ; my knowledge of it is derived from listening to the honourable member. So far as I can gather, the charge was that certain piano sellers intended to do something to influence Parliament by representations or other means.",15
9,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does any one believe the statement ?,15
10,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That consideration is immaterial', so far as my answer to the question is concerned, because, unless the statement is a reflection on. Parliament, it does not affect us. It remains. for the piano vendors concerned to take any action they think fit. WEATHER REPORTS.",15
11,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask the Minister, representing the Minister of Home Affairs, whether he will call the attention of the Department to the extraordinary inaccurracy of the. weather forecasts issued for South Australia since the meteorologist's branch was taken over by the Commonwealth, and if he will obtain a report as to the advisableness bf resuming the issue of local forecasts as be'fore?",15
12,Mr HUMECOOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall draw the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to the honourable member's question, and obtain an answer. PRIVA TE MEMBERS ' BUSINESS.",15
13,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the Prime Minister intend to provide an opportunity for the consideration of private members' business in the ordinary way ? Will he submit at an early date the neces-' sary motion?,15
14,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That w i ll depend en-, 'tirely on the progress made: I shall be glad to do so when business permits. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE . of DEFENCE ESTIMATES - NATIONAL GUARD - REGISTRATIO N OF RIFLECLUBS ",15
15,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask the. Min ister of Defence whether the opinion of the Military Board has been sought or obtained with regard to the estimates of expenditure in connection with the organization, mobilization, and equipment of the proposed National Guard?",15
16,Mr EWING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Chief Accountant of the Department, is now dealing f u l ly with that question.",15
17,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I asked whether the opinion of the Military Board had been obtained.,15
18,Mr EWING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It s opinion' as a Board has not - If I inform the honourable member definitely that I have, not consulted the Board, I discover that a Minister should always adopt the views of his officers. On the other hand, if I say that I have done so, I am ' to l d that the House does not want a Minister without initiative.",15
19,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Then the honourable member can understandmv difficulty in regard to ""Yes-no.""",15
20,Mr EWING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I do. I discuss these matters with the members of the Board, and cannot recall any permanent officer who does not agree with the Government in general principlesupon this matter'.",15
21,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member has not submitted the matter to the Board inks corporate capacity?,15
22,Mr EWING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No j and I doubt very ' much whether at this stage it can be regarded as having any bearing upon the work of, the Board.'- In administration, figures are dealt with hy the Chief Accountant. The various heads of Departments deal with the matters which have been relegated to them.",15
23,Sir JOHN QUICK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the Minister of Defence able to make any statement with reference to an allegation that the Department has refused to register the formation of a rifle club at West Shelbourne?,15
24,Mr EWING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I informed the honourable member last night that I would endeavour to ascertain the facts! The officers who deal with this branch of the service have informed, me.that they have no in formation with regard to the case. ' I should be. glad if the honourable member would supply me with the source of his information that the Department object to the registration of rifle clubs. He will remember that the Prime Minister, in outlining the defence scheme to the House, said that not only did we intend to continue the rifle club movement, but that the Estimates to be submitted would provide for a sum of Â£ 1 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of the amount now voted for that purpose.",15
25,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask the Minister of Defence whetlier the opinion of the officers and rank and file of the Defence Forces generally, including cadets, is being sought upon the Government military policy, or upon the best metliod of executing that policy? If it be the latter, in what way are officers and the rank and file of our Defence Forces, better qualified' to offer advice than is the Inspector-General or responsible bodies like, the MiliLary Board and the Council of Defence?",16
26,Mr EWING,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Will the honourable mem- within a reasonable period? ber be good enough to hand me his question?,16
27,Mr BOWDEN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,- I have-no objection to repeating it. FEDERA L CAPITAL SITE.,16
28,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask the Minister of Defence whether it is a fact that the Government have promised the honourable member for Gwydir that the question of the Federal Capital site will not be considered by Parliament until he has made a second visit to another site which he has in view, and that, as a result, they are quite unable to proceed with the Bill dealMinister ing with the matter?",16
29,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"At the close of last session, the honourable member for Gwydir endeavoured to arrange for honourable memsider bers to pay a visit of inspection to the at Tooma.",16
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"He arranged two application trips, both of which fell through.",16
31,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"At that ""time, owing the pressure of public business, and the desire of honourable members to take at . least one day, if not two, from the sittings of the House to enable them to make the proposed visit, the Government interposed and objected to this concession of the pubing lic time. The honourable member has since renewed his application, and he has been informed that, if honourable members desire to inspect the Tooma site, the Goabout it vernment will, as far as possible facilitate their visit. No promise whatever has made in reference to proceeding with the Seat of Government Bill .",16
32,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that: the selection of a Federal Capital Site is to be hung up for six months, as stated by the Treasurer, until the honourable member for Gwydir has organized a visit 'of inspection to the site at Tooma?",16
33,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It used to be said by Artemus Ward that certain things were "" spoke sarcastic."" I think that phrase explains the nature of the interjection as to which the honourable member questions me.",16
34,Mr HENRY WILLIS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Following up the question I have already asked, I desire to know whether the Prime Minister approves of the levity of the Treasurer. Do the Government regard it as a joke to set at defiance the people of New South Wales in their desire to have this question settled Will the Prime Minister take an early opportunity of stating when the Government will- - be prepared to proceed with this matter?",16
35,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have already received notice from the leader of the Opposition that he proposes to ask a similar question today. I , therefore, ask the honourable member for Robertson to allow me to postpone my reply. TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY: BRENNAN MONO RAIL .",16
36,Mr MAHON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I wish to ask the Prime whether, in view of the necessity for the early construction of the transcontinental railway- I mean the line from Fort Augusta to Kalgoorlie-h e will conthe advisablity of getting additional site information concerning Mr Louis Brennan's invention of the mono rail, and the of the gyroscope to rolling stock travelling upon it. I underto stand fhat the Admiralty authorities have recently set apart a sum of Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 for the purpose of carrying out experiments in connection with the use of the gyroscope on vessels at sea. Will the honourable gentleman obtain the fullest particulars regardthis invention, so that, before the Bill authorizing the construction of the transcontinental railway is submitted to Parliament, honourable members may know all",16
37,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The invention of Mr . been Brennan is now world famous, ancl many articles, illustrated and otherwise, have appeared in connection with it. It attracted so much attention that, whilst we wtre in London, my honourable colleague the Treasurer endeavoured to find time to inspect a working model of it. But, unfortunately, this proved impossible owing to his early departure. Whilst in England, I was informed, on practically official authority, that the Government of India thought so highly of the invention that they were prepared to expend a considerable sum upon the construction of a trial line. Having regard to the cost of. the working of the mono-rail system, it w.ould be a matter of the utmost importance to us to adopt it if it should prove successful. But, as far as I am aware, a trial upon an actual working scale has not yet been made. TEMPERATURE RECORDS.",16
38,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs whether it is the intention of the Government to establish official stations for the taking of shade temperatures in order to remove the inconsistencies which have arisen since the appointment of a Commonwealth Meteorologist?,17
39,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,To what inconsistencies does the honourable member refer?,17
40,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"To inconsistencies in connection with the registration of shade temperatures in various districts. For instance, upon the Murray, the shade registrations throughout the present year have been io degrees and 12 degrees lower than registrations in places from 120 to 200 miles south. These inconsistencies, which are very misleading to the public, aiid are calculated .to do certain areas great injury, are clue to the fact that no proper stations for the registration of shade temperatures have been established. 1 therefore wish to know whether it is intended to establish proper stations for the registration of shade temperatures in the northern districts of Victoria ?",17
41,Mr HUME COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I understand that the Minister of Home Affairs has the matter to which the honourable member alludes under consideration. I will bring his question under the notice of my colleague, ancl will endeavour to supply the desired information tomorrow. NA PARLIAMENT. '",17
42,Mr LIDDELL,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I desire to direct attention of the Prime Minister to a paramembers this statement relates. graph which appears in a journal published in Sydney, and which reflects upon every lionorable member of this House. I wish also to point out that the paragraph in question was not published until the House had risen for the Christmas adjournment. Consequently the present is the earliest opportunity that I have had of directing attention to it. It readsA curious list drifts round Federal Parliament House. It purports to show the names of two members, both Tories, who got ^2,000 apiece for changing their views about .the necessity for taxing the Standard Oil Trust's kerosene; of a third Tory who was bought by being put into a nice corpulent spec, and of a fourth Tory wlio took the price of the betrayal of his country in a different form, but took it all the same. Certainly, a person who has openly alleged to be the emissary of Standard Oil was lobbying most industriously, and there was a sudden and amazing falling away among those wbo wanted to reserve the Australian market for the British Company's oil, and the Four, regarding whom suspicion now stinks to Heaven, are said lo have not only changed their own views, but to have toiled enthusiastically to make converts to the doctrine of free-trade for the Monopoly's oil.",17
43,Mr WATSON,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,In what journal is that paragraph printed?,17
44,Mr LIDDELL,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"In the Sydney Bidletin of 16th January of the present year. I wish to ask the - Prime Minister whether he intends to allow a reflection of that sort to rest upon every honourable member of this House? I , for one, object to be branded in that way in the public press. There are means of dealing with men who publish innuendoes of that sort, ancl I ask the Prime Minister what he intends to do in reference to the matter ?",17
45,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"The paragraph to which the honourable member has directed attention was brought uncler my notice by letter from Sydney during the latter portion of last month. I replied at once, inquiring why our notice had not been directed to it previously, whether there was any further information making the charge more definite, and why it hacl been left until this time to be brought under notice. To that, speaking from memory, we have received no answer. Parliament, of course, has not been sitting since it was published. The charge contained in the paragraph is a most serious one, but of the most general character. It uses a party name with which we are not familiar-the Tory Party-and it is a matter of individual opinion as to what part of this House that term, applies. There is no in the dication of any kind to what individual Under these circumstances, it rests with the House, if sufficiently aggrieved, to call the editor of that publication to answer for this general indictment. Whether the dignity of Parliament is served by taking notice of such wild imaginations is. always a. matter for grave consideration. We have known in this State, and elsewhere, editors and publishers brought to the Bar, but we have rarely, if ever, seen any good results follow from the proceedings. this case, as in any other, if some convenient means could be devised by which, without the antiquated procedure that'at present obtains, this House could provide for its protection in the future against particular or wholesale slanders-of which this is by no means the only or the most damaging that could be cited from the press-w e should have some prospect of making those responsible suffer for it in a legal and just way so as to forbid them for the future. But every one who has had any experience in connection with legislative bodies, and of charges of this character, shrinks from taking the only. steps now available, seeing that the almost invariable result is nothing but a great public advertisement of the scandal complained of, and some admonition to the offender without any appreciable effect. Therefore, at this date, after the publication and with such a general charge, I think it may be reasonably questioned whether we have anything to gain by proceeding further. Mr LiDDELi, - There has been a long interval, because the paragraph was not published until Parliament had risen.",17
46,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"No attention was officially called to the matter until, as I have said, past the middle of last month, when four to six weeks had elapsed. So far as my memory serves, no further particulars or repetition of the charges was forthcoming. I clo feel, however, that the time has arrived wben this House is called upon io consider the constant imputations which a it recklessly and .vaguely levelled against honourable members, and sometimes against public officials. We should see whether some adequate mechanism cannot be devised f i r dealing with the offenders without distinction and with the necessary penalties. I shall take an opportunity of consulting my colleagues, and am prepared to advise them to appoint a small Committee to consider a method of procedure by which, without adding to the notoriety clear to some slanderers, we may bring them before a proper tribunal, and deal with them in an efficient manner. TELEPHONEWIRE , SYDNEY AND WOLLONGONG .",18
47,Mr FULLER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General, without notice, whether any provision is made in the Supplementary Estimates for the erection of a copper wire between Wollongong and Sydney ?",18
48,Mr MAUGER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"The Supplementary In Estimates are under consideration, and all the provision that the funds will permit will be made. I am not able to say definitely whether the. wire mentioned will be included, but the provision asked for will be made if it be possible. TASMANIAN CBE.",18
49,Mr STORRER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General, without notice, whether the cable between the mainland and Tasmania has been purchased by the Government, and, if not, whether provision will be made for completing a new cable in view of the expiration of the present contract with the Eastern Extension Company ?",18
50,Mr MAUGER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"Step s have been taken to call for tenders for a new cable, the Eastern Extension Company not being willing to comply with the conditions the Government thought necessary to lay down for the purchase of the present cable. PREFERENTIAL TRADE, PACIFIC ISLANDS.",18
51,Mr BOWDEN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I desire to ask. the Prime Minister, without notice, what steps the Government intend to take to give preferential trade to the New Hebrides, and other islands of the Pacific,' as promised when this question was last debated.",18
52,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"As soon as the Tariff has been passed by both Houses my colleague will introduce proposals' dealing with this subject, and some similar proposals which have been postponed. MARINE SURVEY, NORTH - WE ST COAST.",18
53,Sir JOHNFORREST,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether he can give us any information with regard to the proposed marine survey of the north-west coast of Australia. When is the survey likely to be commenced ?",18
54,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"We have communicated with the Admiralty, and, speaking from memory, I should say a reply has not yet been received. If one has been, received, I shall give the right honourable member the desired information tomorrow.",18
55,Mr WATSON,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"In this connection, I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government have considered the advisableness of providing an Australian survey ship, and not loafing on the Admiralty for the surveys of our coast.",19
56,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,It is not a question of an Australian ship merely. We require the well-trained staff which the Admiralty possess.,19
57,Mr WATSON,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"Doubtless , the Admiralty would lend us some members of that staff to commence with.",19
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"To make our surveys would cost Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year.",19
59,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,The Admiralty survey is the standard survey for all the world.,19
60,Mr WATSON,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,We ought to pay cost of the survey anyway.,19
61,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,We propose to part of the cost. BUSINES S OF THE SESSION.,19
62,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"In a note which I sent the Prime Minister yesterday, I told him I intended to ask him to make a short statement today as to the course of public business.",19
63,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"The course of public business is determined by one factor, which, at the present time, unfortunately, remains of an indeterminate character, namely, the.return of the Tariff, with suggestions from the other Chamber. We are at present unable to say whether the Tariff will be returned to us in three, four, five, or six weeks, and, consequently, any forecast as to public business must be subject to that possible variation. The business proposed, to be dealt with - roughly follows the order of the first items on the notice-paper. The Quarantine Bill has already passed both Houses, and, as only the amendments made by the Senate remain to be dealt with, that measure ought to be rapidly disposed of. Then we have Supply, which, of course, includesthe whole of the Estimates. Ten months of the year have expired,- and they must be disposed of before the end of June.' The Australian Industries Preservation Bill - the third order of the day-come s to us from the Senate, and is a very short measure. Then follows the Papua Bill , a slight, formal measure, whose consideration can be postponed until any convenient opportunity. The f if t h order of the day is the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , which we expect to be able to further consider in Committee very shortly-^when the Senate has dealt with the section of the Tariff relating to it . The Commerce Trade Description Bill , the Marine Insurance Bill , and the resumption of the Committee of Ways and Means, can be handled at convenience - Then comes the Seat of Government Bill , the measure which I understand the honourable and learned gentleman to have chiefly in mind. The only legislation to be introduced in addition to the list on the notice paper, so far as I am now aware, is own a Bill for dealing with the surplus funds returnable to the States. It would have been laid on the table today were it not for the fact that the Attorney-General has the been too engrossed in the cases in the High Court, to which the Commonwealth is a pay party, to be able to complete its final revision ; but the Treasurer will give notice of it today. It is a short but important measure, which must be dealt with before the Tariff is returned to us, and passed into law before June. The consideration of the Estimates and the Additional Estimates, also urgent, can be arranged to meet the wishes of the House. Now, as to time. The first two measures on the'business-paper need not detain us very long. The discussion of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill should occupy, at most, two or three evenings.",19
64,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,Q u it e as long as that.,19
65,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I hope not much, if any,' longer. Supply ought not to call for much debate at this stage. Therefore, we shall probably be able to discuss the Seat of Government Bill at the end of a. fortnight, or possibly after three weeks. The Bill relating to the surplus funds returnable to the States, though short, is important, and may occupy more time than I have allowed for ; but, even if we leavea month for these measures, unless there is much more expedition in another place in dealing with the Tariff, it is prox bable that we shall be able to dispose of theSeat of Government Bill as well before that measure is-returned to us. If we saw that it could not be disposed of before the consideration of the Senate's requests in connection with the Customs Tariff Bill had to be undertaken, it would be wise to postpone it , because it is not desirable to have a break in its consideratioh.",19
66,Mr FRAZER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,When shall we get Postal Rates Bill?,20
67,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"The second reading has not been moved, but I have every son to hope that, with the enthusiastic port of the honourable member, we shall easily carry it. If the Capital Site question is not dealt with before the Customs Tariff Bill, is returned by the Senate, I shall ask motion. the House to deal with it after the Senate's requests have been disposed of, that is, assuming it to be possible to copewith it tion. this session. It will be of great advantage to us, if we are going to close, to pose of it before separating, so that meet next session with a clear run financial and defence proposals.",20
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,Does the Prime Minister suggest any difficulties other than want of time? Its consideration took only a couple of nights on a former occasion.,20
69,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"On the last occasion its consideration occupied more than a fortonly night. There are many delays which may arise, because of the peculiar complications which it presents. Members have second, and third preferences, divisions opinion exist among all parties in gard to every site, and the tactics by which they hope to defeat other sites. Then there are proposals already on the notice-paper-thoug h I do not expect them to be brought forward-for an alteration the Constitution in this regaid. Anything may happen in this way to introduce foreseen embarrassments. If we deal the Quarantine Bill and other measures rapidly as we dealt with certain measures the early part of the session, I see no reason why we should 'not pass the Government Bill this session. - correspondence which took place . a little the session. while ago, my hopes were not so sanguine, because I thought that the matter would bably have to go over until next session. If we'are fortunate in'getting a good - of business, there is no reason why it not. be tackled this session.",20
70,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I wish to refer to the Minnext December. isterial statement, a right which from time - immemorial has been allowed to the leader - of the Opposition.",20
71,Mr SPEAKER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"The honourable ber asked a question in the time allotted for the asking of questions without, notice, .and he has received a reply in the ordinary way. Had I understood the Prinie MinisGovernment ter to be making a Ministerial statement, I should have asked him to conclude' .a motion, to enable debate to take the upon it . As he was merely replying to a. question, I must now call upon the honourable member for Echuca, who rose before reathe honourable member for East Sydney, supor, if the Prime Minister pleases, I will regard him as not having resumed his seat, and give him the opportunity,' bylaying a paper on the table, to conclude with a",20

73,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"My request was that the Prime Minister should make a statement, not to me, but - to the House, as to the probable course of business during the remainder of the session. It is of great help to honourable members to have, from the authority which can give us a reliable ' forecast, a statement of the intentions of the Government in regard to public busifirst, ness ; and I am glad that the Prime Minof ister recognised this by promptly acceding, reto my request. My remarks will not be controversial, because-1 think that such-a speech would be foreign to the occasion; I wish merely to make a few observations, entirely free from party spirit, on the proof gress of public business. The Prime Minister-perhap s because the situation of afunfairs prevented him--ha s unfortunately with not dealt with one very important quesas tion. He has not told us whether he inin tends a short time hence merely to follow the practice adopted just prior to Christ- .

74,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"The honourable gentleman prodid not make'it clear whether he meant a prorogation of a couple of months, f o lrun lowed by a new session in September, or should merely an adjournment, allowing the present session to extend from last July until",20
75,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,I intimated that I hoped that the session would close soon; - but it is quite possible that the prorogation will memhave to be postponed as suggested.,20
76,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"Then I may take it that the state of public business leaves it open to the to decide whether there is to be a new .session after a prorogation two or with three months hence, or merely an adjournplace ment. The Government leaves that open.",20
77,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"Yes , until we know when we shall get the .Customs Tariff Bill the Senate.",21
78,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"There were one or - two very important, though perhaps inadout vertent, omissions from the Prime Minisestablishment ter's statement, one of the most sti iking being the lack of a reference to measures to give effect to the new protection. The honourable gentleman will remember that the Government made that rather novel, but most important, departure an essential part of their Tariff policy.",21
79,Mr WATSON,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,-He said yesterday that it is still so.,21
80,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,I think we are all agreed as to its importance. Am I to understand that when the Prime Minister spoke of Tariff he had in mind the - Tariff as nected with the system of new protection ?',21
81,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"Hear , hear.",21
82,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"That removes one diffianother, culty. We shall have a very considerable volume of business relating to the Tariff and that very important matter to dispose of. May I suggest to the earnest conpractically sideration of the Government that they should avoid as far as possible departing from understandings arrived at between the Government and this House in conit nexion with the rates of duties? It will most inconvenient if we discover, when and-by the Tariff is returned to us, that the Minister in charge of it in another place has departed from the understandanother ings which the Treasurer arrived at with this House in regard to certain duties. dealing with this Tariff by-and-by we the next three weeks. shall have troubles enough without having what I might call a high temperature envisit gendered as the result of an arrangement arrived at between the Committee of House and the Government being overridden by a member of the Government in. another place. ' Unless the Cabinet with one voice in dealing with the Tariff the normal difficulties of the situation be immensely increased, and honourable members who are opposed to the GoyernMinister ment in.this House will have scope to put one member of the Ministry against another in connection with these important matters. That would be very undesirable. I hope that when the Tariff comes back to us the arrangements which have been made between the Government and members of the Committee of this House will be honvote as he pleases. orably observed. If the new protection scheme fails and cannot be proceeded to with, I presume that honourable members from who have been dealing with the Tariff on the basis of that important system will not treat it as being precisely the same with the new protection. I presume that the of the new protection has entered seriously ' into the consideration of honourable members in connection with the imposition of duties. I feel sure that they will review the situation if the new protection scheme cannot be proceeded with. The Prime Minister very properly promised us that the Committee would have an opportunity to review the position if such a situation arose. I come now to the question of the Seat of Government. The constant iteration of the demand for settlement of the question may .occasionally prethe sent to some honourable members a more or conJess humorous aspect. But putting aside those passing humours, I feel that since; the Government and the House have determined to deal with the matter one way or the sooner it is out of the way the better. It has been a disturbing influence in the course of our legislation for the last eight years, and since the Government have pledged themselves to deal with it within the next two or three weeks, or very soon afterwards, I would strongly urge them to ask the House to dispose of before the Tariff is returned to us. I take be the Government to be sincere in their statebyment that they propose to get it out of the way this session. There will be ample time to do so before the Tariff is returned from place, and I hope I am representing the general feeling of the House when In I say that it should be dealt with within That would give every honourable member who wishes to rethe suggested sites, or to visit them for the first time, a reasonable opportunity to this do so during the next two week-ends.",21
83,Mr FISHER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,What procedure does the speaks right honourable member suggest ?,21
84,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"It is much better that the will procedure to be adopted in settling the question should be decided by the Prime and his colleagues. I made one suggestion yesterday, but think it would be unfair to advance any other suggestion before the Government ha\e stated their intention. I look to them to determine upon a method bf procedure which will leave every honourable member perfectly free to",21
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,The great thing is get a definite date fixed for the consideration of this matter.,21
86,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"Certainly ; but I accept the Prime Minister's statement that it will be dealt with within the next two or three weeks, and am pointing out that we can dispose of it before the Tariff is returned to us.",22
87,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,I do not want to encourand age delay elsewhere on that account in dealing with the Tariff.,22
88,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"There is yet a great deal of work to be done in connection with Tariff. I cordially agree the Prime Minister that the Quarantine Bill should be got out of the way. It is practically finished, and should have been posed of years ago. The Government will find very little difficulty in passing through its remaining stages. The Addiof tional Estimates are very important. I not know their nature, but do not suppose that they raise any large question policy. That being so, their consideration should not take long. The Prime Minister did not say. anything about the Defence scheme, but I suppose that was a mere omission.",22
89,Mr DEAKIN,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,Not about the Bill .,22
90,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"The defence scheme for the present seems to be put aside. Although I differ from the Prime Minister, 1 thoroughly recognise the service which has rendered in bringing this question to Federal system. the forefront of practical politics. However much we may differ from his views on the question, we must nil do that. Whilst the future scheme remains in abeyance, I unusual. hope that the Prime Minister will not suspend or impair the existing system, that the fullest encouragement will be given to the rifle clubs, the militia and the teer forces, and that recruiting will be encould speak. couraged in every possible way. Those are lines upon which we all agree. We am gestion. agreed as to the .importance of defence; differ only as to the precise methods to adopted. Pending the settlement of the question, let the methods prevailing f years in the Commonwealth be fullv supable ported. In the Governor General's Speech, at the opening of this Parliament, great prominence was given to the financial relasion tions of the States, coupled with the ization of old-age pensions. Long took up a very strong attitude in respect to that matter. A Conference of is about to be held, ancl I hope thac the Government will use their influence with the Premiers of the States to secure rangement that will enable old-age pentinue that policy?

101,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"That is a very fair sugI can see no trouble if the we other States will only consent to give he the Federal Government the authority to federalize old-age pensions, and to take o r the amount required from the sum returnto them under the Constitution!. The difficulty of the Braddon section would thus be surmounted, and an old-age pensystem could be federalized without federaldelay/ No amendment of the Constituago I tion would be necessary. I hope that the Government will use their influence with Premiers the Premiers of the States.",22

103,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,r should use every effort to induce them to adopt the proposal.,23
104,Mr SPEAKER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,I must ask the right honourable member not to deal further with that matter.,23
105,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I come now to the Postal Rates Bill . Surely.the Prime Minister is not going to devote valuable public time to the discussion of that Bill , which would deprive us of a revenue of over ^100,000 per annum, at a time when the officers of the Post and Telegraph Department are notoriously underpaid. . If we had the necessary money, and everything in the Department were being conducted in a - proper way, no anxiety would be experienced by anybody. The idea underlying the proposal is a good one. The more postage is cheapened the better. Every intelligent man will admit that. But we must have some regard to the financial position of the Commonwealth, and if we have -7 Ooo,ooo to spare, I would rather see it paid away to the men who carry our letters or devoted to placing reasonable postal and telephonic facilities within the reach of-the whole community, than I would see it expended upon penny postage.",23
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"There better paid public servants in the world than those of the Commonwealth, especially those in the lower grades.",23
107,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I have been looking through the report of the Public Service Commissioner, and the general average of the salaries paid in the Postal Department strikes me as being very low indeed.",23
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,-The right honourable member should compare the salaries which they were receiving prior to Federation with those which they are receiving now.,23
109,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"The fact that their position has been improved is not conclusive evidence that they are now getting all that they are entitled to. We must endeavour, as far as possible, fo get on with the transaction of public business, and if , by adjourning, instead of proroguing, two or three months hence, we can secure more expedition and satisfaction, I am sure that honourable members will not shrink from adopting that course. So far as I am concerned-and I think I may speak for honourable members upon this side of the House-so long as the measures submitted by the Government are measures to which we can give our support, we will not allow any party feeling to interfere with the discharge of our duty to the country. When Government measures call for criticism, it will not be found wanting. If , however, the Ministry will redeem the promise which has now been distinctly made, to deal with one of the thorny subjects that has been before the House for many years-the question of the selection of the permanent Seat of Government-ther e will have been one achievement this session upon which they will be able to congratulate themselves.",23
110,Mr FISHER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,I desire to offer a few remarks,23
111,Mr SPEAKER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I would point out that the course which has been pursued this afternoon is most objectionable, and is opposed to the rules which have hitherto governed our procedure. But, having asked the House to grant leave to the leader of the Opposition to speak, I must extend the same courtesy to the honourable member for Wide Bay, as the leader of the Labour Party. Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member Have leave to speak ? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear !",23
112,Mr FISHER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"Wide Bay) [3.30] - I agree with some of the. observations which are no have been - made by the leader of the Opposition, and I disagree with others. It is, therefore, only fair that I should be permitted to state the position which I take up. I am exceedingly pleased to learn of the anxiety of the right honourable member for East Sydney to have certain matters submitted to the State Premiers. I can assure him that the whole of the members of the Labour Party are just as anxious as he is in that connection. But the fact cannot be ignored that our patience in these matters has been almost exhausted, and the time has arrived when this Parliament must perform the duty which has been cast upon it. Upon the question of penny postage, I have already expressed my opinion very strongly. Every honourable member is' in favour of penny postage if it were merely a question of penny postage versus twopenny postage. But the real point is whether we shall devote money which is being collected in certain of the States in which the residents do not enjoy reasonable postal and telephonic facilities to the introduction of the system of penny postage. Shall we provide these persons with reasonable postal - and telephonic facilities, or shall we allow a particular Minister to gain some little political kudos for having brought about the adoption of penny postage during his tenure of office? I say that until we have provided the residents of the various States with an efficient postal service we should hesitate to adopt penny postage. The one matter which I consider most urgent at the present time is the carrying out of the pledges which we have repeatedly made to the old people of Australia that we would pay them old-age pensions. PUBLIC SERVICE : BOARDS OF. INQUIRY.",23
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"Whils t the honourable member for Maranoa was speaking last evening, I promised that I would make an inquiry concerning the practice which has been adopted by the Public Service Commissioner under regulation .267A. I have made that inquiry from the Commissioner, who writesThe necessity for the regulation arose through numerous cases arising in the remote parts - of the Commonwealth where offences had been committed at distant places-say , for example, such places as the Gulf country of Queensland or Broome, or Wyndham, in AVestern Australia. To get to many of tliese places would necessitate the Board's spending days travelling by steamers and coaches both ways at considerable expense, and it was considered that in these exceptional cases some more reasonable and business like means should be devised than that of either bringing the accused and all necessary witnesses to the head centre or of taking three highly-paid ofncials away from their work for perhaps weeks, with all the attendant expenses. In cases of this kind the evidence is taken locally by a responsible and competent person. The accused has full opportunity of being represented by counsel and' cross-examining any witnesses brought against him, and also of adducing whatever evidence he is able to in his favour. It is dealt with in exactly the same way as if the inquiry were held at the head centre. When the evidence is completed, it is remitted verbatim to the Board', who consider it and arrive at their finding. In regard to the statement made by the honourable member for Maranoa, the Commissioner informed me that the gentleman who held the inquiry at Bowen had expressed the opinion that it was absolutely improper for any person conducting such an inquiry to give any information regarding the case. His duty was merely to take the evidence submitted, and without comment to forward it to the Board. The - Commissioner addsThe procedure followed is by no means novel or new, and is the same as that adopted by Courts of law in a case where evidence is taken on commission in order to avoid the useless expense of bringing witnesses from distant parts. .[3^]- 2",24
114,Mr REID,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,That is only when they are in foreign countries. No commission is* issued to examine witnesses who are within our jurisdiction.,24
115,Mr SPEAKER,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,I do not know whether the memorandum which the Trea-' surer desires to present to the House is of much greater length.,24
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"No; I have nearly completed reading it. It continuesWith regard to the three officers at Bowen, Messrs. Beach, Edwards, and Stanborough, who are under suspension in connection with delay in delivering a registered letter containing an electoral nomination, a Board of Inquiry has been appointed in each case, consisting of . Mr. Berkman, Chief Postal Inspector, Mr Kent, Sub-Collector of Customs, and Mr Thomson, the Divisional representative. As considerable time and expense and Departmental inconvenience would be involved in sending these officers from Brisbane to Bowen, Mr Moran, Police Magistrate at Bowen, has been appointed to take all the evidence on oath and remit it for the consideration of the Board as provided for in regulation 267A/ - I desire to add that the power of delegating the taking of evidence has been exercised by the Commissioner on the advice of the Attorney-General as. to its legality. When the Public Service Bill was under consideration in the House, this very point was raised, and I remember that the Gulf of Carpentaria was specially mentioned in connection with it. Provision was inserted in that Bill for the taking of evidence in this manner for the purpose of enabling cases to be dealt with, which it was practically impossible to deal with in any other way. In the case mentioned last evening by the honourable member for Franklinthat of Miss Hall- a Board was appointed to inquire into it. The Board visited Ross",24
117,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"My complaint was that Miss Hall was not present when the inquiry was held. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Sh e was present, and gave evidence, and she was also represented by counsel. The honourable member has been misinformed.  surer whether he thinks that an officer of the Public Service who is stationed in the northern or western portions of Queensland, and who is charged with an offence, should be placed in any worse position than an officer who is resident in the more favoured districts around Brisbane ?",24
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,I certainly think not; but we have to deal with this matter in a practical way. conversations with the Public Service Commissioner in order to ascertain whether it would not be possible in distant places to appoint a Board of residents there instead of appointing one official.,24
119,Mr WATSON,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,I think that might be very injudicious.,25
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ALLEGED CORRUPTION OF,"I admit that it might, and, therefore, we have to proceed .with a view to giving the man in a distant 'district the same facilities, as far as pos-.siMe, as those enjoyed b'y the man in the centre of population. The honourable member will admit that it is most difficult to deal with cases in distant parts of this immense continent. Last night the honourable member for Maranoa stated that the plan complained of was adopted only in Queensland, but I may inform him that exactly similar procedure has laeen f o l lowed in New South Wales. the territory is not so large, and, therefore, this procedure is not necessary, and in Western Australia there has never been a case requiring it.  that an officer, whose case is investigated by one man in the person of a police magistrate in one of the Western towns of Queensland, has the same chance of justice as has an officer whose case is investigated by the Board before which witnesses are examined ?",25

The amendment, which is in the form of an addition to clause 45, provides that where a person ordered into quarantine is not, in the opinion of the quarantine officer, actually suffering from a quarantinable disease, he may, subject to the regulations, be permitted to leave the ship or station under quarantine surveillance. The opinion of a quarantine officer is a variable opinion.",28
158,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Imagin e the case of a new Governor General arriving. Does the right honourable member not think that the Governor General, if not suffering from any disease, should be allowed to land ?",28
159,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"When such an extraordi15. nary case arises, it will be dealt with in some way or other. What I am saying is that, in the actual administration of the quarantine law, - if it be permissible to allow persons out of bounds, we know, as a rule, the class of persons who will be thus treated.",28
160,Mr FISHER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I agree generally w.ith the right honourable member, but it would be better to have the law made thus elastic than to have the law overridden.",28

We must remember the tremendous risks to which the community might be exposed if this amendment were made part of the law. Doctors, like other men, may make mistakes,- and even in cases where a man is not, when examined, apparently suffering from disease, he may, if allowed out of quarantine, develop it - within a day or two, to the great danger of the community. What is the use of providing for the surveillance of men allowed out of quarantine bounds? Who is amendment, going to look after the liberated contact? Mr : DEAKIN - The practice against which the honourable member is speaking has existed in England for many years.",28

166,Mr BATCHELOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There should be either strict quarantine or no quarantine.,28
167,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What - intense dissatisfaction would be created amongst the passengers of . a quarantined ship if some favoured person, having perhaps large interests on shore, were allowed his liberty, while the remainder were detained ! The law must be administered humanely, but with the most absolute impartiality. By allowing only one person out of quarantine, the community would be exposed to the dangers for the prevention. of which perhaps 199 other persons were being detained. It is unfortunate that quarantine detention should be necessary; but it is useless unless made absolute. What surveillance can there be of persons allowed out cf quarantine? Are we going to provide that certain passengers of a detained vessel may go to a first-class lodging house in Queenscliff, while the remainder are kept quarantined at the quarantine station ? Such difference of treatment would create the most intense dissatisfaction. In my opinion, it is objectionable to give any quarantine officer such tremendous power. Mr .FRAZER - Is the power given to the quarantine officer ?",29
168,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The quarantine officer must give the opinion, before any person can be liberated, that he is not suffering from the disease for which the detention has been - made. The quarantine officer may make a mistake, or he may be right, ancl the man may not be suffering from the disease, but, having been a contact, or having become infected, although showing no signs of sickness, he may become ill within two or three days after his liberation. We do not know what the proposed regulations will provide.",29
169,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is left to the Executive Government to say under what conditions exceptions may be made on the score of dire necessity.,29
170,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"When vessels are quarantined, there are ordinarily only one or two persons, out of perhaps 100 on board, suffering from disease, but as the disease may have been communicated to those who have been in close contact with them, it has been considered unsafe to release any one until a sufficiently long period has elapsed to show that no further case will develop. Quarantine would be intolerable if it did not apply to all concerned. When Treasurer of New South Wales, I administered the Quarantine Department, and know that occasionally the most impassioned appeals for release, on account urgent business, or for other reasons, were made to the .authorities. There would be seething discontent if one man were released while another in exactly the same position, so far as the quarantinable disease was concerned, was detained. The proposed distinction is likely to upset the whole quarantine system. If it were provided that every person not suffering from a quarantinable disease should be allowed to go free, the proposal would be regarded as farcical, and the suggestion that certain persons, not apparently suffering, should be allowed to go free, strikes at the utility of quarantine.",29

Would such a person be detained if , in the opinion of the medical officer in charge, he could with perfect safety to the community be allowed to visit his relative, and return to the quarantine station?

I was surprised to learn, of when a conference of the medical officers 01 Australia assembled not long ago, that they were unanimously in favour of doing away with quarantine, and having open ports. They seem prepared to deal with infectious diseases after they come here.",29

There may be occasions when, in the interests of the country, certain persons may have to be allowed out under surveillance.

The reference made by an honourable member to the position of a naval officer on board such a vessel was rather beside the. mark There are strong sentimental considerations running through all our legislation. Cases of hardship must arise under every law.

There is no comparison between the quarantine laws of Great Britain and these of Australia. For many years quarantine in the Old Land has been practically existent. There is a certain measure of surveillance, but nothing more. In AustraUnder lia the position is wholly different. This is a young country, with a comparatively small population, and we want to shut all highly contagious diseases. The amendthink ment of clause 45 is not at all comparable with clause 14. Under that clause the Governor General, acting on the advice his responsible Ministers, may exempt person from quarantine, and the Ministry would have to take full responsibility such action. We may depend upon it that individual from quarantine. they would take care to obtain the opinion of more than one expert before advising the Governor General to release any vidual fromquarantine. Under this amendSenate, ment, however, a suspect might be allowed to leave a ship and spread disease. In this country it is almost impossible to keep man so released under surveillance.

He might there be placed under surveillance of the local policeman, but f within three weeks the whole district would probably be infected witli scarlet fever. Since we have adopted the principle of quarantine, we should make our quarantine Taws effective.

That can be his only reason for proposing that the amendment be agreed to. It seems very I largely to set aside the whole object of been the Bill .

If there is a possibility of an outbreak of small-pox, for instance, from a shipload of people, who, though not suffering from the disease, are let loose on the land with it latent in their is worth our while taking every precaution. In a climate like that of Australia, where diseases seem to thrive and spread with amazing rapidity, we ought to be all the more careful in our endeavours to prevent the introduction of what have proved such terrible scourges elsewhere.

214,Mr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Melbourne) [4.42] I shall vote for the amendment suggested by the Senate. I do not think any one is more favourable to stringent regulations affecting the spreading of diseases than I am. When I was at Hong Kong I made many inquiries, the results of which induced me to regard that place as the storm-centre of disease so far as Australia and other places are concerned. I am alluding now to the three dangerous diseases. nf small-pox, cholera, and plague; and in no country in the world do the conditions prevail which can be observed at Hong Kong. No less than 1,100 dead bodies are thrown into the streets of that city every year, and those who know the veneration which the Chinese have for their dead will understand that there must be something wrong when such conditions prevail in an Engjish port which is greater than either London or Liverpool. The South China Weekly Post, in 1905, published figures showing that in the previous year the total number of bodies examined at Hong Kong was 2,225. Of these, non-plague cases numbered 1,700, or'nearly 80 per cent., while the plague cases numbered 430, or 19.3 per cent.; 1,171 bodies were, in the same year, found in the streets, of which the non-plague cases numbered 1,028 or 87.4 per cent., while the plague cases numbered 148, or 1.2.6 per cent. Those figures deal particularly with' plague; but there were also Small-pox and cholera cases. I have full confidence in the conduct of'any Government officer who has control in a place of trust. It was interjected by one honourable member that the officer might be bribed; but bribery is possible anywhere, and an officer who is subject to such influence would be in danger not only of losing his position, but, 1. believe, of severe punishment under the Act.",33

I can say that one of the persons who was under surveillance in West Melbourne afterwards expressed the opinion that he would prefer sir weeks in a quarantine station. I read the speech of the honourable senator whe introduced this amendment, and his views accord with my experience. I have been four times a doctor cn board ship, ancl have brought emigrants to Australia, so that I have some knowledge of this matter. I do not think we sufficiently appreciate what we owe to the United States in connection with the preservation of the public health. It is not the laws' as they leave the American Congress, but the regulations and the ability of the heads of the Department, which make America the sentinel, as it were, to guard us from the diseases of the East. All bills of health on ships in the Japan trade, ancl the Eastern trade generally, have to be vised by the American Consul. This holds good in all the ports on the way to Hong Kong; and at Manila the American authorities insist on the Chinese on board taking antiseptic baths. We must all pay a meed of praise to the great American nation for so guarding us from the dangers incidental to the diseases of the East. There is no doubt that we might reciprocate somewhat-that .the present Government might act in friendly co-operation with the American authorities in order to make our safeguards better than they are now. The sooner this Bill becomes law, the better it will be for us ; ancl if experience proves, in the course of a year or two, that amendments are necessary., they can easily be made.",33

On the arrival of such a. vessel at Port Darwin, the medical officer might be absent, and the quarantine officer, who need not be a. medical man, would, under the amendment, have power to allow certain of the passengers to go ashore. We have it on the authority of the honourable member for Hunter that some diseases take three weeks to develop. As for the surveillance spoken of, it has been explained that that means that the persons concerned must attend regularly to have their pulse, temperature, and their respiration on taken. Is the local policeman to determine diswhether such a person is suffering from disease, and, if so, what the nature of the to go disease is? Even in regard to measles, several examinations have often to be made before the disease can be definitely disany tinguished from diseases whose initial the symptoms are similar. . Besides, the local "" bobby "" will be as likely as any one else no to take an infectious disease. Under this provision, any one might be allowed to land quaranat Port Darwin from a vessel from the East,- so long as he showed no signs of disease.

If it were certain that a person could be released without danfor ger to the community, what occasion would there, be for keeping him under surveilbility lance? I am sure that the public will put up with anything in the nature of favouritism in regard to quarantine. Ifa ship is'detained because of the sickness of one or two of her passengers, the medical officer must either keep all on board in quarantine, or let all who are not sick go. If the latter course is to be taken, the Bill is unnecessary. All we should do is to provide that persons actually suffering from infectious diseases shall be detained. In a district like that which I represent, it would be impossible for a person to present, himself daily at a police station, because police stations are often more than a day's quarantine journey apart. Probably most persons would prefer to stay in quarantine, where, as at Sydney, they would be fairly comfortable, rather than be compelled to present themselves to the police from day to day. *At any rate, it is unwise to leave a loophole for abuse. Honourable members must know what a great scare there was in Sydney when plague was first discovered there, and we may have a similar small-pox scare if , by allowing persons out of quarantine, the disease is spread through the community. Act Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - Quarantine officers can release passengers now.",35
238,Mr SPENCE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No medical officer would think of releasing passengers with-out a thorough examination, which would betake a long time if there were 200 Or more. I have not heard many complaints in regard to our quarantine regulations. The public recognise that it is wise to take may precautions against the introduction of diseases - The honourable member for Melonly made the wisdom of such a course more apparent, by showing the great clanger of infection from the East. Yet he would give the quarantine officers power r to turn loose a ship load of passengers who had been in contact with a diseased person.",35

240,Mr SPENCE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable gentlegave the Americans great credit for the safeguards they take, which, he said, were advantage to us. But his remarks only emphasized the need for great care on our part. It may be that this system would a time work very w e l l ; that the quarantine officers would recognise the responsicast upon them, and would not be not' prepared to release any man until they had satisfied themselves, after consultation with other experts, that he should be allowed to go free. After a time, however, a more lax state of affairs might prevail. Let us consider the preservation of the health of the people generally, and err, if at all, on the side of hardship, rather than run the risk of allowing disease to be spread broadcast.",35
241,Mr CARR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Macquarie) [5.11] - It is somewhat incongruous that the leader of the Opposition and others should take exception to the action of the Minister in proposing to accept an amendment enabling the Government to be guided by the advice of their experts, having regard to the fact that only yesterday the right honourable member denounced them for failing to act upon certain expert advice with reference to the defence of Australia. We have the opinion of the Government medical officer of New South Wales Mr Reid.;-But this is an afterthought. It did not appear in the Bill as introduced.",36
242,Mr CARR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Perhaps the Government did not then have the opinion in question?,36
243,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Oh , yes.",36
244,Mr CARR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Government medical officer of New South Wales says that there is no need for the exacting conditions that have hitherto prevailed. The system of quarantine, to my mind, has never been absolute. The conditions supposed to be in operationare so irksome that I believe they have been largely ignored, or that it has been tacitly conceded that they cannot be observed in their entirety. From some of the arguments that have been a'd-"" vanced, it would seem that the quarantine laws of the States have-been more honoured in the breach than in the observance. The point is that the quarantine officers would recognise that, provided those affected by the disease were detained, nothing was to be gained by quarantining the remaining passengers on a ship upon which an outbreak of small-pox had occurred. self-interest would cause those allowed to go free to keep a careful watch upon themselves and ascertain whether or not they were infected.",36
245,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"What about the people with"" whom they associated?",36
246,Mr CARR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It does not follow that the disease would be disseminated in that way. I gather that the opinion of medical men is that infection does not take place so readily as many laymen imagine. not when the disease is incubating, but when it has developed, that"" danger of infection arises. The diseases to which this provision relates already exist amongst us. If we placed in .quarantine persons who were suffering from any of these diseases, or were noticeably developing any of them, we should keep them well under control. The fear of the public-whic h would materialize into public opinion-of the possibility of the spread - of disease, would have considerable political weight. It certainly seems to me that we are justified in accepting the opinions of experts in this matter. In the United States of America only those who are affected are quarantined.",36
247,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Then we shall have to remodel the system. Mr CARR.'-It is admitted that England has abandoned the system because there are so many people entering and leaving that country that it is impossible to secure effective quarantine. . After all, the health of the people depends more upon an effective local system and the setting of our own house in order than upon watching assiduously those who come from abroad. Let us by all means quarantine those who are infected with disease, but we are merely bowing to the inevitable when we say it is impossible to quarantine every one who conies from an infected port or lands from an infected ship. We must content ourselves. with quarantining the passengers who are suffering from any contagious disease, trusting to the law and good sense of the remainder who are allowed to land to report themselves. I do not propose, as was suggested, that they should report to a policeman. ' Such a proposition is ridiculous. None but qualified medical officers would be deputed to carrv out that duty.",36
248,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable member for Melbourne said that in West Melbourne suspects had been called upon to report themselves at the police station; Reasons of Mr MALONEY - Yes ; but I did not mean to'suggest that patients were paraded through the streets.,36

If the ister makes a mistake, he is responsible Parliament and the country; but if under this amendment the quarantine officer a mistake, the Government would not be responsible. The Ministerial head of the Department could say, "" I know nothing about the matter. The mistake was made all-important. by one of my officers."" We have given the Minister quite enough power to deal ence of a few ? with this matter under clause 14. This is not a party' question; we are seeking to do what is best in the interests of the public. It is a mistake to allow our quarantine regulations to become too. lax. If my memory serves me. rightly, we last had an outbreak of small-pox in Victoria some twelve or fourteen years ago. days after the arrival of a certain vessel in our port, one of the passengers was found to be suffering from small-pox. Meantime, all the other passengers hacl scattered over Australia. I think that at least a dozen cases of small-ipox occurred, ancl that .one of the passengers carried the disease as far as Sydney. That shows the clanger of allowing any passenger out of quarantine before the ger - period has expired. I question, the authorities collected as many of the passengers as possible, and erected tents for their accommodation on Coode Island. Half-a-dozen houses were also placer! under police surveillance, biit, withstanding those precautions, a number of cases of small-pox occurred, and the ease spread to Sydney.

If we agree the amendment of the Senate we open the door to the introduction of small-pox and other diseases from oversea - I shall therefore support the right honourable member for East Sydney in his opposition to the proposal.",37
261,Mr LIDDELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Hunter) [5,27] - I desire to preface my remarks with the statement that the incubation period of small-pox is thirteen days, not three weeks, as I hurriedly interjected this afternoon, in reply to an observation by the honourable member for Parramatta. It seems to me that in connection with a Bill of this description we cannot exercise too much caution. Various opinions have been expressed by honourable members regarding different forms of quarantine, the reasons underlying quarantine, and the results attending it . Whilst the leader of the Labour Party was speaking, I made an interjection which was intended to direct attention to the fact that different countries required to adopt different systems of quarantine. Unfortunately, my interjection was misunderstood by the honourable member for Dalley, who subsequently attempted to turn it inside out. a loss to know why my interjections possess such a peculiar fascination for that honourable member, who rarely allows an opportunity to pass without taking exception to them. I . repeat that different countries require to adopt different systems of quarantine. The system which obtains in Great Britain differs from that which prevails in America. Nor can the Commonwealth expect to fashion its quarantine laws upon the lines which have been adopted by the countries of the old world, because our conditions are entirely dissimilar. For instance, we have a very sparse population, and practically a virgin country. Australia has never suffered from cholera or hydrophobia, and in that respect it differs from Continental countries. Further, we are, to a large extent, protected from the introduction of disease by .our extensive seaboard, by the fact that Australia is an island, and by our remoteness from infected ports. We are so far removed from some of these ports that passengers who have contracted disease on the voyage would have recovered from the attack ere they arrived here. In Great Britain the people chiefly fear cholera, and in America small-pox. In Australia we chiefly fear small-pox, which may be introduced from eastern countries. To-day the means of transit have become so rapid that the rlpnger of its introduction has been considerably increased. Of course, if we had perfect sanitation and perfect sanitary laws we might have very little to fear, and it might be possible to adopt the limited form of quarantine adopted in America, under which suspects are allowed to travel throughout the country, and only those persons who are . actually suffering from disease are placed in quarantine. But that system ought not to be adopted here, because for a considerable time we may reasonably hope to keep out diseases from abroad. Honourable members must recognise that if we possessed the maritime trade ' that is possessed by older countries it would be almost impossible to do this. If we had ships arriving daily - with numbers of immigrants on board it would be almost impossible to quarantine the whole of the passengers carried by them. But situated as we are, we should endeavour to make the provisions of our Quarantine Act as rigid as possible. The more stringent our health laws are the better for all concerned. I shall oppose the amendment I am at of the Senate, because it would open the door to the introduction of disease. I quite agree .with the leader of the Opposition that it would be unwise on our part to allow this Bill to be altered in the waysuggested by the Senate. I shall vote against the proposal, because, also, it is not right to vest such large powers .in the hands of a quarantine officer. I know that officers are supposed to be above suspicion, but we must recollect that we are all human. It appears to me that at the present time a tremendous quantity of opium is being smuggled into the Commonwealth, and that a few coloured aliens are also gaining admission. .I am, therefore, led to fear that the regulations in respect of these matters are not being administered as they should be. In exactlv the same way I apprehend that the adoption of the amendment made by the Senate might permit of the introduction of diseases that we do not wish to see here.",38
262,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"East Sydney) [5.38] - I think that this is a very important matter in connection with our quarantine laws. We should be very careful about how we set up a code of laws and afterwards give the officers administering them power to give effect to a different system. This Bill prescribes a system of dealing with all persons on board ships upon which there is infectious disease. It provides that every individual upon such a ship, no matter what may be his rank or station, shall be quarantined until a certain period has elapsed, when it will be safe to allow him to mix with the general public. How the honourable member for Macquarie can entertain the flippant view that he does of the danger of disease spreading amongst our people passes my comprehension. about Tories! Was ever a more recklessly Conservative speech delivered than that made by the honourable member? What is the imprisoning all these persons because there is one case of disease on board ? It is not that we want to punish them. This is not done because we desire to expose people to inconvenience and suffering, but because the great mass of the people must be saved from the possibility of pestilences, which if introduced might destroy thousands. We desire to keep Australia free from those horrible scourges which afflict more populous communities; and, however harsh it may seem, we, in' the interests of public health, are passing a law which compels every one on a ship under such circumstances to be practically im prisoned until the period of possible danger has expired.",38
263,Mr CARR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,What about expert opinion ?,39
264,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,May I suggest that the Conference of Medical Officers never suggested any exemption of the kind. That Conference was held three or four years ago; and we may be sure that if they had recommended an exemption the necessary provision would have been provided in the Bill originally.,39
265,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Would the right honourable member accept the exemption if the experts recommended it?,39
266,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In making laws affecting the liberty of the subject, we have a very high duty to discharge. Why should it be in the power of a. medical officer to set one man free and keep foity-nine others imprisoned behind the bars of the quarantine station ? Surely we must have some regard for principle. If the safety of the public requires the forty-nine men to it requires that the one man also shall be imprisoned.",39
267,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The forty-nine might let out and the one detained.,39
268,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Eithe r proceeding is ridiquarantine. culous. Either let every one go wbo is free from disease, or detain all. The present system is that not only those who have velled on the ship, but even any from the shore who may have come aboard to greet 'relative, or by any chance may have got the quarantine' aiea, are detained. This, as 1 say, is done not because we desire to interfere with the liberty of individuals, but because the public interests require the act of force and detention. The very fact that any person released under this amendment Talk is to be under observation shows that the authorities are not sure that he will not develop disease.

276,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In the main, we aU agree with that view; but we do not desire to - see a number of people unnecessarily detained simply because there is no enactment under which they can be released if they are free from disease.",40
277,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is a question of system, and not one of individual exemption.

285,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We can realise how much easier it would be for me, for instance, than for many others to take advantage of the exemption offered by the amendment.",40
286,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And if the honourable, member were clean, why should he be detained?",40
287,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then why should any one else be detained who is clean? Let us have a system that applies to all men alike.,40
288,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,This proposal' does.,40
289,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It does, in a sense that an officer may do as he likes. Clause 18 provides1. The following persons shall be subject to quarantine :(a) Every person who is on board a vessel subject to quarantine, or who has been . on board the vessel (being an oversea vessel) since her arrival in Australia; (b) Every person infected with a quarantinable disease; and (c) Every person who has been in contact. with or exposed to infection from any person or goods subject to quarantine. That is the principle of the measure; and under that principle the moment a vessel reaches port, with disease on board, every person thereon is detained. If it is desired to do away with that principle, and to permit to go free all who are not actually sick, or showing symptoms of sickness, then it is a question of policy for. the House to decide. But if that be regarded as a safe course, it is a reversal of the rules of all the quarantine systems of Australia up to this day ; and instead of making quarantine more efficient it will break it down. I have before me the Consolidated Quarantine Act of New South Wales of 189,7, d a n there is not a line under which even the greatest man that ever lived could be exempt from quarantine if he happened to be a passenger on a vessel subject to detenI tion. I do not believe in clause 14. If it is right to keep thousands of people in quarantine, although they are well, there is no rhyme or. reason in allowing any one to leave. It is a practical breaking of the law in favour of some individual. At any rate, those who believe in some power to distinguish between one man and another ought to be satisfied with clause 14, which is as followsThe Governor General may exempt, for such time and subject to such conditions as he thinks fit, from all or any of the provisions of this Actfa) any ship of war j (i) any vessels trading exclusively between Australia and New Zealand or F i j i , or other places adjacent to Australia; (c) any particular vessel or class of vessels, and (d) any .persons, animals, plants, or goods.",40

If , in the public interest, certain persons exposed to infection are quarantined, why should exceptions be made? In Holland, there are many miles of dykes, but one little leak might be sufficient to make them all useless. So the release from quarantine of one apparently healthy person might nullify the precautions of years, by sowing the seeds of an ineradicable pestilence. The word ' ' surveillance "" is a new one in English legislation. The person under surveillance is at liberty, and yet not at liberty.",41

My experience tells me that exceptions would not be made except in regard to persons of influence and standing; that unknown persons, would not be released. If , in the interests of the public health, certain persons should be kept behind prison bars for a time, those bars should not be. let down for any one.",41
296,Mr GLYNN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Angas) [5.59] - I do not wish to say anything in regard to the general objections to the amendment, because they have been' pretty exhaustively stated. I do not believe in it, because it seems to me dangerous. Furthermore, I do not think it workable. Clauses 17 ancl 19 provide that when a man is allowed to land from a ship, he is released from quarantine, and no after surveillance is possible."". If there is to be no surveillance, the public will not be protected. Clause 34 provides that, when a vessel arrives at a port from a proclaimed place, or is subject to quarantine, and the quarantine officer is satisfied that there is no person on board actually suffering from disease, he may allow her to continue her voyage, and may allow persons to land. But it is expressly provided that those so allowed to land remain subject to quarantine, and must obey the regulations regarding surveillance. Under the amendment, there is no such reservation. It is notstated that the person landing is still subject to quarantine. Therefore, unless kept subject to quarantine, he is clear of the penal provisions relating to a quarantined person. It is provided that he'shall be under quarantine surveillance, and shall comply with the. regulations relating thereto; but the Bill gives no power for the making of such regulations. Clause 87 contains - a general power for making, regulations, but it implies a limitation to the matters therein set down. The Minister would find that before the Â£ i o o penalty ""could be levied, it must be clearly shown that the person proceeded against had broken a regulation which the Act gave the Government power to make. Otherwise, I do not think the fine could be levied. This is a weakness in the provision which; apart from questions of policy, justifies its rejection.",41
297,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wentworth) [6.3] - Whils t in sympathy with any relaxation of quarantine, not incompatible with the preservation of the public - health, I regard the amendment as a dangerous innovation. The honourable member for Angas has shown that the Act is not so framed as to make the provisions relating to quarantine-enforceable on those released under the amendment. But, apart from that objection, which should be sufficient to prevent its acceptance, I am of opinion that it is too early Tor us to follow in the footsteps of other countries, where more stringent measures have been taken internally for the eradication of diseases, by making our quarantine law less stringent. In countries, where vaccination is compulsory, thespread of small-pox from a centre of infection cannot be nearly so rapid as it mightbe here, where only a small percentage of the people have been vaccinated, and wherethe climatic conditions and the difficulties-of proper medical surveillance are favourable to its rapid extension. Fortunately, however, we have hitherto' been able to keepit out, and. Australia is, I believe, the only country in the world where small-pox is notendemic. Our circumstances are such-,, however, that it would be extremely dangerous to allow it , or any similar disease,, to gain a footing, and, therefore, I shall! strongly oppose the adoption of the amendment. The Government, instead of being' driven, should show its readiness to do all that is possible for the preservation of the public health. I hope that the Minister will not treat the matter lightly, for it is one which honourable members have deeply at heart, and needs most earnest consideration. If we err at all, we should err on the side of over-precaution.",41

In conversation, medical authorities of good standing. have told me that the inspection which now takes place before a clean bill of health is given to a ship has greatly diminished the' risk of the introduction of diseases. At all events I am satisfies! that no greater danger is to be feared from the acceptance of this amendment than, is likely to arise under clause 14.",42
312,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"South Sydney) [6.11]. - The honourable member for Hindmarsh pointed to a feature of the Bill that is worth considering. I do not anticipate any improper discrimination wil L be of made by the quarantine officers in regard to releasing persons under surveillance, Our experience in Australia is that these officers are men of some responsibility. A quarquarantine officer, being a medical man, . knows that he incurs a very serious respon- . out sibility in releasing persons where there is a real danger of their carrying disease into principle ot the Commonwealth.",42
313,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,If the period of danger has elapsed why should a man be under sur,42
314,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,In many cases it is reasonableto suppose that ' surveillance after quaranwould be necessary.,42

316,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It might not. As. indicated by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, we have not only ,passed a clause that will allow this to be done, but something more. Uncler clause 14 the Governor General, who would act on the suggestion, at ail events, of the quarantine officer, has the power of absolute exemp. tion from aiiy quarantine.",42
317,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On conditions that may be Such' a recommendation would pass through the hands of the Chief Medical Officer and the head of the Department,-whilst the President of the Board of memHealth would also have to endorse it be- on fore it was submitted to the Governor General.",42
318,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does not the' right honourable member recognise that the power given by clause 14 is unlimited?,43
319,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I object to it altogether.,43
320,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But we have passed it. My recollection' is that a similar provision exists in the New South Wales law.,43
321,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has shown me the codified Act - of 1897, which provides for the issue of a 'Governor's licence. During the whole time. I was in office in New South Wales I never issued such a licence, nor do I think that the present Treasurer of the Commonwealth did so when he was Premier of New South Wales.",43
322,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Before the honourable member for Kalgoorlie mentioned that law to me I had an idea that there existed in the New South Wales Act some provision which - would permit of exemptions being granted under certain conditions.,43
323,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It is in an Act of 3 William IV., which was codified. The codified Act brought all these laws together.",43
324,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is a very reasonable power. Members of the medical profession can alone determine the necessity for quarantine:,43
325,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,If anv of the passengers on harbour. an infected ship had to go into quarantine all should be quarantined; if any were allowed to go free all should be given their freedom.,43
326,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"After all, practically all the power that we assume under.this Bill is vested in' the quarantine officers. The person on whose decision rests the question of whether or not a vessel is to be quarantined is the quarantine officer. He might decide that what were regarded by the ship's officer or by some of the general public as suspicious symptoms were not of sufficient gravity to justify the ship being ordered into quarantine, and might allow the ship to go free. If he made an error of judgment, or were not properly seized of the gravity of the situation, serious consequences might follow. The success or failure of the Quarantine Act must rest upon the shoulders of the officers. granted absolute power to the quarantine officers to detain a vessel or to allow her to proceed on her journey, it seems to me rather strange that we should object to give tbem the power of surveillance.",43
327,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Shoul d they have the power of imprisonment?,43
328,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The whole purport of the Bill submits that question to the decision of the quarantine officer. He can order a ship into quarantine or allow her to go free.,43
329,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"He cannot order one-half of a ship into quarantine and allow the other half to go free. ' Mr WATSON - The point is whether we are going to compel an officer to say that either a whole ship.'s company shall go into quarantine, or that nothing shall be done. If that is the only discretion to be vested in the quarantine officer, it may so operate as to defeat the objects of the Bill. If a quarantine officer were in doubt as to the presence of a contagious disease on board ship-and we know that a number of communicable diseases in their initial stages are very difficult to diagnose-h e might allow the vessel to proceed on her way if he had not the power to place under surveillance some of those on board. Unless some power of this description is given to the officers, the object of the Bill may be largely defeated.",43
330,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If a quarantine officer were in doubt, he would, for greater safety, order the suspected ship into quarantine. He would not, in such circumstances, err in the direction of allowing her to go up the",43
331,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If he had no alternative but to order the ship and her company' into quarantine, he might determine in a doubtful case to allow her to proceed on her journey, whereas if this power were vested in him, he would probably order some of the passengers or crew to remain under surveillance.",43
332,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is not quarantine. Quarantine means isolation.,43
333,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have heard of an instance in which it was alleged that an actress who was. able to get the ear of a Minister in New South Wales was allowed to have her dog quarantined in the hotel at which she wasstaying. - I dare say. that is purely apocryphal, but "" quarantine "" is a very elastic term. MrJOSEPH COOK - In Victoria a system of home quarantine has been in operaHaving tion.",43
334,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And I do not say that it is not justified. Our ideas in respect of quarantine in plague cases have expanded very much since the first outbreak in New South Wales. At first a very rigid system was enforced, but it has since been relaxed as being in a very large degree unnecessary.",43
335,Mr WILKS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Then the honourable member believes in quarantine - with discriminamember tion ?,44
336,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The whole system of quarantine is based on discrimination, and cannot be anything else.",44
337,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member period would detain one man because he had been. on board an infected ship, and allow another to go free.",44
338,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The quarantine oflicer middle course. can alone judge whether or not a suspect is in sound health.,44
339,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The policy of the Act that, even if a passenger on an infected remarkable. ship is healthy, he is not to go free until a certain period has elapsed.",44
340,Mr WATSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That depends on the nature of the disease. A certain measure of isolation may be necessary in one case, and much more may be necessary in others. It appears to me that in this instance we must trust the officers. I see no escape from that position. The whole value the Act seems to depend upon the of the officers charged with its administration. That being so, I do not see why we should not give them this power, rather than compel them to take extreme meaopposed sures, whether it might be necessary to so or not.' Mr AUSTIN CHAPM AN (Edenthat Monaro-Minister of Trade and Customs) [6.20] - The leader of the Opposition bases his case against the amendment of clause 45 on the supposition that under it some weeks. a man of importance or influence on board a suspected ship would be allowed to gofree, whilst a man in the steeragewould be detained.",44
341,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,I say that it would be equally as bad if the man in the steerage were allowed to go free and a man of fluence detained ,44
342,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The right honourable member builds up a case which he thinks he can batter down very easily. One cannot help smiling at his constant ference to the steerage passenger. His strongest objection is that the officers the Department are not to be trusted.,44
343,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is only one objection.,44
344,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The right through honourable member keeps harping on the possibility of favouritism. He has gested that of 200 men ordered into quarantine, a quarantine officer might allow one to go free because he was a man of importance.",44

346,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It would rarely, if ever, happen that any man would be given his freedom before the danger had elapsed. If we have degrees of risk, we must also have degrees of power. I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney that we must throw open a",44

351,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Oh come !,44
352,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Surely I am at liberty to believe that the right honourable member would do what I should do. It must be admitted that he has built up his objection to the amendment of clause in45 on the possibility. of favouritism. He said that the provision would be much better if the recommendation for the release of a person on board a suspected ship had to pass through tha hands of the Chief reMedical Officer and the Department of Public Health before being submitted to of the Governor General. As an old politician, the right honourable mamber must know that such recommendations pass the hands of responsible officers. If we cannot trust our officers, our quaransugtine law must fail . The amendment is really a restriction, rather than an extension, of the power conferred by clause 14, under which a man under suspicion may be allowed absolute freedom.",44
353,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Unde r conditions that can be made just as stringent as those proposed to be provided for in this case.,45
354,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Unde r the amendment proposed, he would have to report himself. He would be kept under close surveillance. The right honourable member spoke of 200 passengers being on board a vessel only one of whom might be released under a provision of this kind. Let me put a reasonable case to him - suc h a one as might occur. Let us suppose that upon a large ship there is one saloon passenger who has a portmanteau containing some rags which might be expected to harbour a quarantinable disease. ' If the quarantine officer satisfied himself that there was no ground for entertaining such a belief ought he to quarantine the whole bf the steerage passengers on that ship ? The right honourable member has attempted to build up his case by urging that under the amendment made by the Senate favouritism might be exercised. It is idle to suggest that a Minister would not accept responsibility for the acts of his officers. As a matter of fact, he has to accept that responsibility in every instance.",45
355,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It is rather an unfair responsibility to put upon him.,45
356,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"During the right, honourable member's Ministerial career I have never known him to shelter himself behind, the plea that he was not responsible for the acts of his officers. Although he declared this afternoon that the report of the experts who considered this question contained no recommendation in the direction of the Senate's amendment, when I asked bim whether he would support the proposal if the experts had recommended it he declined to answer.",45

I say .that we'should not rush to extremes in legislation of this k in d ; the adoption of a middle course should always be open to us. Why should we not vest some discretion in our quarantine officers instead of laying down a hard-and-fast rule? If the man of importance can get past these officers he can also get past the Governor General, because the latter acts upon the advice of his Ministers.",45
359,Mr KELLY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Does the Minister suggest that the fact that under the Bill in the form in which it left this Chamber, the Governor General would require to be moved to. secure the release of any person from quarantine is not something in the nature of a check?",45
360,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No . But I do say that in ninetv-nine cases out of a hundred the advice of the officers of the Health Department would be acted upon.,45

If we do not accept the amendment of the Senate we shall probably delay the passing of this measure for two or three months. In view of the declaration of the honourable member for Melbourne who, upon this subject, is a specialist, I think that we mighr very safely agree to the amendment of the Senate.",45
370,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bass) [7.49] - Unfor tunately, I possess some knowledge of infectious diseases and quarantine regulations, and in the light of that knowledge I say that the amendment of the Senate is a very wise one, because it refers the matter of exemption from quarantine to quarantine officers. Surely that is better than allowing it to remain under the control of the Government. We must all recognise that no matter what action a Ministry might take in connection with quarantine arrangements, under our party system of government it would be sure to be questioned by political opponents. think that altogether too much has been made of the suggestion that under the amendment, of the Senate one passenger by a vessel might be liberated from quarantine, whilst 199 others might be detained. We know very well that nowadays the various classes of passengers on board-ship are just as much separated from each other as are the dwellers in adjacent houses in our cities. If. a case of smallpox occurs amongst the first-class passengers on a vessel, why should those in the steerage be quarantined?",46
371,Mr REID,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That ' is a new idea. ' The universal idea is that if a case of infection exists on board, it is a danger to the whole ship.",46
372,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In city life, if an outbreak of infectious disease occurs in one house of a terrace that house alone is isolated, notwithstanding that its inmates come into much closer contact with their neighbours than do the various classes of passengers on board ship. In the case of small-pox, I contend that the greatest' danger lies, not in contact with the sufferer, but in the liability of one's clothing to infection. In Tasmania the first outbreak of this disease was traced to certain clothing whicn 'had been locked up in a box for some considerable time. If the passengers by any vessel upon which an outbreak of small-pox occurred had their clothing thoroughly fumigated there would be comparatively little danger of their spreading infection. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment of the Senate, and that the Bill will speedily become law. Only yesterday, in coming from Launceston, I heard complaints made of the existing quarantine regulations as between State and State, and of the necessity for their early alteration. I hope that'we shall leave this matter of quarantine in the hands of our quarantine officers, and not in those of the Government.",46
373,Mr SAMPSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member wish to destroy all Ministerial responsibility ?,46
374,Mr STORRER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No , but it is not well to provide in a Bill of this character for the exercise of political influence in any shape or form. I recollect one occasion upon which the Mayor of Launceston was unable to visit Melbourne, because he had not been vaccinated, notwithstanding that he had suffered from small-pox, which I understand affords the sufferer greater I immunity from further attack than would vaccination. According to the regulations made by the Victorian authorities, no per-, son could be admitted to the Colony unless he had been vaccinated; and this incident, in my opinion, shows that a certain amount of discretion should be left with the responsible officer.",46
375,Mr FRAZER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Kalgoorlie) [7.55] - I agree with those who declare,-in no uncertain language, that all classes of people should' be treated alike in the administration of the quarantine Jaw.; and I believe that the provisions of this Bill as proposed to be. amended will have that result. It is highly important, however, that some discretionary power should be given to those who will be responsible for the administration; and, as a matter of fact, under State law, there is a discretionary power now in the hands of the quarantine - officer, who is generally a medical man. It appears to me harsh that, because of certain suspicious symptoms, all the people on a ship should be detained, when the safety of the public might be completely guaranteed by keeping the actual case and contacts under observation. That, I think, is the principle on which' the various States Acts have been administered up to the present time. The right .honourable member for East Sydney this afternoon told us that under his administration of the quarantine laws of New .South Wales no exemptions were permitted ; and I unhesitatingly accept his statement that he was not aware of any exemptions. The fact remains, however, that under the New South Wales Act the Governor in Council-which , of course, means the'Government-ma y grant exemptions in regard to persons or goods on any ship. It may be absolutely necessary, on account of suspicious symptoms, that certain people should be detained, but it is a great hardship that others, who show no symptoms whatever, should be confined; in other words, I can conceive of circumstances where it may be desirable or necessary to detain individuals, but not to detain the whole of the passengers.",46

If Ceylon, which is much more exposed to infection than we are, finds that system efficient, I do not think that we run much risk, seeing that our ports are ten days' steaming from India. possibility that quarantine might be relaxed in favour of the Governor General, or some high official, I think-that nowadays the press and our friends in the Labour corner are so vigilant that a responsible official would rather release a steerage passenger.

402,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Darling Downs-Attorney General) [8.25] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. In 1906 Parliament passed the Australian Industries Preservation Act, ofwhich Part II . aimed at the repression of monopolies, while Part III . was designed to prevent dumping. Part II . creates four or five different offences. Its general ob-' ject is to make it an offence lor persons to enter into a combination in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the States, either(a) with intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public; or, (4) With intent to destroy or injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due' regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers. It also makes it an offence for foreign corporations with a like intent to restrain trade or commerce, or with intent to destroy or injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry. It likewise sought to repress monopolies by making it an offence for any person to monopolize or attempt to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce with other countries or amongthe States with intent to control, to the detriment of the public, the supply or price of any service, merchandise, or commodity. Further, it made it an offence for any corporation or trading or financial corporation formed within the Commonwealth to monopolize, or' attempt to monopolize,- or - combine in any of the ways to which I have already referred. The intention of the ' Parliament was that trusts which were injurious should be repressed. It was recognised that trusts and - combines were beginning to - grow in Australia. realized, also, that in other countries, notably the United States, there ""had been formed large trusts and combines that were operating to the detriment of the public, and that the Legislature of those countries had attempted to pass laws to deal with them. Guided by a similar feeling in Australia, we passed this legislation. Honourable members will recollect that the Bil l was attacked at the time as being rather drastic; but, when compared with the United States law, it is found to be in essence much niilder.",49
403,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I should think so.,49
404,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In our case, the "" intent ' ' is the essence of the offence; whereas in the United States of America any combination in restraint of Inter-State trade is an offence. We required something more, and determined that intent should be proved. The Act has-been in operation since 1906', and it has since been our duty to administer it and to apply it to Australian conditions. During the last twelve months more particularly, the existence of a series of combines has been brought under the notice of the Department of the Attorney-General, and, after careful investigation, we have arrived at the conclusion that an amendment of the Act is necessary if we are to cope effectively with those evils. The operations of a ""series of combines have been most carefully investigated. The officers of the Department have made full inquiries, aiid have obtained as much evidence as it is possible to secure in connection with a number of combines that are alleged to exist in Australia. But when one enters a Court of law in a matter of this kind one has to prove that a combine in restraint of trade is in existence. A combine may consist of a limited number of persons who join together for the purpose of accomplishing a certain object. The agreement to combine is absolutely within their own knowledge, but the effect of what tliey do may come home to every individual, in the Commonwealth ",49
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does .the lionorable member, say that it has been found that there are a number of trusts in Australia?",49
406,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Evidenc e has been submitted to us from which we have every reason to believe that there are combines.,49
407,Mr JOSEPH,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,COOK - Then why does not the Department take action?,49
408,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am coming to that point. In all these cases we have in the It was first place to give proof of the agreement. That agreement, as I have said, is within the knowledge of the limited number who form the combine.",49
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Do . I understand that if this amending Bill be passed, the Government intend immediately to avail themselves of it?",49
410,Mr GRTJOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wherever we have good reason to believe that a combine exists to the detriment of the public, the intention is tq use this legislation to meet the evil.",49
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member says that the existence of such combines has been discovered.,49
412,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Our investigations lead us to believe that in order that, we may ""effectively cope with the evil it is necessaiy for us to secure the powers for which this Bill provides.",50
413,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There is no doubt .that combines do exist. . - Mr GROOM - That is so; but in all cases it is absolutely essential to establish proof of their existence.,50
414,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I suppose we may take it that the necessity for these powers did not occur to the Government when the original Bill was under consideration-som e of these powers are obviously necessary.,50
415,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,They are. certainly necessary,50
416,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is surprising that the Government did not think of them before.,50
417,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The precedents that we have for some of the powers fbr which we ask are to be found in the later American Acts.,50
418,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Some of them appear in the Canadian Acts.,50
419,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And in the United States Aet of 1906. The Crown Solicitor, who has investigated a great many' of these matters, in a report on the subject, writesTn this and other propo:ed prosecutions of Trusts and Combinations the difficulty is to obtain evidence even if a special staff is appointed, for the following reasons :(1) The persons who can give the information in most cases, either (a) dare not 'assist for fear of the Trusts; or (4) are benefited by working with the Trusts and will not do so. (2) The Trusts and members of the Trusts or Combinations naturally refuse to give any. information voluntarily, if they have been doing wrong, to assist in a prosecution against themselves ; and there are no means at present available to compel them to do so. (3) The consumers, the public, the persons who sutler most-and the Government representing the consumers, producers, and workers-ca n only get information from those who are to be prosecuted, or those who are at their mercy, either as purchasers from the Trust, workers for the Trust, or sellers of produce to the Trust.",50
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then the ment discovered their inability to take action after trying to enforce the Act?,50
421,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,When we have to grapple with the practical difficulties of administration we ascertain exactly what is necessary. Mr. JOSEPH CoOK --This Bill has grown out of the Government's effort to investigate these matters?,50
422,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Crown Solicitor, after investigating concrete cases put before him, made the report from which I was reading. Upon investigation, we felt it was essential for the . Administration to be equipped with wider powers than we possess under the existing Act. If honourable members look at the nature of the offences in respect of which' prosecutions can be instituted, they will realise that wider powers are necessary. A . secret agreement may be made by six or seven wealthy individuals,"" who keep the memorandum of agreement within their own. possession, and control. Naturally, if we askthem for information in regard to it , they decline to give it , saying, "" It is our own private concern."" That may be so, but their operations may affect the whole Commonwealth. They are exercising their powers to the detriment of the public, and it is because they are doing so that it is necessary for us to take action and to ask for these powers. The powers for which this Bill provides are not unknown to other countries, or even to our' own law. The United States has had to deal with Inter-State corporations. Its' Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, which applies to all common carriers engaged in Inter-State commerce, provides that all charges for transportation must be reasonable, and prohibits pools or combinations in Inter-State traffic. Under section 20, the Inter-State Commission, appointed to secure the enforcement of the Act, is vested with very wide powers. For instance, that section enables the Commission to require all corporations who are common carriers, subject to the Act', to furnish annual reports. These show--(1 ) The amount of capital stock issued, the amounts paid there for, and'the manner of payment: (2) dividends paid, surplus fund, and number of shareholders ; (3) funded and floating debts, and interest paid thereon; (4) cost and va.lue of the carriers' property; (5) number of employees, and salaries paid; (6) amount expended on improvements during the year, - and nature of improvements; (7) earnings Govern- ancl receipts' from each branch of business ancl from all sources; (8) operating and other expenses, balance of profit and loss, and a complete exhibit of the financial operations of the carrier each year. Moreover, these reports must contain such information in relation to rates or regulations concerning fares or freights, or agreements, arrangements, or contracts with other common carriers, as the Commission may require. The Inter-State Commission can also require all common carriers to have a uniform system of accounts, and it is absolutely essential that these powers should be given in respect of corporations having control over the highways of trade and commerce, which are practically the lifeblood of the nation.",50
423,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is a really good free trade sentiment.,51
424,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am afraid that the right honourable member is misapplying the remark. It is necessaiy that those who control the highways of trade and commerce to the detriment of the public should be dealt with, and that the Commission should have power to obtain from them the nature of their transactions, in order that the law may be enforced. If an honest agreement is made, nothing is to be feared, but if a body of men have entered into an agreement to the detriment of the public the people are entitled to know ' it. That is the position that the authorities of the United States of America took up. In 1.906, in the United States, an amending law was passed, giving even more extensive powers of investigation. Under the law of 1906, these reports have to be made on oath, and any failure to file them within the prescribed time, or to make specific answer to any question authorized by the section-that is any question upon which the Commission may need information-is punishable by a fine of $100 per day.",51
425,Mr WH IRVINE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is that penalty not limited to a certain class of questions?,51
426,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It has reference to the subject-matter of the complaint. Mr VV. H. IRVINE - What are American Acts to which the honourable gentleman is referring?,51
427,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Inter-State Commerce Act of 1887, and the Amending Act of 1906. Under the latter Act, the Commission has access at all times to all accounts, records and memoranda to be kept by Inter-State carriers, and it is unlawful for a carrier to keep any other accounts, records or memoranda, than those prescribed or approved by the Commission. The Commission may, furthermore, employ special agents or examiners, who have authority under the order of the Commission to inspect and examine any and all accounts, retions cords, & c , kept by any carried. The of penalty for refusing or failing to keep such accounts, memoranda, &c, as are prescribed by the Commission, or to submit such accounts, to the inspection of the Commission, or any of its authorized agents or examiners, is $500 for each offence, and for every day of the continuance of the offence. Penalties are imposed for false entries. The Inter-State Commission Act deals only with one class of corporation-the class which is engaged in Inter-State commerce - railway s and carriers. But in February, 1903, the United States. Congress passed ah Act to establish a Department of Commerce and Labour. Section 6 of this Act enacted that there should be, in this Department, a bureau to be called 'a Bureau of Corporations, with an officer known as the Commissioner of Corporations at its head - The Commissioner has power to make investigationsinto the organization, conduct, and management of the business of any joint stock company, corporation, or corporate combination, engaged in Inter-State commerce, except common carriers, who are dealt with in the Inter-State Commerce Act. In order to accomplish these purposes, the Commissioner has, with respect to all corporations or combinations engaged in Inter-State commerce, all the powers which are conferred by the Act already alluded to upon the Inter-State Commission. So that in the United States exceedingly large powers have been conferred in regard to this particular matter. Further, the United States Government are rigorously enforcing these laws, and with success. What is the nature of the law that we propose to enact ? . The Bill is a short one, and is confined solely to the question of procedure. It does not purport to amend in any way the principle of the original Act. All that it does is to prothe vide machinery with which it is considered necessary to arm the Executive in order that the law as expressed in the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1906 may be successfully administered. In - the first place, it deals with the onus of proof. In this matter, we simply follow the principle which' has been adopted in our Customs Act. Section 255 of that' Act sets out that when an information has been laid against an individual, the onus of proof is thrown upon him with certain exceptions. We have adopted those exceptions in this Bill, and we ask the House to enact thatIn any prosecution for an offence against sec4, 5, 7, 8, or 9 of this Act the averments the prosecutor contained in the information, declaration, or claim shall be deemed to be proved, in the absence of proof to the contrary, but, so that- ' (a) the averment in the information of intent shall not be deemed sufficient to prove such intent, and, (6) in all proceedings for an indictable offence, the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence. Thus, if we are prosecuting a'combine for having entered into an unlawful agreement, and the nature of that agreement is known only to the combine itself, all that we need to allege in our claim is the making of the agreement. Under such circumstances, the agreement would be held to be proved unless the combine could prove the contrary. Clause 15B empowers the Comptroller-General, if he believes that an offence has been committed against the - Act, to require any person whom he believes to be capable of giving any information relative to the alleged offence, to answer questions, and to produce documents either to him or to some person named by him. It also provides that the duty shall then be thrown upon that person to answer the questions put to him. The Comptroller General, or any person to whom any documents have been produced under this provision, may take copies of or extracts from such documents. The clause also providesNo person shall be excused from answering any 'question or producing any documents when required to do so under this section on the ground that the answer to the question or the production of the document might tend to criminate him; but his answer shall not be admissible in evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceeding other than a proceeding for an offence against this Act. Under the Customs Act, if a person presents an entry, he is bound to answer any questions which may be put to him. The next clause provides for a heavier penalty, and is directed against trading orfinancialcorporations. It readsWhenever a complaint on oath has been made in writing to the Comptroller-General that any person or any foreign corporation or any trading or financial corporation formed with the Commonwealth has been guilty of any offence against this Part of this Act, the Comptroller-General, if lieves the complaint to be well founded, may, by writing, require any such person or foreign corporation or trading or financial corporation or any member, officer, or agent of any such corporation, to produce and hand over to him or t.o some person appointed by him in writing all books and documents relating to the subject matter of the complaint and ""all books and documents of any kind whatsoever wherein any entry or memorandum appears in any way relating to the 'subject-matter of the complaint. That is not an inquisitorial power. Mr w . H . IRVINE - It sounds like one.",51
428,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I would further point out that this power can be exercised only where a complaint has been made on oath in writing to the Comptroller-General that a person has been guilty of an offence against the Act. The Comptroller-General has also to be satisfied that the complaint is well founded. When he is so satisfied, he may go to the individual in question and say- "" I demand the production of your agreement,"" and the individual is bound to produce it, subject to penalties. Under clause 15D of the Bill, the Comptroller-General can obtain possession of these documents and impound them. But to prevent the information thus gained from being disclosed, provision is made that the only persons - to whom it may be revealed are the Attorney-General or persons authorized by him, or the Comptroller General, or the tribunal before whom the case is being tried. I sub-' mit that these provisions are absolutely necessary for. the due enforcement of the law. They are not harsh provisions. The innocent man who is carrying on his business in accordance with the law.of the land has nothing to fear from this Bill. Underlying the whole measure is a recognition of the fact that Parliament has declared that these combines shall not carry on their operations to the detriment of the public. The machinery which it provides is required to protect the interests alike of the producers and consumers. It is necessary that the Executive should be equipped with these powers in order that the law'as declared in the principal Act may be successfully enforced.",52
429,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"East Sydney) [8.51] - I have only just had a copy of the Bill placed in my hands, and upon comparing it with the original Act I find that it is full of difficult questions. I think, therefore, it would be in the interests of the measure itself if the debate were adjourned so that honourable members might lie afforded an he beopportunity of studying its provisions in-the light of the provisions of the principal Act. It is impossible to deal with it in a satisfactory manner at a few moments' notice, and if no other honourable member desires to speak at the present stage upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill, I should like to move the adjournment of the debate.

430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Parramatta) [8.58] - I should like to know what has happened to prevent the carrying out of the intention clearly expressed before we adjourned in regard to the ventilating and sewering of Parliament House. We return to work to find an atmosphere just as oppressive and smellful as before, and the sewering still incomplete. Many of us object most strongly to the atmosphere of the House, and to the sanitary arrangements in particular. It has seemed to us for some time simply disgraceful that the Parliament of the Commonwealth, above, all other institutions, should not have all up-to-date sanitary arrangements, as well as modern methods of' ventilation.",53
431,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We have no control.,53
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If so, there is an end of the matter, but we ought to have the statement officially. told that some remedial measures were to be taken during the recess, but, if we may take it as official that nothing can be done, then, as I say, there is an end of the matter.",53
433,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I only speak because I happen to have been on the House Committee almost since the inauguration of this Parliament, and know that the State Parliament will not agree to the work being done.",53
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But it was distinctly stated that during the recess the sewering was to be carried out, and a new system of ventilation adopted.",53
435,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The State Parliament have not done the work, and there is an end of it.",53
436,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Why ?,53
437,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [9.0] - The position in regard to ventilation is that the scheme is now actually being carried out, and, it is expected, will be completed in two weeks at furthest. But, of course, as a system of ventilation, it can have no effect until it is completed - As the honourable member has said,' the conditions are jiist as we left them when we adjourned, but progress has been made during the adjournment, and the work advanced to the eve of completion. As to the sewerage, the honourable member has probably derived his information by a statement made in the press on behalf of 9 9 0 ; the State Government, that they propose to alter the whole of the arrangements in the building. I believe the plans are prepared and ready, but this is a work which cannot be carried on while either House is sitting, and. as the Senate has been at work, it has not been possible to take advantage of the recent adjournment. It may take weeks, cr, perhaps, months, to complete the sewerage, seeing that the work involves the penetration of these massive walls. It is, however, the intention of the State Government to carry out the sewerage work on the first occasion on which both Houses are long enough in recess.",53
438,Mr TOSEPFI COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Parramatta; [ 9 . 2 ] - If a day should ever come, I suppose, when both Houses are not sitting ! The statement of the Prime Minister is satisfactory as .far as it goes, but it seems as if we may give up all hope of ever breathing a pure atmosphere here, or having the ordinary, cleanly, sanitary, arrangements common to almost every household. We' were If we have to wait until both Houses, are absolutely in recess, our prospects seem hopeless, for, apparently, we have turned on. perpetual motion, though whether that is good for the Commonwealth or not I do not stay to inquire. I advise the Prime Minister - to consider very seriously whether romething cannot be done, even though Parliament is sitting continuously, to make this House what it ought to be- a reasonably healthv place .in which to transact the country's business.

Am I to understand that the wages of this man have been cut down ?",53
439,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That payment is for only part of the year. .,53
440,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Anyhow , there seems to me to be an invidious distinction made in the wages. No doubt this person is quite as capable as others who receive more money for lighter work, but owing to circumstances over which he has ho control he is compelled to take the lower-paid position. There seems to me to be too great a disparity in the wages paid, and I ask whether something cannot be done to remove what appears to me an invidious distinction.",53
441,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"This cleaner is on his probation. Mr. JOSEPH COOK [9.4] - This seems an appropriate time, in considering the item of contingencies in connection with Parliament House, to raise a question which I think should have been raised long ago. I should like to know, first of all, whether any provision has been made on the Estimates for meeting the expenses of the Echuca re-election?",54
442,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That matter was before me this morning, and will be provided for in the Additional Estimates.",54
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I raise the question because I find an amount was paid some time ago to Sir Malcolm MCEacharn and Mr Blackwood in connection with some other elections.,54
444,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"This does not come under the division of Parliament, but of Home Affairs.",54
445,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The money was provided under the heading of "" House of Representatives,"" and why it should appear there I do not know. I invite, the Treasurer to make a statement as to what is proposed to be done in regard to the Echuca election. It has been a custom in both the States Parliaments and the Commonwealth Parliament, so far, to pay the expenses of any re-election caused by reason of any fault on the part of the Government.",54
446,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I take it that the honourable member is referring to what was done on a previous occasion.,54
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I quite recognise that the item should have appeared under the heading of the Department of Home Affairs, but I think it appropriate to raise the question now. ment, in my opinion, should have paid the money long ago; and they might well have made provision for it in the various Supply Bills which have been passed.",54
448,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There are no new items introduced into Supplv Bills.,54
449,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I am surprised to find .that no provision is made in the Estimates in Chief. [3^7],54
450,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I must point out to the honourable member that the item of "" Contingencies"" on which he has raised this question deals solely with the telephone service. I think it would be much better to deal with the matter of the Echuca election when it is introduced in due course.",54
451,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"My trouble is that there is no item in the Estimates. (Parramatta) Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [9.7] - The matter to which the honourable, member for Parramatta refers is one that was not ripe for settlement when these Estimates were prepared a considerable time ago. It was only today that I received the full information, not only in reference to the Echuca election, but also the South Australian Senate election; and a point has arisen, which I shall have to consider with the Prime Minister and my colleagues, as to how far the Government should accept responsibility for legal expenses. This is rather a difficult matter, as to pay the legal expenses might set a dangerous precedent. However, the question will be placed before the. Cabinet at the earliest possible date.",54
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I take it there is no doubt in the honourable gentleman's mind as to the obligation of the Government to pay the ordinary costs of the elections?,54
453,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have no doubt about that at all. Proposed vote agreed to.. Division 9 (Parliament Gardens), Â£ 4 8 2 .",54
454,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Dalley) [9.10] - It is usual for honourable members to move reductions in the votes, but in this case I suggest there should be an increase. These gardens, as Â« the Prime Minister, who is a lover of the beautiful, will acknowledge, are an adorn ment to Parliament House, but I wish to point out that there is not a sufficiently large staff to keep them in proper order. - We have only one foreman gardener and two assistants, and any one who has any knowledge.of gardens will recognise thai such extensive grounds as we have here cannot be properly looked after by so few .men. The foreman gardener and his assistThe Govern- ants are very hard-worked, and certainly some consideration should be given to this matter. The service is not one which can command political influence. We ought not only to see that these buildings are kept in good repair, but also that the surroundings are kept in good order. The gardens are so beautiful that I am sorry that the public has not an opportunity to take pleasure in thefn. If the surrounding railings were removed, they would be one of the beauty spots of ""Melbourne. But, at present, probably few persons know how beautiful they are. In the past, they have occasionally been used by certain honourable members for private functions, and, therefore, there should be no objection to the citizens of the Commonwealth using them. My experience is that the general public values these opportunities for enjoyment"" and that no vandalism is to be feared. I do not believe in keeping the precincts of Parliament as private as the surroundings of an oriental palace. At any rate, the gardening staff is undermanned, and I hope that the Treasurer will see that further assistance is provided.",54
455,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Wide Bay) [9.12] - I agree with what' the honourable member for Dalley has said about the work done by the gardening staff. But I would remind him that they are State officers, and, moreover, that we, as mere tenants-at-will of the State Government, have not the right to remove the surrounding fences.",55
456,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Of course, the State authorities would have to be approached ",55
457,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I think the suggestion that the State authorities should be approached by the House Committee a good one. I have seen, in Canada, parliamentary gardens, much larger ""than ours, to which the public had free access, and honourable members were not spied on, nor did any outrageous conduct take place there. This reform was advocated by the honourable member for Melbourne twenty years ago. The honourable member for Dalley ' ' will be pleased to know that the fences surrounding a number of the Melbourne parks and gardens have been removed.",55

466,Mr WILKS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Prime Minister,, has been besieged with questions regarding his immigration policy, but, apart from the general statement a few months back, that he intended to place a large sum on the Estimates, he has told us nothing. If we determine to try to attract emigrants to Australia, we shall have to outvie Canada. If we wish to turn the flood of emigration this way, we must not be content to spend a few thousands per annum.",55
467,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No r must we let immigrants trickle back, as Canada is doing.",55

We have not the that Canada has to contend with, and large areas in Australia are more easily to held'.than in Canada. That is really the an reason why we have not a larger population. Our temperate climate makes it easy to hold enormous areas of - fertile land. Men have acquired large areas owing to in what was at the outset a very necessary policy, and consequently our fertile lands been alienated.

488,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And it would be no bar to the people coming here if it were known that what is better than gold-the permanent wealth of the country, of which the people can never be dispossessed as long as the land is properly cultivated-is available. No proposition for encouraging immigration will have mv support unless it is accompanied by some practical proposal to settle the people on the land. We do not desire to turn them out on the land as we turn out a horse in one of our lanes in times of drought. We want it to be understood that men having proper credentials will receive financial assistance in settling on the land. What purpose will be served by establishing in London an institution to send men to Australia if , when they come here, they will have to indulge in what is little better than a gamble for a block of land ? It is idle to talk about the necessity oÂ£ encouraging immigration' as long as we fail to make room on the land for men when they come here, and room in the secondary industries that will then spring up.",58
489,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Robertson) [9.38] - I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister will take steps to provide for the establishment of a properly organized I mmigration Department working throughout Great Britain. If lecturers travelled United Kingdom, and the necessary funds were provided, we should have no difficulty in obtaining suitable immigrants. We should be able to obtain men like those who have built up Australia and made her what she is. Men of the eminence of the late William Bede Dalley and Sir Henry Parkes f e l t it an honour to lecture in the United Kingdom and make known the openings for enterprising immigrants to Australia. If we provide funds by which worthy men, ready to do what the people of England have always done in connection with our colonization schemes, may leave Great Britain for Australia, we shall have no difficulty in obtaining them. The few. men selected by Mr Coghlan and sent out to New South Wales find employment as soon .as they reach their destination. Nevertheless, unemployed are still to be found in Sydney. There is a backwash in every - community, and improvident men are even to be found amongst our immigrants. If we are going to nurse our immigrants and bottle-feed them, we shall not have a hardy population as worthy successors to who made Australia what she is. There are to be found in the Old Country tens of thousands of men of the stamp of our fathers, who do not require to be brought up on the State feeding-bottle. To talk about bringing men here only upon condition that we can supply them with land, and with money to stock it , is perfectly ridiculous. By acting in that fashion we should be merely courtinc failure. If a father started a youth out in the world with a large banking account, the probability is that the youth would return to his home, having wasted his substance in riotous living. So it would be with the immigrant. If we wish to attract immigrants, let us give them a reasonable opportunity of acquiring land upon their arrival. In New South Wales and Victoria schemes are being elaborated at the present time under which they will be able to obtain land. But those States do not intend to give immigrants the land. There are enough men here who are tumbling over each other in their efforts to obtain more land than they already possess. Those who croak about the lack of opportunity which presents itself in this connection are the real land-grabbers ot Australia. Labour bureaux should be established in our midst, through whose agency immigrants would be able to obtain employment ",58
490,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There are hundreds of the men in Australia today who cannot obtain employment. What would the honourable member do with them?,58
491,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I would afford equal opportunities to all men. There is too much disposition to lock up Australia, so that those who are here may continue to be land-grabbers. Those who. seek to lock up out lands in the interests of the labourer who is already here are merely pandering to his acquisitiveness. The honourable member for Barrier thinks only of those who are already here, not of those who are willing to come, here and contribute to our national wealth.",58

Without posing as an alarmist, I think that head we have reached a very important stage in our history- a stage almost of stagnation to so far as an increase of our population is",59
502,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Why , - Victoria gained take 20,coo persons during last year.",59
503,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What'is an addition of 20,000 in a continent which is almost large as the United States? There is no reason to suppose that Australia is not capable of carrying a population equal to that of the United States. But if we are going to increase our population at our present snail's pace, this country, instead of a portion of the 'British Empire, it will, in a few years, be handed over to the teeming millions of Asia. VVe have now reached a stage when it is incumbent upon us to consider .our position, and to reflect. whether we ought not to submit to personal sacrifices, rather than allow ourselves to drift into a state of ineptitude, which will permit of Eastern nations robbing us of our heritage. I .recognise that a policy of inviting here large numbers of immigrants, without being able to at once afford them employment, is one that may be open to the charge of inhumanity. The question,, however, ' is whether there is any greater duty on the ' Commonwealth or States Governments to find employment for every immigrant than there is to find employment for everybody now within the Commonwealth. If we have to wait until we can provide work for every immigrant we shall not make much advance in population. I believe that the insular policy adopted by the Labour Party, no doubt conscientiously, of discouraging immigration",59
504,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,How ?,60
505,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Every time the ques-. tion is raised, the Labour. Party immediately urge the necessity of first employing the people already here.",60
506,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And quite right, too! . Mr SAMPSON - I admit that that is perfectly consistent with the policy of Socialism enunciated as the main plank of the Labour Party-the policy that it is the duty of the State to find employment for every individual. Consistently that policy, the Labour Party hold that employment must be found for all here before we invite more people to come to this country. The Prime Minister has a difficult task to fulfil in enunciating a vigorous policy of immigration without the opening up of avenues of employment. I believe, however, that if the Commonwealth Parliament shows that it really desires to carry out a broad policy of immigration, encouragement will be given to the States Governments to initiate large public works.",60
507,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The question is, who is to take the initiative?",60
508,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The Commonwealth Government should show the States Governments that they are ready to supply the necessary labour if these public works are initiated.,60
509,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The Prime Minister demonstrated that two or three years ago, but nothing has been done.",60
510,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am not sure that, under the Constitution, it would be possible for the Commonwealth Parliament to take control of the large inland rivers of Australia.",60
511,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"And the large estates, too.",60
512,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That , of course, means a land tax, which the Labour Party so ardently desire. The experience in Victoria so far has heen that a land tax does not succeed in cutting up large estates for the benefit of people with limited capital.",60
513,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The honourable member does not mean to say that there is a land tax in Victoria.,60
514,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I mean to say that' the imposition of a land tax will merely mean the purchase of the large estates, when cut up, by the present small holders of land, and not by those of more limited means. With proper negotiation between the Federal and the States authorities, I think it might be possible to initiate an important scheme of locking the Murray, the Murrumbidgee, and the Darling. The water which now runs to waste would thus be conserved, and the dry, arid, but rich country on the banks of those rivers would give room for hundreds of thousands of people. I believe that under present circumstances the States Governments are not sure that the labour would be available if they decided to enter' upon any such large public works. As a matter of fact, along the rivers I have mentioned there is land sufficient to satisf y the aspirations of a with stream of immigration equal to that which has been flowing into Canada.",60
515,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The first thing would be to settle the question of the States' rights to the waters of the rivers. ' Mr SAMPSON - The Commonwealth has navigable power over the rivers, and, therefore, it seems to me that there is ample power to lock the streams for navigation, purposes.",60
516,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,And to divert the water ?,60
517,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The locking of the rivers would be subject to the reasonable use of. the water by the States for irrigation purposes; and the locking, while facilitating navigation, - would also conserve the water for irrigation. According to the estimates of the various States'"" engineers, there ate 50,000,000 acres along the watercourses I have named that could be irrigated, and thus made quite capable, I believe, of supporting a population of 25,000,000 of people on the basis of the Egyptian Nile and Mildura settlements. That may appear a rosy picture, but we must remember that France, a comparatively small country, supports from 18,000,000 to 20,000,000 of people on the soil. If the Federal Parliament should undertake the locking of these rivers, we shall find a solution of the land question in its 1 elation to immigration. Considering that we have reached the stage when the States Governments have not fallen in with the proposal or invitation of the Prime Minister to throw their-land open for immigration settlement, it is our duty to use other means; and I should be very glad to support the .Government in any proposal to lock the streams.",60
518,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is a matter which also depends on the co-operation of the States and the Commonwealth.,61
519,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the Commonwealth Parliament were to undertake the locking of the rivers for navigation purposes, I am ' sure that the electors of New South Wales and Victoria would not permit the States' Parliaments to be recreant to their duty in connection with making land available for irrigation purposes.",61
520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,The question whether the land to be irrigated is private or State land.,61
521,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The great bulk of it is private land, but it is of that class which could now be purchased at a moderate rate. Land, which with the water on it would be worth, perhaps, as much as Â£ 1 0 0 an acre, could now be purchased for Â£ 3 or Â£ 5 an acre.",61
522,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The member's suggestion is a good one, and its only defect seems to be that some sevenor eight years must be required to get it under weigh.",61
523,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"But we must make a start. We have no control over the lands; but I believe that, if the Commonwealth Government were to initiate a vigorous policy of immigration, we should give a great impetus, not only to State, but to private enterprise.",61
524,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"What does the honourable member mean by "" a vigorous policy""? """,61
525,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I was referring more particularly to the policy of re-purchasing land by the States.,61
526,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,We can impose a good land tax.,61
527,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I know that the Labour Party regard a land tax as the panacea for all evils; but, as I said.before, such a tax will not have the effect that the Labour Party expect. A land tax .will have the effect if high enough",61
528,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Order !,61
529,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Le t us hear what a land tax, if high enough, would do.",61
530,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I recognise that land settlement is inextricably mixed up with the question of immigration, but, after all, the production from the soil is only a portion of the wealth of the nation. A large number of immigrants may come here, ""but only a portion of them will find their place on the soil, many having to d r if t into other walks of life, possibly some into the great iron industry.",61
531,Mr CARR,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,But those others will find employment in consequence of the occupation of the land.,61
532,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Of course, I know that it all means increasing the local market, but what I say is that there are inexhaustible spheres of labour beyond that on the soil. The land settlement policy can be solved in only one way, and that is by is the re-purchase of the land by the States. If there be a land tax there must be an exemption, just on the same principle that the Labour Party believes in a minimum wage. We may be absolutely certain that the' Labour organizations in formulating their policy would insist",61
533,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Is the honourable member going to connect his remarks with the question of immigration ?,61
534,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I was going to point honourable out that, just as there is a minimum wage, there must be an exemption in the case of a land tax. The result would be that small men would not buy up and settle on the large estates, but that they would f all into the hands of existing holders in a substantial form. I again emphasize the need for the appointment of a High Commissioner, and for a vigorous scheme of immigration. Mr KING. O'MALLEY (Darwin) [ 1 0 . n ] - If the speeches of . those' who have preceded me were not comical, they would be tragical. It has been extraordinary to hear the representatives of wealth and property express the desire that our population may increase at an enormous rate of speed. They know that the larger the population the more there will be for the various places fo be filled, and that when there are fifty men waiting for one' job, down will come MCGinty's When men who will not vote for a land tax and the bursting up of large estates talk about the need for immigration, their desire is to have working men fighting for jobs like dogs for a bone. But, in the midst of our Christian civilization,. people are starving, and the farms one hears most of in Australia are baby farms. I am surprised to hear the honourable member for Robertsoni speaking about Socialism. If individualism makes people starve, Socialism will at least bury them decently.",61
535,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Is Socialism dead? Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is time that the tommy-tinpot-double-dyed-distilled rot which we have heard about Socialism was buried. Notwithstanding all that we have heard about that and other ""isms,"" I see no difference between honourable members opposite and ourselves. We should not bring immigrants to this country until we are able to take them by the hand, as they do in Montreal and Quebec, and say, "" We have farms ready for you.""",62
536,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Not half of those who go to Canada are able to take up farms. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then they are brought out under false pretences. Last year 1,050,000 persons emigrated to the United States of America. I remember when agents used to meet immigrants at Castle Gardens, Philadelphia, and Boston, and convey them by immigrant trains to the west, where they were placed upon 160-acre holdings, with homestead, preemption., or timber right land tenures. Let us do something like that in Australia. If the States will not impose taxation to make land available, and the electors of the Commonwealth do not show themselves sufficiently intelligent to give the Labour Party the. necessary .numbers, the only thing to do is to alter the Constitution, so that the Commonwealth can buy land, and resell it to immigrants ",62
537,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"An alteration of the Constitution would not be necessary for that. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then I am for doing it. It is about time that we began to work on honest and just lines. We are all interested in building up the population of Australia, by settling the country with a progressive and robust race. The East is watching us. I was pleased when the Prime Minister invited the great American Fleet to visit Australian waters. 13 'Â«] wages - Mr MCWILLIAMS - We have been nearer to fighting the Yank than to fighting the Jap. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have no need to fight Japs, or Chinese, or any other people; but I believe that if we were in trouble it would be imperative upon the great American nation to see that the Pacific was kept clear for commerce.",62
538,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The United States cf America have not helped Canada much. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The 85,000,000 comprising the population of the United States of America could, if they choose, annex Canada before breakfast. The Monroe' doctrine protects Canada from the interference of foreign powers. Coming now to the proposed erection of Commonwealth offices in London",62
539,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member was the first to suggest the idea, and those who laughed at it are now pushing it' forward as their own. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am glad to get credit for it, and they are wise in their generation. As for the appointment of a High Commissioner, a good man has to be chosen, or none at all. We have a few amongst us who would do splendidlv im the position. The right honourable member for East Sydney would make a good! man.",62
540,Mr THOMAS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Surely the honourable member will say a word for those of his own party. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member for South Sydney is another good man, and there are others. . But I am not going into that question, beyond saying that, unless an extraordinarily clever, smart, up-to-date man is chosen, it will be useless to make the appointment.  member? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am not looking for the job; I am getting too old. I want to be Treasurer of this country, and I shall be. Then Australia will have a banking system which will help the poor man. But the Â£4,400 put down for"" the erection of Commonwealth buildings in London is altogether too small an amount. What could one .do in London with a sum like that?

I am one of those who think that there is a great deal of nonsense, and sometimes a good deal of insincerity, associated with the talk that we hear on the question of immigration. Up to the present, I have been unable to see how the Commonwealth could possibly establish any system of im-' migration unless, as some honourable member has said, it simply landed the people nn the wharfs and left them there, to shift for themselves. That would be undesirable, and it seems to me that iri speaking of immigration we are talking about something that we are not prepared at present to undertake.

It is time Mr MCWILLIAMS - On l y 25 per cent, of the lands of New. South Wales Instead have been alienated; 47 per cent, of the lands of Victoria; and 4 per cent, of the lands of Queensland. In South Australia, a little over 3 per cent, has been alienated; whilst in the Northern Territory, only .14 per cent, has been alienated from the Crown.  ber like a friend of his who had just arrived from England to take up a farm in the Northern Territory ?",63

552,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"In Tasmania, only 32 per cent, of the land has been alienated from the Crown.  the Government of Tasmania a 640-acre block? The Mr MCWILLIAMS - No ; because the Government of that State will not sell to one individual a block of more than 240 acres of first-class land. The honourable member for Macquarie has said that the unalienated land of the States is not available because it has been leased. The whole of the land leased here is, however, subject to resumption. The land policy of Queensland is distinctly liberal. There a man may take up 240 acres of first-class land, which becomes his own after he has resided on it for five years, and paid during that time an annual rental of is. per acre. ",63
553,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Then the land laws of Queensland are even more liberal than I thought.,64
554,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If I were to allow the honourable member to go into details regarding the land laws of each of the States there would be no finality to this debate. The honourable member may refer incidentally to them, but must not discuss them in detail.",64

556,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does the honourable member say that, although only 4 per cent, of the land of that State has been alienated, the pick of the country has been taken up? ",64
557,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,When only half the land now taken up had been alienated it was even more difficult to obtain a selection.,64
558,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Then I am forced to the conclusion that there is more truth in what honourable members have said on this subject than I thought. If their statebeen ments are correct, it is idle to talk about attracting to our shores hundreds of thousands of people to be settled on the land. The figures as to the lands leased by the Crown are as follow :-Ne w South Wales, 62 per cent.; Victoria, 29 per cent.; Queensland, 57 per cent.; South Australia, 37 per cent. ; and Tasmania, 24 per cent.",64
559,Mr SALMON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If there is so much land available for settlement in Queensland, why is the State Government buying up estates?  party on it.",64
560,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I am afraid that the "" stinking fish "" cry comes rather from those who declare that, although in some of the States practically no land has been alienated, there is really no land available for settlement. Either the unalienated land in these States is of such a quality that it offers no inducement to the people to settle upon it, or it has been so mismanaged by the authorities that the cry that there is ho suitable land available is all moonshine. I [318]- 2 differ from the majority who say that it is essential that a High Commissioner should be appointed. Up to the present nothing has been put before the Committee to show what duties the High Commissioner could actually perform. Some say it is necessary for the Commonwealth to have a High Commissioner to act as an immigration agent, but, in the next breath, they tell us that it is impossible for the Commonwealth to establish a system of immigration. I believe that it is. Then we are told that it is necessary to have in London a High Commissioner to refute - the slanders on Australia that are published from time to time in the press of England. I think that articles published in the English press decrying or belauding Australia have no more effect upon the Commonwealth than have the articles which appear from time to time ,in our own newspapers. I believe that for the next five or ten years the duties of a High Commissioner would be practically those of a showman, who would merely represent the Commonwealth, at various functions in London. Certainly his services would be of no practical value to Australia until the States debts had been taken over by the Commonwealth.",64
561,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Does not the honourable member think that it is time those debts were taken over ?,64
562,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"They should have taken over long ago, and I believe that they would have been had the right honourable member for Swan been permitted to carry out his scheme. I come now to one of the most important questions with which we shall have to deal during the current session-the administration of Papua. I hold that the Commonwealth, in taking over that territory, has incurred an enormous responsibility, and one which has not yet been adequately recognised. We have taken over the control of practically half-amillion natives there, and I say that our system of indenting them has been a standing disgrace to the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, 25 per cent.' of the natives employed as carriers by white miners at the miserable wage of ios. per month were dying annually., and the Commonwealth has closed its eyes to the fact. I am very glad to learn that there has been a decided diminution in the mortality rate amongst this class.  aboriginal natives of Tasmania?",64

564,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"That is no reason, why the miners should employ these natives of Papua at ios. a month. In addition, former have instituted a system of fines,.so that in some cases the natives receive little in return for their labour. Thus who have made such a fuss about the ployment of cheap labour on the Rand, have been permitting the employment of natives of Papua under the most disgrace-, f u l conditions.  to take the. matter up, because no other party will do so.",65
565,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If the sugarOpposition, planters had been employing these natives, the matter would have been taken up long ago. It is merely because they are ployed by the miners  to retract certain statements in reference the miners of Newcastle, so the honourable member had better not make any statements which he may have to recall.",65

Therefore, while - I am always to observe any arrangement that has been come to, I think the Minister might give way on the present occasion. The honourable member for Barrier informed me be that the Prime Minister had consented to when a certain point in the Estithe mates had been reached. I do not - claim - any right in my position to be consulted in matters of that kind; but when I make an appeal for others I expect my remarks to resome consideration. In view of the arto rangement arrived at, I suppose it is useless for me to protest. I should like, hoAvever, to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin-remark s which I do not think will prove gratifying to that gentleman when he reads them in Hansard to-morroAV. There may have been a high - mortality amongst carriers in the mining that fields. of Papua, biit it is absolutely Avrong to charge that mortality to the act anxious that of any of the miners.",66

584,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable member for Franklin said that those miners, if in Australia, would be vigorous supporters of a White Australia and opponents of black labour. The inference from those remarks is that these miners are not only misleading, but misusing the native carriers and causing their death's.",67
585,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That is entirely the honourable member's own assumption.,67
586,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,All I understood the honourable member to say was that investigation was required.,67
587,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Thos e miners very properly would be against, black labour in Australia, but is it contended, therefore, that they should ""not employ native labour in Fapua?",67
588,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"At ios. a month, and all the wages are retained in .the shape of fines !",67
589,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"If there be such conduct it might form the basis of a charge against the Administration, but not against the miners. It may, of course, be a reflection on the miners as sweaters; but the natives of Papua are under the particular care of the Governor or Administrator, and it. is the duty-of him and his officers to see that they are properly protected in every way:",67
590,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The honourable mem-, ber. for Franklin said that the percentage of deaths was higher than in any slavery he had ever' heard of.",67
591,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"The deaths were 26 per cent, in one year.",67
592,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,That surely needs some inquiry.,67
593,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It has been inquired into and accounted for.,67
594,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I admit the mortality has been high; but I cannot admit that the deaths have been proved to lie at the door of the white miners, who have suffered greater hardships on the gold-fields than have any of the natives. They have taken their lives ih their, hands, and pioneered the country, with the courage and. ability which always distinguishes men of their class.",67
595,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Does the honourable member advocate a system whereby men are paid Â£ 3 a year, and fined for certain offences, the fines being deducted from tlieir wages at the end of the vear?",67
596,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No ; that is a wrong and mischievous system, which should not continue. But that is not the charge which the honourable member, brought, against the - white miners.",67
597,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It is one of them.,67

599,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"No . I pointed out that the death-rate was high, and that Parliament, although attention was drawn to the matter on a former occasion, had done nothing to reduce it.",67
600,Mr FISHER,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,It would have beer* better had the honourable member taken some serious action in the matter two years ago. When a member of Parliament thinks that manslaughter is the result of want of proper legislation he fails in his duty if he does not make a direct attack on the Government.,67
