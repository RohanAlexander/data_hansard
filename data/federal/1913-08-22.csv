1,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Flinders-Attor ney-General) [10.31 a.m.]-An attack of a more or less personal character was made on me yesterday by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. I should have left it unanswered had it been directed merely against my personal honour, but I understand that it was not; that the honourable member expressly disclaimed his intention of making an attack of that kind. The attack was made because, in his opinion, the acceptance of the directorship of a bank and the continuance of one of the general retainers which I hold create a conflict between my interest and my duty. I say, at the outset, that that opinion, if held by honourable members generally, would not be permitted by me to be used as a weapon against the Government. Should the House adopt the views at the basis of the honourable member's argument, I should immediately take steps to relieve my colleagues of any embarrassment that might thereby be caused to them. The subject is, therefore, of sufficient importance to warrant me in claiming the indulgence of the House for a few minutes, while I - deal with what seem to be the principles underlying the facts on which the attack was made.",12
2,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I think that this is going beyond a personal explanation. Attorney-General is proceeding to argue the question.,13
3,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Pu t on the gag, - course!",13
4,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"If the House - does not desire to hear me now, I shall take another opportunity to speak on the subject.",13
5,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I , for one, desire to hear what the honourable member wishes to say.",13
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is it the wish of honourable members that the Attorney-General be allowed to make a statement? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear !",13
7,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,I propose to make use of argument,13
8,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Will a reply be allowed?,13
9,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I have no objection to any reply being made. It is right that my remarks should be replied to, if honourable members wish to reply to them.",13
10,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Do we understand that we are to have a general debate ?,13
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That cannot be permitted.,13
12,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I shall proceed with my statoment, and, if I go beyond what is legitimate to a personal explanation, I am sure you, Mr Speaker, will .stop me.",13
13,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"On the motion for the adjournment, the honourable member will bave absolute freedom to say what he likes. Of course, I am not opposed to the making of a statement now.",13
14,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"As the honourable member will have perfect freedom to say what he likes on the motion for the adjournment, why should he not be permitted to say it now?",13
15,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Other s could reply to him on the adjournment.,13
16,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie raised a question which I consider of great importance, and the assenting cheers with which his statements were received by members supporting him cannot be regarded as dictated by purely party motives. This is not a matter affecting merely a section of the .House, and some definite understanding should be arrived at in regard to it. Replying first to the charge that I did not return one of the general retainers that I hold-that from the Marconi Company- I ask honourable members to consider what a retainer is. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie seems to think that the holding of a general retainer involves The a confidential relationship between the giver of the retainer and the counsel who is retained. Nothing is further from of the - truth. A general retainer does not entitle the person who gives it to consider the barrister as in any way bound to tender advice or to accept a brief from him. The barrister so retained may at any time, if there should be any reason whatever, public or private, which would embarrass him in accepting a brief from one who has given him a general retainer, decline it . It is a common thing, and it has happened more than once in my experience, for a barrister to hold general retainers from individuals or companies who are engaged in litigation between themselves. That position is often inevitable. The fact that the giver of the first general retainer has the prior right to claim a barrister's services if he is in a position to give them does not require the barrister to hand back the general retainer to the other party in the case by whom he has been retained, because that party may desire to retain his services in other litigation. A highly confidential relationship is established in another way. As soon as counsel is called into consultation with a client, whether on a retainer or a special retainer or without retainer, there is a relationship established of the highest degree of trust and confidence that can exist among men. The honourable member spoke of the code of honour among lawyers. Let me say that no profession, and no occupation demands from those who would be successful in it a higher standard of personal honour than is demanded of barristers. From the moment that he commences practice, the barrister learns-if he did not learn i the would not get very far-that he must keep absolutely good faith with the Bench, and with his clients, and the important information and secrets which come to his knowledge in the course of his practice he learns to separate entirely from the knowledge of which he may make use.",13
17,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"There may be an unconscious lapse occasionally. Mr W. I i . IRVINE - I do not know what the honourable member wishes to insinuate, nor do I care; but I resent strongly, on behalf of the profession to which I belong, the suggestion that it has not as high a standard of personal honour as that of any other body of men in the community.",13
18,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,No one denies that.,14
19,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Mr Asquith cognised the high code of honour that generally prevails. Mr W . H . IRVINE - An it , too, in the quotation read by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The barrister who holds a general retainer has not the righ t to give it up unless for a good reason, but when any man takes office as a Minister of the Crown he must at once place himself in a position in which his duty and his interest cannot conflict. That is generally admitted. In accepting the position of Attorney General I felt it my duty to make a complete and absolute severance of my relations with the Marconi Company in its litigation with the Commonwealth.",14
20,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Surely the honourable member would do that. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Of course, and I have done it . Not only did I do that, but in every kind of litigation in which I was engaged in which there was any possibility of conflict with the Commonwealth I severed my connection absolutely. might give instances, but I do not propose to do so. Reference was made to the Marconi case in Great Britain . That is a case in which two Ministers of the Crown had become shareholders in a company",14
21,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. Whilst I am anxious that the honourable member should have every latitude, I submit that he is going beyond the limits of a personal explanation in dealing with the Marconi Company.",14
22,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would point out that when the Attorney-General first rose I understood that he was about to make a personal explanation, but when he in timated that his remarks would probably go somewhat further than a personal explanation, I took the precaution to ask whether it was the pleasure of the House that he be given leave to make a statement - That leave was granted.",14
23,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Leave to make a personal explanation.,14
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"No ; as I have just pointed out, leave to make a statement. The honourable member should have objected when leave was sought. Leave to make a statement was granted to the Attorney-General without any objection, and he is therefore in order.",14
25,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. The Attorney-General did not receive the unanimous assent of the House has re- Mr SPEAKER - Order . Mr H IG G S - To enter upon a debate. I was quite willing that he should make d I recognise a personal explanation,14
26,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order .,14
27,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am raising a point of order. Do you decline, sir, to hear me? If so, I will sit down.",14
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is not raising a new point of order, but is arguing the point already decided. Leave was granted to the Attorney-General to make a statement, and in pursuance of the leave so granted he is making a statement to the House. No dissent was raised when leave was granted. H ad there been one voice raised in dissent at the time, the desired leave could not have been granted.",14
29,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"There were objections. However, the Attorney-General has in vited a motion, and he now wants to be out of the trouble he has got into.",14
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order . Mr W . H . IRVINE - The facts of the I Marconi case in Great Britain are that two Ministers of the Crown, during the currency, I think, of negotiations between the British Government and the Marconi Company for a large concession or contract, had become shareholders, not in the English company, but in another company, whose fortunes would be necessarily largely affected by the fortunes of the English company.",14
31,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The American company had a dominating interest in the English company. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I think that is so. The question was as to whether the American company's shares must necessarily have been affected by a successful contract made by the English company with the British Government. I do not wish, however, to enter into that point. Whilst the negotiations were pending, these two British Ministers had taken up shares in a company closely allied, at all events, with the British Company which was obtaining a large contract from the Imperial Government. The most serious part of the charge, however, was not that fact, but that these Ministers when the contract was brought before Parliament had not given the Legislature a full knowledge of the exact which they stood. It was on that ground, ultimately, that, whilst the two Ministers in question were acquitted of all wrong-doing in continuing to be members of the Cabinet whilst they held shares which gave them a direct personal interest in the contract, the opinion was expressed that they were guilty of indiscretion in going on as they had done and failing to take Parliament into their confidence. The other ground of the attack made upon me is that I am a director of a banking institution.",14
32,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Before the honourable member leaves the point as to the Marconi Company, will he answer the position I raised as to what would happen in the event of his colleagues presenting to the Cabinet a proposition for a compromise. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am glad that the honourable member has reminded me of that point. He said that there might be a proposal for a compromise. I replied that I did not know whether there was or was not because the whole matter had been handed over by me, as I had pointed out previously, to the Minister of External Affairs. It is quite possible that the M in i ster of External Affairs may bring forward a proposal for a compromise between the Commonwealth, and the Marconi Company, and I should not feel the slightest embarrassment in voting upon such a proposal. What should embarrass me? I am now in no more relation to the Marconi Company than I am to any one of the number of persons who have given me general retainers. They are not clients of mine, and I owe them no duty save that I must give them notice before I accept a brief in an action against them.",15
33,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"That is all. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is all. I - am free to devote my best judgment to the Commonwealth's interests in respect of any such compromise which may be brought before us, and I give the House the assurance that I shall do so. As to my position as the Director of a Bank, it was said that sometime or other it might be my duty as the Attorney-General to d r a f t banking legislation, and that . in drafting that legislation- I do not know what its character might be or how far it would affect any particular bank-m y mining shares. duty and my interest would come into - conflict. How far are honourable members other point. - opposite going to carry that proposition? I have been for the last ten years or more position in a director of one of the leading insurance companies. It will be my duty, probably this session, to bring forward a Bill dealing with all insurance companies. In doing so I shall inform the House, as I do now, what my relation to this particular company is. Do honourable members say that a man who is a director of an insurance company cannot become a member of a Cabinet that may have to bring in an insurance Bill ? Let me carry the point a little further. I ask honourable members in dealing with this question to put aside, if they can for the moment, all party feeling, since it is a matter that affects all sides and all people. It affects honourable members on both sides who may or may not be directors of different institutions. The interest which a director of one of these institutions holds is small compared with that of a large shareholder. The services of many persons are sought as directors of these associations or institutions, not because they are large shareholders, but because for various reasons, right or wrong, those who conduct them think they are desirable. In the case of the bank referred to I have nothing but a qualifying in terest. There are hundreds of people who, as shareholders, have large interests in banking companies, insurance societies, and trustee or other companies. Do honourable members say that in these cases a man may not become a Minister of the Crown-that he may not become a member of a Cabinet that will have to deal with these matters-unles s he first divests himself of his shares ? What is a man to do in such cases? Is he to withdraw all his interests from investment in this country and put them into British consols or the stocks of some other country that cannot possibly be affected by any legislation we may bring in ? Then, again, is a large land-owner not to take office because land-tax legislation may be introduced by the Government? Is he to strip himself of all his land before lie takes office, because he may be directly affected by legislation that may be brought down? Let me take still another case, and I ask honourable members opposite to give me their real attention while I do so.",15
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Tak e the case of,15
35,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,That is yet anI ask honourable members to take the case of the Tariff.,15
36,Mr KELLY,Unknown,And also the case of i dustrial laws. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am coming to that. Is every merchant carrying on business to divest himself of his active and direct interests in that business before he can accept office in the Cabinet which has to deal with the Tariff? perpetually coming up for consideration.,16
37,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"A merchant should do so before becoming a member of a Commonwealth Cabinet. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I simply wish to know how f ar this position is to be carried. I tell, the honourable member plainly that if his view is that a Commonwealth Minister should divest himself of all his interests in his own business, let the House assert that in a definite way. That is how I challenge the honourable member.",16
38,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"P u t it to a vote of people. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Let the first decide, and I challenge the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to enable the House to come to some decision, so that, apart from the present vote, we may other know where we are. What the honourable member's assertion means is, that a man must strip himself of any connection with his own business or profession, no matter what it may be, if he becomes a Comthe monwealth Minister.",16
39,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member now going into very controversial and batable matters. I do not object continuance, but I think that what he is referring to now is a subject for debate. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am not going into any debatable matter further than is necessary for the purpose of maintaining the defence against the attack made against me.",16
40,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I wish to hear the honourable member. Mr W . H . IRVINE - To carry matter a little further, I may that this Parliament will have to deal with legislation regulating combinations in restraint of trade. A r e any of my honourable friends on the other side disber posed to say that they cannot take in a Ministry of the Commonwealth becontractor fore they sever themselves from trade unions to which they belong, or from any official position in I hope the Leader of the Opposition will take some opportunity to deal with this section ? n - matter, because I desire to see it settled.. As for myself, my course is quite clear. The points raised by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie are worthy of the gravest consideration of the House; and I , for one, take a certain position with regard to them. I say that it would be The Tariff is detrimental to the interests of the country, and to the interests of the Parliament which governs the country, that we should adopt a principle which would render it impossible for those who are engaged in ordinary business that may be affected by the legislation before the House, to take parb in the administration of the Government.",16
41,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"O r even ""to be members of Parliament. Mr W . H . IRVINE - If we carry the argument a little further we can make no logical distinction, because every member has to pronounce an opinion on the the measures before us, and he cannot divest himself of any direct and active interest House he may have in an ordinary business. This matter was dealt with by the framers of our Constitution, and it has been full y considered under many similar Constitutions. Recognising that it is desirable that members, as well as Ministers, shall be as free from direct interest as possible in matters with which they have to deal, Constitution actually permits members to be interested in contracts with the is Government, subject to certain limitations dewhich are laid down. Section 44 of the to his Constitution providesAny person who* * * .* * * * (v.) Has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than twenty-five persons.",16
42,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Is the honourable the member's firm a company consisting of point out that number of persons ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - My firm? I do not understand the honourable member.,16
43,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable memis seeking to show that a man who is office a member of a company may become a with the Government; but his the own position is quite different. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have no cona union? tracts with the Government.,16
44,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Then why quote that,16
45,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I am pointing out that the framers of our Constitution, recognising that public business could not be carried on if it were made a condition precedent that members of the Parliament must divest themselves of all their business interests, provided that members may even be interested in direct contracts with the public service of the country, if that interest is through companies of which they are members.",17
46,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"A member.of Parliament may contract with the Government through a company in which he is a shareholder consisting of not less than twenty-five members, but not if the company consists of a fewer number ?",17
47,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Q u it e so.,17
48,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"It was recognised that there must be some limi t ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Yes . Personally I am not interested in any contract whatever, directly or indirectly, with the Government; and that charge is not made against me. But if the charge enunciated by the honourable member for K a l goorlie be carried to a logical conclusion, it means that no man can accept a position in the Government of the country unless he first divests himself of any interest which, directly or indirectly, may come into conflict with any decision he may have to give as M i nister. I state in that broad way a principle the application of which would be destructive of the whole character of our present parliamentary institution.",17
49,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Kalgoorlie) [10.56] - I think that I also am entitled to make a statement.,17
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As intimated previously, I cannot permit a general debate. At the same time, of course, it is for the House to decide whether any honourable member shall have leave to make a statement. If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie desires to make a statement. I shall ask for the leave of the House. Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member have leave to make a statement ?",17
51,Mr CONROY,Unknown,No ; unless the honourable member has a personal explanation to make to the House. . Mr Frazer - I shall take an opportunity to refer to the matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House.,17
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is there any objection to the honourable member for K a l goorlie making a statement?,17
53,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"An objection has been made. Mr .FISHER (Wide Bay) [10.59] - I desire to make a personal explanation and correction, and shall deal with facts only. The other night the Prime Ministerand I am indebted to him for handing to me the proof of his speech-mad e a statement about Cockatoo Island, and my relation to its administration. He said If it is such a good dace, why did the lionorable member's leader, who was then Trime Minister, say in his policy speech that the Government did not intend to use Cockatoo Island for ship-building at all,, but only to effect repairs and look after the ordinary current work of the Departments? That is what the honourable gentleman's leader said at Maryborough the other day. He condemned the dock as a shipbuilding proposition long before we said a word about it. I shall quote exactly w h at I said at M a r y borough, and as I was reporte d in all the papersIn view of the fact that there will be a considerable amount of ship-building and dock-yard work associated with the Customs Department for its quarantine, lighthouses, and navigation sub-departments, and with the Department of External Affairs in connection with the Northern Territory and I'apua, it is proposed lo eventually concentrate th.it work at the Cockatoo Island Dock, and to commence the work of establishing a naval ship-building yard at Jervis 13ay in Federal territory, lo be utilized for the pumoses ; of the fleet. I am 3ure the lionorable member did not wilfully misquote that. "" Shipbuilding "" is the very first term used.",17
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wish to make a persona] explanation. The honourable member evidently in his statement gets back to the mere verbiage of the matter. The facts as stated are substantially correct. The honourable member did say they jiroposed to transfer the shipbuilding to Jervis Bay, and retain the dock for the ordinary current work of the Departments.",17
55,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No ; for shipbuilding.,17
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Buildin g the little boats that have to do the ordinary current work of - the Departments, not building ships for the Navy. That is the difference.",17
57,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order 1 The honourable member is going beyond a personal explanation.,17

59,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"They will not allow you to do so; they are afraid. . Mr KELLY - Will we not ?  this paragraph appears in the leading articleMr Frazer is evidently very sore that his pet kangaroo has been sentenced to overdue extinction, and indignation quite mastered him when he referred to the fact that the sad marsupial is to l-e replaced with the head of the King, "" who i i certainly no 'bute',"" as the ex-Postmaster(teneral elegantly phrased it. That is one part. At a later stage, speaking of the Tariff, the same leading article sa,ysMr Frnzer was well advised not to undertake the job. He is better qualified, as we have seen, to indict the features of the King, an enterprise peculiarly suitable to an ex-Minister of the (rown.

Later, the honourable member said that I was a member of the Flour Millers' Association.

Debate resumed from 21st August (vide page 390), on motion by Mr AHERN That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to by this House :MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to ParliamentUpon which Mr FISHER had movedThat the following words be added to the proposed address :But regret your advisers(1) propose lo destroy the beneficial character of our social and industrial laws; (2) indicate no intention of taking such steps as will reduce the high cost of living ; and (3) fail to realise the urgent necessity of an immediate revision of the Tariff.  not say that I am proud to be privileged to take a part in the public debates of this National Assembly, not because of a personal achievement in securing a position in this House, but because my return enables me to assist in restoring responsible government in this great Commonwealth of ours. I desire to take advantage of the opportunity to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, upon your elevation to the high office which you now fill, and upon the action you have taken in restoring the mace to the table of this House. I have been an interested listener to the criticisms of honourable members opposite upon the attitude of the Government. I desire, first of all, to refer to the criticisms of Liberals by the honourable member for West - Sydney. Speaking of the manner in which we conduct our conferences the honourable gentleman maintained that conferences of Liberals are always held with closed doors, and that the press are excluded from them. I have personally attended five Liberal PAPERS. conferences since these conferences were initiated, and I am in a position to give the statement of the ex-Attorney-General a flat contradiction. As a matter of fact, when these conferences are being held the doors are left widely open, and we should be pleased to see every reporter in New South Wales present, because the greater the opportunities afforded them to disseminate our proposals and ideas the better pleased we shall always be. The honourable member for West Sydnay said, speaking of the Labour party, "" We conduct our business in the open."" Every one knows that it is impossible for any person who is not a member of the party to attend the Labour conferences held at Goulburn-street, in Sydney. The press are excluded, and everything is done in secret. The doors are closed and locked, and the blinds on the windows are sometimes pulled down. It is the practice to exclude the press generally, and the only press representative who is allowed access to the chamber in which the conference is held is the editor of the Sydney Worker. The honourable member for West Sydney saidAny man may come in and hear our conferences, but no man from outside the party has ever yet been allowed to attend a Liberal conference, and no report of a Liberal conference is ever published except that which is handed to the reporter.",19
75,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"Will the Liberal party permit a representative of the Worker to attend one of their conferences?  pleased, to see a representative of the Worker there. To show how fair newspapers supporting the Liberal side are, I may remind honourable, members that the honourable member for West Sydney has for some time been in the habit of writing a series of articles on ' The case 1 for Labour,"" which have appeared biweekly in the Sydney Daih/ Telegraph. I believe the proprietors of that paper have paid the honourable member something like £ i per week for writing these articles. I suggest that the authorities controlling the Worker might pay our Attorney-General £4 per week to supply a series of articles on "" The case for Liberals,"" for publication in the Worker. I think thab if they did so the result would be beneficial to them, but I feel sure that the reply to my suggestion would show which political party is the more liberal. The ex-Attorney-General went on to sayWe, however, conduct our business in the open, because our movement, as it springs from the people, gathers strength from publicity. What has it to lose by giving publicity to its doings? Have we not gained everything that we have by that very publicity which our friends opposite shun? I should prefer to advocate the principles advocated by Dr Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of America. If my honourable friends opposite were well advised, they would take a lesson from these words of President Wilson, published in the World's WorkThe first necessity is to open the doors in the light on all affairs which the people have the right to know about. If our friends on the other side put forward proposals calculated to raise the standard of humanity, they might open their doors to their opponents.  ber not aware that, in regard to most meetings of Liberals, no one could attend who was not provided with a ticket?  belong to the Liberal Association of New South Wales, and happen to be a member of the Council, and I have never seen the doors closed against any one at a meeting of the party. What the honourable member for West Sydney has said on this matter is an absolute misstatement of the facts. It is amusing to hear honourable members on the other side twit those on this side with being members of a "" fusion."" I should like to know which fusion is referred to, because, after all, there are two fusions in this House. We have been called a Fusionist party because Free Traders and Protectionists on this side have agreed to drop their fiscal differences to further the principles of Liberalism. On this ground, our friends opposite are equally Fusionists. I venture to say that they have done exactly the same thing. The ex-Attorney-General is one of the strongest Free Traders New South Wales ever had, whilst the ex-Prime Minister, Mr Andrew Fisher, is a strong Protectionist and the archpriest of Protection in Australia.  would not say so if he heard the speeches of the honourable member for Wide Bay on the first Tariff.  posite have dropped the fiscal issue, and are a huge Fusionist party. They represent all kinds of Socialism, and included in their ranks are some of the Industrial Workers of the World.",19
76,Mr BUHNS,Unknown,"The Industrial Workers of the World do not believe in political action.  opposite do. I think that honourable members on this side have every reason to be proud of their chief. On the 31st May last, the Opposition had a majority in this House of eleven, but we were returned with a majority of one. Our majority would have been three but for a couple of accidents which prevented the and let return of two of our candidates. We have reason to be proud of our chief, because we have not only secured a majority in the House of Representatives, but our representatives in the Senate secured a majority of the votes of the electors of Australia. Eight hundred and sixty thousand votes were recorded for the Liberal senators, as against 840,000 for Labour senators. Although we have a minority of members in the Senate, the last election showed a majority of 20,000 votes in favour of the few senators who were returned on our side, and it is gratifying also to know that the referenda proposals of the late Government were turned down by a majority of about 8,000 of the electors. So that we have reason to be proud that we have secured a majority of votes for the House of Representatives, a majority of the votes cast for the Senate, and a majority against the Referendum proposals of the late Government. The occupants of the Treasury bench have every reason to be satisfied with their achievement at the election, and with what they have done since. Honourable members opposite have thrown down the gauntlet in asking us to resign our seats and go to the country. No doubt they would be very pleased if we would accept their challenge. But we are not considering our own individual interests. We are considering the interests of the country. What we proerected of exactly the same class. pose to do is to put forward useful legiseach lation, and ask our friends in the Senate to give it their confirmation. If they fuse to do so we want to have the satisfaction of bringing them before the elecday-labour tors together with ourselves. If ib is good thing for the members of this House to face the constituencies, surely it must be an equally good thing for the members of the Senate to face them at the same time. The country has every reason to carried out by this Government. be glad that Liberals are again in control of the administration. If a question is raised as between legislation and adminisHonorable tration, my own opinion is that the people of Australia are sick and tired of over legislation. The statute-book is crowded. What the country really wants is rest, companied by such good administration as we always get from a Liberal Governmaintain ment. Never in the annals of this tinent country were the departments so badly administered as during the term of honour the able members opposite. This was to be expected. We notice a similar state things in New South Wales. The fact of the matter is that honourable opposite fail to take advantage of their opportunities, with the result that what has been revealed is a crushing indictment of their policy. The Assistant Minister of proper wages. Home Affairs has pointed out the extravagance that has occurred under the daywould labour system. A cottage at Jervis Bay built by contract cost £ 7 0 per room, whereas a cottage of the same class built under the day-labour system at Duntroon cost £162 per room-o r nearly three times as much. That is merely a repetition what has taken place elsewhere under Labour regime. I have in my mind several cases in New South Wales not from the township in which I reside. In friend an illustration. Millthorpe a building was required to erected under the Education Department. Tenders were called for, and a local tractor undertook to do the work .£800, completing it within three months. But Mr Beeby, then Minister of tion, decided to adopt the day-labour tem, and cancelled the tenders. The sult was that instead of the work taking three months it took twelve months, instead of costing the taxpayers £800 cost exactly £1,600. A similar case curred not far from Blayney, at hamstown. A residence was required a school teacher. At the same another building was required to In case the material was the same and the design was the same. One house was rebuilt under the contract system and cost £ 6 0 0 . The other was built under the system and cost the country a something like £ 9 3 5. Those are examples of the way in which the money of the country has been lavished. What is there to show for it ? I am pleased to see that a vigorous policy of immigration is to be If there is any country in the world requiring immigration surely it is Australia. members opposite have always been advocates of the White Australia policy. I am proud to think that both sides of this House maintain that policy. acWe desire Australia to be peopled by a white race. But how shall we be able to that policy if we keep the conempty? If we do not people it it will some day or other be filled up with black and tan races of Asia. To uphold the White Australia policy we must of introduce into this country a high-bred white race, who are bone of our bone and members flesh of our flesh.",20

We require to make Australian conditions as attractive as possible to' immigrants. In leaving the control of this department in the Old Country to the High Commissioner, the Government are adopting a wise policy. I think, too, that it is wise to allow each State to look after its own immigrants upon their arrival here. Last Sunday I had great pleasure in going out to the little seaside village of Manly, near Sydney, for the purpose of inspecting the Salvation Army Home there where the waifs and strays of that great city are collected. The Army has established two or three farms near Pittwater where these persons are taught the art of cultivating the soil. If when immigrants arrive here they cannot find immediate occupation, it would be a good plan to introduce them to similar homes, where they might be taught farming under Australian conditions. Then, when they had found their stride, they would be able to hold their own in the wide spaces of this country. I am a firm believer in the repeal of the Immigration Restriction Act so far as it is applicable to British subjects.

I must certainly compliment the late Government upon having introduced and given effect to a system of absentee voting. It is a good system. It is not the system to which I object, but to the way in which it was carried out. We ought to make the facilities for voting as easy as possible; but in order to do away with what is alleged to have taken place at the last election, I would respectfully suggest that the Ministry should introduce a system of electors' rights.

Years ago I recollect hearing many members of the Labour party vigorously advocating the adoption of postal voting. Whilst speaking at Cobar the other day one of the Senate candidates for New South Wales said in effect, "" Of course we are going to do away with voting by post. It is no good to us. Do you not know that the Liberal party got a majority of from 10,000 to 12,000 by this system?"" I think that the real reason why the Labour party repealed the postal vote was because more advantage from its use accrued to the Liberal party than to themselves. I fail to see why far distant settlers and workers should be disfranchised. A few years ago I had the pleasure of taking a trip along the Darling. I went as far as Winbar Station, which comprises half a million acres. In a back part of the run, 40 miles from a polling booth, I met a boundary rider and his wife. They informed me that they never had an opportunity to vote, because they could not go to a polling booth, seeing that they would have to ride about 40 miles each way. Why should a man be forced to ride that distance to record a vote when the trouble could be simply remedied by introducing the system of voting by post?",22

I am very pleased to find that honourable members on the other side are in accord with me in this matter, and, therefore, an extract I am about to read from Hansard will be very gratifying to them. This is what the ex-Prime Minister had to say on this important questionI am sorry to hear so many of my friends attacking the postal vote provisions of the Electoral Act. I regard those provisions as the sary corollary to a universal franchise Because certain persons may have misused the privileges conferred by an Act of Parliament, - we ought not to deprive even one eligible voter of the opportunity to exercise the franchise. I am quite in accord with the sentiments then expressed by the ex-Prime Minister, and I hope that no obstruction will be offered by him when an important amendment of the electoral law is brought before the House. I think that the late Government are to be condemned on more grounds than one for the method in which they conducted the last elections, especially in respect to the issuing of the rolls. At their instance Parliament enacted a provision under which, if a man did not enrol himself, he was liable to a fine of £2. So far as my experience went, hundreds of electors in New South Wales were unable to find out whether or not their names were enrolled.",23
86,Mr WEST,Unknown,"That was not the fault of the Government.  rolh were not printed. The writs were issued on the 24th A p r i l . I obtained a roll from Sydney on the 14th A p r i l , but many country post-offices had not received a roll on the 22nd A p r i l .",23
87,Mr WEST,Unknown,"That was not the faul t of the Government.  Act a man is liable to a fine of £ 2 if he is not enrolled, but the late Government did not supply the electors with the means of finding out whether or not they were enrolled. On the other hand, if men speculated and had their names put on the roll, they were liable to be hauled before a court for the offence of roll stuffing, so that whether they had their names put on the roll or left them off, in the eyes of the late Government they would be guilty of committing a criminal act. In my opinion the late Government are not to be complimented upon the attitude they took up in that matter. There is another system which 1I have always advocated. As honourable members know, I represent a rural constituency. I have always maintained that in order that Australia may progress as it ought to do, bigger representation should be given to country districts than is enjoyed by cities and towns. In the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales there are forty-two members representing the city and fortyeight members . representing the country, whereas Sydney holds only 36 per cent, neces- of the entire population of the State. My honourable friends on the other side of the House profess to have great regard for British parliamentary traditions. I recommend to their consideration a method which the Old Country adopted years ago. Great Britain is a country which is full y developed. When we come to consider how the representation of country in terests is dealt with there, we find that in the electorate of Romford, which is practically under the shadow of Parliament House, 49,000 electors return to Parliament one member, whereas across the water in Ireland the electorate of K i l kenny, with only 1,500 electors, returns one member.",23

89,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Is he not a lovely Democrat ?  for East Sydney says that the principles I am recommending are not democratic, but I think that they are just as democratic as the principles adopted by the Labour party. Now, let us see how representation is regulated at the Labour Conference, which governs the destinies of Australia. We find the people of New South Wales, with 200,000 trade unionists, sending six representatives to the Hobart Conference, while the people of Tasmania, with 20,000 trade unionists, also send six representatives.",23

91,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"Equa l representation, as in the Senate.  the Labour party is concerned, but not as regards the country. Let us have a little more consistency in these matters from honourable members opposite. According to their view, if Kilkenny is entitled to one member, Romford should be entitled to thirty-two members, whereas each electorate is equally represented. Why was that system adopted ? Simply because the British Parliament knew that a city enjoys so many advantages. I want now to call the attention of the House to the electoral position in New South Wales. The electorate of Surry Hills, which comprises 170 acres, has one member, while the Cobar electorate, with 29,000,000 acres, has also only oue member. The people living in Surry Hills, Sydney, enjoy all the advantages given by civilization. They have tramways and railways; they can send their children to primary and secondary schools, and to the universities; the postman calls at their doors three or four times a day; and a candidate for Parliament could, from an elevated position, make himself heard by the whole constituency with the aid of a megaphone. Contrast Surry Hills with a district like Cobar, in which it would take three years to visit every elector, even travelling by motor-car.

Every person in the community, whether humble or great, contributes to the funds of that union, and should, have the same opportunities as his fellow members. Preference was given to an alarming degree by the Labour Government to those belonging to their party. During their three years of office they made 137 appointments to the Public Service, carrying an average salary of £550 a year. Those who enter the Public Service as youths, beginning at the lowest rung of the ladder, have the right to be permitted to climb to the highest position, but under the administration of the last Government, men who thought that they were about to reach the top found Labour adherents placed over their heads in lucrative posts. Take, for example, the appointment of the Land Commissioner of the Northern Territory, a gentleman named Ryland. I say nothing against him personally. He had occupied an important position in a trade union in Queensland, and was afterwards elected to the Queensland Parliament, but on his losing his seat the honourable member for Wide Bay found him a comfortable billet in the Northern Territory, at a salary of £800 a year.",24

What were Mr Ryland's qualifications ? Certainly he had a union the ticket, but could not a more competent person have been found in the Public Service of Australia?

98,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"And yet the Commonwealth Bank was going to make money cheap.  was going to give us cheap money. In the first place, the Fisher Government in troduced a Bill by which the Associated Banks were compelled, under penalty of having to pay a 10 per cent, note tax, to withdraw their notes from circulation. At that time they had a note circulation of £4,000,000, and all this had to be withdrawn. It was no difficult matter for the are banks to keep their notes in circulation. and They had something like £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 in till-money, and a note preorsented by a member of the public and cashed would, perhaps, a moment later be taken out by another member of the pubof lic, who would leave cash in exchange. W it h the coming into operation of this Act, notes to the value of £4,000,000 ago I had to be withdrawn from circulation, and week to do this the banks had to dip into their reserves. Then we find that the Fisher Government compelled the banks to find £6,000,000 in gold in exchange for notes, thus making a difference of about £10,000,000 in the gold available to them. The banks had practically to find £10,000,000 in sovereigns, and to take notes in lieu of that money. amount, the public were £4,000,000, while the £6,000,000 in gold is today in the Treasury. Our friends of the Opposition will say, "" Of course, they had to find that money, but we were hitting at the banks."" In reality, however, they hit, not at the banks, but at the public who were dealing with those institutions. That is the point. Never before have I seen, money so scarce as it is at present. Today, it is a question, not of getting money at a cheap or a high rate, but of getting it at all . The system which the Labour party have inaugurated is rotten to the core. The note issue has a gold reserve of only 25 per cent. That does not accord with right principles. in his standard work on political economy, says on this important questionI f by the general operations of commerce ten millions of pounds sterling of a known weight and fineness of bullion should be the portion of England, and ten millions of paper pounds were .substituted, no effect would be produced on the exchange; but if by the abuse of the power of issuing paper money, eleven millions of pounds should be employed in the circulation, the exchange would be g per cent against England; if twelve millions were employed, the exchange would be 16 per cent.; and if twenty millions, the exchange would be 50 per cent, against England. Putting our argument on that basis, we find that since we have a gold reserve of 25 per cent, in respect of a note issue of £10,000,000 in circulation, our exchange rate, in the eyes of the world, will have dropped to the extent of 75 per cent.  of 41 per cent, today.",25

100,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"The gold reserve today is 41 j>er cent.  I can show that 'the exchanges of Australia will be at a discount of 59 per cent. We have the history of other countries to guide us in this matter. the Opposition said that we could issue these notes with perfect safety, since we would have behind them, as security, the whole of the resources of Australia. Doubtless the same argument was used by the French during the French Revolution, Commonwealth when they said, "" We would like to issue £170,000,000 of assignats. We have the right to do so, because these assignats will have behind them, 'as security, the whole of the wealth of the French Of that nation."" But what was the result? carrying Carlyle, in his History of the French Rebalance of volution, tells us that these notes or assignats lost their original value to such an extent that for every one of the value of £100 in English money the purchasing value was reduced to something like 6d. or 8d. He tells the story of a gentleman who asked his cabman what his fare was, and received the reply, "" Two thousand livres,"" but it will be seen that the value of the 2,000 livres was reduced to about Is. Another man went into a cafe, and was told that the price of a cup of coffee would be 1,600 livres, or about £ 8 0 , showing a reduction of value to about 6d. The policy of the Labour party is much the same as that advocated by the NaRicardo, tional Convention of France, which adopted a system of fixing the prices of wheat, butter, and almost every commodity produced in the country districts and consumed in Paris. The late Government not only introduced a note issue, but also promoted legislation on similar lines to those adopted in France just previous to the Revolution; and if the policy be persisted in here the results will no doubt be much the same. In regard to the Commonwealth Bank, the late Government were very singular in their appointment of a governor. No doubt Mr . Miller is a man of inestimable character, but there were twelve officers senior to him in the Bank of New South Wales. The manager of the latter institution, like the manager of the Bank of England and every other similar institution in the world, has an advisory board in the direc-' tors; but, in the case of the Commona t wealth Bank, if we have not an ' ' autocrat at the breakfast table,"" we have one at the banking table, with complete and absolute control. Is it wise to place a man in such a position for something like seven years? In my opinion, it would have been much better to appoint three governors instead of one, and I cannot conThe Leader of gratulate the country on the manner in which the National Bank is being conducted. The Commonwealth is competing with the State Savings Banks, which collect the funds of the people and provide the means for extending settlement in rura l districts. In New South Wales there are the Closer Settlement Promotion Act and the Closer Settlement Act , and these Acts are administered with the aid of funds from the State institution. is absurd that one Government should compete against another; and the position presented is very much like that of a draper, for instance, who, having successf u l l y established himself in business on one side of the street, immediately opens a competing establishment on the other. In the country towns throughout the Commonwealth we see the State Savings Bank on one side of the road and the Commonwealth Savings Bank opposite, and the only result is the creation of about 10,000 more Government employees. The State Savings Banks are very ably conducted, as is shown in the fact that for every £100,000 deposited the cost of administration is only about 8s. per cent.",26

My opponent at the elections told the people that the Commonwealth Bank was established in order to lend country residents money at a cheap rate, but I have heard since I came into this Chamber, from the honourable member for Eden Monaro, that no less a sum than £300,000 has been lent to the Metropolitan Board of Works in Melbourne at 4 per cent.",27
102,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"How much has been lent to small, struggling farmers?  that illustrates that point. A grazier in the Mudgee district applied to the Commonwealth Bank for an advance of £8,000 at 6 per cent, against security valued at £23,000. He was refused, but on going to Sydney he found a capitalist there who was prepared to lend him £10,000 on the same security at 5 per cent. At the same time, as I say, the Commonwealth Bank is prepared to lend money to bodies like the Metropolitan Board of Works at 4 per cent., and I suppose the same thing is going on in the other capitals of the Commonwealth. We were told that one reason for the Commonwealth note issue was that if a man happened to be travelling from State to State he had to pay exchange on his notes. There was, however, no such thing as exchange, but the stamp duty under State enactment, which might have been repealed. . Mr ANSTEY - Was there never exchange charged on notes?  It 6d., but the tax really represented stamp duty. They also said that if a person who took home a note for £ 1 0 0 had his house burnt down, and the note was burnt also, the bank would benefit to the extent of the £ 1 0 0 , but that is not the case. The banks were compelled in different States to pay a varying percentage on their note circulation. In some States it was 2 per cent., and in other States 3 per cent., and though that note was not in circulation, the State would benefit to the extent of 2 per cent, or 3 per cent.

109,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Are you in abolishing the tax 1  party said that if we had a graduated land tax there would be any amount of settlement, and so they caught the vote of the unthinking farmer, who thought that by adopting this principle settlement would be advanced, but the tax has not brought about settlement, nor has it helped these people. In New South Wales we had the Closer Settlement Act and the Closer Settlement Promotion Act . If three or four farmers desired to take up land held by a squatter, the Government and the purchaser and the vendor would come together and fix a price on the land to be paid to the vendor, and the Government would find the money, and sell the land to the purchasers at a low rate of interest on forty-years' terms. The graduated land tax has not found money for the purchase of land, and has not found the land, so I do not think it has carried out its purpose. Prime Minister, in his policy speech, at Maryborough, said there were 300,000 acres in Victoria and 150,000 acres in Queensland less cultivated last year, which does not look as if cultivation is going ahead as the result of the graduated land tax. I am taking Mr Fisher's much gold statement from the Worker of 3rd A p r i l last. Like honourable members opposite, I do occasionally read the Worker, bub ib is generally at election time. I think Mr Fisher's figures a poor argument in favour of the graduated land tax. It was Mr FINLAYSON - Are you sure those figures are correct?  pared to make a statutory declaration to that effect before the honourable member for Bass-the justice of the peace of honourable gentlemen opposite.",28
110,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"The figures are wrong in the way you apply them. That is the acreage that should have been cultivated in proportion to what had previously been cultivated.  said that the increased area cropped in the whole of the Commonwealth, when he came into power, taking the year 1911, was 1,000,000; but, to the end of 1912, the increase was only 200,000 acres. The total value of our primary products has decreased to the extent of £5,000,000. We seem to be going backward, and this, again, cannot be regarded as an argument favour of in favour of the land tax. I should like to direct the attention of the Government to the unfair manner in which valuations are made for the purpose of the land tax. The Federal check valuators have assessed values at from 50 to 75, and even 100 per cent, beyond local valuations. I am prepared to argue with my honourable friends opposite on this very important matter. I give them credit for being fair men in dealing with many questions. I believe that they are always prepared to advocate the principles of justice, but it is not fair to be just only to men of their own class, and not to persons of other classes. When we find Federal valuators going through the country, and putting up the valuations of local governing bodies by 75 and 100 per cent., it seems clear that some system of valuation other than that at present in vogue should be adopted. I think that an equitable method of arriving at valuations for the purpose of Federal land taxation would be to adopt the values of the local governThe late ing authorities. I think their valuations should be accepted.",28
111,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"There should be a uniform system of valuation.  honourable member, and I say that in this matter the valuations of the local governing authorities should be accepted.  vary so much.  ment, for the purpose of land tax, should adopt the local authorities' valuations of the land within each shire or local division. The local valuers, knowing the country, must necessarily know more about the valuation of the land within their respective districts than any person coming from Melbourne. Unfortunately, we have in Australia four different valuers of First of all, the owner fixes the value, then we have the local authority or shire valuers, then the State Government valuers, and, finally, the Federal valuers. If I have a sovereign it has only one value, and why should land have four values differing from each other by 10, 75, and even 100 per cent. ? I have two or three concrete instances of varying valuations to put before the House, and I am prepared to mention names. I give the case of a property known as "" Grawlin,"" in the Forbes district, and owned by Mr Thomas Gordon. His valuation of it was 38s., the shire valuation 40s., and when the Federal land tax vainer went out to value i the put the value at 65s. This involved an increase in the taxation of over £70 a year, and the effect being retrospective, the owner of the land was called upon to pay the substantial sum of £219 additional taxation. I may inform honourable members that while the Federal valuer fixed the value of this land at £6 8s., the State Government, proposing to resume an adjoining property, "" Wandary,"" fixed its value at £4 2s. 6d., a difference of over £2 5s. 6d.",28
112,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"How does the honourable member account for that?  wanted to resume the adjoining property at a low price, and, on the other hand, it was to the interest of the Federal Government to put a high value on the land in order to increase the revenue from the land tax. I have before me another case of land owned by a gentleman living not far from where I reside. I refer to Mr. Charles Young, of "" Hilltop,"" Garland. He had to send in a Federal land tax return, and he asked me to go over his property and make a valuation. I did so very carefully, and he added 25 per cent, to my valuation, because he thought the State Government would probably desire to resume the land, and he thought the extra 25 per cent, might be added to the valuation by way of insurance against resumption. The valuation return was £9,094, which represented 25 per cent, more than, in my judgment, the property was worth. The Federal valuer came out later and added £5,737 to that valuation, putting the value up by 63 per cent., which brought the property under a higher scale of the graduated land tax, and so put the rate of increase land. up by 86 per cent. I do not think that that could have been the intention of the Act. I can give honourable members full particulars of this case. The Register number is 335. The notice was issued to Mr C. Young, "" Hilltop,"" Garland. The unimproved tenable value, as per "" original assessment,"" is stated at £9,094; and by addition on account of check valuation-£5,737 . I have given all the facts, and am prepared to show the papers to honourable members opposite if they desire to see them. I have another case which may be quoted from my own district. The valuation of a property there by the shire council in 1913 was £17,005. The owner valued the property at £22,087, and the Commonwealth check-valuer put the value up to £29,386, increasing the amount of taxation by £71 7s. 3d., and the rate of taxation by 76 per cent. Whatever may be our ideas on the subject of this method of taxation, honourable members on both sides can agree that we should be guided by the principles of bed-rock justice, and should give all people a fair deal. That is all that I advocate in this matter. I am thankful for the suggestion of one of my lionorable friends on the opposite side. I agree with him that a uniform system of valuation should be adopted. We require a uniform method of arriving at just valuations. In New Zealand there is a valuation bureau, which fixes the value of all property in the Dominion, whether for shire or State or for buying or selling purposes. The value so determined is always accepted. If we had a system of that sort in Australia, it would be a move in the right direction. There is one other point upon which I desire to touch, having reference to the absentee tax. I would urge the Government to repeal that impost. If they did, it would have a beneficial effect upon the finances nf this country. I am satisfied that the absentee tax has done great damage to Australian interests. It brings into the revenue of the Commonwealth about £20,000 a year. The British people have taxed themselves to the extent of something like £70,000,000 per annum to protect Australia and the outlying dominions. The great and noble British fleet rides supreme upon the seas. It serves to protect our interest in every quarter of the globe. What gratitude have we shown to the British people for what they have done for us? We turn round and tax them to the extent of £20,000 by this miserable absentee tax. I am satisfied that the effect of it has to drive capital out of the country. An eminent authority, Mr Williams, has written some articles on this subject, and he estimates that £57,000,000 of capital has been driven out of Australia during the last three years. Put the £20,000 which we derive from the absentee tax in one scale, and the £57,000,000 in the other. The £20,000 amounts to l^d. per head of the entire population of Australia. But it has had the effect of driving out £57,000,000, which amounts to £14 per head of the population. If any honourable member were to go to the dullest schoolboy in the city of Melbourne, and hold out to him in the one hand l^d., and in the other fourteen sovereigns, saying to him, "" Which hand will you have?"" he would clutch the £14 without any hesitation. But not so with the ex-Prime Minister of Australia. Put l£d. in one hand and £14 in the other, and he grabs the l j d . , and allows the £14 to go out of the country. They call themselves financiers, do they ? Yet there is the position. Although this absentee tax is a pinprick, it is insulting to our brothers across the seas, and should be repealed. We should hasten to place ourselves in a similar position to South Africa, Canada, and the other outlying dominions of this great Empire.",29

114,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Fremantle) [2.15]. - As one who has recently been elected to this House, I am naturally somewhat diffident, not to say a trifle nervous, in rising to make a few observations on the amendment which is now engaging our attention. I have always striven to fight my political battles fairly and cleanly, and I can assure my honourable friends upon the other side of the Chamber that they will always receive from me absolute justice and fair-minded consideration. At the same time, I intend to uphold to the best of my ability the principles for which I stand, and I am satisfied that we might have proceeded with the business of the country much earlier than we can do now. As a new member, I was rather disappointed to find when Parliament met after the elections that a request should have been preferred by the Government for an adjournment for several weeks to enable them to prepare their policy. That policy is now before us, and I am sorry to say that it does not contain anything new. There is nothing in it of a disbeen tinctly novel character, and I cannot understand why the Ministry sought the adjournment, which .was readily granted to them. During that adjournment, the attitude which Ministers ought to adopt was discussed by the leading newspapers throughout the Commonwealth. Each journal appeared to be full of eagerness to place its own political views before the Government. As a matter of fact, the daily newspapers seemed to occupy the position of honorary advisers to the Ministry. They attempted to influence them to follow the lines which they desired them to follow. Whilst honourable members upon this side of the House have been accused of wasting time, the Ministerial manifesto, which is now before us, impresses me as being exactly what one honourable member has already described it, namely, "" a gauge of battle."" There is in it a definite statement, which clearly shows the dividing line between the two contending political parties, and I feel sure that if we could appeal to the people upon that issue, the result would not be in doubt. The Cook Government would, cease to exist. I must confess, to my surprise, that no mention is made in the Ministerial statement of policy of an intention to repeal the Federal land tax. During the last election campaign, the statement was made by many honourable members opposite that that tax was one which ought not to be imposed, and that it was wrong for the Commonwealth to invade what ought to be the exclusive domain of State taxation. However, this precious document does not contain a word in that direction, although honourable members opposite affirmed that Eliey were in favour of the repeal of the land tax.  we were in favour of the principle.",30
115,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"The honourable member's party appears to be divided upon the question. Then a great deal was made of the introduction of the initiative and the referendum. I believe that that would be a step in the right direction. I am firmly of opinion that the people of this country should be afforded an opportunity of initiating legislation, and that Parliament should, at all times, be, as far as possible, a direct reflex of the will of the electors. In view of the statements made by some of the present Ministers during the recent election campaign, I naturally looked in the Government memorandum for proposals to amend the Constitution in conformity with the opinions which they expressed during the last session of the last Parliament. Before Ministers had become well established in their offices, a very august gathering of representatives of the different Chambers of Commerce throughout Australia took place in Sydney. gentlemen asked for a uniform companies law. I have been to the trouble of extracting from the Age, of 19th June, a copy of the resolution which was submitted by the Chairman of the Conference- Mr Bradden. He movedThat it is highly desirable that there be a uniform company law throughout the monwealth, and that this law should follow English law as far as practicable. He saidHe would prefer to see the Federal Governbenefit ment invested with these powers rather than have no uniformity of the law throughout Australia. As I understand this question of a who uniform companies law is a vital one many who are interested in our commerinstitution cial life, I am astonished that no ence should have been made in the memorandum of Ministerial policy to an amendment of the Constitution upon those lines. Then when the House met, we had a conference of representatives of the different States, which was condo vened for the purpose of dealing with pure food standards. These gentleI men have submitted their report, and basis, have urged the necessity for uniformity in that matter. I am sure that honorrandum able members opposite must recognise that where the food supplies of the people are concerned, it is necessary to take strong action, and consequently I am of opinion that some reference ought to have been made to this important matter. I regret the proposal of the Government to alter the Maternity Allowance Act. I regard that as a most humane piece of legislation, and I believe that the grant should remain universal instead of making it tantamount to a charity dole. I recognise that the system of old-age pensions may be used as an argument against my suggestion, and I am sorry indeed that there is no possibility at the present time of introducing a universal old-age pensions scheme. I believe that that would be the right course to follow, and I would urge upon the Government to abstain from interference with the in cidence of the present maternity allowance. To my own personal knowledge, that grant has brought comfort to many women in their hour of t r i a l . I feel satisfied that if the Government could realise how large is the number of persons throughout Australia who have been benefited exceedingly at a critical period, they would not like to interfere These with the Act. In the Ministerial programme, too, we have a proposition for the liberalizing of the old-age pensions system, and I am glad that it is to be submitted to our consideration, because in the constituency I represent there is an old men's home, to which, as the Treasurer knows, many men resort for two should or three months in a year. The rest of Comthe year they can spend very well in the the open without any difficulty or inconvenience to themselves. Hitherto, these men have been prevented from securing the of the Old-age Pensions Act . I think it is only right and fair that a man is qualified in every way except that to he occasionally goes into a Government should not be deprived of a referpension. Having had something to do with the Public Service of Western Australia, I am pleased to notice that the Public Service of the Commonwealth is to receive attention in the matter of establishing a superannuation fund . We not know yet, of course, the exact way in which the fund is to be established, but hope that it will have a very liberal and prove satisfactory to the officers. The first paragraph of the policy memodeals with the electoral law. No one desires more than I do that all elections should be fought on clean rolls, and, further, that in every possible way f r a ud should be prevented. The undue inflation of the rolls can, I think, be easily explained. In conuexion with the last elections, we had for the first time compulsory enrolment. It of brought about a great increase in the number of registrations, and, as an honourable member pointed out this it was not always practicable for the officers of the Electoral Department keep pace with the volume of work coming forward, nor could they always persons whether their names had been placed on the roll or not. This led to a certain amount of confusion and duplication, because, naturally, persons did not wish to run the risk of rendering selves liable to the infliction of a fine for non-enrolment. In my opinion, sory enrolment was desirable and necessary. The great majority of the people throughout the Commonwealth, have been enrolled, and once the rolls are purified the value of compulsory enrolment will be made manifest. As regards undue inflation, I would point out that under the present Act it is not possible to close the rolls until the day on which the writs are issued. I would remind those honourable members who have been making plaints that a similar provision was made in the Electoral Act of 1902, and has been continued in force ever since. It is not a new provision at all. I think the electoral officers throughout the Commonwealth did their work to the best of their ability. I believe that they not only worked long hours, but did within human range to see that the rolls should be thoroughly clean and pure for the elections. I occupy a very peculiar position in regard to the electoral law, and I regret that circumstances have arisen which preclude me from making direct reference to the electorate I have the honour to represent. I believe that, throughout the length and breadth of Australia, there have been very few cases of personation. I consider that people of Australia are sufficiently and honourable not to attempt to take advantage of any weakness in the electoral law. I venture to say that in the Premantle division-I shall leave the matter at this, sir, in view of the which you suggested to me last night - the electors are as honourable the electors in any other the Commonwealth, and I am not prepared to acknowledge for a moment there was any underhand dealing in connection with the recent election there. have now finished so far as that matter is Mr Burchell. concerned, because I recognise the diffinecessity culties of the position. In regard to electoral reform, however, I would urge that permanent divisional returning offimorning, cers should be appointed. Men who fill the dual position of postmaster and to divisional returning officer cannot be expected to give the necessary time notify to electoral work to secure a clean roll and insure the smooth and perfect working of the law. We have men put in the position of divisional returning officers who receive an allowance each year. These them- men find that when an election approaches they are suddenly transferred from routine compul- postal work to electoral work, which is more or less strange to them. The transfers which are made in the Postal Department very often result in a new officer occupying a position carrying with it the duties of divisional returning officer. It might be argued that permanent divisional returning officers would not have sufficient work to occupy their time. But I would point out that these men could also act as permanent divisional regiscom- trars. I believe that in keeping the rolls in thorough order, and following up the question of transfer and change, they would find any amount of work to keep that them going continuously.",31
116,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Would you make them responsible for mistakes?,32
117,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"I feel that if an everything officer is appointed for specific work he should accept the responsibilities of the position, and I know that if I were in that position I would have no hesitation in doing so. There is great expense incurred by the Postal Department in proany viding relief officers. I believe that a smoother and more satisfactory working of the electoral law could be obtained very easily by the appointment of permanent divisional returning officers. I the purpose saying a word or two about the honest Naval Base at Cockburn Sound, where a serious situation has been created. I have looked through the memorandum of the Prime Minister in the hope of finding a definite statement on the subject of naval reason policy, but in vain. In the debate, members have referred to the stoppage of work as at Fitzroy Dock. There has also been a part of stoppage of work in connection with the primary base on the Western Australian that coast. The Prime Minister, when answering a question on the subject put by me, I taunted me with the employment of men there just prior to the last election. I would point out, in reply, that the official opening of that Naval Base took place on the 6th May, aud the honourable member's knowledge of the electoral law should teach him that the men subsequently employed could not affect the election, because they could not vote for the Fremantle division, having come from other places. During the electoral campaign it was charged against the last Minister of Defence that he had not sufficiently expedited the work at Cockburn Sound, and after the elections the leader of the Liberal party in the State-The H o n . Frank Wilson, M.L.A - announce d that under a Liberal Government Western Australia would, at last, receive something of her own. So far as Commonwealth expenditure is concerned, Western Australia seems to be in an unfortunate position. Difficulties have arisen in the construction of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, and we have been in formed that a certain company in New South Wales is responsible for the nonsupply of trucks. If , as there should be, there are penalty clauses in the company's contract, they should be enforced at once, but I ask is it not possible to obtain from the Government of New South Wales waggons that would do what is needed ? I was for a number of years connected with the railway service, and know that there are usually many waggons available which, though not fit for main-line traffic, would serve for the construction of a new railway.",32
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am afraid that the New South Wales authorities have not enough rolling-stock for their own need.,33
119,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"There are but no trucks, at Kalgoorlie.",33
120,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"There arerails and sleepers stored up there, but no waggons to convey them along the route of the proposed line. I suggest the borrowing, not of new rolling-stock, but of old waggons. It is to the New South Wales Government that application should be made, because the railway gauge of that State is the same as that of the transcontinental line. It is stated in the Prime Minister's memorandum that the proposals in Admira l Henderson's report will be generally adhered to, bu t the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs told me, in answer to a question, that it is intended to stop all work in connection with the base at Cockburn Sound, except surveying and boring. Information received from Western Australia, however, shows that surveyors have been put off, and that one or two of the boring plants have been stopped. It has been said during the debate that Captain Clarkson runs the Naval Board. Is it possible that he is responsible for this stoppage of work at Cockburn Sound? Admiral Henderson, on page 12 of his report, says, "" Port Western is a very good harbour, and u n t i l Cockburn Sound (Fremantle), which is f ar more important from a strategical point of view, is ready, it should be utilized by the Western Division as one of its principal anchorages."" He advises, too, that "" the harbour of Cockburn Sound, in cluding Owen's Anchorage and Jervoise Bay, should be examined thoroughly, as soon as possible, by experts.""",33

I agree with those who have said that this question of the naval policy of the Commonwealth should be above mere party politics, and I assure the House that I have no intention of dealing with it from a party point of view. I wish only to say that, on the evidence available, the Government were not justified in stopping the work in connection with the Cockburn Sound Naval Base at the present juncture. According to miral Henderson, there is ample work that could be undertaken, and complete plans should be available. I read with some concern a statement made at Bunbury on 5th March last by the present Treasurer, that the Liberal party believed in the promotion of Australian defence on the lines of Imperial co-operation. Whilst I recognise that Imperial co-operation may involve the question of the co-operation have of the vessels of the British and Australian Navies once the latter are built and are manned by Australian seamen, it seemed to me that the right honourable gentleman's utterance was a rather cryptic one.",34
142,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is the policy of the Liberal party.,34
143,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"The right honourable member's interjection confirms my suspicion that, after all, honourable members opposite are proposing to revert to the old order of things; that they are going back to the days when we paid a subsidy to Great B r it a in ; and that, instead When the of pushing on with the construction of the Australian Navy and its necessary corollary, the construction of naval bases, there is going to be a cessation of work, and that there is doubt whether a naval base will ever be constructed.",34
144,Mr BURNS,Unknown,"That , perhaps, is the reason why the Government have stopped the work at Cockburn Sound.",34
145,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"That is what I fear. honourable My opponent at the recent general election heard a rumour that the naval base was to be removed to Albany. We all admit that Albany is au excellent harbour, and has served its purpose very well. But one of the reasons why A d miral Henderson made his recommendaThe A d - tion in favour of Jervoise Bay was that the proposed dock should be available also As every one from Western Australia knows, the port of Fremantle is immeasurably more used as than is Albany, and it is only natural, therefore, that he should have tried to get a site as close as possible to Fremantle, in order that the dock may be of advantage to both the Navy and the merchant service. I should like the Government to be perfectly frank in regard to their proposals affecting the Cockburn Sound Naval Base. They should tell us exactly what is in their minds, and give rcs a definite statement on the subject. I have listened with a great deal of attention to' this debate, and have been much i m A d - pressed by different speakers. I i those who have preceded me will pardon a new man for indulging in a few criticisms, I should like to refer to some of them. The honourable member for Calare this morning referred to the Fusion which took place some four years ago, and said that all who then agreed to amalgamate their forces were Liberals. I could not wondering whether that statement accepted at its face value, because I have a rather distinct recollection that there were among the parties to the Fusion who had most bitterly opposed each other, even on questions other than the Tariff. The same honourable member said that the system of absentee voting was a good and that it would receive his support. was delighted to hear this frank admisthis sion on his part, because we have had the newspapers filled day after day with of the absentee voting system. that when the question of electoral reform comes before the House we shall have the assistance of the honourable member for respect. Calare in retaining the absentee voting facilities of the Act. The honourable member made allusion to the representabe tion of rural districts, and, apparently, he does not recognise the necessity maintaining the principle of one vote one value. I believe that all sections of the community are entitled to the fairest best representation i u this Chamber; I am not prepared, however, to give votes to areas of land and not to individuals. The same honourable member referred to the note issue, and, if my memory serves me aright, expressed the opinion that legislation in connection therewith was ""rotten."" May I remind honourable members that the Treasurer, when speakorable ing in Western Australia, and, also, I lieve, in this House, has stated that note issue was an idea of the Liberal vernment, and that it had been "" filched"" by his successors.",34
146,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is right.,35

153,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Probably so. In view of some of the remarks of the honmember for Robertson I have made beinquiries, to satisfy my own curiosity, as the to how many on this side of the House Goacknowledge Australia as their native place, and I find that of such men we have a majority.",35
154,Mr RILEY,Unknown,The poor men cannot be sympathize blamed for that !,35
155,Mr MCWILLIALIS,Unknown,"At any rate, they with can take no credit for it .",35
156,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Perhaps not, but I may say that I am Australian born, to and I am proud of the fact. We were the told by the honourable member for Dampier that the members of the Labour party had to do what their "" masters told to do,"" or words to that effect, and in support of his statement he quoted the Vanguard, a publication issued is in Western Australia during the last to State election. The honourable member also mentioned a late member of bhis and House as having written that what the Labour party had prepared in the way of a platform' they could amend, and that the amended platform would become binding on every Labour member.",35
157,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The platform , or alteration of it .",36
158,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"That is exactly where the honourable member and I part company. Before I became a candidate at the last election I signed a certain definite platform; and I am not going to alter that platform in any shape or form - and I say this straight out-until there is another election, and I once more go before the people. It is on these points that we have the misrepresentation.",36
159,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I quoted other persons, and did not give my own opinion.",36
160,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"I am giving facts, and every honourable member on this side will support me. The honourable member for Dampier went on to speak of the independence of members on the Liberal side, whom he declared weie controlled by no Caucus. I wonder whether the honourable member for Dampier remembers an old colleague of his in the Western Australian Parliament, because I feel tempted to mention an incident connected with that gentleman and the tions in May last. The gentleman I refer to represented Claremout in the local Parliament-the honourable member for Dampier will know to whom I refer-and he told me that the old bogey of the Labour "" Caucus"" did not hold water ;is between members of Parliament, and that he personally had been carpeted by his own party four times in one session for statements he had made in the House.",36
161,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Is he a Liberal ?,36
162,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Yes. Further, prior to the last State elections in Western Australia there was a Redistribution of Seats Bill introduced, and, when it was before the House, a member was carried in on his sick bed in order to vote. The point I wish to emphasize, however, is that the whole question of the alteration of the boundaries of the State electorates was fixed up at a Liberal Caucus meeting. It has to be said, however, that the whole question was discussed during the State elections, and that the Government responsible for the redistribution did not retain the confidence of the people. The honourable member for Dampier referred to the Electoral Act as being a bad one from beginning to end. It occurred to me that the honourable member might have been referring to the whole Act , or, perhaps, to only the amendments during last session. He was not clear on the point; but if he meant any the whole Act , then those who preceded us in this Parliament must have been sadly lacking in common sense and the knowledge of affairs. The Electoral Act now in force is built on foundations laid as far back as 1902. There has been a great deal of debate on the question of preference to unionists. I believe that when men have given the best part of their lives to trade unionism, and have devoted the whole of their time to it , and been consistent in their work, they are entitled to preference in their employment. As I have followed the debate, the whole question appears to hinge oil two things-preferenc e granted by the President of the Arbitration Court, and the preference in reference to casual employment mentioned by lionorable members on this side of the House. I cannot understand how any one can bring forward an argument to exclude rura l workers from the operation of the Act . The honourable member for Calare agrees with the benefits of organization and with unionism. In my opinion the Commonelec- wealth Arbitration Act should cover all workers throughout Australia. We have heard of the tyranny of unions, but it seems to me that there is also need to ask what of the tyranny of those opposed to trade unions. I remember that when the honourable member for Dampier was M in ister of Railways in Western Australia, his Government discharged me because I had the temerity to stand for election in connection with the State elections. The Wilson Administration in Western Australia, in 1911, discharged three railway men because they stood for parliamentary honours.",36
163,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Would not the same thing apply in the Commonwealth?,36
164,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"No , because the Commonwealth is under a different Constitution altogether. I thought the remarks of the honourable member for Dampier did not come very well from him, seeing the personal experience I had of his Administration.",36
165,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Could you attend to your work and attend to politics also 1,36
166,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"The honourable member wishes to get me on to the whole subject. A f t e r the House adjourns, I shall be glad to give him the whole history of it . The honourable member for Dampier raised the question of Wages Boards, but I may explain to the House that the honourable member is no newcomer to political life, and I have taken more notice of his utterances than I would of another honourable member similarly situated to myself. The honourable member for Dampier supports Wages Boards today, but in 1902, when the Arbitration Act was amended in Western Australia, and the whole arbitration law was before the State Parliament, the honourable member was a member of the Administration that introduced the measure.",36
167,Mr GBEGOHY,Unknown,And I supported it .,37
168,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"So I cannot understand the honourable member's position today with regard to Wages Boards. Much has been said concerning the sugar bounty and Excise. I frankly acknowledge I have had little opportunity to study the subject, but during the recent campaign I met a lady who knew a great deal about sugar, and, under her tuition , I learned much concerning it . To one who has simply heard the arguments for and against during this debate, it seems there has been a very serious blunder made. If only on the matters affecting our Naval policy and its administration, and affecting the sugar bounty and Excise, the gentlemen at present occupying the Treasury bench seem to have failed very much in their task.",37
169,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Do you not the blunder was in the Act itself 1,37
170,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"No . I consider that an appeal to the people of Australia cannot be very long delayed. shall welcome an opportunity of going before the electors who sent me here. That is a statement. I have made repeatedly since the elections, and when my friends who are members of the Cabinet today decide that they shall go to the country, I am quite prepared to go also, and see whether the electors throughout Australia will not recognise the good work of the Fisher Administration, and see that they have a sufficient majority to place those at present in charge of affairs on the lef t hand of the Speaker, and the Labour party on the right.",37
171,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [3.12] I think the debate, as far as it has gone, will serve to clear the atmosphere, and when the division is taken we will be able to proceed with business generally. It has been stated that the Prime M in [17] ister's manifesto contains a lot of matter that means the repeal of the legislation previously passed by the Labour Government. Of course, it does refer to the repeal of certain legislation, but it was the fact that the previous Government piled up legislation of an objectionable character that compelled the present Government to bring down proposals for its repeal. I believe the previous Government put up a record for legislation. In their three years of office, they passed eighty-three measures. They boast of the fact that they put up a record, and as Australia is much inclined to put up records in connection with legislation, probably they are proud of their achievement. I have been looking through the list of achieve^ ments or supposed achievements, and J can find only three matters they tackled that might be regarded as requiring the qualities of statesmanship, and those three were handled in a way that showed their want of statesmanship. The first. I shall refer to is the note issue. I have always believed that the Government of a country should control the issue of its paper money, as they are in a position to know how far it is safe to permit paper money to take the place of gold in order to preserve the stability of the nation, for which they alone are responsible. My complaint against the late Administration in conthink nexion with the note issue is that in this young country, that is continually faced with the necessity for the construction of public works, and constantly applying in I the money markets of the world for funds for that purpose, their note issue was based upon a lower gold reserve than is provided for in any other country in the world. We could not afford to make as experiment of that character. In a young country such as this, I believe it was necessary, in the interests of our national credit, to provide a higher gold reserve than would be deemed sufficient in the older countries of the world. I know of no other country in which the gold reserve for the paper currency is as low as 25 per cent. In Germany, they have the lowest reserve required in any country, with the exception of Australia, and, under Statute law, the minimum reserve there is 33 per cent., which means that considerably more than the minimum must be kept in order to prevent a violation of the law in the contingency of a sudden demand. Dealing with the banking system introduced by the last A d ministration, I believe that a Commonwealth Bank might have been established to perform great and important services for the Commonwealth. It should have been associated with the borrowing of the whole Commonwealth, and the conversion of the debts of the State, which this Parliament has a constitutional mandate to carry out. The late Government, in failing to make the conversion of the State debts an integral part and prominent feature of their banking scheme, displayed a. lack of the statesmanship necessary for the proper management of the finances of the country. Commonwealth borrowing and the conversion of the State debts formed the chief justification for bringing a Commonwealth Bank into existence, and these important matters were left out of their consideration of the question by the late Government. Mr Laird SMIT H - The honourable member admits that the bank had to be established.",37
172,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"It should have been established to carry out those great purposes, and my objection to the present Commonwealth Bank is that it has not been established on proper lines. The Government should, first of all, have entered into negotiations with the State Governments.",38
173,Mr RILEY,Unknown,They did so.,38
174,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"They did not do so until the Commonwealth Bank was estab-. lished. Then the ex-Prime Minister came down with a proposal that the State Governments rightly regarded as an insult to them. The Commonwealth Bank was so established as to interfere with the operation of the splendid banking institutions established by the State Parliaments throughout the States. Finding that the Bank was not as successful as they anticipated, the Commonwealth Government came down with a proposal to the State Governments. I gave the ex-Minister of Home Affairs credit for displaying in the banking scheme which he proposed to the Commonwealth the only evidence of statesmanship that I have been able to discover on the other side in connection with their banking proposals. His proposal was that the States should be brought into association with the Commonwealth in the establishment of a banking institution, the Commonwealth Parliament being supreme in cases of differences of opinion with the States in the management of the concern. If a banking scheme had been introduced on those lines, taking the States into partnership with the Commonwealth, I believe it would have been successful. I should not object to the Commonwealth having a predominating influence in the management of the bank on vital questions. In those circumstances we should have had the whole of the State Parliaments in association with this Parliament in dealing with the financial, problems which conf r o n t us. I venture to say that our financial problems would be much more easily handled under such a scheme than they are likely to be during the next decade under existing circumstances.",38
175,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that the State Righters would have been satisfied with such a scheme ?,38
176,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"They were never given the opportunity to say whether they would be satisfied with ib or not, and the overtures should, in the first instance, have come to them from the Commonwealth Parliament.  member know that in Sir George Turner's time the State Parliaments were against the proposal?",38
177,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I do not know how it could be said that they were. Under Sir George Turner's scheme the State Parliaments were to be asked to give over their railway properties as security.  they should borrow through the Commonwealth, and they would not agree to that.",38
178,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Si r George Turner's scheme of ten years ago should not f u r nish a precedent for the action of this Parliament for all time. I remind honourable members again that this Parliament has not yet exercised its constitutional power to bring about a consolidation of the State debts. The Constitution gives this Parliament the power to take over the State debts, with power to compel the States to pay up any deficiency of interest on those debts; and in 1910 that constitutional power was extended to enable us to take over all the State debts up to date.  member consolidate the State debts, and permit the State Parliaments to continue to borrow in London as much as they pleased ?",38
179,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I do not know that that represents a very serious objection, because I believe that if a Commonwealth bank were established in a proper and statesmanlike way, Australian consols on the London market would be so much more easily negotiated, and loans could be obtained by the Commonwealth on so much better terms than by the individual States that the various State Parliaments, in .the course of a little time, would find that it was to their interest and advantage to borrow through the Commonwealth. I did not, on rising, intend to refer at such length to ' this matter, bu t I have been drawn into the discussion of it . If the Commonwealth Bank had been established on the lines of a partnersbip between the Commonwealth and the States, it would have secured the confidence of the State Parliaments. They would have had no objection to do their business through what would be their own institution, and would offer less objection to the conversion of their debts through the Commonwealth Bank into Commonwealth stocks. is where the previous Administration lacked perception and statesmanship in dealing with a national question. Here was a magnificent opportunity for the Commonwealth and States to combine to form a great and powerful banking institution, which could deal with the conversion of the State debts, prevent overlapping of borrowing in the different States, secure a reduction of interest on loans, and deal with the whole of the financial business of both States and Commonwealth. That in itself would represent a considerable turnover to the bank, without going into every corner of the Commonwealth to compete with existing institutions which have been serving the public well. The Government have tackled another question. They propose to provide to some extent against sickness.",39
180,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,An y lodge will do that now.,39
181,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"To a limited extent, but if the honourable member were acquainted with the recent history of England, he would know that provision has been made there for a large number of people to receive the necessary assistance when they are sick.",39
182,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Would the honourable member make a scheme of that kind compulsory here ? [17]- a,39
183,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Yes , and I would make it far-reaching. This is one of the best planks in the platform of our party, and shows that the Government has some constructive ability. The maternity bonus passed by the last Government is costing the Commonwealth from £600,000 to £700,000 a year. If it had been made part of the scheme to provide for sickness, widowhood, and unemployment, probably the total expenditure from the Treasury would have been only a little over the amount that is now being paid out on account of one branch of incapacity. There was a want of statesmanship and of perspective in the policy of the late Government in this respect such as are necessary for the framing of laws to suit our complex sociological system. It has been claimed that the previous Government were responsible for carrying out the defence scheme. I do not wish to take away the credit that belongs to them in that regard, though the scheme was in itiated by the preceding Government. It was the Liberal Government of 1909 that This originated the defence scheme,' both with respect to naval policy and compulsory training. That scheme has upon it the impress of statesmanship, and I must give credit to both Governments for having carried it out as far as we have gone. There are several other questions to which I wish to allude, but perhaps it would be convenient to adjourn the debate at this time, and allow me to continue my speech on Tuesday. Leave granted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND THE MARCONI COMPANY. Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",39

Unfortunately for him, Hansard is one of those records which are kept in our cupboards.

207,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I can quote the Prime Minister's own words to show that he was not representing South Australia against the Commonwealth. The honorAttorney-General able gentleman put it that the time might come when a stage would be reached which the Commonwealth interests would be involved. But, in the case of the - coni Company, the Commonwealth inSouth terests are already involved.",41
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The case I referred to was an actual concrete one which was then being dealt with.,41
209,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"And this is an actual same concrete case which is now being dealt that with. The Prime Minister went on to nayI expected some such objection as that from honourable members seated on the Corner benches, and it has come. Surely the Attorney General might have been left to make that kind of apology. He called upon the Attorney-General to apologize for the position in which he found himself as the result of expressing an opinion as the representative of the 'South Australian Government on the himself Murray waters question. He further saidIt is quite clear, however, that he cannot be our legal watch-dog, and at the same time the legal watch-dog of the South Australian Government. Can the present Attorney-General be the legal watch-dog of the Commonwealth, and at the same time be liable to be called upon to render service to the Marconi Company ?",41
210,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,The honourable member does not understand the position.,41
211,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I have understood too much about it for the Attorney-General.,41
212,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,It is so obvious that the honourable member does not understand it.,41

216,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,He withdrew it at the time.,41
217,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"How very anxious the honourable member is. There is not the slightest doubt that there are quite a number of honourable members occupying seats in the Ministerial corner who are not as prepared to endorse the attitude of the in this connection. The Prime Minister affirmed, on the occasion at to which I have referred, that the Attorney-General could not be the legal Marwatch-dog of the Commonwealth and of Australia-that he could not occupy the dual position. He further saidIt is quite clear that the Attorney-General cannot be for us against South Australia, and for South Australia against us, at one and the time, unless he has a dual personality like of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. I know that at times lawyers do very strange things, but I think that we should keep the domains of these functions very clear, and should see that our law officers are in a condition of absolute independence. Does he endorse those sentiments today?",41
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Absolutely !,41
219,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Then the Prime Minister must be in a very restless frame of mind when he meets some of his colleagues in Cabinet. He further saidThe honourable and learned member has bound by oath to guard the judicial power of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, he should not be retained by a Government whose interests may conflict at any given point of time with those of the Commonwealth. He should not be ''retained""-that , is the word upon which the present Attorney-General places so much reliance. In the case of Mr Isaacs, that gentleman was not engaged in Court, because, as a matter of fact, the question of the Murray waters has never come before a Court, although it has been the subject of many conferences. These are the views which were expressed by the Prime Minister when dealing with his case. But today he is not prepared to turn round and say to his majority, "" I do not approve of your action in being associated with these banking, insurance, and Marconi cases.""",41

223,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,If the language does not correctly convey what the honourable gentleman meant he had an opportunity of correcting his proof. Why does he find out seven years afterwards that it is not correct? It is an extraordinary thing that when these points are being made against him it is always the newspaper reporter or Hansard that is wrong.,42
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am not blaming anybody. I simply say that the historic fact is that they had accepted briefs.,42

230,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Oh ; I beg pardon. I understood that you did.,42
231,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I said that an opportunity for me to make a statement waff denied twice, and that I was not going to beg for an opportunity.

If I were to speak for a week I could He has not bring a more emphatic indictment against the position of the present Attorney-General than the indictment which fell from the lips of the Prime Minister when he was in opposition. He cannot be said to be free so long as he is in the pay of a State Government. Can the honourable gentleman say that his Attorney-General is free so long as he is in the pay of the Marconi Company?",42
232,Mr KELLY,Unknown,There is a difference between accepting a brief and accepting a retainer.,42
233,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Minister s are as silent as the Sphinx, but we shall have them as gentle as cooing doves before we are finished with this business.",42
234,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Because you and the Prime Minister happen to agree for once, that does not show that you are not both wrong.",42
235,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"We shall attribute that generous remark to the modesty of my honourable friend. I cannot leave off quoting the Prime Minister, because he puts the position better than I could do. He said I assure honourable members that the statement which I saw in the newspapers last week was the first intimation that I had of the facts, and I do not hesitate to say that if I had known that Senator Sir Josiah Symon, when Attorney General, had been retained by the South Australian Government in such a matter, I should have instantly brought it under the notice of the House. That was a case of accepting a retainer, being exactly similar to the position in which the honourable gentleman finds his Attorney-General today. There is nogetting away from that fact. Let me say here that, BO far as anything that, falls from my lips is concerned, the honour of the Attorney-General or the honour of Mr Justice Isaacs is not in volved. I assure my honourable friend opposite that his personal integrity and probity I am not questioning for a - moment. I am dealing with the principle of whether a man can serve two ^masters, and I say that he cannot, and that the Attorney-General's position is intolerable. The Prime Minister went on to sayThe moment that I saw this announcement the newspapers, I. decided to bring the fore the House, and, in the discharge of what I conceive to be an obligation upon my part, I am making these remarks. ""In my judgment, however, he cannot simultaneously accept payment from a State Government and from the Federal authorities, and retain his independence absolutely. It is not often that I do agree with the honourable gentleman, but on this question we are at one. He also saidIn bringing this question under the notice of 'honourable members. I feel that I am discharging - a simple duty- a duty in the interests of the purity of the administration of the judicial - powers of the Commonwealth. The honourable gentleman was really better on the point than is Mr Asquith. Speaking on the same question, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs saidThat, obviously, refines his case down to a - consideration of whether the Attorney-General tinueddid or did not know or think, at the time he accepted his retainer, that the Commonwealth would eventually be brought into conflict with the State of South Australia upon this matter. He uses the simple and only defence of the Attorney-General, that it is only a retainer.",42
236,Mr CONROY,Unknown,What page of Hansard are you reading from?,43
237,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I am reading from page 1342.,43
238,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Of what year?,43
239,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I shall give the honourable member the marked passages in a minute. That will save him a lot of trouble, and, if it will keep him quiet, I shall be well repaid.",43
240,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,You might give the pages before you conclude your speech.,43
241,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I started by quoting from the Prime Minister's speech, on page 1329 of Hansard for the 23rd August, 1905. On page 1342, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs is reported as having saidBut when the Committee are entering upon a - debate of supreme constitutional importance, it is at least due to us that he should obtain and render all the help that he possibly can. Apparently, Mr Isaacs was where the Attorney-General frequently is-in the Courts. I do not propose to labour this question much further. I have quoted the remarks of the Prime Minister pretty fully. I shall now read a few little gems of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, who was not satisfied with having one in attack at the Attorney-General on that facts beday. In a second speech he saidin order to take our attention from the fact that the Attorney-General has accepted from the State of South Australia what practically amounts to an office of profit.",43
242,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Will you deny that every still single member of the Labour party supported the honourable member for Parramatta on that occasion?,43
243,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Ver y likely a number of them did. For he has been asked to give an opinion on matters connected with the control of the navigation of the rivers of the Commonwealth; and he will be paid for that opinion in hard solid coin of the realm. The honourable gentleman always did have his eye on the main chance. It is not surprising that he and Mr Isaacs were in agreement on that question. He conThe Attorney-General is paid, as Attorney General, a certain salary-and no one is better worth it than he-for the discharge of certain services to the Commonwealth, and when the House demands that he shall attend to explain his actions he has no right to stay away. There is a nice dictum to come from honourable gentlemen opposite, who want pairs. They'do not preach a theory now. Our distinguished friend, the late member for Robertson, Mr Henry Willis, made some remarks on the question; but, as he is politically extinct, it does not matter what he said. The Prime Minister finished up the debate",43
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Are you going to let us go home?,43
245,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the honourable gentleman had got his followers - to give me an opportunity this morning, all this would have been over now.",43
246,Mr JOSEPH CQOK,Unknown,"I did my best, and you did get an opportunity.",43
247,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"This is what the Prime Minister said towards the conclusion of the debate, he being the last) sr but oneI would point out that this is a matter that should not be left to the sense of honour of the Attorney-General. Apparently, in this case, he thinks matter should be left to the sense honour of the Attorney-General.",43
248,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What did the honourable member for Wide Bay say on that sion ?,44
249,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The honourable memadvice, ber can read the speech for himself. I have been at pains enough to go through his speech, and that of his Prime Minismore, ter. To continue the quotationI t is a question for the House to determine. The Attorney-General is a servant of Parliament. In this case an exception is to be made",44
250,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,The honourable member has that for the fourth time.,44
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I shall say it for the fifth time if I think fit. I advise the General to be a little less impertinent. The Prime Minister was as courteous then as he is today. Time has not altered him. To continueIt is not sufficient for the Attorney-General say that he will retire from the position he now occupies if he finds that a conflict of interests likely to occur. We know that he is a perfect martyr to duty. The action of the present Attorneyopinion General in keeping a retainer from the Marconi Company could not be more dereceive cidedly condemned than it is in the code of rules of positive obligation laid down by the British Prime Minster, the fifth of which readsNo Minister ought to accept any kind favour from persons who are negotiating with or seeking to enter into contractual or pecuniary relations with the Government. The Marconi Company desires to enter into contractual relations with the Government, and the Attorney-General, pression. by reason of his acceptance of a general retaining fee from the company, is re has ceiving pecuniary assistance from it. He stoodtothesay. has recognised the 'difficulty of his position by transferring the business concerning the actual litigation between the company and the Commonwealth to the Minso ister of External Affairs; but may, at any time, bring before the Cabinet a proposal involving payment from the Treasury, and the Attorneyable General, by reason of his association the company, will not be a free agent, and unbiased, in dealing with any such proposal. He received the confidence of the company when he was advocating its claims against the Commonwealth, and is not, and cannot, be free where the comspecial pany's interests are concerned. He is also a director of a bank which is working the opposition to the Commonwealth Bant. of As Attorney-General, he is the Commonwealth's chief law adviser respecting legislation for the general control of banks; occathe management of the Commonwealth Bank, and the note issue. But in giving his private interests as director of a bank must come into direct conflict with his duty to the Commonwealth. Furtherbeing a director of an insurancecompany, his private interests will conflict with his duty when he is called upon to> advise on proposals for the amendment of the law relating to insurance generally, or for the consolidation of the Statutessaid of the States into one Commonwealth law. His position is condemned by the first Attorneyand fifth of the rules framed by theBritish Prime Minister, apparently to meet a case of this description. It cannot have the approval of his Prime Minister, if that gentleman holds the same views now that he expressed so vigorously to a few years ago, when Mr Justice Isaacsis was Attorney-General. Under these circumstances, the invitation that the At torney-General has extended to test the of honourable members generally regarding his position is one that should the endorsement of his supporters.",44
252,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Flinders-Attor ney-General) [4.1] - I shall not detainhonorable members more than a few moments. The honourable member for of Kalgoorlie said that he did not impugn my honour and integrity, but his speech was couched in the form of a deliberate personal attack. Every word, phrase, and tone that he used conveyed that imWhether he has - wilfully blinded himself to the 'true position, or spoken out of pure ignorance, I leave him He has wilfully misundermorning. explanation which I gave this",44
253,Mr FKAZEK,Unknown,"I am sorry that I wasgenerous, now that the honourable memthe latter ber talks in that way.",44
254,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"The honourable member's idea of generosity is a remarkone. I shall show how, to support with the arguments which he used, he presented a distorted version of the facts. This morning, and on a previous occasion, I explained the position of a barrister whoholds a general retainer. I pointed out. that a general retainer differs from a retainer in that it does not put upon the holder any obligation to advise, in or accept a brief from, or to act in any way for, the person who gives it . I repeat that. I have shown exactly what a general retainer is. It is a fee paid to a barrister in order that the person who pays it may receive notice from him of any contrary brief that he may get. A general retainer imposes no obligation upon the person who accepts it to do anything on behalf of the person who gives i - except to notify him, should it be necessary, of the offer of a contrary brief. Tho honourable member for Kalgoorlie has spoken of serving two masters. At the present time, I serve only one master, the Commonwealth, and am concerned only with the interests of the country. I am not concerned with the interests of the Marconi Company, and am under no obligation to that company, except to give it notice should a brief in an action against them be sent to me. Let me now inform the House of the facts of the case on which the Prime Minister spoke, on the occasion referred to by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. There was no question of a general retainer then. The point was whether Mr Justice Isaacs, who was at the time Attorney-General, could, in accordance with his duty, tender advice, and give an opinion on a certain matter to the Government of South Australia. He was asked to, and did, give an opinion in connection with a matter which the present Prime Minister not unreasonably thought might embarrass him in dealing with the rights the Commonwealth respecting the navigation problem which then existed. Mr Isaacs pointed out that, although lie was asked to give an opinion with regard to South Australia's navigation relations with the Commonwealth, he declined to do so; that he gave an opinion to the Government of South Australia with regard to its relations with Victoria, but not in respect to navigat i o n , for the reason that the giving of - such an opinion might embarrass him in forming an opinion, as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, on a matter brought into clear conflict between South Australia and the Commonwealth. I am .going to cite the language used by Mr . Isaacs on that occasion, and to adopt it as justifying completely the position that I at present adopt. I refer honourable members to Hansard, ' vol. XXVI . , page .1376. The honourable member .goorlie, in picking out certain sentences fro m the language used on that occasion by my honourable friend the Prime M in ister, chose to omit entirely the statement of the case made by the only honourable member then present who knew the whole of the facts, the whole of the law, and the code of honour relating to these matters. Mr Isaacs said I can have no justification for refusing to give t , my advice and opinion to the Government of South Australia unless I can offer them some fair recognised reason for that refusal. But if my position in regard to that State were to bring me ever so slightly, or by any possibility, into conflict with my duty as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, the State of South Australia would have to stand aside, so far as I was concerned. . . . Honourable members will recognise that it must be a strong feeling of duty that impels me to accept a retainer from South Australia in a case against Victoria, the State to which I belong. The position occupied by counsel at the Bar is a public one. He must not pick and choose his clients. When a client offers him a retainer, unless he has some fair and justifiable reason for refusing it , he is bound to give him his assistance as well as he can. In these circumstances, I was compelled to accept the retainer of the South Australian Government, and unless, as I say, the paramount duty that I owe to the Commonwealth is imperilled, or may be imperilled- I shall go as far as that- I have no right to reject that retainer, and do not intend to do so With regard to the position of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, I wish to repeat that if at any moment it appears to me possible that a question may bring me into conflict with my duty as Attorney-General, or if at any moment it appears to me possible that my opinions in the future, which I am bound to tender to the Government of the Commonwealth, of may be adccted by anything I do with regard to the South Australian, or any other case, my duty as Attorney-General must prevail, and everything else will have to go. I repeat and adopt every word of that language, and have only to add that that position was accepted to the full by every honourable member then present who is now sitting on the Opposition side of the House.",44
255,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Werriwa) [4.10] - I wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie was correct in saying that I objected to his making a statement this morning. I asked whether it was an attack or a personal explanation that he desired to make,, and he declined to give me an answer. Notwithstanding that, however, I withdrew my objection.",45
256,Mr TUDOH,Unknown,After objecting twice.,45
257,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Did the honourable member for Werriwa think that I was going for K a l - on my knees to him ?,45
258,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"It is not a matter of the honourable member going on his knees; but if that is a position he cares to assume, it has nothing to do with me. I did withdraw the objection. The honourable member for Wentworth went across to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and when the latter looked towards me, I nodded my head, so that there is no doubt that he thoroughly understood that the withdrawal was made. When this similar case did arise, and the present Prime Minister used language concerning the honourable member for Indi , I , although a supporter of the present Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition",45
259,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,He was not the Leader of the Opposition.,46
260,Mr CONROY,Unknown,He was the leader.,46
261,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,No ; he was not.,46
262,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"At all events, although I was then on the same side as the present Prime Minister, and as strongly opposed as any man in the House to the party to which the honourable member for Indi belonged, I felt bound in justice to that honourable member to give him my support. Even when Mr . Isaacs was giving his reasons I jected, and pointed out why no counsel is allowed to refuse a retainer. The son is that parties may be prejudiced the refusal of counsel to take up their case, and we can easily see what harm might arise if there were liberty to refuse morning. retainers when offered. This retainer was offered to the present Attorney-General three or four years ago, and we are asked to say that, on becoming a member of this House, he ought to have declined the retainer, because some case might arise in which he was interested. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who was at that time studying law, ought surely to have learnt the first part of a barrister's duty, which is to look after his fee; but, apparently, he had not even grasped the meaning of a retainer. It would seem, however, that he did understand the position, for on looking at the division list I find that he voted on behalf of the present Attorney-General. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has not given reason why he has since changed his dealing with it . views, and, until he does so, he cannot expect us to believe that his action dictated by other than political motives; and, under the circumstances, he cannot be regarded as sincere. The present ment. Leader of the Opposition, when speaking on that occasion, saidHonorable members bait a Minister, and then,, if he will not do exactly what they want, they direct the whole strength of their forces against, him and the Ministry with which he is connected. What Government, and what Minister, would be worth supporting who would conciliate an Opposition which had pursued tactics of that kind ? They first use every parliamentary means. tohumiliate the Minister in the eyes of the House and of the public, and then, because he will not concede the points which they wish to gain, they take the most extreme course open to them. I do not know what view the other members of the Labour party take, but I trust that they hold the opinion in regard to this matter that I hold, and will vote against the amendment. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie so absolutely believed every word of that deputy portion of the speech that he voted with the honourable member for Wide Bay.",46
263,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [4.16] - It is unfortunate that this morning this matter was debated in a most controversial manner, when there was no opportunity to thoroughly discuss it . It is a bigger question than one involving merely the position of the Government.",46
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,If it is so big a question why should it be brought up on. interthe adjournment of the House ?,46
265,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The adjournment isreathe only opportunity presented to the by honourable member for Kalgoorlie to make any reply to the very pungent and bitter remarks of the Attorney-General this.. Mr W . H . IRVINE - B it t e r ?,46
266,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes , though the At torney-General may not be conscious of ' the warmth he put into his remarks this; morning. This is a matter of more far reaching consequence than any chargeagainst the Attorney-General or against the Government. It has to be determined', by this, and every other Government,. how far Ministers are at liberty to act in their private capacity in such a way as: may at certain periods cause conflict between their professional or private in terests and those of the Crown. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member knows that such a question can any only be decided on a motion directly",46
267,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It can be dealt with was in a non-party spirit altogether.. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Not in the middle of the discussion of a no-confidence amend- ,46
268,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member does not think, I hope Mr W. H . IEVINE - The question was raised yesterday by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, though it is not connected with or relevant to the no-confidence amendment; and I take it that if the question is to be discussed, it ought to be put into proper shape, and the House permitted to decide it .",47
269,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Quite so; X have never had any other idea. My rejoinder to the Attorney-General's last statement is that nearly all such questions are raised during a debate of .no-confidence, but I agree that this question cannot be properly decided in the heat of party conflict, which is another matter altogether. The question immediately before us is an abstract one dealing with the rights and privileges, and the honour and integrity, of members of this House and of the Government, and our object is to safeguard the interests of Parliament. The question cannot be decided on a proposed amendment on the Address-in-Reply, but it can be decided as a matter of procedure. Honourable members on both sides may see fit by a large majority to say certain rules shall be by this Parliament and Government now and in the future. I think the issue is bigger than party. The honourable member for Werriwa has left the chamber. He quoted part of my remarks on this question; but there are other parts of my remarks just preceding which I wish to - quote, from page 1379 of Hansard of the 33rd August, 1905.. I remarked that the honourable member for North Sydney proposed not to vote for the motion. Hansard proceeds",47
270,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,He admits that there is nothing wrong.,47
271,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member for North Sydney stated that he would not vote for the amendment.,47
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Bu the said distinctly that he thought the Attorney-General ought not to accept any more retainers.,47
273,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"He said most clearly that he thought it would be an error of judgment on the part of the Attornev-General if he renewed his retainer. I also held the opinion that it would be a distinct error of judgment on the part of the Attorney-General if he renewed his retainer; and I wish to say now, the attack having been made in that way, that I said exactly then as I Bay now, that it is a matter that cannot be settled on a party issue. It was unfortunate it was raised this morning in the way it was, and I am sure the Attorney-General, when he thinks of it calmly, will regret that, on a question of privilege, he made a statement prejudicing the whole matter, and compelling the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to raise it again on the first opportunity. When an honourable member is attacked by a gentleman occupying the most prominent legal position in the Commonwealth, he must necessarily make some rejoinder.",47
274,Mr GROOM,Unknown,-The Attorney-General was merely replying to an attack made on him yesterday.,47
275,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It was more than that. The Attorney-General addressed himself to this question for twenty-five minutes, and used the scimitar here and there in the nicest language, but in many oases with bitter thrusts at the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. The Attorney General may not know it , but honourable members are aware of the ability of the Attorney-General to do this,, and there are ways of doing it without shouting very loudly. I do not think the matter can that rest here, now that it has come on; but observed it is bigger than party, and bigger than individual issues, and really concerns the House, and may only be finally decided as .a non-party question. My last wordB are that the Government cannot accuse the Opposition of being unduly partisan in this and other matters. I have been in the House since the first meeting of this Parliament, and I have never known such bitter and biting statements as have been made from the Government side this session.",47
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [4.25] - From what I have heard of my speech on the occasion referred to, I see no reason to withdraw the substance of the .argument used by me. I think it expressed the correct attitude. The distinction that I see between that matter and the present one is very plain. At that time, the then Attorney-General was in the pay of the Government of South Australia with respect to the dispute over the Murray waters, and he had a brief from the South Australian Government, and received payment.",47
277,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,It was merely a dispute between two States.,47
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I took the point that at any moment the Commonwealth might be brought into that question.,48
279,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The Commonwealth is in this case.,48
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And the present Attorney-General has cut the connection between himself and the Marconi Company absolutely, He has returned his brief and cut the connection, That was not the case with respect to the Attorney-General on the previous occasion.",48
281,Mr FBAZEK,Unknown,But the Attorney General says that he is still getting a general retaining fee.,48
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I say the connection has been cut completely, so far as that litigation is concerned, which differentiates the present case from the one in question. On that occasion, honourable members now in Opposition agreed that the Attorney-.General could do anything he liked, because they all voted solidly with him. The ex-Minister of Trade and Customs was one of those who counted the division on that occasion, the honourable member for Barrier voted, and so did the honourable member for Kennedy, and everything was right as right could be then; but now everything is as wrong as wrong can be.",48
283,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,How did you vote on that occasion 1,48
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I voted for the motion. The matter was only taken as one of censure by the then Attorney General ; but I made it very clear that we were not anxious to attack the Government for it . We never thought of such a thing as want of confidence in submitting the motion.,48
285,Mr FBAZER,Unknown,But you divided on it .,48
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We divided to mark our sense of the conduct of the then Attorney-General in taking fees and in being actively engaged in connection with a matter concerning State Governments which might bring him into conflict with his own Government. That is a position that ought not to exist anywhere or at any time. I take the same view today. But the present Attorney-General has completely severed his connection with this litigation, and is, therefore, in an entirely different position from that of the At torney-General at that time. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.28 p.m.",48
