1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I wish to inform the House that I have this day received the .resignation by the Right Honourable Sir , Edmund Barton of his seat for the Electoral Division of Hunter. I find that (1) If a. iwrit were issued forthwith and the shortest. reasonableperiod allowed between the issue of the writ and the nominations and between the nominations and the polbng, it is almost certain that the session would have been concluded and the dissolution have become imminent before the new member could have been elected. (2) The franchise at such election would be quite unlike that under which the election following the dissolution would be held. (3) Considerable expense would be caused to the Commonwealth and trouble to the electors of the division, with no appreciable advantage to either. Therefore, I do not, as at present advised, propose to issue a writ under existing circumstances. DISSOLUTIO N OF PARLIAMENT .",12
2,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown,Can the Prime Minister intimate to the House when Parliament will be prorogued with a view to its dissolution ?,13
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,As soon as it has completed its business.,13
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I should be very glad if you, Mr Speaker, would explain how you know that the dissolution of Parliament will take place at an early date. My views on the subject are quite opposed to those of the majority of honourable members, and if an opportunity could be afforded I should like to discuss the question. I know thing about the probability solution, and I do not think any other honourable member does.",13
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have adopted the course which I have announced because it is a matter of common understanding that the prorogation and consequent dissolution of Parliament are not far distant, but, should facts turn out to be otherwise, I shall, immediately upon becoming aware of the circumstances, issue a writ for. the election of a new member to serve in the place of the Right Honourable Sir Edmund Barton. I am not precluded from doing that.",13
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"May I ask that an opportunity shall be afforded to discuss the matter ? The members of this House were elected in May, 1901, and therefore the term of three years for which they were elected does not expire until next May.",13
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I cannot conceive of any opportunity which I could make for such a discussion, and it is difficult to see how a general discussion as to when Parliament will be dissolved could take place. PACIF IC CAB LE CONFERENCE.",13
8,Mr LE GROOM,Unknown,Can the Prime Minister give the House further information in respect to the proposed conference with the Pacific Cable Board ?,13
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have received another cable message from Great Britain in relation to the proposal, and judge from its contents that it will be necessary to hold a Conference.",13
10,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Has the honourable gentleman any objection to laying the cablegram upon the table of the House ?,13
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I will lay it upon the table of the House with the other papers on the subject, when the correspondence is complete.",13
12,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Before the close of the session ?,13
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes . GENERAL ELECTIONS.  decided to hold the elections for the new House of Representatives upon the day upon which the Senate elections are held ?,13
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I am about to communicate with the Governments of the States to noask what date they propose tofixfor the of an early disSenate elections.,13
15,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman suggest that a common date shall be fixed?,13
16,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I may do so, although, as the honourable member is aware, the Governments of the States are, under the Constitution, independent of the Commonwealth Government in respect to the Senate elections.",13
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is it the intention of the Government that the elections of the House of Representatives and of the Senate shall be held concurrently ?,13
18,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When I have ascertained from the Governments of the States - what day they propose to fix for the Senate elections, I shall be able to announce to honourable members our intentions in regard to the elections for the House of Representatives.",13
19,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think that the honourable gentleman should make that announcement how, in view of what has been said by Mr. Speaker. ELECTORAL ROLLS.",13
20,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister for Home Affairs a question upon a subject in regard to which I have already conferred with him. Will he be good enough to say whether the Federal electoral rolls for Victoria have all been printed and distributed for exhibition as prescribed? Have the appointments of Divisional Officers and Registrars been made ? If not, when does the right honourable gentleman expect to make them ? Will he cause a set of rolls to be exhibited at each of the metropolitan railway stations in addition to the places prescribed ? What will be the cost of a complete set of rolls for each division 1",14
21,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"All the rolls for the State of Victoria have been printed, and the rolls for sixteen divisions have been exhibited. The rolls for the remaining seven divisions will be exhibited before the end of the week. The appointments about which the honourable member asks have not yet been made, but I hope to make them within a few days. W it h regard to the honourable member's suggestion that the rolls should be exhibited at the metropolitan railway stations,- I should like to know whether he means the whole of the rolls for the State, or that at each station the roll for the division in which that station is situated shall be exhibited ?",14
22,Mr KNOX,Unknown,The whole of the rolls.,14
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I think it would be rather confusing to the public to exhibit the whole of the rolls at each station, but I shall be glad to confer with the honourable member upon the subject. The cost of a complete set of rolls has been fixed at 5s. for each division in the Commonwealth.",14
24,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Is the Minister aware that no forms of claim to vote have accompanied the rolls which have tributed for inspection ? Will he take steps to see that proper forms of claim are issued with the rolls, so that those who find that their names have been omitted will be able to sign and send in these forms to the proper quarters ?",14
25,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It was promised some time ago that forms of claim would be sent to every post-office.,14
26,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Non e have been issued in my district, and application been made to me upon the subject.",14
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I will look into the matter, and have it attended to. FEDERALCAPITAL SITE.",14
28,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"Hav e the Government decided to carry out the promise of the late Prime Minister with respect to the publication of the minutes, evidence, and other information compiled by the Capital Sites Commission ? If so, when will copies of the document be available for honourable members and the public generally ?",14
29,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The information was to have been ready yesterday or the day before. I shall inquire why it has not been circulated. NAVIGATION BILL.,14
30,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the NavigationBill to be introduced next session will provide for the exercise of the Federal power to maintain the navigability of interState rivers ?,14
31,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As the honourable and learned member is aware, there are about 600 clauses in the first departmental draft of the Navigation Bill. W it h the exception of those portions of the Bill which relate to coastal trade, and a few other matters to which my attention has been directed, I have not closely considered the measure, and am not able therefore to say specifically whether the Bill as drawn includes any provision of the character to which the honourable and learned member refers. But certainly the matter referred to is one which will require some consideration when the Bill is being revised.",14
32,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Do the Government propose to make provision for dealing with the matter in some Bill ?,14
33,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The matter to which the honourable and learned member refers will require consideration when the draft been disof the Bill is being revised. HIGH COURT : FIRST SITTING. "" Mr CROUCH - I ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been called to the fact that a large number of the members of the inter-State Bar have expressed a desire to be present at the swearing-in of the Judges of the High Court, and the holding of their first Court, and whether, in the circumstances, he can see his way to make the ceremony a public one, to take has place on the Wednesday, instead of the Tuesday, so that a number of honourable members of this House who are interested may have an opportunity to be present ?",14
34,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The character of the judicial office is such that public display or ceremonial other than that of a professional character is generally considered foreign. An opportunity will be afforded, I have no doubt, to members of the Bar to exchange the usual courtesies with the Bench when its members first take their seats.",15
35,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Will that be on the Wednesday or the Tuesday?,15
36,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Probably on either Monday or Tuesday.,15
37,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Why not Wednesday ?,15
38,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The question is whether any business which may require to be transacted should be delayed - for the purpose suggested ; but possibly a day or two would not matter. When the Judges of the High Court take their place upon the Bench, I hope and believe that the usual reciprocal exchange of courtesies will take place. But, beyond that, it seems to me scarcely a fitting thing in connection with the judicial office to import any feature which might be considered to be in any way of a political, not to say party, character. . NA AGRICULTUR E.",15
39,Sir JOHN QUICK,NATIONALDEPARTMENT OP,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he thinks there is any chance of resuming the debate on a resolution submitted by me to this House on the 28th June, 1901, in favour of the establishment of a national Department of Agriculture, and, if not, whether the honourable gentleman will consider the advisableness of formulating a scheme of the nature indicated for submission to the electors at the next Federal elections 1",15
40,Mr DEAKIN,NATIONALDEPARTMENT OP,"The proposal of my honourable and learned friend is one which has always had, and still has, my entire sympathy. I believe the subject is one which is bound to engage the attention of the Government and of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. NA  of the Prime Minister to the amendment of Public Service Regulation No. 149, carried in another place, and involving an increase of Is. per day in the travelling allowance provided for officers in the general division. I wish to ask the honourable and learned gentleman whether it is the intention of the Government to give effect to the amendment ?",15
41,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I assume that the amendment referred to has been made because the honourable member says so. He may recollect that I was absent for the last week or two, and therefore did not follow the proceedings in another place as closely as I otherwise should have done. I have not seen the regulation as amended. I 'shall look at it . APPROPRIATIONBILL (1903-4). SECOND READING. Motion (by Sir GEORGE TURNER) proposed - That the Bill be now read a second time.",15
42,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I do not know whether I shall be in order in embracing this opportunity to refer to a matter concerning which I lately asked a question. I refer to the question which you, Mr . Speaker, have decided in proposing not to ask the electors of Hunter, who are now without a representative, to elect one until the Federal general elections, as to the date of which, at the present moment, we know nothing. I do not wish to contravene any parliamentary procedure ; but as this is a very important matter I think it should be ventilated to some extent. My difficulty is that you have made a declaration which involves the supposition that apparently you alone know that there is to be a general election for the House of Representatives at an early date. We know nothing of it officially, and I shall be surprised to learn that you know anything officially as to when this House will be dissolved, and. the general elections for the Federal Parliament will take place. It is because the action you propose to take may form a precedent that I direct special attention to the matter. I regret that such a precedent is being formed, no doubt with the very best intentions by yourself, and, if you have consulted others, with their advice. You, sir, are alone responsible, and I hold rightly or No. 149. wrongly that you are here setting a precedent which may lead to mischief later on. It is for that reason I should like to know upon what ground, other than that of expense, the decision you have announced is based. I should be glad to secure the attention of honourable members in dealing with this matter.",15
43,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"There are two difficulties in the way of the honourable member proceeding in this matter unless he can avoid them. In the first place, the honourable member will see that on the business paper there is notice of an intention to move a certain resolution with reference to the time when the next general election shall take place. That notice being on the business-paper, and it being impossible to anticipate debate uponany question so appearing, discussion upon the question the honourable member raises is precluded. On the other question we are now dealing with the second reading of the Appropriation Bill, and at this stage it is proper to discuss only matters which are included in the Bill. If the honourable member can connect his remarks with any vote appearing in the Appropriation Bill he will be in order; but I must ask him to so connect his remarks if he can, and also to avoid anticipating any debate which may take place later on upon notice of motion No. 12.",16
44,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,May I suggest that there appears in the Appropriation Bill a very considerable vote for the purpose of the general election.,16
45,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The honourable member for Wide Bay may be able to connect his remarks with that vote.,16
46,Mr DEAKIX,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,He may connect them with the cost of the election.,16
47,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I desire that honourable members should understand that I have no feeling in this matter. It is a most important point, and you, Mr Speaker, have taken upon yourself a great power. I am not at all disputing the benefit which may be derived from, or the saving which may occur, as the result of your well-intentioned decision ; but I have the gravest doubts as to the constitutional soundness of that decision. One reason given for it is that of pense, and it is on that ground I raise the question. I believe that holding the high office which you, sir, adorn in this House, no question of expense should stand between you and the representation ofan important district of the Commonwealth. On that account I regret your decision, and whatever trouble and reasonable expense may be involved, it is our duty to see that every constituency in the Commonwealth has a representative in this House without one day's unnecessary delay. It is upon the grounds that I have stated that I regret the decision at which you have arrived.",16
48,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I am obliged to the honourable member for giving me an opportunity of pointing out that the expense was not the chief reason why I have not proceeded to issue a writ. I first pointed out in the statement. I have read, that allowing the shortest possible practical interval between the issue of a writ and the nomination, and between the nomination and poll, it would require, I think, four weeks from today before any member could be returned to a writ issued today. If it were possible that the member so elected four weeks hence could take his seat, even for a day or two, and so represent his constituents, I should judge it unfitting on my part, or on the part of any one holding the office I have the honour to hold, that the consideration of expense should be taken as a sufficient reason for a course which would prevent a district being represented even for that brief period. Seeing that in the general opinion of those who know most of what is probable, four weeks hence will see this session closed, and that a dissolution will follow a few days later, it did appear to me that the expense and trouble to which the electors would be put would be absolutely resultless and unprofitable. Then a further point to which I called attention in the memorandum I read is that in any case an election held now would have to be conducted under the New South Wales electoral law, under which women would not be able to vote, whilst if an election took place after the dissolution double the number of electors would be entitled to vote, as compared with those who could now exercise the franchise. Any election that might take place under a writ issued by me could afford no index of the will of the electors, or as to the probable result of the election which would take place exa short time afterwards under the new roll. These were the reasons which influenced me in taking the action I did. I shall, however, hold myself free to issue a writ if, upon a closer view of the probabilities, or in view of the events which may transpire within the next few days, I consider that there would be any reasonable probabilty of the person who might be returned as the representative of the Hunter district being of any service to his constituents, who certainly have a right to be represented here, regardless of any expense that may be involved.",16
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I think that the honourable member for Wide Bay has taken the proper course concerning this very important matter. It is almost impossible nowadays, when public opinion is so keen concerning electoral matters, for Mr Speaker to do anything he ought not to do. At the same time. I venture to remark that unless you, Mr Speaker, had some statement from the Government upon the' subject, it was not open for you to act as you have done in this particular case. Of course I do not expect you to say that anything has taken place between yourself and the Government, or that you have taken steps to ascertain the opinion of . Ministers: but I have a shrewd suspicion that you have ascertained from the proper quarter what are the probabilities. If the Government chose they could put an end to the whole question in five minutes by making a statement, with some kind of certitude, as to the date upon which the elections will probably take place. Is there any special reason why this should remain a secret 1 Is anything to be gained by withholding this information from Parliament ? It is usual towards the close of business in all Parliaments of the Empire to give the House some indication as to when it is likely to rise, and as to the business that is to be disposed of before the prorogation takes place. The Government have not so far informed honourable members upon these points, and the least we have a right to expect from the Prime Minister is some indication of the business which is to be proceeded with and completed before our labours are brought to an end. Weshould be informed as to the probable time of the prorogation and the date of the elections.",17
50,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," The question raised is a perfectly legitimate one. One would think that an honourable member of wide experience, such as the honourable member for Parramatta, would know that the day upon which the second reading of the Appropriation Bill is proposed marks the very close approach of the end of the session.",17
51,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,That should takeplace on the last day of the session.,17
52,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Yes , except that under our system the Senate is entitled to have the Appropriation Bill presented to it earlier than is usual in the States Parliaments, in order to afford it an opportunity to criticise matters that do not come before it at other times. I might further reply to the question of the honourable member for Parramatta by stating that, of the business which is still on the paper, all that it is desired to dispose of is the Patents Bill and the determination of the site of the Federal capital. There are two other small measures of a purely machinery and departmental character, which it will be necessary to consider. Upon the notice-paper of the Senate appears the Defence Bill, upon which the final touches have to be placed. That is practically all that we propose to do this session, and I hope that this may be regarded as a sufficiently clear indication to honourable mem-. bers of the date of the prorogation. Of course, it is unconstitutional to refer here to that - which is a subject for the exercise of the prerogative of His Excellency the Governor General. The honourable member for Wide Bay directed attention to the step which you, Mr Speaker, have seen f it to take, and he did so in a manner which was well within his rights. I have no doubt that the step which you took, Mr Speaker, involved much consideration on your part. It is clear, from such indications as I have mentioned, that this session is about to close, and it would surely be the cruellest of kindness to both the candidates and the electors concerned to ask them to take part in an election upon a roll which is about to be superseded, and which could afford but a very poor indication of the feeling of the constituency.",17
53,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The people of the Hunter are the persons who should be allowed to determine whether or not they should elect any one.,17
54,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"But if a representative were returned upon a roll other than that which will be in force within the next two or three weeks, it would be at a time at which he could not take his seat in Parliament. What possible work of a public character could he do for his constituents.",17
55,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,This is not the point. The electors should have the choice. They need notnominateany candidates even though the writ is issued.,17
56,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I should agree with the honourable member if the consent of the constituents were required before a candidature could be entered upon. There is, however, no condition of that kind, and we know that very often persons are ready for the mere purpose of calling attention to themcontemplates selves to rush in as candidates. Thus the Commonwealth might be put to the expense of a thousand pounds, and the constituents to the expense of conducting a contest the writ. which could be effective in no practical way, and would be repeated within or three weeks. There is nothing to prevent Mr Speaker from issuing a writ at any moment if he comes to the conclusion that a representative could be here i take part in the work of Parliament. No doubt'he would issue a writ under such cirsome cumstances. But unless he is satisfied that the person elected would become a represenfollowed. tative in reality, be able to take a seat in this House and speak for the surely acting in a most considerate manner and in the public interest in saving the people of the district and the Commonwealth the expense which would be involved. I think that the course Mr Speaker has taken is in the best interests of the public. Retaining, as he does, the power to change his course of action to-night or tomorrow morning, he can take the steps necessary to secure to the district its proper representation if our sittings should longed sufficiently to enable its representative to take his seat.",17
57,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I quite appreciate the stand Mr Speaker has taken with a view to save expense, but I am port adopted. afraid that it may involve a slight ""difficulty. When a vacancy occurs whilst Parliament is in session the proper person to issue the writ is Mr Speaker. Suppose, however, that Parliament really lasted until the 9th day of May next, and no writ were now issued by Mr Speaker, I question very much whether the Governor General could issue it . Some difficulty may arise from departing from the usual course. rule, when Parliament is near its close and is out of session the Ministry delay issue of writs. But, in that case, there be no question as to who shall issue the writs. Suppose, however, that the Speaker delayed the issue of the writ until the session closed.",18
58,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Mr Speaker would issue the writ if he were in the Commonwealth, irrespective of whether Parliament was in out of session.",18
59,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"That may be the conward struction which is placed upon the section by the Prime Minister, but what it really is that the writ should be issued by Mr Speaker during the session.",18

Sir GEORGE, TURNER (Balaclavathe Treasurer) - Ha d the honourable member can put that question to me yesterday, when - the Supplementary Estimates were under consideration, I could have supplied him with the details. At the present moment, however, I am not in the position to do so. I know that we have purchased a considerable quantity of machinery for printing purposes. When the Commonwealth was or using the printing machinery of the Victorian Government, it was found that awkdelays frequently occurred. To obviate these, we secured some fast-running machines and machinery for binding purposes, and also a number of linotypes; but it is impossible for me to quote the separate items which we purchased twelve months ago. I know, however, that they included some folding machines, and also a number of quick-running machines for other purposes. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolutions adopted. WAYS AND MEANS.

66,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," Perhaps this would be a fitting opportunity for hie bring under the notice of the Prime Minisnothing ter a matter of some importance to the House. I trust that.some little time will elapse before the prorogation, and I desire the honourable and learned gentleman to consider whether an attempt should not be made, before the session closes, to pass the draft Standing Orders. I put a similar I question to his predecessor on two or three occasions, and I hope that this matter will be attended to.",19
67,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION, This is a matter which is entirely in the hands of honourable members themselves.,19
68,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,We are here.,19
69,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Quite so ; but I think we shall be very closely occupied for the next few days in disposing of the Capital site question. If, - in order to enable the draft Standing Orders to be considered, honourable members are willing to remain after we have dealt with that question, the Government will be very happy to assist them. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolutions reported. PATENTS BILL . In Committee (Consideration resumed from 29th September, vide page 5524): Clause 35Every application and specification shall forthwith be referred by the Commissioner to an who shall ascertain and report as to(a) Whether the title has been stated as prescribed ; (6) Whether the invention has been described as prescribed; (c) Whether the application and specification are as prescribed ; and (d) Whether the invention is novel or has been already in possession of the public with the consent or allowance of the inventor.",19
70,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," Before we proceed to consider the question of novelty, I wish to suggest that the exof the amination provided for in this clause should be confined to the complete specification. I believe that the Victorian State 30th Parliament, last year, passed an Act to adopt the English practice, which is confined to the examination of the complete speciI understand that the practice of examining . the provisional specification was found rather inconvenient, and that it led to more expense and delay than was really justified by any safeguard which was thus secured. If a provisional specification is to not followed by the complete specification occurs in relation to the patent, although, of course, should a patent be' applied for in respect of the same invention it might subsequently affect the question of novelty. If the complete specification in relation to the application is filed, all the examination that is necessary must be made. t must also affect the provisional specification, because in clause 36 it is provided that the examination of a complete specification must be for the purpose of finding out amongst other things whether the invention to which it refers is substantially the same as that described in the provisional specification. Thus the second examination which must take place under the Bill, as drafted, will also include an examination of the earlier specification. We have also to remember that if the earlier one is not in order, although it has not been examined, the patent itself will be liable to be challenged, or opposition may be offered to the granting of the patent on the ground that the provisional specification is not as prescribed by regulation. There is, therefore, no object to be gained by having two examinations. I <lo not think that even the drawings are filed in England until the complete specification has been lodged. There they regard the complete specification as the only one in relation to which much trouble need be taken. If there were a breach of the rules as regards the form or title in the provisional specification it might involve the patent itself. Several patent agents think that the examination should be confined to the complete specification, and in order to ventilate their views I gave notice of an amendment, which I do not now propose to move in the form circulated by me. I think that it would be well for the Prime Minister to consolidate clauses 35, 36, and 37. If the examination be confined to the complete specification they may well be converted into one clause. Then the various sub-clauses would follow in their order as part of clause 35, and the subsequent clauses could be amended accordingly for the purpose of reference. Eor example, if this were done the reference in clause 38 to clauses 35 and 36 would apply to the subclauses of clause 35. I trust that the Prime Minister will consider the matter, for I believe that several honourable members are disposed to support the suggestion which I make.",19
71,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," In the matter of drafting a good deal can be said for the last proposal made by the honourable and learned member. It would have been easy to include the whole of these three clauses in one, but the subdivision has been adopted, notwithstanding that it involves a little extra reference, for the purpose of clearly showing what is intended to be done at the different stages of the investigation. The honourable and learned member is also correct, so far as I follow him, in his references to the English practice; but he requires to note that we have not adhered closely to the principle upon which' the English patent law is founded, and upon which the English administration on. The amendment with which we shall deal presently introduces a proposal entirely novel to the British method of dealing with patents, and though I propose to move an amendment of that amendment, we shall still go considerably beyond what the British law contemplates. This appears to me to affect the question of the two specifications. If the honourable and learned member looks at the clause which we are now considering, he will see that the proposal relates to the provisional and complete specification, as the case may be. Any person who chooses to come forward with his complete specification will have to comply with clauses 35, 36, and 37. A provisional specification, on the other hand, will have to comply only with clause 35, and will not be affected by clauses 36 and 37. What are the requirements ? Occasionally even an agent makes a mistake in applying for a patent, although that is very rare; but it constantly happens that persons who are extremely uninformed in the ordinary processes of patenting attempt to secure the protection of the law without the assistance of an agent, and that their applications are defective in purely formal matters. The proposed examination is intended, not for the advantage of the office, but for the assistance of the would be patentee.",20
72,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"But why should the work be done by an "" examiner "" 1",20
73,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Because the examiner is the officer who will have to deal with the application under the following clauses. The elementary requirements in respect of a provisional specification will be set out in the regulations, and under this clause it will be the duty of the examiner to point out to the applicant what those requirements are. It is comparatively common for a would be patentee to misdescribe his invention, even in the matter of title, and applications are frequently defective in matters of form. The examination provided for is not an examination upon which any application is rejected.",20
74,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"It is a very important examination, because it covers the question of novelty generally.",20
75,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I propose to strike out that provision.,20
76,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,And insert it later on.,20
77,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Yes . It is entirely out of place in this clause.,20
78,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Was not paragraph d inis carried serted by the Senate ?,20
79,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Yes ; it was not in the Bill as originally drafted. Honourable members will see that when that paragraph has been omitted, all that the examiner will have to do is to see that applications for provisional patents are correct in matters of form. The examiner sees that the would be patentee has complied with the regulations in that regard, and, if he has not, lends assistance to put matters right. No application will be rejected at this stage. The clause has been introduced solely to afford assistance to persons applying for provisional patents.",20
80,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"""But why should application be referred specifically to an ""examiner""?",21
81,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The honourable member probably knows that in a well-equipped patent office there is a machinery expert, a chemical expert, an expert for textile substances, and so o n ; and the examiner to whom the application would go would be the expert in the particular trade affected by the invention which it was sought to patent. He thereupon sees that the application is in order in mere matters of form, and then the patent may be regarded as fairly launched. I move That paragraph d be omitted.",21
82,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"North Sydney) Power has been given under a previous clause to appoint examiners, and by an amendment which was agreed to last night, a special meaning has been given to the word "" examiner.""",21
83,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But the duties of the examiners are not defined. They will be gathered from the various provisions of the Bill.,21
84,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I have received a communication from a gentleman who is connected with the Patent Office of one of the States, in which he says that formal correctness is not generally inquired into by examiners.",21
85,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"That work is done by examiners in some of the States. - Mr THOMSON - Yes , but in other States it is done either by the Commissioner or by one of his clerks. I think it would be better to so amend the clause as to leave it open to the Commissioner to refer applications either to the particular officers entitled examiners, or to clerks, or to do it himself. I do not object to the examination of applications, but the clause as it stands, if read in conjunction with other provisions of the Bill, provides that the work of examining t Bill. 5583 shall be done only by certain officers. That, I think, is undesirable.",21
86,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"It is the practice of the United States, and, I think, also of Great Britain, to leave this work to examiners.",21
87,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"That may not be an objectionable practice in a large office where there are plenty of examiners available, but it is not desirable that applicants should be kept waiting because a particular examiner is busy, when there are other officers who the could run through their applications and see that they were formally correct.",21
88,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I do not see what substantial objection there can be to such a matter being referred to an officer called the ""examiner."" The Commissioner himself may perform the functions of an examiner, and if he should be too busy there is no reason why he should not refer a matter to one of those officers I think we should be disturbing the structure of the Bill if we omitted provision for the appointment of examiners. I desire to refer to paragraph d.",21
89,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I am asking that that should be omitted from this clause. Sir JOHN QUICK : - I am very glad to hear that it is proposed that that-paragraph should be omitted.,21
90,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The honourable and learned member cannot object to an examination as to the question of novelty. ,",21
91,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Will the honourable and learned member wait until we come to clause 37 ?,21
92,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I think it is not necessary for the purposes of a patent that any preliminary inquiry should be made by a Government officer on the question of novelty.,21
93,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It is most essential that there should be such an inquiry.,21
94,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I think not, for this reason : The Government, in issuing a patent, do not guarantee its unassailability. They grant a patent at the risk of the applicant.",21
95,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Why should they grant a patent for something that is not novel ?,21
96,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"A Government office coidd not possibty enter upon the vast and tremendous inquiry involved in the question of novelty: The determination of such a question may involve an inquiry extending all over the world, and including all ages of history. Such an inquiry is impossible for a Government office. - Mr WATSON - Not at all. Such inquiries are now made in America.",21
97,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I am aware of that, and the result is that a large number of applications for patents are delayed for a long time in the Patent Office, and unfortunate inventors are lamenting the consequent obstruction and delay.",22
98,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Many express a contrary opinion.,22
99,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"In an article in the Law Quarterly, the writer contends that this is a good provision, and that it works well in America.",22
100,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"There are the two objections to an inquiry as to novelty. The Government do not guarantee the unassailability of a patent, and they grant it at the risk of the applicant. He is asked to comply with certain preliminary requirements, a patent is then granted at his risk, and any one may attack it in a Court of law.",22
101,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Does the honourable and learned member know that the real objection to the provision is that it is in existence in the Victorian Patents Act at the present time 1,22
102,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,That is the very reason I am criticising it in this way. Complaints have been made that it has been found unworkable in Victoria.,22
103,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Thos e complaints are not general.,22
104,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I have read them time after time in the press. The requirement of an inquiry as to novelty will impose upon the Government a vast and important function, and one which no Government office can fairly perform.",22
105,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I trust that the view expressed by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo will not find acceptance in the Committee. There have been two broad methods upon which patents procedure has operated in different parts of the world. Under one method there is something like an inquiry into novelty in connection with an application, and in the other a patent is granted without any such inquiry. This latter procedure, in my opinion, strikes at the underlying principle upon which patents are granted. Patents were first of all granted in England on the ground that the inventions were novel so far as England was concerned, and a monopoly 'with respect to a patent was granted in order to insure to the people the benefit of an invention previously unknown in the country. The essence of the whole matter was novelty. Yet the English procedure for some years has departed altogether from that leading principle, and in England at the present time patents are granted which, in a vast number of instances, are not worth the paper upon which they are written, as indicating that the patented article has the essential element of novelty. In the United States of America the procedure is upon exactly opposite lines. While there they make no attempt to guarantee the inviolability of a patent, or to say that it is absolutely novel, they still take all reasonable care to determine that it is novel. The old formula of "" all care taken but no responsibility incurred "" seems to be that upon which they act. They do take every care, and the experience of those associated with patent procedure as patent agents ordirect applicants is that they infinitely prefer a slight delay while inquiry is being made as to novelty, in order that they may be reasonably assured that their patent when granted does not infringe the rights of of any one else, and that it covers something novel in the way of a valuable improvement. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has said that the experience of the Victorian Act has supplied him with one reason for opposing the provision.",22
106,Mr MCCAY,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Was not the similar provision in the Victorian Act repealed 1,22
107,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"No , an attempt was made to repeal it, but the late Sir Frederick Sargood, who introduced the Bill for the purpose, became convinced before it had proceeded very far that it would be wrong to repeal the provision, and he dropped the measure and allowed the original procedure to stand. I may say that within a few days a petition against the repeal of the Victorian practice in this respect was signed by thousands of business men and inventors. In New South Wales we have adopted the laxer system, and I think it has been found to be a mistake. So far as I can learn, persons having business with the Patent Office, whether as patent agents or inventors, are not at all satisfied with the laxer procedure. I am not at this stage arguing as to the best place in which to insert this provision. The Prime Minister agrees that 1 there does appear to be some reason why the element of novelty should be inquired into by the examiner, and whether the inquiry should take place in the preliminary stages of the application is a matter of detail. I trust that, in any case, the Committee - will insist upon an inquiry into the element of novelty.",22
108,Mr WILKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION, I hope this paragraph will be allowed to remain.,23
109,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Not in this clause. I propose to have my amendment inserted in clause 37.,23
110,Mr WILKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I believe in the principle contained in it . The Prime Minister referred to the "" uninformed inventor,"" but I desire to impress upon the Committee that it it is commonly from men who are considered uninformed that we get inventions.",23
111,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I meant uninformed as to the proper course of procedure.,23
112,Mr WILKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I am speaking with reference to information to be gained in schools and universities. I acquit the Prime Minister of any intention to reflect upon men who are not possessed of that information. There is learning of different kinds. One man may be learned in the law, and another learned in engine-driving. I do not for a moment suppose that the Prime Minister intended to convey any reflection upon such men as George Stephenson, Watt, and others. I have here a book, entitled The Law and Practice of New South Wales upon Letters Patent, by A. G. Taylor. In an introductory note the author quotes Isaac Taylor as follows: The great inventor is one who has walked forth upon the industrial world, not from universities, but from hovels ; not as clad in silks and decked with honours, but as clad in fustian and grimed with soot and oil. These are the men .we have to consider in passing legislation of this kind-me n without means, to whom every day's work is a consideration-and we should place it within their power to patent the results of their inventive thought in the easiest possible manner, not only for their benefit, but for the advantage of the community. I am pleased to hear that the Prime Minister intends to retain the principle to which reference has been made. I should like to quote one short paragraph from a pamphlet pub agent, who demonstrates the benefit of cheapness. He points out that it pays the nation to make its patent fees as low as possible, and to relieve patentees of expense as far as possible by employing officers to - look after their interests. In the end, the general community benefits from every invention, and it should be prepared to pay for the advantages so conferred. Mr Gossler saysIn the United States, in spite-o r rather because-of the small fee charged for a patent, the inventors have with their fees full}' paid the cost of the magnificent patent office building^ in Washington, and maintained the enormous staff of officers employed therein. And yet there is a surplus of over £125,000 in the Treasury to the credit of the patent office. The volume of work done in this office may be guessed when it is stated that 40,000 applications for patents are made yearly. In 1899 no fewer than 25,527 patents were granted. With all this work there is no bustle, no confusion ; everything goes like well regulated clockwork. If it pays to do that kind of thing in the United States, it wili surely be to our advantage to proceed upon similar lines. The result of the American system has been to enormously increase the number of patents. In the United States there are twice as many patents applied for every year as in Great Britain. This has been due largely to the reduction of the fees. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 36 agreed to. Clause 37In the case of all complete specifications the examiner shall also ascertain and report whether to the best of his knowledge(a) The invention is already patentedin the Commonwealth or in any State, or is already the subject of any prior application for a patent in the Commonwealth or in anv State ",23
113,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I m o v e That the letter (a) be inserted after the word ""also,"" line 2; that the letter (a), line 4, be omitted ; that the words "" (6) Report whether to the best of his knowledge the invention is or is not novel"" be added. This provision will bring us abreast of the latest British law upon the subject of patents. It will give us the benefit of the advance which has been made in the British law after the experience which they have gained of the unsatisfactory results of granting patents without previous searching of the records. The examiners will be persons of large experience and special training. It will be their duty to possess such a knowledge of the specifications as will enable them to detect in the records of the offices of the States similar patents already registered. Further, in the course of their inquiries they will become acquainted with unpatented machines which have been introduced into the States, and acquire a very large general knowledge as to inventions patented elsewhere, which, though not patented in Australia, have been published in Australia. As the fact of the publicathe tion or use in Australia of these machines would at any time thereafter be quite sufficient to upset the patent and destroy its value, we hereby provide that the matter, knowledge obtained by the examiners, infor stead of being locked up in their breasts, should be communicated to the inventor if it is proposed to critiis cise the patent in that regard. we are placing at the command of the inclares, ventor all the information which the aminer has. We do not propose to follow the American system, and erect the examiner into the position of a Judge who can make requisitions as he chooses, or issue or refuse patents. Mr A . PATERSON - That is the best system.",23
114,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Expert s differ. I preI sume that the honourable member has Edmunds on Patents. Dr Edmunds is certainly one of the highest living authoriConcerning ties on patents. He is a master of the British system, but when he went to to America he examined the United States system, which he had always admired and absolutely valueless. preferred to the British system. On examining it on the spot, he came to the conclusion that although it possessed great advantages it also had many drawlitigation. backs, which on the whole rendered it desirable than the system adopted in Great Britain. We have followed the course adopted by the British Patent Office last year, and we are taking a still further stride in vance. We do not erect the examiner the position of a Judge, but we propose to against inventors. communicate to the inventor the knowledge obtained by the examiner.",24

117,Mr MCCAY,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The patent is issued at his risk in any event.,24
118,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Ye s ; and the risk is a very serious one if there should be any position to his patent. Then the case to be decided by the Commissioner. We do not decide the question at this stage, simply place the knowledge obtained by examiner at the command of the inventor.",24
119,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I think that the proposal of the Prime Minister constitutes a distinct improvement upon present form of the clause, and it also removes the grounds of my previous objection to this provision. It does not set up the examiner as the judge of finality in this nor does it obstruct the application a patent, nor subject the applicant to a large expenditure, as has been the case in connection with previous applications. It a compromise which may fairly be acThus cepted, because, as the Prime Minister dei t give3 the applicant the advantage exof the knowledge of the Patent Office by informing him whether there is any suspicion of a want ©f novelty in regard to his patent. Should such a suspicion be entertained, the Government officer practically says to him- "" If you take out this patent you do so at your own risk, because it is liable to attack and is therefore valueless."" think that the amendment is the best read possible solution of the difficulty. Mr A . PATERSON (Capricornia) the remarks of the Prime Minister, I would point out that it is well known patentees all over the world that patents issued by the British Government are The same remark applies to those issued by the Victorian Government. A British patent is worthless until it has emerged from the fire of actual Upon the other hand a patent less which is issued by the American Government is so valuable that immediately the patentee gains possession of i the can raise money upon it . The reason for this differadence is that the whole trend of the English into Act is in favour of patent agents as What we wish to do is to protect the inventor, and that should be our main consideration in this Bill. I am very glad that the provision relating to the novelty or otherwise of an invention is to be preserved in the",24
120,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"It cannot be preserved effectually. Mr A . PATERSON - It ought to be so preserved, because it is the only vital principle in the Bill so far as the inventor is opconcerned. In England the practice is for has the Government to accept money from the applicants for patents, notwithstandbut we ing which they have to run the risk the of whether their inventions are novel or otherwise. Consequently, the patents issued in that country are absolutelv worthless. In America, however, every application for a patent is most carefully examined, and such is the wonderful skill of the examiners that a statement appears in the Daily Mai l Year Book that there are not two per thousand of the applications for patents which cannot be finally reported upon regarding their novelty or otherwise. Our aim should be to protect the inventor, and we can never accomplish that unless we retain in the Bill a provision for inquiry as to novelty. That is really the vital principle in the measure. I speak from personal experience. I have had a great deal of experience with patents in connection with inventors themselves. I know that every inventor feels that he is not sufficiently protected anywhere in the world, save America and Germany. The German patent law is very nearly as good as that which is operative in America. I hold patents in both those countries, and I have no hesitation in affirming that the difference between the value of an American or German patent and an English patent is really marvellous. That difference arises from the fact that the patent offices in America are managed by experts. So far from it being a disadvantage that the Commissioner, rather than a Judge of the Court, should pronounce as to the novelty or otherwise of a patent, I think there is no comparison in actual experience between the value of the two judgments. Nine out of ten inventors would infinitely prefer the decision of a patent expert to that' of a lawyer or Judge.",24
121,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I was somewhat doubtful about this provision, but I iritend to support its inclusion in the Bill. Sir Edmund Barton mentioned in the course of his remarks that it did not afford very much protection in America, seeing that 72 per cent, of the patents issued there-notwithstandin g the elaborate search which is instituted-ar e open to challenge upon"" the ground that they are not novel. Personally, I do not think that his authority is altogether reliable. In the Law Qua/rterly Review for July last there is a able article by Mr White, who specially refers to these examinations for novelty, and would go to the length of the German and American practice by insistinguponageneral examination in that respect. He points out that the. practice has been a very great success in America. Consequently I cannot regard the authority quoted by the Attorney-General as reliable. In America not only is there an examination as to whether previous specifications have been lodged in respect of the same invention, but a general search is made through the records and text-books. The digests of other countries are even ransacked with a view to ascertain whether any invention has been patented elsewhere. There, search is comparatively easy, because the index system in America has recently been brought up to date, and, in comparison with that of other countries, is perfection itself. But, according to an article which recently appeared in the Times, the very opposite condition prevails in Australia. Consequently, until we bring our index system up to date there may be a difficulty, at any rate in regard to the economical working of this provision. I notice that in the report of the English Comptroller of Patents for 1902, it is stated that the Board of Trade Committee which inquired into this matter, and the question of compulsory licences under an Act which was passed in 1901, recommended as a compromise an amendment which applies only to an examination for previous specifications, and that a strong opinion was expressed concerning the need for the'adoption of a general search, such as is proposed in this paragraph, in regard to the novelty of inventions. It points out what has already been referred to by the honourable member for Capricornia-namely , that the way in which patents are issued in that country constitutes a serious evil. I believe that in England, owing to the absence of an examination as to the novelty or otherwise of inventions, a search. disclosed that from 1870 downwards about 42 per cent, of the patents issued are open to challenge upon the ground of want of novelty. That condition scarcely fits in with the statement of the American authority quoted by the Prime Minister, who declares that 72 per cent, of the patents granted in America are open to attack. If in England, where there has been no examination as to novelty, 42 per cent, of the patents issued are open to challenge, f ^ w is it possible that in very America, where a most rigorous examination is conducted, 72 per cent, of them can be open to attack? The chances are that in America the provision is a complete success. Under the circumstances I shall support the amendment, although I cannot see that it makes the slightest difference to the clause in its original form, save in respect of the preliminary examination. Amendments agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 38If the examiner reports adversely to the application . . . the Commissioner may(c) refuse the application.",25
122,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I m o v e That paragraph c be omitted. The Commissioner may require compliance with certain directions. He might direct than an application should date from a certain time, and if that direction were not complied with he would not issue the patent. It is, therefore, unnecessary for him to have power to refuse an application. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 39 (Appeal to Law Officer).",26
123,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I understand that provision is to be made for the appeals to which I have already referred. The difference between my suggestion and the amendment to be proposed by the Prime Minister relates to whether the appeals should lie to theLaw Officer or to the Supreme Court. Perhaps on the whole it would be better for the appeal to be allowed to the Supreme Court, and therefore I do not propose to move an amendment. Mr L. E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the decision of the Law Officer will be final under this clause 1",26
124,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It will be final in regard to the question of date. Mr L. E. GROOM - And it will be final in relation to any matter arising under clause 38?,26
125,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Quite so. It will be final in regard to directions for amendment and as to date. Mr L. E. GROOM - Will not this vision go further ? Will it not relate to the question whether the title has been stated as prescribed, and whether the invention fully described in the complete specification is substantially the same as that described in the provisional one 1",26
126,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,This provision relates only to clause 38. Mr L. E. GROOM - The intention is that the appeal provided for in this clause shall be final in regard to matters arising under clause 38.,26
127,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Yes . Clause agreed to. Clause 40 agreed to. Clause 41 verbally amended and agreed Clause 42If the Commissioner is satisfied that no objection exists to the specification on the ground that the invention is already patented in the Commonwealth or in any State, or is already the subject of any prior application for a patent in the Commonwealth or in any State he shall in the absence of any other lawful ground of objection accept the specification.",26
128,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I move That, after the word "" state,"" line 6, the words '' or is not a matter of common knowledge or practice "" be inserted. It seems to me that if the Commissioner is not to refuse to accept a specification on the ground that it is not Dovel, a man will be at liberty to patent the most well-known process or article.",26
129,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Not if it has already been patented.,26
130,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"But suppose it has not been patented 1 A man might apply for a patent in respect of an article which, although not patented in Australia, had been patented elsewhere, and, by means of a patent improperly secured in that way, might endeavour to obtain certain rights as against the public. That is undesirable.",26
131,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I think that objection is covered by certain amendments which have been made. There is to be an examination for novelty, and there might be a requisition on that ground.",26
132,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,There is to be no objection on the ground of want of novelty.,26
133,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,No .,26
134,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,There might be a requisition,26
135,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"How would it be possible to requisition in respect of an article which in itself was patentable, the only objection pro- being that there had been a prior publication or user ?",26
136,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,A patent could be granted for an article in respect of 'which there had been prior publication or user.,26
137,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,As long as it was not already patented.,26
138,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"That is not desirable. I do not say that the amendment I suggest is the best that could be made, but it is ridiculous that people should be able to patent an article with or without result. It may be said that a patent such as that to which I have referred would have no result. In that event the patent would be worthless, and, therefore, should not be to. issued. On the other hand, if people were threatened with heavy law costs if they made use of an article or process which had been patented in these circumstances, they would be deterred from using it, and the holder of the patent would secure an advantage to which he had no claim. An injury would thus be done to the public. Some provision such as I have proposed should be inserted. As I read the Bill-and the Prime Minister agrees with my reading-w e might have the most ordinary processes, designs, or articles patented. I think that if a process, design, or article is within common knowledge or use, a patent for it should be refused on that ground.",26
139,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," If an examiner reports that, to the best of his knowledge, an invention for which a patent is asked is not novel, can the Commissioner refuse the application ?",27
140,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I think not.,27
141,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"It seems to me an extraordinary thing to provide for an inquiry, and to obtain the finding that an invention is not novel, and then to grant a patent which virtually declares that the invention is novel. The inquiry is either needless, or practical effect should be given to it.",27
142,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"If an application for a patent is accepted, it is. published in due course, and any person who feels that his interests are in any respect challenged may enter opposition to the patent upon the ground of want of novelty, which, if proved, will be fatal to it . ""When the officers of the Department think that a supposed invention is not novel, they inform the would be patentee, but that is not fatal to his application. We propose to shut the door in an applicant's face only when the invention for which he seeks a patent has already been patented either in the State or in the Commonwealth. When it is objected to on the ground of want of - novelty, the Department will give the applicant the advantage of its knowledge upon the subject, and leave it to him to say whether he will take the risk of proceeding further; because the question of novelty touches upon problems of infinitesimal delicacy. In Germany, where there is in existence one of the most elaborate patent laws, the great Bessemer process, which brought an enormous fortune to its discoverer from the revenues obtained in England, could not be patented, on the ground that there was no novelty in any part of the invention, and 11H that all that was new was the linking together of facts which were already known. The German Patent Office did not give the inventor the opportunity to take out a patent at his own risk. The practice adopted under the Bil l is to give the applicant all the information in the possession of the office, and to warn him that the patent may be objected to on the ground of want of novelty. If he then chooses to take out a patent, he does so with his eyes open. Under the English system, he would have his eyes shut. Mr A. PATERSON - Will it be stated in the patent ?",27
143,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"If it were a matter of public use, it would not appear in the patent; but the applicant would be warned that objection might be taken on that score. We do not think that we are injuring the public by adopting this method, because the claim for a patent is published everywhere, and any one has a right to challenge it .",27
144,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Unde r what provision of the Bill could a patent be defeated for want of novelty ?,27
145,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Unde r paragraphs « and f of clause 52. We have the choice of two disadvantages. We can either erect the examiner or commissioner into the position of a Judge, which is practically what they do in America, where in many cases there is no appeal from a decision, or, having given the applicant the information possessed by the Department, issue a patent to him with the warning that it may be opposed, and let him risk the opposition, and secure what gains he can, should he survive it. It seems to me that the second alternative is the lesser of the two evils. I have framed my amendment upon learning that, according to the advice of the experts consulted, it is, with our methods and our system,, safe to go as far as it provides but dangerous to go further. Although the amendment of the honourable member is in very general terms, and would not impose anything like the obligation which is imposed in America or Germany, it still imposes the obligation to reject an application if it is thought that the invention is a matter of common knowledge or in common use. If we adopted the amendment, we should run the risk of having the examiners declare that because an invention was old in its form, but new in its 'applica-. tion, it was not sufficiently novel to justify a patent, and thus the hopes of a man's lifetime might be destroyed. Is not that greater evil than to run the risk of a patent being upset after warning has been given to the applicant of the possibility of opposition 1 Mr A. PATERSON (Capricornia) - I feel compelled to support the amendment. It is the practice every day of patent scalpers to steal patents; to take ideas from the American and English patent offices, and to work up a little syndicate to buy them. The moment the syndicate is established they apply for a patent in Sydney or in Melbourne. A case of the kind came under my observation three or four years ago, when a person to whom a patent had been offered asked me, while in Sydney, to inquire into it. I was a little suspicious of the patentee, but the drawings and the particulars of the patent appeared to be in order. A few days later, however, I found a drawing of the machinery in the Scientific American as an invention which had been patented in America. If ""publication"" in clause 52 were defined to mean, not the actual printing in the Commonwealth of a book or other document in which an invention has been described, but the selling of such a book or newspaper here, that difficulty would be got over. But I think it is also advisable, in the interests of true inventors, to adopt the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney.",27
146,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," The Bill is throughout framed on lines which I do not consider the best. I am entirely against the system of issuing a document which is supposed to confer a right or a privilege, but is absolutely useless for that purpose. When a decision as to its uselessness or otherwise is sought in a law court, it will very often happen that the party with the longest purse will succeed, because of the costliness of the processes through which he can take his opponent. There are such things as bluff patents, and they are not uncommon. They are patents taken out by wealthy parties with the object of frightening other persons from using an invention. Under the Bill a patent might be granted for an invention of the commonest knowledge, perhaps for an article in use in the Patent Office itself. The Department would say to the applicant-""This invention is not new, therefore you have no right to obtain a patent for it . Nevertheless we give you a patent."" That is an objectionable system. I would rather leave it to the a Commissioner to decide whether a patent is novel, and give the right to appeal from his decision. When the Commissioner has decided that an invention is not novel, he should refuse to grant a patent for it, and should tell the applicant that if he objects to that decision he can go to court, and have the matter determined there. The applicant would then have to face, not a rich rival syndicate which was trying to crush him, but merely the Commissioner, who would have no private interests to serve. That is the position which I should like to see adopted. I recognise that the Bill has not been framed upon those lines, and that the acceptance of my amendment would necessitate the passing of other amendments which would, to some extent, disturb its framework. For that reason, and because it is difficult to get a sufficient number of honourable members to take enough interest in the question to vote on other than party lines, I shall not push it . But I protest against the system which has been adopted. I think that a better system, and one which would have been less dangerous both for the public and the honest inventor, could have been adopted.",28
147,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"South Australia) The Bill is familiar to me, inasmuch as I had the honour of settling it after it had been prepared by the various patent offices. In regard to the conditions upon which patents may be granted, I was deeply impressed with the desirability of making letters patent something more than waste paper liable to be defeated by the showing at a subsequent date of 'a want of novelty, even though the patent had then passed into the possession of a bond fide purchaser for value. I should have liked to give them a document of the highest authority, such as a certificate of title under the Torrens Act. The ideal is to confer indefeasibility of title, to give by registration a guarantee of validity, backed up by something in the nature of an insurance fund. I thought at one time that perhaps we might proceed generally upon the broad fundamental lines of the Act to which I have referred, but on looking into the matter more closely, and after having the advantage of the advice of the authorities, and reading up what information was to be obtained on the matter, I came to the conclusion that, under the circumstances, we could not do what is most to be desired.",28
148,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But there is no need to grant a certificate that is known to be invalid.,29
149,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I should infinitely prefer to issue a certificate of the character I have indicated; but the nature of the inquiries which would have to be made, and the vastness of the investigation involved, would make the operation so cumbrous and expensive that I am satisfied that we can do nothing at present. At the same time the idea is a very good one, and will require further consideration. I hope that ultimately something will be done in the direction indicated.",29
150,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Shoul d we need to make inquiries beyond the Commonwealth ?,29
151,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I do not know as to that. We might lay it down that unless foreign patents are registered within Australia within a certain time they should be void so far as we are concerned. The question, however, is a very difficult one, and we are scarcely in a position at this late stage to introduce substantial amendments into the measure which has already been passed by another branch of the Legislature. At the same time. I sympathize with the suggestion made. No doubt the Prime Minister has noted that, according to the memorandum prepared by the Board of Trade, by Imperial direction, for the use of the Colonial Conference, which sat in 1902, at page 99 it was statedIn New Zealand and Tasmania the Registrar of Patents may refuse to grant a patent for an allegedinvention which he knows is not new, after giving the applicant an opportunity of being heard personally or by his agent. Then followed certain information regarding examinations as to novelty and other matters.",29
152,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,That makes the Registrar a Judge.,29
153,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Yes ; and' far less expense is involved than would attach to an appeal to a Judge.,29
154,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Onl y if the decision of the Registrar is in favour of the litigant, otherwise an appeal would have to be made to a J udge.",29
155,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"It is a pity that a number of absolutely worthless letters of registration should be granted, but we find ourselves between two difficulties. On the one hand, we could register everything, and that would involve the issue 'of a number of worthless certificates. On the other hand, 11 H 2 there is the almost superhuman difficulty attaching to the investigation necessary before we should be justified in declaring the title of the patentee to be indefeasible. The officials of the Department gave a great deal of time to the consideration of this question, and I was very pleased with their work. I hope that the exception which has beeD taken to the measure will not prevent the Prime Minister from persevering with it, because I believe that there is a general desire on the part of honourable members to place a comprehensive A ct upon the statute book, and that it is generally recognised that the B i ll now before us is an honest attempt to improve our legislation.",29
156,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," Wit h the consent of the Committee I shall withdraw my amendment. I have no desire that the Patent Office should guarantee the validity of a patent. But I wish it to abstain from issuing certificates which are known to be absolutely invalid and useless. If the authorities have reason to believe that a patent is absolutely worthless they should decline to register it , except, of course, under the direction of a Judge. I recognise the force of the statement of the right honourable and learned member for South Australia that it would be impossible to attempt to reframe this measure at this late period of the session. I desire, therefore, to withdraw my amendment. t Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",29
157,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I am obliged to the honourable member for having withdrawn his amendment. I am closely in agreement with what he has stated, but looking to the task which will lie before the Patent Office during the next three or four years, in making good the defects in the records of the various States, and in initiating a new system, I am loth to put any fresh burdens on the Commissioner. When we are well established, and have taken the great step in advance for which this legislation provides- a far greater stride than has yet been taken by any large British community except Canada- I hope that we shall be able to march onward in the direction which the honourable member has indicated.",29
158,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Why does not the Prime Minister allow the absence of novelty to be notified 1,29
159,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I have already stated the reason. It seems to me that in this measure we are undertaking as much as we can do for the next three or four years. It will be hard work to bring our patent records up to date, and to comply with all the requirements of the Bill. Once we have reached that stage I shall be strongly in favour of increasing the usefulness of the office, and of introducing the reforms indicated so far as experience warrants that course. I move That after the word "" the,"" line 8, the words ""application or "" be inserted. Amendment agreed to. Amendment (by Mr DEAKIN) posedThat the following words be added:- "" Without any condition, but if he is not so satisfied he may either(a) accept the application and specification on condition that a reference to such prior specifications as he thinks fit be made thereon by way of notice to the public ; or (6 refuse to accept the application and specification. """,29
160,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I think that the PrimeMinistershouldhave provided for a notification in case of an adverse report on the ground of absence of novelty. The examiner has to report whether an invention is a novelty, and if he reports adversely upon that point, why should it not be indicated that the patent is open to challenge on that ground t Opposition may be raised to a patent on the ground of previous publication.",30
161,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,In one case the report of the examiner is verifiable and in the other it may not be.,30
162,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But the report is not conclusive in either case.,30
163,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"In one case it may a matter of opinion, whereas in the other it is a matter of fact.",30
164,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"It is the same in eftect in each case. I consider that the patent should bear upon its face a notification of the adverse report on the ground of the absence of novelty. Such a report might very seriously affect the sale value of the patent rights. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 43If the Commissioner is not so satisfied he shall unless the objection be removed by amending the specification to his satisfaction[a] determine whether a reference to an\', and, if so, what prior specifications ought to be made in the specification by way of notice to the public, and any reference so determined upon shall he made accordingly ; (6) except from the patent any State to which the objection applies ; (c) refuse the application.",30
165,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"We have by the previous amendment attached to clause 42 the substance of this clause, and when the time comes I shall move for the adoption of a new clause, 42A, which will provide for an appeal to the Commissioner. I propose to omit the clause.",30
166,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"South Australia) pro- I observe that we have introduced a special provision excepting from the patent any State for which it cannot be properly granted. In other words, we have to pay regard to the existence of local patents. I do not notice that in the amended clause.",30
167,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I have omitted that in its entirety.,30
168,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Does not the Prime Minister think that it is necessary ?,30
169,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I think that it is of doubtful constitutionality.,30
170,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I was inclined to believe at the time. I had the Bill under consideration that a provision of this sort was necessary. I should be glad of an assurance from the Prime Minister that he has given the matter adequate consideration.,30
171,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"What the right honourable member suggests would be a most convenient and advantageous provision if we could insert it in the Bill. The Crown Law officers, however, called my attention to the means of giving effect to it, and upon consideration I came to the conclusion that, primd Jacie, the only power which the Combe monwealth possesses, is the power to issue Commonwealth patents-that is patents running throughout Australia. Having regard to the Constitution I do not see how it would be possible to issue a Commonwealth patent which did not run throughout the Commonwealth.",30
172,Mr WILKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Will a Commonwealth patent override patent rights which have been granted by a State t,30
173,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"We take the patents which have been granted by the States exactly as we find them. We do not extend them by one iota, nor diminish them in any respect.",30
174,Mr WILKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Suppos e that a man took out a patent in Queensland and also a Commonwealth patent. Would the Commonwealth patent override the State patent 1,30
175,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"When a Commonwealth patent has been issued it will not be possible for any individual to take out a State patent in respect of the same invention, so that the emergency which the honourable member contemplates cannot arise.",31
176,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,What effect will a Commonwealth patent have upon a State patent ?,31
177,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The State patents will retain all their legal force. We do not interfere with any patents which have been granted prior to this measure coming into operation.,31
178,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Is there any power to make a State patent a Commonwealth patent?,31
179,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,No . Every application for a patent will come before the Commonwealth as a fresh proposal.,31
180,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Darling Downs) I presume that under this Bill existing applications for patent rights in the different States will be preserved ? Under it no patent will be granted to the detriment of any previous patent ?,31
181,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,No .,31
182,Mr HUME COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," If a patentee has secured patent rights in one State only, will it not be possible under this Bill for some person to secure a patent for the Commonwealth which will impinge upon his State rights ? I desire to know how the patentee who has obtained patent rights in one State only can be protected against the individual who can at a later stage secure rights for the Commonwealth.",31
183,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,We cannot issue patent rights for less than the Commonwealth in my opinion.,31
184,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"South Australia) Of course clauses 42 and 43 are intended to be read together. It seems to me that, upon iuquiry we may find that some person is entitled under a State Act to obtain a patent for a particular State, and that some one else may claim, as regards the rest of the Commonwealth, the issue of a patent under the Commonwealth law. Surely such a case may conceivably occur. I take it that what we wish to do is to continue existing conditions. We do not desire to interfere with the rights enjoyed by a man under a State patent either by diminishing or extendingthem. It seems to me, however, that if an individual has secured patent rights in regard to certain States it will be possible for another party to obtain a Commonwealth patent as regards the rest of the Commonwealth.",31
185,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"There is no "" rest of the Commonwealth."" A Commonwealth patent will cover all the States or none.",31
186,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"As to a State patent, does the honourable gentleman propose to enlarge that?",31
187,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,No . . Mr KINGSTON - Then who can obtain patent rights as regards the remainder of the Commonwealth ?,31
188,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,No one can secure Commonwealth rights for a patent which has been issued by a State.,31
189,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Surely some person will be in a pesition to. claim them. Let us suppose that one man has patent rights in South Australia, and that another claims those rights for the rest of the States in the Commonwealth ?",31
190,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"That may happen under the existing law if the applicant does not take out rights in six different States, but it cannot occur after this Bill becomes operative.",31
191,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"If a man is entitled to patent rights for the Commonwealth, does the Prime Minister intend to prevent him from securing those rights ?",31
192,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Ye s j if he does not take out patent rights for the Commonwealth before the Commonwealth law comes into operation.,31
193,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Then a Commonwealth patent cannot be granted to five States in which patents could be granted before ?,31
194,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,That is so.,31
195,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I do not think that that ought to be so. We ought not to limit the rights of patentees. What is provided here isIf the Commissioner is satisfied that no objection exists to the specification on the grounds that the invention is already patented in the Commonwealth, or in any State, or is already the subject of any prior application for a patent in the Commonwealth, he shall, in the absence of any other lawful ground of objection, accept the specification. But if he is not so satisfied-if he finds upon an application being made for patent rights for the Commonwealth that part of the area is already covered by a grant for a particular State-it appears to me he should have a right to issue the patent for the remainder of the Commonwealth. sequently we made clause 43 readIf the Commissioner is not so satisfied he shall, unless the objection be removed, by ing the specification to his satisfaction except from the patent any State to which objection applies. Why should we limit the right of granting patents ? I say that the proper thing is continue the power which at present exists, only exempting from the operation of the patent that area in respect of which patent rights have been properly issued under the States laws.",31
196,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"This is not a question of what is desirable. If it were in our power to parcel out the Commonwealth, to deal with those States in which particular patents have been granted, and then to consider whether we should not issue a patent for the balance of the Commonwealth, it would be highly convenient and advantageous for us to adopt that course. But from my reading of the Constitution, I hesitate to believe that we possess any such power. The right honorState able member for South Australia, Mr. Kingston, has been arguing the question advantage, convenience, and propriety, and State. I agree with his arguments. Where I differ from him is that I doubt very much the Commonwealth has any power except to issue a Commonwealth patent. It appears to me that such a patent must of all other patents of the same_ kind throughout the Commonwealth!",32
197,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,As regards State patents which have already been granted ?,32
198,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Yes . The Commonvision and try it . wealth has no power to grant a patent for a part of the Commonwealth.,32
199,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Will this provision preclude another State from issuing patent?,32
200,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The State laws wiU applicants operate until this measure comes into operain the States? tion.,32
201,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The effect of passing a Commonwealth patent law will be to prevent the possibility of extending an existing patent to any other State t,32
202,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Yes , unless the person paring an index to the patents w hich have who desires such an extension applies for before the whole of this Act is brought into operation by proclamation. U p period it is open to any person to apply to any other State for a patent which has Conbeen taken out there. But when by proclamation we extend this Act to the whole of the Commonwealth, we shall issue amendonly one class of patents-namely , those . . . . which run throughout the Commonwealth. the Clause 42 provides that in issuing a patent for the Commonwealth we shall take into consideration whether an invention to is already patented in the Commonwealth or in any State. Where a patent has been granted in any one State the Commonwealth will be powerless to issue any other patent in respect of the same invention; and it appears to me that in the remaining five States in which no patent rights have been taken out the general public are open to make use of that invention. In giving the Commonwealth power to grant patents, the Constitution only conferred upon us the power to issue patent rights for the whole, of the Commonwealth, and not for parts of it.",32
203,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,This provision will make a State patent a Commonwealth patent ?,32
204,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,No ; it will not extend the operation of a State patent beyond the in which patent rights have been granted. But it will prevent somebody else of from taking out the same patent in another,32
205,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It will prevent the original whether patentee from doing so.,32
206,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Yes , if he has not thought it worth his while to do so prior to be clear the Act becoming operative.",32
207,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Is that seriously intended?,32
208,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I doubt if we have the power to do otherwise.,32
209,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Le t us insert the pro,32
210,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The adoption of that course might involve patentees and others in a large expenditure before the question another could be absolutely tested.,32
211,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,For how long will be permitted to apply for patents,32
212,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Until the Commonwealth is ready to take over the business of the Patents Departments. That period will necessarily depend upon the time occupied in collecting the State records, and in preT it been granted. It seems to me that when we take over this Federal power it must be t ill that exercised federally.",32
213,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,What is the position in not regard to all pending applications ?,32
214,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"They are preserved. I have been considering that question since last night, and at a later stage I intend to submit a proposal which will guarantee all pending applications which are recorded before the Commonwealth finally takes over the administration of the Patents Department. The effect of that proposal will be to provisionally protect those who desire protection throughout the Commonwealth.",33
215,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"""Why should a patentee in a single State not be allowed to apply for a patent throughout the Commonwealth ?",33
216,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Because, if the individual who has the advantage of a monopoly .does not think it is worth his while to extend his rights to the other States, why should we do so 1",33
217,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I desire to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a concrete case having reference to this point which occurred only today. morning the holder of a provisional patent called upon me. He said, "" I know that a Patents Bill is now before the Commonwealth Parliament. I cannot afford to do more than obtain protection for my invention in Victoria, and consequently I am waiting t ill the Commonwealth Patents Bill becomes law. I shall then apply for patent rights throughout the Commonwealth."" There are several other similar cases of which I have knowledge. Surely the Prime Minister will admit that in the'case to which I have referred the man would suffer a very grave injustice.",33
218,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,He would not suffer any injustice.,33
219,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I do not understand the position taken up by the Prime Minister. Does he say that the patent rights obtained by this man would be limited to Victoria, and that someone else could step in and a PPly for a patent in Queensland or New South Wales in respect of the same invention?",33
220,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"No . The holder of patent can still apply for a patent in any State, or under the proposal to which I shall ask the Committee to consent he will be able to protect it in Australia. That proposal would enable him to at once provisionally register for the whole Commonwealth.",33
221,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Would that protect him t,33
222,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"It would give him protection over the whole Commonwealth. He could not, by putting in his provisional registration for any State, secure a patent for the whole Commonwealth.",33
223,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"This man says that he has secured a provisional order in Victoria, and that he is waiting for the passing of this Bill to obtain a patent for the Commonwealth. Would it not be possible for him to give notice to the patent officer in Victoria that immediately this Bill becomes law he intends to claim his prior right in respect of a patent for the whole Commonwealth %",33
224,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But he has not had a prior right in respect of the Commonwealth. He has chosen to apply for a patent in only one State.,33
225,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I know that the Prime Minister has the constitutional difficulty in his mind.; but I venture to agree with the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn, that-we should give a practical turn This to this proposal. The whole of this most excellent Bill is designed to assist poor inventors. They have been looking forward to it as «one of the advantages of Federation, believing that it would enable them to take out a patent for the Commonwealth at a very low rate.",33
226,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"They will be able to do so, but they cannot confuse that right by making States applications now and coming to the Commonwealth hereafter unless they practically seek a patent in each of the States.",33
227,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,There is no wish to evade the necessary payment to the Commonwealth. The publication of the provisional order in this State might give information to some one else who possessed the means necessary to enable him to apply for a patent elsewhere.,33
228,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The provisional specification will not be shown to anyone.,33
229,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I have cited a concrete case, and it seems to me to be a very hard one. the Mr WILKINSON (Moreton) - I am particularly anxious that this Bill shall become law at the earliest possible date, and my frequent speeches are due not to'any desire to delay its progress, but to my interest in it. There are men who may think it worthwhile to extend their patent rights beyond any particular State, but who for want of means are unable to do so. They have been able to raise the few pounds necessary to secure a patent in one particular State, but have been unable to bear the heavy cost - of taking out a patent throughout Australia. I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether it would not be possible to convert a patent right held in any one State at the time of the passing of the Bill into a Commonwealth patent. Legal intricacies are not' always clear to the lay mind, but it seems to rae that a man who has taken out a patent, for example, in Queensland, at a cost of £ 1 5 or £18-hal f as much again as we propose to charge for the issue of a Commonwealth patent-shoul d be allowed to merge that patent into one extending over the whole Commonwealth on the passing of this Bill into law. The public would not suffer to any extent by the adoption of such a course.",33
230,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," It appears to me that the position assumed by the Prime Minister is perfectly sound and constitutional. I do not agree with the suggestion that, even if we had power to grant a patent applicable only to a portion of the Commonwealth, a Federal patent should be a kind of fragmentary affair. Our Legislature has power to pass patent laws applicable not to any one section of the Commonwealth, but to the whole of it. The Prime Minister is quite right when he says that a patent granted by us, and made applicable to only a few of the States, would be null and void. At the same time, I agree with the contention that we ought to protect those who at present have, or at the passing of the Bill will have, patent rights in only one or two States, and I believe that provision has been made for such cases. By takingactiontheholder of apatent right in any of the States will be able to obtain a Commonwealth patent. His rights are protected by this Bill. An old State patent would, in these circumstances, merge into a Commonwealth patent.",34
231,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,There is no such provision in the Bill.,34
232,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"In any event, I - passing of this Bill. think that a provision such as that would be the best way out of .the difficulty. We should provide that on application being made by the holder of an existing patent, and certain preliminaries being carried out, theoriginal right should merge into a Federal patent, and that the applicant should not be compelled to go to the whole expense and formality of making a fresh application.",34
233,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,He would have to show that there was no user throughout Australia.,34
234,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Exactly .,34
235,Sir JOHN QUICK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The point is whether the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is correct in his contention that we can issue fragmentary patents. I do not think that we can.",34
236,Mr BROAVN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," The point raised by the honourable member for Moreton is a very important one. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo objects to a patchwork system of patents ; but, if I read the Bill rightly, it will perpetuate the present patchwork system, inasmuch as it provides that a patent taken out in any State shall be recognised under the Commonwealth law only so far as that State is concerned. There is no provision that a State patent shall, on the passing of this Bill, merge into a Commonwealth patent. There is no provision that would allow the holder of a State patent to at once extend his right over the Commonwealth.",34
237,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Why should we have such a provision 1,34
238,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Why not ?,34
239,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Are not the public to be considered ?,34
240,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Since the introduction of the Bill several persons have sought my advice in regard to this question. They were disposed to protect themselves by taking out a State patent, believing that on the passing of the Bil l they would be able to convert it into a Commonwealth patent. I have had to tell, them that no such provision is made in the Bill, and that they would not be well advised in taking out a State patent to protect their rights pending the passing of this measure. The Prime Minister apparently considers that persons so situated have no rights-that if they have been unable to incur the very heavy charges involved under the existing law in taking out a patent for all Australia, they have no right now to demand that their State patent shall merge into a Commonwealth one on the I am not prepared to enter into a controversy with the honourable gentleman on the constitutional aspect of the question; but I disagree with the principle laid down by him. If the Constitution will permit of it I think that we should insert a provision in the Bill, enabling the holder of a State patent, in the absence of any valid objection, to convert it into a Commonwealth patent.",34
241,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Suppose some one had taken out a patent in another State in respect of the same article 1 . Mr BROWN - That would be a valid .objection to the granting of a Commonwealth patent. I should like to see some provision in the Bill to enable these persons to apply for the registration of their patent in respect of the Commonwealth. When the necessity arises the constitutional question can be fought out and settled by the proper tribunal. I hope that the Prime Minister will propose the insertion of a new clause enabling the holder of a patent in any State to obtain a Commonwealth patent, providing that the Commissioner considers that there is no reasonable objection to the granting of such an application.",34
242,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Darling Downs) I recognise that the position would be complicated if an amendment were moved in relation to this matter, and that we should perhaps lose the present opportunity to pass the Bill into law. The Prime Minister, however, might give us his assurance that he will look into this question and see whether it is not possible to provide that, if a person has obtained a patent in any one State which is not being used in any of the other States, he may convert it into a Commonwealth patent on making proper application. I feel that the position taken up by the honourable and learned gentleman is right in this respect: that if a patent has been granted, for example, in New South Wales, some one else should not be allowed to come in under the Commonwealth law and take out a patent in respect of the same article in all the other States of the Union. In that event, we might have two different proprietors of one patent granted in Australia.",35
243,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It might be proprietor.,35
244,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"If application were made by the original inventor, who had a patent already in existence it would not be unconstitutional to convert that patent into a Commonwealth one.",35
245,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But suppose the application had been refused in another State ?,35
246,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Many have been refused.,35
247,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"In that case the patent should not be converted into a Commonwealth one. Such an objection should be a good reason for the refusal of the application. I recognise that this is a difficult matter, and cannot be settled on mere sentimental grounds. We have to bear in mind the strong constitutional point which has been put by the Prime Minister-that we have power to grant patents only in respect of the whole Commonwealth, and that in any grant of a patent we cannot except from its operation one particular part of the Commonwealth. The position put by the honourable member for Kooyong, however, is different. His supposition is that a patent taken out in any one State by a man who has not had the means to apply for it over all Australia should be converted into a Commonwealth patent.",35
248,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I have promised to make provision in that regard.,35
249,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Quite so. I think that that is a fair and reasonable request. If the Prime Minister gives the Committee his assurance that he will enable existing State patents, in the absence of any valid objection; to be converted into Commonwealth patents, and will also preserve the rights of present applicants for patents in any of the States, the concession will be a very great one. But there is force in his position that we cannot grant patents of limited application. The Prime Minister has promised what to a certain extent is a compromise upon the only lines which the Constitution will allow. What we all desire is to encourage inventors who have already been able to obtain a patent in one or more States. If their patent rights have not been lost by user, or in any other way, in the other States, let us give them an opportunity to convert their State patents into Commonwealth patents. The Prime Minister has given us a reasonable assurance, and I think it is advisable that we should try to pass the measure as speedily as possible. the one",35
250,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"South Australia) I regret that I cannot follow the arguments put forward by some of the speakers in this connection. The scheme of the Bill was that there should not be a duplication of State patents andCommonwealth patents in the same area, but that at the same time we should recognise existing rights; that we should recognise the rights of the owner of a State patent to have the continuance of that patent within the State. But it was not intended that a man who had chosen to patent an invention in one State, reserving 'the right to patent it in the rest of the Commonwealth when facilities for doing so were provided by a Commonwealth Act, should be in any way harassed or enibarrassed. What is now proposed is that if an invention is patented in one State, there shall be no possibility of obtaining a patent for the remaining States. That was not intended, and it will cause great disappointment to many investors if the provision is carried into effect. The case to which the honourable member for Kooyong referred is but one of many. Inventors have, in many cases, been content to protect themselves in the State in which they are manufacturing, intending at some future time to take out a patent for the rest of the Commonwealth. Why should they not be allowed to do so 1 Why should men who have taken out patents in one State be in a worse position than men who have taken out no patents at all ? Or why should we deprive them of the existing right to take out patents in other States? The Prime Minister says that to give them that right will be unconstitutional. It has become the custom to say, when there is no other reason for objecting to a proposal, that it is unconstitutional, the word being used as a substitute for "" that blessed word Mesopotamia."" We have had too much of the cry. In my opinion what I suggest is not unconstitutional. We have the fullest power in this connection. paragraph xviii. of section 51 of the Constitution power is given to legislate with reference to patents and designs, the provision not being accompanied by any restrictive words as to discrimination between the States. On what ground is it unconstitutional to provide what I wish to see provided ?",35
251,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,A Commonwealth patent must be issued for the whole Commonwealth.,36
252,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The Constitution does not say so.,36
253,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It is not discrimination do what we propose.,36
254,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I think that it is.,36
255,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"We have a right to legislate as we like on the subject of patents, so long as we do not do something utterly unreasonable. AVhat is unreasonable in this connection 1 This is simply a mode of saying that existing rights shall be preserved. I expect that there are more cases of this sort than of any other. Yet we are told that we can issue patents only for the whole Commonwealth. In my opinion we can issue patents for the Commonwealth, subject to any patent that may have been ie.oued in a State or States. I ask the Attorney-General to look further into this matter. Clause 37 provides thatIn the case of all complete specifications the examiner shall also ascertain and report whether to the bsst of his knowledge(a) The invention is already patented in the Commonwealth or in any State, or is already the subject of any prior application for a patent in the Commonwealth or in any State. If an invention is already patented in the Commonwealth, no new patent should be issued except under theconditions which have been suggested ; and if it has been patented in any State, no new patent should be issued for that State, but a patent might be issued for the whole Commonwealth with the exception of that State. It seems to me that that is a reasonable provision to make. Let us make such provision, and allow the High Court afterwards to determine whether it is constitutional. Why should we prevent the holders of State patents from enlarging their rights ?",36
256,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,What the Prime Minister proposes is really discrimination against existing patentees.,36
257,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"^Yes. If the Prime Under Minister has his way, the possession of a State patent will be a disqualification for the granting of a Commonwealth patent. Under existing conditions, the holder of a State patent has the right to take out patents in other States where the invention is not in use, and we should not take away that right. If we do so, this' will be a disqualifying instead of an enabling Bill.",36
258,Mr WILKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," If the constitutional objection holds good, and it is impossible to grant a Commonwealth patent which will not apply to every State, I should like to know whether it will not be held that the existence of a patent in any State to prevents the granting of a Commonwealth patent for the patented invention, on the ground that it is not a novelty within the Commonwealth 1 I think that, inasmuch as those who have taken out patent rights in the States have paid more than we are asking for a Commonwealth patent, their rights should be recognised, and we should not lose very much if we converted their State patents into Commonwealth patents.",36
259,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Northern Melbourne) I understand that the Prime Minister has no objection to the granting of a qualified Commonwealth patent, if it be constitutional.",36
260,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Hear , hear.",36
261,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Le t me put a definite case before the Committee, so that we may not misunderstand each other. The right honourable member for South Australia is i favour of allowing a person who has ob- | tained a patent in, say, Victoria, but who at the time of the passing of this measure has not applied for a patent in New South Wales, to ask for a Commonwealth patent will be reconsidered. which would apply to New South Wales, prothe viding that there has not been user in that State. It is desirable to give patentees right, if it is not unconstitutional to do The Constitution provides that duties of Customs shall be uniform, and that we shall pass laws of taxation without discriminating between the States or parts of the States but where is the provision that the patent laws shall be uniform 1 We might as say that a post-office could not be built one State because it was not built all over covered. the Commonwealth.",37
262,Mr BROWN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The proposal of the Prime Minister is in the direction of uniformity. ' Mr HIGGINS - No doubt. The Minister has in view the expediency of as soon as possible issuing patents for the whole of Australia, and we are all in agreement with him upon that point. But if at the time the Act came into operation a patentee had not yet applied for his patent in more than one State there is a general feeling that he ought to be allowed to apply for letters patent in any do other State, and that in the absence of prior user he should be allowed to qualify. It must be shown that at the time the Conthink stitution came into force a patent had issued in one of the States. Of course, after the Act came into force we could allow a man to apply for an absolutely patent for any one State. It is only cases where a patent has already been issued in one or more States that a patent limited to other States could be applied for. I think that a good deal of the heat of this debate has arisen partly from the character of the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, who is strenuous at times-in breaking a butterfly on the wheel, monwealth patent. as in everything else-and to a misunderConstitution standing. Perhaps it would be better the Prime Minister to postpone the clause for the present, and to think over it.",37
263,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"South Australia) thoroughly agree with the the right honourable and learned member for I South Australia. Last night I drew atten! j tion to the same point when I moved in the | direction of conferring power on an applin I cant for a patent to ask that it shall be limited to a particular State. Several patent agents have drawn attention to this, ques| tion. I think we should strike out the ! clause, on-the understanding that clause 42 We ought t c add provision contained in paragraph b of the present clause to clause 42 ; otherthat wise I shall have to move the amendment so. of which I have given notice. The clause applies only to patents which were granted prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth. It is only where a patent has not ; been made applicable to the whole of the States prior to the establishment of the well Commonwealth that a patent may be in granted limited to the part not at present",37
264,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I think the course indicated by the honourable and learned member for South Australia is the correct one. The clause is useless for the purposes for which it was originally intended, and the greater part of it has been incorporated in clause 42. I think, therefore, that it must go. If any provision of this kind be included, it should be separate and apart. It will require to be very care; fully drafted, and I shall be glad if the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, who has had so much to with the drafting of this measure, will a give the matter his attention and draft a clause which will embody his view. I that he will meet with grave difficulbeen ties. When the Bill passed into my hands I found myself at an early stage face to not face with the question whether it was innew tended to apply in the manner now dein sired-in what I call the partial manner. I at once entertained doubt as to our constitutional competency. Consequently, I adopted what I thought to be a safe attitude. A State patent was to remain a State patent, and, unless it were extended before the Commonwealth was established, it was not to be all extended to the point of making it a ComBy section 51 of the this Parliament is entitled for to make laws with respect to such matters as weights and measures, bills of exchange, bankruptcy and insolvency, and patents. It cannot be urged that we I are entitled to legislate partially in any position put by of those matters.",37
265,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Even as to the machinery 1,38
266,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"This is something more than machinery. My honourable and learned friend was very ingenious in suggesting a way out of the difficulty. He says : Give a Commonwealth certificate in respect of a patent which has already been granted in one or more States. First of all make it aCommonwealth patent, and then omit from the certificate Victoria, or New South Wales, or Queensland, if in those States patents shall already have been granted, and give to the patentee or his assigns a monopoly in the remainder of the States. That is a possible escape perhaps.",38
267,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Why is there an express provision as to uniformity in regard to taxation and not in regard to other laws ?,38
268,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Because the same kind of uniformity is not contemplated. This is expressly a matter of territorial legislation. The advantage to be derived from adopting the suggestion of the honourable and learned member is more superficially attractive than real. The cases in which valuable patents have been taken out in one State and not in others, must be very rare indeed.",38
269,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I think the Minister is wrong.,38
270,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Eve n within my own limited experience I know of cases in which it would be extremely difficult to carry out the proposal of the honourable and learned member. I admit that a provision such as that suggested might prove very useful, but I deny that it is important. Take the case of the cyanide process, for instance. That has been patented in every State. A patent was granted in New South Wales, which has since been revoked, whilst in Victoria the rights of the patentees have been purchased by the State Government. How could we deal with that patent ? Could we grant a patent for New South Wales, where the patent has already been revoked t Then, again, to whom should the patent be granted-to the Government of Victoria, which have purchased it so far as it applies to that State, or to the original inventor or some of his assigns? Then, again, there would be different assigns for different patents which have been granted subject to special conditions. This is particularly the case in Queensland. All these would have to be dealt with upon a territorial basis. If a patent had been granted in Victoria, and it were desired to extend it elsewhere, and it had been published and used in Queensland, but not in New South Wales, we should have to retain in a Commonwealth patent the boundary between New South Wales and Queensland, because no certificate could be granted for the latter State. Suppose it had been published in South Australia, and could not be registered there, but that it had not been published in Western Australia, and that a patent could begranted to the latter State, we should have to.grant a patent for odd States. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has put the case of a patent which has been taken out for one State only. Take the converse case, in which a patent might have been obtained for five States and not for the remaining one. Does my honourable friend contend that we could grant a Commonwealth patent in order to cover only one State. I shall very carefully reconsider the whole question, which is surrounded with difficulty, and invite the able assistance of the right honourable and learned member for South Australia. I shall ask him to state his proposition. We are now dealing with a proposal to give those who have already obtained rights in some of the States an opportunity to obtain similar rights in other States by means of a Commonwealth patent.",38
271,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But the Minister would not refuse a man his rights to a patent in five States because somebody else had obtained a patent in a sixth State 1,38
272,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"No , not if it be possible to give it. I shall willingly reconsider the whole question, because my desire is to find a way out of the difficulty. Sir JOH N QUICK - Does the Minister propose to consider the constitutional aspect of the question ?",38
273,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Yes , that is the only one with which I. am concerned. We are all agreed that if we can do what is desired legitimately it would be a good thing.",38
274,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It will not deprive any person of his rights.,38
275,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,We do not do that now.,38
276,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,This will block a State patentee from proceeding any further.,38
277,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"It will if he does not take the necessary steps to protect his rights throughout the Commonwealth before the Bill comes into operation. Persons to whom State patents have been issued can at any time within the next two or three months make application on all the States to protect their rights. The right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, desires to give State patentees an opportunity to secure a Commonwealth patent. Whether or not that can be done under our Constitution I shall advise the Committee at a later stage. Personally, I hope that it can be done. Consequently, I shall not object to the inclusion of this proposal, especially if it is made severable from the rest of the Bill. Then, if at any time its validity should be challenged, and the Court decides adversely to it, the remainder of the Bill will continue in operation.",38
278,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I think that the remarks of the Prime Minister are fair enough. At the same time, I cannot retire from the position I have taken up regarding the necessity of a provision of the character to which I refer. If the right honourable gentleman had not interfered with clause 42, he would not have experienced the slightest trouble in dealing with this matter. I understand that the policy of the Bill, as regards novelty, is chat if an invention has been previously patented a Commonwealth patent will not be issued. Clause 37 provides for that. will be made as to whether it has previously been patented, and upon the report of the Commissioner the granting of the patent will depend. Should the report be favourable the patent will issue as a matter of course. According to clause 42, if the Commissioner is satisfied that no objection exists to the specification, on the ground that the invention is already patented either in the Commonwealth or in any State, he shall accept the specification. Clause 43 merely set out what was the position in case the Commissioner was not so satisfied-in the event of his discovering that a prior patent existed either in regard to the whole of the Commonwealth or to any State. It declaresIf the Commissioner is not so satisfied, he shall,, unless the objection be removed by amending the specification to his satisfaction(a) Determine whether a reference to any, and, if so, what prior specifications ought to be made in the specification by way of notice to the public, and any reference so determined upon shall be made accordingly ; (6) except from the patent any State to which the objection applies ; (c) refuse the application. Paragraph a deals with cases in which there is a difference between the patent which is proposed and any patent which is already in existence-case s which the Commissioner may well settle. Paragraph b was intended to apply to cases in which there was no doubt as to che identity of two patents - the State patent which was originally granted, and the Commonwealth patent which was proposed to be granted. In such instances it was intended to give the Commissioner power to except from the patent any State to which the objection applied. Where there was a. doubt as to whether two patents covered exactly the same ground, patent No. 2 was issued subject to patent No. 1. The third alternative is to refuse the application. I do not know how the' matter could have been put plainer. What does the Attorney-General propose? Simply to jumble two clauses together, so as to give the power to specify patent No. 1 when there is a difference, also to give the Commissioner power to refuse the application, but to deny him the power to except from patent No. 2 the State to which the objection referred. It is not very much of a difference; but I think it is infinitely better not to allow the patentee and the public to be worried by a comparison of the two An inquiry patents. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that they are identical, it is well to permit him to except from patent No. 2 the whole State covered by patent No. 1, so that there may be no doubt in the minds of anyone concerned that the Commonwealth patent does not refer to a thing of that sort. I cannot put the position plainer, and I do not think it requires to be put plainer. It is an additional power which I venture to think will require to be exercised. I can assure the Prime Minister that there are many cases of the character referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong. Numbers of intending patentees are awaiting the facilities which this Bill offers for obtaining Commonwealth patents. I think that where persons have already secured a State patent they should be assisted in every possible way. Although some men's rights may not extend to the whole of the Commonwealth, but to five-sixths of it, T think they are entitled to equal consideration with those who enjoy the larger privilege. I hold that the adoption of terms such as those which were originally employed will tend towards simplicity, and I hope that further consideration on the part of the Prime Minister may lead to that end",39
279,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," The right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, desires to insert in the Bill a provision by which any person who is not the patentee of an invention in one State may apply for and obtain patent rights in respect of it in any other State or throughout the rest of the Commonwealth. The impression of the Prime Minister is that the Constitution will not permit of that being done. Should further investigation confirm his present impression, would it not be possible to give to the same patentee the right to obtain a patent which will cover the whole of the Commonwealth, including the State in which he has already secured protection? The reason why we cannot interfere with a patent which is already in existence is that by doing so we should be meddling with individual rights. But where the same individual is concerned we are not trenching upon any person's right. Should he wish to substitute for a State patent a Commonwealth patent which will extend to the State in which he has already obtained protection, it would be extremely hard if he could not do so. A man may recently have patented an invention in one State. It is impossible for him to determine what is the value of that patent until it has been tested. It may prove to be veiy valuable, and consequently he may desire to secure patent rights in the other States. In such circumstances it would be a great pity if this Bill prevented him from doing so. If we cannot go as far as the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, wishes- a proceeding which is most desirable if the Constitution permits of it - I trust that the Prime Minister will look into the matter with a view to ascertain whether it is not possible to grant Commonwealth patents to State patentees. Clause negatived. Clauses 44 and 45 agreed to. Clause 46In addition when a complete specification has been accepted, the Commissioner shall advertise the acceptance in the prescribed manner, and thereupon the application and specification be open to public inspection.",40
280,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Northern Melbourne). - I wish to call attention to this clause, which provides for advertising specifications after their acceptance. Of course the term "" acceptance "" means that any specification upon the face of it is a proper one, but it does not necessarily mean that a patent will be granted. The object of advertising is to enable people-riva l inventors or others-to lodge objections, and to show cause why the patent should not be granted. Of course the report of the Examiner upon the novelty or otherwise of any invention will not be available to the public. But the advertisement is inserted with the object of directing attention to the proposed patent. I am assured that a practice is in vogue-muc h to the injury of honest inventors-under which, as soon as the specification relating to any invention is made public, patent agents send a copy of it to foreign countries, and take out patents there before the inventor here has had an opportunity to get his patent. The result is that the man in Australia whose brains are responsible for the invention loses the result of his work, and the thief abroad gets the benefit of it. It is this fact which induces me to oppose the idea of advertising specifications. The Bill, as introduced, provided for a thorough examination as to novelty.",40
281,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,That provision still remains.,40
282,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It has been to a large extent removed. The honourable member will realise presently that the only provision that now remains relates to the private report of the Commissioner-whic h is not to be used as a basis for granting or refusing a patent-as to whether the invention is novel.,40
283,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,That is to be communicated to the applicant.,40
284,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Otherwis e it will be kept private.,40
285,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,l b will be kept from the public.,40
286,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Unde r the Bill as it stands an application for a patent will not be refused because of want of novelty. I am and always have been in favour of a thorough official examination as to novelby. I do nob mean to say that such an examination would provide a guarantee as to the novelty of the article or process sought to shall be patented. That guarantee could not be given because the examination would take place before the rival inventors and those who desired to use the article had been heard. It would be impossible to say on the ex parte statement of an applicant and a search made by the official examiners that the article in question was novel, but in ninety cases out of one hundred the fact that a thorough examination for novelty has been made by an official examiner gives a practical guarantee of novelty. The result is that the inventor is placed in a better position in dealing with capitalists and the public generally than would otherwise be the case. If a patent is granted only after an examination for novelty has been made, its value is practically ten times greater than is that of a patent which has been granted without any such precaution. It is true that the examination does not assure the novelty of the patent, but there is such a strong probability that an article which has stood that testis novel, that capitalists are willing to help the inventor by taking a share in his invention. I am assuming at present that the Committee will abide by its decision that there shall be no examination for novelty. If no such examination is to take place there will be Still less reason for making a specification public. What is to be gained by adopting such a course ? The fact that a patent has been granted 'will in no way prove that it relates to an article which is novel, and, therefore, nothing is to be gained by advertising a specification. Rival inventors and the public generally are not bound to read it, and even if an advertisement is published, inviting objections to the application, it does not follow that outsiders will accept the invitation. There is no assurance of novelty in regard to a patent which has been granted after the publication of an advertisement of this kind. I at one time met a patentee in America who felt very aggrieved. He complained bitterly that under the American law a patent is granted to only the actual inventor, and that it is only given to him if the invention was not known at the time of his discovery, as distinguished from the time of its introduction into America. He said that there are English patent agents in Washington who are always on the look out for new patents, and that when they discover anything of the kind they at once send particulars to England and secure the patent rights there. Owing to the English law, which allows a patent to be granted to the man who first imports an invention into the country, and not solely to the actual discoverer, the pilferer is able to obtain a right and to rob the brains of the American inventor. When these facts were placed before me by this gentleman, I began to speak to him about the injustice of the United States copyright law, but he said- "" A patent is far more valuable than anything relating to copyright, and in this regard you Britishers are the biggest robbers in creation."" I feel that if in dealing with this Bil l we find a provision which will assist pilferingof that kind, without giving any compensating benefit, we ought to strike it out. Having regard to the fact that there is no provision as to novelty in the Bill, what can be gained by requiring a specification to be advertised? It will be said, of course, that it is an evil to grant patents which are of no use, and which must mislead those who deal with the holders of them. That is quite true, and I admit that there ought to be an examination for novelty, but there is not",40
287,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,We shall make another effort in that direction.,41
288,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I trust that the honourable member will succeed in his endeavour to provide for such an examination, and I promise to give hiin my support. As the Bill stands, however, nothing is to be gained by advertising specifications as is proposed. It will simply enable strangers to take advantage of an inventor's genius. It will delay applications, and at the same time it will insure no greater certainty as to the grant of the patent being of service. It is true that the advertising of a specification will enable opposition to be entered; but even if objection were taken, no guarantee of novelty would be forthcoming. Very few people search for advertisements of this description. A few patent agents certainly do so, for they are always anxious to send details of inventions to other countries, in order to secure the patent rights there. The keenest look-out is invariably kept in America- I do not suppose that it is so strong in Australia-for any new and marketable invention; and it seems to me that no compensating advantage is to be gained by the publication of advertisements of this kind. The proper course to pursue would be to allow a patent to issue after the applicant had satisfied the examiners and the Commissioner, and to give power to revoke a patent by machinery as simple as could be devised. If , in these circumstances, a man said- "" I do not want to have this patent standing in my way, the patentee has no right to it "" ; the answer would be- "" The patent has been granted, but you are at liberty to take advantage of simple machinery for its revocation.' I do not think the Bill provides a sufficiently simple method to secure the revocation of a patent which ought not to have been granted. The necessity for simplicity will be still greater if no examination as to novelty is to take place. It is provided in clause 46 thatWhen a complete specification has been accepted the Commissioner shall advertise the accepti ance in the prescribed manner, That provision will be of very little service, but there is no harm in it and thereupon the application and specification shall be open to public inspection. I would say that as soon as the patent has been granted, the specification should be open to the fullest inspection, but that we ought not to allow it to be open to public examination before the grant has been made-befor e the patentee has obtained a foothold in the country. As soon as a man has obtained a patent in Australia, he. is in a better position to take steps to patent his invention in other parts of the world.",41
289,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But what about opposition. Surely the public should have a chance to object ?,42
290,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Certainly . But there is no provision in the Bill which will render opposition to an application of any-value. There is no guarantee that such opposition will be of any avail. What is to be gained by advertising for opposition unless, after it has been found that no opponents are forthcoming, the patentee is open to all the risk of action being taken against him in the law courts ? I do not know of any law under which men who work with their brains are more unjustly treated than they are under the patents laws. It is to the interest of patent agents to get their applications granted, in order that they may earn their commission. Having suceeeded in doing so, they leave the poor inventors to the mercy of the men who will use their invention and say that it has been used before, with the result that the question of novelty has to be fought out in the law courts. If I had my way, I should provide a much simpler scheme than this. I should say, in the first instance, that we should have a thorough examination by official examiners to determine the question of novelty. Then we ought to give every opportunity to a man who thinks that a patent should not have been granted, to apply for its revocation; but we should not allow him to see the specification before the grant has been made. In nine cases out of ten the examinees, if competent, may be trusted.",42
291,Mr KINGSTON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Of what is the honourable and learned member afraid ?,42
292,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I am afraid that if we allow a specification to be made public before the application for the patent to which t relates has been granted, we shall enable men from abroad to send copies of it to other countries, and to obtain patents there before the inventor in Australia has secured a foothold here. I am assured by inventors that this practice is by no means uncommon. I would suggest that the clause be omitted. If this be done, consequential alterations will have to be made in other clauses, but I should not venture to interfere in that direction. I should leave that work to the Prime Minister. There is no harm in advertising the acceptances, though I do not think there is any advantage in doing so, because it is a mere preliminary stage. I hope the Committee will negative the clause.",42
293,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"If the Committee strike out the clause they practically destroy the Bill. It has been drafted upon the latest English system, developed by an extension in the direction of novelty further than we originally proposed to go, whereas if this clause is negatived it will mean the substitution of the American system which has just been commended by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. Under the American system the examiners are, not merely experts, but judges. They can require further information, and obtain it. They can insist upon alterations, and there is no appeal from their refusal to grant a patent.",42
294,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,There is an appeal to the Examiner-in-Chief.,42
295,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I regret that the honourable member for Bland was absent when, on an earlier clause, the question of novelty was debated at some length.",42
296,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Ye t the Prime Minister assured me that the transposition would not alter the effect of the Bill.,42
297,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"No ; very far from it . AVe spent more than an hour discussing an amendment moved by the honourable member for North Sydney, in connection with which I very elaborately explained the exact point to which we went in regard to novelty, and the point to which he wanted us to go. The suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne revives the whole issue.",42
298,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Did not the Prime Minister tell me that he intended simply to transpose a paragraph from one clause to another ?,43
299,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The object of the transposition was to make "" novelty"" an element.",43
300,Mr A MCLEAN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Wan t of novelty is nota barrier.,43
301,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"That is so, but what some honourable members desire is that want of novelty shall be a barrier. The Bill provides that the knowledge of the Patent Office in regard to novelty shall be placed at the disposal of the would be patentee. He is to be given all the information possible as to the obstacles in his path, and, if he then chooses to accept a patent, he does so at his own risk.",43
302,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,And is able to swindle the public.,43
303,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The public will not be injured because, when the acceptance of an application for a patent is notified, objection can be taken to it. Those who are interested in other inventions which they consider are affected will always be ready to challenge an application for a new patent. The challenge will afford an opportunity for the question of novelty tobesettled. Accordingto theoriginal proposal, the question of novelty had to be determined as a condition of obtaining a patent. The Bill now provides that would be patentees shall have the benefit of all the knowledge in the possession of the Department, so that they can re-shape or alter their inventions in order to avoid opposition; but the Department is not to refuse an application on the ground of want of novelty. If, knowing the risk, an inventor is ready to accept a patent, he is at liberty to do so. Instead of making novelty an essential element in the examination of an application, we make it a possible objection if opposition is raised.",43
304,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,And thus help the lawyers. - Mr THOMSON - The Department issues a patent which it knows to be invalid.,43
305,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"No ; but it issues patents for inventions which it suspects to be not novel. The suspicion of the Department may be ill-founded, however, and therefore we allow would be patentees to take the risk, if .they are willing to do so, of accepting a patent. The novelty question is revived again by the proposal of the - honourable and learned member for Northern I Melbourne. If the clause were negatived, j che whole Bill would have to be recast. I He is prepared to allow the public officer to be both judge and jury, and to refuse to issue a patent until he is satisfied that there is novelty in the invention for which it is asked. The patentee, however, would still be liable to be brought before the Courts to test the alleged novelty. The honourable and learned member has stated that patents are very rarely challenged after there has been such an examination in regard to novelty as he asks for, but I find that during the years 1895, 1S96, and 1897, the United States Courts declared seventy-six patents to be invalid, while for the last three years of which I have been able to obtain the figures the English Courts declared only twenty-nine patents to be invalid.",43
306,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But many more patents are issued in the United States than in Great Britain.,43
307,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"An honourable member has stated that twice as many patents are issued in the United States as are issued in the mother country, but if the English figures are doubled they still remain below the American figures. I do not press the argument too far, but the facts go to show that there is not the exemption from legal attacks under the American system which is generally supposed to. exist. It is well known that patent cases in the Courts of America occupy a very large body of legal practitioners, as well as a great many patent agents, and that the fights over patents are as keen, if not keener, in that country than anywhere else in the world. The examination into the element of novelty, exhaustive as it often is, does not prevent law suits, and I do not think any examination would do so.",43
308,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It must reduce their number.,43
309,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"That is probable; but when regard is had to the number of applications with which the examiners have to deal, it seems impossible that they should be able to allot to each application the time necessary to make the finding as sure as it is made after an investigation by a court of law. The question of novelty is always indeterminate, and with the multiplication and intricacy of inventions in all countries, even the most elaborate investigation cannot do more chan approach the goal of satisfaction.",43
310,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But examination by publie officers is less expensive than examination in the courts.,44
311,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"As a rule; but a case has been placed before me in which an Australian patent agent has been endeavouring for seven years to satisfy the American examiners, although he was able to obtain a patent in Australia in a very short space of time.",44
312,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"An invention may be courts, novel in Australia, and yet not novel in America.",44
313,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"That is so ; but a numor ber of cases have been brought under my notice in which inventors have vainly endeavoured, year after year, to obtain patents in America for what they allege to be relatively simple inventions.",44
314,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Every applicant for patent thinks his invention a simple one.,44
315,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"A recent report of the would beUnited States Commissioner of Patents shows that upwards of 21,000 cases had been more than two years before the office, invention, 2,000 eases more than five years, 150 cases his agent more than ten years, and twelve more than fifteen years.",44
316,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Sometime s a man wants back to obtain a patent for a machine to provide perpetual motion.,44
317,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Thes e are not cases of that sort.,44
318,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I think that in nine out of ten of those cases the American authois rities have postponed the application, said to the applicant-""If you bring us certain evidence we will consider the matter; but, as things stand, we cannot grant patent.""",44
319,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I have another authoWhen rity here, which will, I think, carry great weight with ' the honourable and learned member. The following excerpt is taken from an article published in Engineering, 4th March, 189 2- "" As helping to show what small value really to be placed upon the preliminary tion system, it maybe interesting to mention that in Germany many patents granted after official examination have been declared novelty, and that Dr Edmunds, a barrister, who has devoted much attention to, and has written an exhaustive treatise upon, patent law, in course of the discussion which followed the reading of Mr Lloyd Wise's presidential address at Chartered Institute of Patent Agents, last vember, said that he had recently had an portune of personally inspecting the worktain ine of the examination as to noveHy in the United States, and of talking to some of interested. the examiners on the subject. He must confess that he went to the States rather enamoured of the American examination system, but he bad returned quite the reverse. It appeared to him that the examination as to novelty was in a large number of cases highly vexatious and troublesome, that it led to an enormous amount of correspondence and worry and expense, and, further, that even when the patent was granted there was very little guarantee as to its validity. He had been told by these who were in a position to know, that something like70 percent, of the total number of patents granted were, when litigated in the declared void. What could be the value of an examination when that was the case ? Not 70 per cent, of the patents granted in this country, anything like that number, were declared void. The Scientific American of 23rd April, 1892, contains a leading article on patents, which, after dealing with the huge monopoly unduly gained in the United States by the a American Bell Telephone Company, suggests the amendment of the law, so that the effect To dispeuse with the present S3'.stem of official examination into the novelty of the and place that duty where it more properly belongs, viz., upon the applicant or This proposed change would relieve the Patent Office from a vast amount of labour, enable it to issue patents promptly to every applicant, prevent the holding of cases on legal or technical grounds, and prove of the highest advantage to the public and to inventors. I do not attach great importance to these statements, because they were made ten years ago, but they tend to show that novelty a relative term. We cannot be entirely and satisfied of the novelty of an invention. No man can possibly be aware of all that has transpired in every country, and the a question arises as to the measure of the novelty to which we are prepared to certify. the honourable member for North Sydney put before the Committee the reasonable proposal that where there was obviously no novelty in an invention, a of patent should be refused, I asked him not to press it at present, because we have the ought enormous task before us of putting the examinawhole of the State records in order.",44
320,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The proposal would affect void for want of only new patents.,44
321,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Yes , but in the meantime the new office will have the burthe den of all the old patents upon it, and some the considerable time must elapse before all the Noold records are adjusted, corrected, and opindexed so that the information they conmay be readily available to every one",44
322,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But the Minister proposes to cast upon the office the extra burden reporting as to the novelty of inventions.,45
323,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Yes , but we do not cast upon the Patent Office the responsibility of defeating the proposal. We propose that the information shall be placed at che posal of the inventor.",45
324,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"That would impose a great burden upon the office, without accomnations plishing any practical end.",45
325,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"No doubt it will impose a considerable burden upon the office, will mark a great step in advance in the practice with regard to patents, because ventors require to be informed of the cumstances which lead to the conclusion that there is an absence of novelty in their inventions. It seems to _rae that that about as far as we can go in regard to examination as to novelty at present. When we have established the Patent the Office, steps will be taken to extend these examinations as to novelty. If , however, we were to be plunged into the adoption of issued here. a system altogether new to Australia, and which, although it has been followed in America, has its defects, we should find great difficulty in taking up the work of administration which has been carried on the States upon entirely different methods. We are now face to face with difficulties which must be multiplied immensely if we introduce an entirely new system.",45
326,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I desire to know whether the Prime Minister proposes to substitute any Other provision for this clause or to modify it ?,45
327,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I do not see how we can modify it . The scheme of the Bill contemplates that any dispute with reference to a patent shall cake place before it is granted. If there are no objectors, and the burden is to be thrown upon the examiners, spected and if, after the examiners have finished tion their work, the question is to be one enor tirely for the Courts, an entirely scheme will have to be adopted. I believe the thefts of patents to which the honourable and learned member has referred as having taken place in America and Great Britain have now practically been done away with, because I understand that, under the Treaty of Paris, a reciprocal arrangement has been entered into by which twelve months' protechis tion is assured. The Bill has been drafted with the objectof enabling the Commonwealth Patent Office to receive similar consideration I under that Treaty. The evil referred to of was a very grave one while it lasted, but now it seems to have been abolished. The honourable member's amendment, innocent as it may appear, would have the effect of substituting a system entirely different from disthat with which we are acquainted in Australia. It is true that under the Victorian and West Australian systems examias to novelty are provided for, but in neither case is so much responsibility thrown upon the examiners as is suggested but it by the honourable member.",45
328,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"How far does the Treaty inof Paiis cover section 103 of the English cirPatents Act which provides for provisional protection? I understand that under the treaty of Paris twelve months' is protection is granted, but not under the conditions such as I mentioned. If an application were pending here and specifications were sent to France there would be nothing to prevent the registration in that country before the patent could be",45
329,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I understood that provision was made against anything of that kind, but I may be in error. The information in suppliedtomeledmeto suppose that the protection was good for twelve months. The whole question now before us is whether we should alter the system proposed by the Bill and substitute that adopted in America, because that seems to be the natural corollary of the honourable member's proposal. If any such vital change were made it might be impossible to pass the Bill this session. Clause agreed to. Clause 47Except as provided in section forty-one, reports of examiners shall in no case be published or be open to public inspection, or be liable to be inor produced in any legal proceeding unless the Court or person having power to order inspecor production certificates that such inspection production is desirable in the interests of jusdifferenc tice and ought to be allowed.",45
330,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"- I am advised that if this clause is passed in its present form, an applicant for a patent may be subjected to considerable hardship. There is no reason why an applicant should be called upon to fight in the dark, without any knowledge of the objections urged against application. In the United States and Canada, if any difficulty arises the examiner reports fully to the applicant as to the grounds upon which he takes exception to the application. I am not prepared to propose an amendment, but I mention the matter to the Prime Minister, because"" I am quite sure that he wishes to protect applicants for patents.",45
331,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Practically , the invariable rule has been to treat the reports of the-examiners in the way proposed, and it is very often to the interests of the applicants themselves that this practice should be followed. It is of great advantage to the applicants to be informed of the purport of the reports against them. We have made provision to that effect in clause 41, and consequential amendments are to be made later on. The question as to how far these reports should be made public has been very carefully considered by the officials concerned, who have advised that this provision should be retained. We have made a considerable step in advance by inserting provisions which will place the patentees in possession of the most material part of the information at our disposal.",46
332,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Northern Melbourne) Is not the reference in this clause to clause 4 1 a mistake ? There is no provision in clause 41 with regard to the publication or inspection of the reports of the examiners. think that there must have been some change in the numbering of the clauses, and that clause 39 should be referred to.",46
333,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I do not think there is any mistake, but I shall look into the matter. Clause agreed to. Clauses 4Sjto 50 agreed to. Clause 51 verbally amended and agreed to. Clause 52(1) Any person may within two months from the advertisement of the acceptance of a complete specification, or within such further time not exceeding one month as the Commissioner on application made within such two months allows, give notice at the Patent Office of opposition to the grant of the patent on any of the following grounds, but on no other :[a) That the applicant has obtained the invention from the person giving such notice (hereinafter referred to as the opponent), or from a person of whom he is the legal representative or assignee or nominee ; (6) That the invention has not been communicated to the applicant by the actual inventor, his legal representative, or assignee (if the actual representative, or assignee is not resident in the Commonwealth); (c) That the invention has been patented in the Commonwealth on an application of prior date or has been patented in a State; (d) That the complete specification describes or claims an invention other than that described in the provisional specification, and that such other invention forms the subject of an application made by the opponent in the interval between the leaving of the provisional specification and the leaving of the complete specification; (e) That the invention is not novel or has been alreadj' in possession of the public with the consent or allowance of the inventor ; (f) That the invention has been described in a book or other printed publication published in the Commonwealth before the date of the application, or is otherwise in the possession of the public.",46
334,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Northern Melbourne) Does the Prime Minister think that the provisions contained in this clause have been sufficiently worked out ? For instance, paragraph c declares that any person within two months from the advertising of the acceptance of a complete specification may give notice of opposition to the granting of any patent, on the ground that the invention to which it refers has been prievously patented in the Commonwealth, or in a State. The fact that an invention has been patented in a State is to be regarded as an objection to the I issue of a Commonwealth patent. Of course, that provision bears directly upon the question which has already been raised by several honourable members. But I would point out that if any alteration is to be effected in the policy of this measure, a similar alteration must be made here. Paragraph e sets forth as a possible ground for opposition to the issue of any patent, that the invention to which it refers is not novel. Paragraph f covers the same ground. Is that intended ?",46
335,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I admitted last nightthat in portions of the Bill-and this is one of them-the drafting was not that which I should have adopted, nor do I think it is that which would have been followed by the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, had it not been pressed upon him by the Patent Officers. They declare that the public have come to place a specific meaning upon these terms, and that therefore they should be adhered to. At the same time. I think that they might have - been disposed of by a briefer and simpler inventor, his legal statement.",46
336,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,To what Acts do the sidenotes refer?,46
337,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,To English Acts.,46
338,Mr MCDONA LD,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I should like to ask the Prime Minister if he thinks that two months is a sufficient time within which to allow of objections being wealth. taken to the granting of any patent ? Only this afternoon the case of the patentto ing of the cyanide process was mentioned. this kind ? In that case the patentees really had no legal standing in Queensland until they secured an amendment of their patent. These matters are usually advertised in the Government Gazette- a publication which the average person does not read. As a result the patentees of the cyanide process were allowed to amend their patent in such a way as to give them power, in the event of any other chemical being discovered for the extraction of gold-n o matter how remote it might be from cyanide-to claim that it was covered by their patent rights. Consequently the mining industry in Queensland had to pay a royalty upon a large quantity of gold which was extracted by this process. Indeed the northern portion of that State alone must have contributed £100,000 by way of royalty. I think that the period of two months prescribed in this clause should be extended to at least three months.",47
339,Mr WILKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I do not to lodge their objections. like this provision. More than two months might be occupied in reaching the centres population, where the Patent Offices will be months. established, from the remote parts of the different States. The time limit imposed by the clause is altogether too brief. Paratograph J sets forth, as a ground of objection, that the invention has been with described in a book or other printed publication issued in the Commonwealth before the date of the application. The provision, it seems to me, will deprive a man, who bas obtained a patent in any State, of his right to become a Commonwealth Commissioner patentee. I wish to preserve to him that right, and I am not at all sure that we have done that, despite the assurances I moveof the Prime Minister to the contrary. Let us suppose for example that a tained a patent in New South Wales in 1899, and that another individual, taking advantage of that invention, obtained patent in respect of it in Victoria the ing year, under this Bill who would the priority of claim ? The original inventor would probably be the man who patented the invention first. But two conflicting claims would arise.",47
340,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,That is one of the many difficulties which must occur if we attempt to extend State patents to the Common,47
341,Mr WILKINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Is it not possible surmount those difficulties in a Bill of ,47
342,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I am inclined to think there is a great deal in the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy. I find that the report which I have in my hand relating to the British patent system throughout the Empire does not refer to this point. Reference to the Victorian Act, however, shows that in connection with the granting of patents in this State two months are allowed for lodging objections. If that period is not too long in the case of Victoria, it certainly does not err upon the side of liberality in the case of the Commonwealth. Of course it is very undesirable to keep an applicant whose patent has been accepted upon the tenter-hooks for a longer period than is necessary. Every extension of the time within which objections may be lodged constitutes an injury to him. We should, therefore, only allow such a period to elapse as will afford persons throughout the Commonwealth a fair opportunity to I feel some hesitancy in suggesting any further term, of but I am prepared to extend it to three Amendment (by Mr - MCDONALD) agreed That the word "" two,"" lines 1 and 5, be omitted, a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""three.""

343,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Darling Downs) That after the word ""appeal"" the words "" to man obthe High Court or "" be inserted. There is just one other matter upon which I should like the opinion of the Prime a Minister. Is it not advisable that we followshould preserve an appeal in these matters have to the Crown Law officer? It has been suggested to me by several patent agents that instead of compelling an appeal to be made t© the Supreme Court, it might be cheaper and more expeditious to permit first . an appeal to the Law Officer and afterwards, if necessary, a further appeal from him to the Supreme Court.",47
344,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The undoubted difficulty is that the adoption of such a pro, posal would mean the introduction of still another tribunal. Although I am told that in Victoria comparatively few appeals have been made from the decisions of the Crown Law Officer, there is no doubt that the suggestion of the honourable and learned member, if carried into effect, would interpose another tribunal in cases in which contentious litigants were concerned. S© far, I am without prejudice against the proposal, but I am assured by patent agents that they much prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court.",48
345,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Darling Downs) I presume that the first Commonwealth Patent Office will be at the seat of Government.,48
346,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Yes .,48

I have been consulted with regard to this question by several patent agents, who think that if the enlargement of the time of payment were extended to twelve months, and proportionate charges made for each additional month over the period at, present provided for in the Bili, considerable revenue would be obtained.

367,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"This is a question relating to th6 time of sealing. It has been pointed out that the term of sixteen months, although apparently universally agreed upon as fair, might in some very exceptional cases be insufficient.

I cannot say that it is altogether lost, because a man may use his provisional patent to some extent, although he is not fully protected by it . He has only a limited use of his patent, and cannot dispose of it . The inventors desire that the patent should date from the time of sealing and issuing.

That is frequently by first-class inventors. In one case of which I became aware, a great deal of the money was thrown away in Melbourne and in London upon a pirated invention, owing to the fact that the inventor had not disclosed the actual secret of his invention.

399,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I desire to specially direct the attention of honourable members to the provision contained in sub-clause 6. powers given in the English Act, from which this clause is copied, are very extensive, and should prove very valuable. In is not the war upon which those great industrial corporations called trusts are at present entering against the unorganized industries if of different peoples, this particular clause is and likely to be of extreme service. In fact, apart from this clause, I do not know what s protection could be offered against such the corporations as those which have bought up all the inventions connected with machinery used in some of the great manufacturing industries. These trusts will not sell the submachines which have become essential to such industries, but only rent them at or rates which practically pay for the cost of the the machines. They levy further charges for their use, at the same time making it a the condition that all other machinery of a similar class shall be purchased from them. As a result of this, manufacturers in other are likely to be reduced to the posithe tion of hirers of the machines which have become essential to them. These operations have been very much commented upon in ' Great Britain, and it was partly owing to I therefore the representations made regarding this development that the provision was introduced into the English law. I propose to amend of the sub-clause so that it will read as follows :For the purposes of this section the reasonable requirements of the public shall not be deemed to have been satisfied if by reason of the default of the patentee to work his patent, or to manufacand ture the patented article in the Commonwealth to an adequate extent, or to sell the patented at a reasonable price, or to grant licences reasonable terms, or to sell the patented article at a reasonable price.",52
400,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The Minister is opening a very large field.,52
401,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Yes . But I am prepared reasonto meet that objection by pointing out that the word "" reasonable "" allows such a large the amouni; of latitude that no Court would order press unduly upon the proprietors of a machine. , In construing a point of this for kind, the Courts would lean in every way towards protecting the interests of the seller, and they would only take action against him in the event of some abuse of his proprietorship. It might, perhaps, be objected that the phrase is not so strong as it ought At all events it appears to me to take a step in a direction to which my attention has been pointedly called by the Melbourne Chamber of Manufactures. I have been shown conditions in leases to which manufacturers in this State are now obliged to conform which absolutely restrict their freedom of operations. This proposal inflicts no hardship upon the patentee. He is granted a monopoly, and so long as he either hires or sells at what the Court does not consider to be unreasonable prices no one can interfere with him. It is only when he seeks to obtain a trade monopoly that any Court would dream of interposing. In view of the gravity of the situation which is being created here, as well as in the' mother country, I move That the words "" or to sell the patented article at a reasonable price,"" be inserted after the word "" terms,"" sub-clause 6.",52
402,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Northern Melbourne) I think that it is absolutely absurd to give any man a monopoly which not only enables him to make a considerable profit out of his invention, but prevents others from making use of it upon reasonable terms. we ought to offer every legitimate encouragement to inventors, some limit must be imposed. If this proposal be carried, is it the intention of the Prime Minister to propose that all inventions shall be worked within the Commonwealth 1",53
403,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Ye s ; I intend to move that in a new clause.,53
404,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," This amendment seems to involve a much bigger issue than honourable members would imagine from the gentle manner in which the Prime Minister has moved it . The object of patenting an invention is to allow its author to obtain a special price for his article- a price which he otherwise could not secure. Surely then, it is the height of inconsistency to subsequently ask the Court to fix the price of it. We propose to extend to an inventor protection for fourteen years, and afterwards to allow the Court to cut down the price of his invention to what it regards as a reasonable sum. Probably that price will approximate to what competitors in other lines of business think it is worth.",53
405,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The whole object of patent laws is to encourage the use of the best appliances. to be. Mr Glynn - And to stimulate inventive genius by affording inventors protection for a prolonged term. Under this proposal, an inventor may be harassed by a series of actions during the wholeof that period. Applications may be made to the Court to vary the price of his patent from year to year. Thus, by the time his patent rights have expired, he may have lost the greater part of the benefit which he had anticipated receiving. Certainly, if he has to defend five or six actions in the Supreme Court during the fourteen years' currency of his patent, he will be involved in considerable expense. I trust that the Prime Minister will reconsider this matter. If we establish this precedent, it will develop in the same way that legislation has developed in New Zealand under Mr Seddon's rule. Only a fortnight ago I saw by the newspapers that he proposes to cure the effects of his protective Tariff by establishing a board to fix the price of articles the sale of which has become a, monopolv.",53
406,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I thoroughly agree with the honourable and learned memWhilst ber for South Australia in regard to this proposal. I am anxious that the formation of trusts shall be prevented, but I think that honourable members should be allowed more than five or six minutes in which to to consider a matter of such grave importance. To my mind, the words in sub-clause 6, "" to manufacture the patented article in the Commonwealth to an adequate extent,"" fully meet the position. Let me point to the inventor of the linotype as an example. I believe that the actual material and workmanship in that machine costs less than £200, although the machine itself cannot be purchased under £1,200. At the same time. I am very doubtful whether any court would decide that 500 per cent, was a. proper profit for its inventor to make. If we start to consider such matters, we shali only get ourselves into the most awkward of dilemmas. If an inventor is not to enioy the right to use his patent as he chooses for fourteen years, what is the use of ingenuity and ability? Moreover, under this proposal, an opportunity will be afforded todrag every patentee before the Court, and, as a result, endless litigation will arise. 'Every man who imagines that the price of a patented article is in excess of what it should be, will invoke the aid of the Court. I need scarcely remind honourable members that in the early days of his career, Mr Edison himself was greatly harassed by rivals, who involved him in litigation. I support the position taken up by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn.",53
407,Mr KNOX,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," It seems to me that the objection which has been' taken to this clause deserves careful consideration at the hands of the Prime Minister. If we deprive inventors of their right to make all that they possibly can out of their inventions we shall rob them of their greatest incentive. I hold that the public are amply protected against an unreasonable charge being made for any patented article, by reason of the fact that an excessive price would result in its disuse. The proposal of the Prime Minister involves a very vital departure, and one which follows upon the lines of that policy which seeks to regulate the value of a man's work, his inventive genius, and his capacity by Act of Parliament.",54
408,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," Al though the proposal of the Prime Minister sounded very plausible, when closely examined it amounts to this : We are framing at considerable trouble a patent system to encourage invention, whilst under this proposal we shall strike a death-blow at invention. The value of any invention must be determined by a comparison between what the user was paying for his appliances prior to the invention being placed upon the market, and what he pays for the invention itself. If the appliances which he was previously using were superior, there will be no demand for the invention. If , on the other hand, the invention is superior, there will be a demand for it, and the price paid for it will be in proportion to its superiority. This is a limitation on the patentee.",54
409,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,An unrestricted right does not invariably work to the advantage of the consumer.,54
410,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It does to this extent: that if the invention had not been discovered the consumer or user of it would probably have had to incur greater cost.,54
411,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The consumer would not obtain the full advantage of it.,54
412,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Not at first; but he would do so after the expiration of fourteen years. The principle of a patent law is that the chief advantage derivable from a patent should for a limited time go to the inventor.,54
413,Mr WATSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"What about the incandescent gas light ? In Sydney, a few years ago, one had to pay 15s. for a complete burner which, although the patent has not run out, can now be obtained for 3s. It is the same invention.",54
414,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I am not sure, but I think that in that case the reduced price is due somewhat to the reduced cost of the production of the article. We have to recognise that if a man was prepared a few years ago to pay 15s. for the burner in question, it was because he obtained some advantage from its use. If , by its use, he could reduce the quantity of gas consumed on his premises, it was to his advantage to purchase the burner, and to allow the inventor the advantage of his patent rights for fourteen years, knowing that 'at the expiration of that period he would effect a still greater saving. Thus the public have been advantaged by that patent, although the patentee, in the first instance, may have received a very high price for his invention. It is very difficult to determine what is a fair price to allow for a patented article. We know that in many cases inventors have devoted the best part of their lives to the work of perfecting some improvement in a process or article of manufacture; and that in some cases they have lost thousands of pounds belonging to themselves or to other people in making that effort. When, after such an experience, an inventor at last achieves success, it is very difficult to say what he should receive in respect of his patent during the fourteen years over which it extends. The only true guide to the proper price to be fixed is the consideration of the question whether the public gains an advantage by purchasing the invention at the price demanded by the patentee. It would not suit a patentee to demand a price for his invention that would discourage its use.",54
415,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It often suits their book to do so.,54
416,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"It cannot do so, just as it can scarcely suit a barrister-and this is not a personal reference-to demand too high a fee for his services, and consequently reduce his income.",54
417,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,There are cases in which a barrister charges too high a fee in order to avoid being retained. Mr THOMSONBu t if he desires to the be employed his income must suffer if he demands too high a fee for his services.,54
418,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Some corporations do sell articles patented by them, because they desire that some other article shall be used.",55
419,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I cannot conceive to such a case.,55
420,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It has been done.,55
421,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"We should not leave it open to a patentee to be harassed merely because of some extraordinary circumstance which may have occurred in relation to particular patent. Under this proposal patent granted to a poor man will be pracsame tically worthless to him. He will be conwould stantly harassed by men who desire to obtain possession of his patent, and who better able to bear the cost of proceedings at law. A patent will be worth nothing a man who has no means to defend actions brought against him under this provision. Will a rich monopoly suffer under it ? The man who will suffer will be the indilay vidual who cannot afford to go into court and contest the points of law which a provision such as this will enable people want to secure his patent to raise. In respects this is a very dangerous proequal vision. I admit that in a few cases will it may confer some advantage on the public, but it will be a serious danger to patentees, and more especially to patenthan tees in poor circumsances. Ample proviprovisions sion is made for the Court to deal - with the interest. difficulties which have been suggested. If in a case such as that to which the Minister has referred, powerful foreign monopolists desired to retain the advantages of their invention for their own country they would probably secure patent for it abroad-in Australia, for exampleand might charge a price for the article which would exclude its use or consumption here. But we have here a provision enabling the Court to grant a compulsory licence have just mentioned? to others if it is shown that any existing industry, or the establishment of any new industry, is unfairly prejudiced by the twenty action of the patentee. That is a fairly strong provision, and constitutes a great source of protection to the public. The Court . has also power to determine what shall be done if the demand which for a patented article is not reasonably met. That touches the question of cost to which the honourable and learned member ticles, for Northern Melbourne has referred. When sale of a patented article is absolutely restricted, and people are unable to obtain possession of it because of the high price not demanded by the patentee, the Court may be called upon to determine what shall be done in order to'remedy that difficulty. But say that in every case brought before it the Court shall decide what is a fair price to be charged for a patented article is a very serious matter. An invention may be hit upon by chance, while on the other hand, another patentee may have devoted many a years of his life to the work of improving a and perfecting au invention useful for the purpose. In such a case the Court have to say, "" These patents, although distinct, are useful for the same purpose, are and the public must take their choice. The price of this patent accidentally hit upon by to this inventor, shall be so and so; but as the other invention was devised after years had been spent in conducting experiments, No. and as the result of a considerable out the proper price to fix for it should be higher."" Is that a fair way to make a comparison ? If these articles were de1 who signed for the same purpose and were these practically equal, would they not be of value to the public ? This proposal reduce the value of patents. It will operate to the disadvantage of the poor patentee, and will not accomplish more would be accomplished by the other designed to protect the public",55
422,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"We have already dePrimetermined that the Court shall decide whether an article is adequately manufactured, and why should we not leave it to the Court to say whether a patented rights article is adequately sold ?",55
423,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Because the two questions are wholly different. If the honourable and learned member were a judge, how would he deal with the case which I Surely he would have a right to take into consideration the plea made by an inventor that he had spent or thirty years of his life in perfecting his invention, and to allow him to charge what he considered to be a fair price for it ? If another man came before him and produced an equally useful patent he had perfected without the expenditure of much time or money upon it, what would he do ? Would he say- "" These two ardesigned for the same purpose, although different in construction, should be sold at different prices,"" and thus practically deprive the man who had spent much time and money in perfecting his invention of a market for his patent ? The only way in which to decide these questions is by having regard to the principle which is really at the root of all patent laws. Let us assume, for example, that there is a certain process or article in use by the public, and that some one effects what he believes to be an improvement upon it. The public test it, and, finding that it is an improvement, they are willing to pay a certain price for it .",55
424,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,If there is a person ready to sell it to them,56
425,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Does not the honourable and learned member see that the clause already provides for the case of a man who declines to sell a patented article 1 The public will only buy a patented article at a price which will enable them to obtain better results by using it than they could get by doing without it . I think that the Bill itself provides for cases in which the patentees will not sell. We are departing from the principles of patent law. Those principles are, first, that in order to encourage invention patentees should be given a monopoly for a certain period of the right to sell their inventions. But unless an invention is sold to the public at a price at which they can gain an advantage by using it, they will not buy it .",56
426,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Is the honourable member in favour of allowing the Crown to take over a patent upon paying compensation for it, as is provided in clause 88 ?",56
427,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I shall be prepared to answer the honourable and learned member when we come to clause 88.,56
428,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The principle is the same.,56
429,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The provisions of clause 88 have nothing to do with the question now under discussion. Although for a limited period patentees have a monopoly of the right to sell their inventions, at the end of that period the public have the full advantage of the inventions. There is no occasion for such an amendment as the Minister has moved, and I regard it as a dangerous one. It will be difficult to administer, and will play into the hands of those who wish to worry patentees, and especially poor patentees. Moreover, it will make patents of much less value than is the intention of most patent laws.",56
430,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"If I , for one moment, believed that the amendment would have any of the effects to which the honourable member has referred, I should not have moved it . I do not support it on merely theoretical grounds. Some of the most substantial manufacturers in Melbourne have represented to me that they are already commencing' to feel what men in similar businesses in England are suffering.",56
431,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,They are the men who want their own goods to be protected.  others of the protection afforded by the patent law.,56
432,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I have before me the conditions of some of the leases upon which they are obliged to obtain machinery. It is patented machinery which they are bound to use, and it is the property of trusts who have a monopoly of its disposal.",56
433,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,That is especially so in the boot business.,56
434,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The trust will not sell the machinery ; it leases it upon the condition that the manufacturers using it shall pay the price in instalments, and shall pay a lent according to the business done.",56
435,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The trust compels the bootmakers to use certain machines, while the bootmakers, by means of the Tariff, compel the public to buy and wear certain makes of boots.",56
436,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"In the case of the machinery to which I am referring there is no competition, whereas in the case of the bootmakers there is great competition, and the public are free to choose for themselves what brands of boots they will wear. The trust to which I am referring commands millions of capital. It has bought all the machinery used in a certain manufacture, and other trusts are buying machinery to control other manufactures. This trust requires the manufacturers to procure all their machinery from it, and holds itself free to terminate its leases at any time.",56
437,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,But it must pay the manufacturers to use the machinery.,56
438,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"They mutt use it, because the trust has bought up the latest patents. Proceedings of this kind were incredible to me until I was given proof of them, because I did not believe that it was possible for such a condition of dependence in business to be created in Australia. I find, however, that some of our manufacturers are absolutely at the mercy of a foreign, trust, which holds them in the hollow of its hand. My amendment is designed provide a means to put an end 'to such state of things.",56
439,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The amendment goes much beyond that, and deals with every patent.",57
440,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It deals with every been framed. patent in regard _ to which certain conditions are not fulfilled. I am open to consider suggestions for the improvement of the phraseology which I have used.,57
441,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The amendment would allow any patentee to be worried and harassed.,57

443,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,What is the the English Act ?,57
444,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Sub-claus e 6 has been borrowed from the English Act. What aim at is the utter misuse of the monopoly created by patents. The profits of patents ought to be large, because it is necessary offer great prizes in order to encourage ventors. But we should prevent wealthy combinations from obtaining control whole trades by getting into their possession all the machinery which is necessary for carrying on those trades. Perhaps it would be better if I substituted for the amendment which I have already moved the wordsOr his refusal to sell the patented article absolutely or except at oppressive and unreasonable prices. Amendment amended accordingly.",57
445,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," Al though the honourable member's alteration is an improvement upon his original amendment, I would point out that the words do not meet the case to which he referred, because the machinery of which he spoke is, he says, leased and not sold to the manufacturers.

450,Mr WINTER COOKE,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"This is the first time that the question has been put before honourable members, but surely we ought also to hear a statement of the case of patentees and patent agents. The honourable member for North Sydney has pointed out that inventors have often spent years in t bringing to fruition something upon which their brains have been working. For inare stance, the inventor of the Woheley shearing machine worked at it for, I am afraid to wording of say, how many years.",57
451,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The original inventors are I generally very anxious to sell.,57
452,Mr WINTER COOKE,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Surely when an inventor has perfected his invention and to obtained a patent for it, he should be able into obtain a large reward. Some inventors are lucky, and are able to perof fect their ideas in a few hours or days, but very often an inventor has spent years in perfecting his invention. It is proposed to leave in the hands of the Government the decision as to the reward which shall be given to a man for many years of labour. It would be just as fair to cut down the fees of a barrister after he had proved himself especially competent and skilful. I know that there is such a thing as a taxing master attached to the Courts, but some barristers are allowed much higher fees than are others. We might, by imposing a condition of the kind now proposed, prevent some big combination from doing harm, but at the same time we should work infinite mischief to a large number of poor inventors.",57
453,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I have known great industries in America to be ruined by the patentees of certain machinery refusing to rent their machines to the manufacturers. For instance, large boot factories in some parts of the United States have been absolutely closed and thousands of employees have been turned out with their swags on their backs to tramp towards the",57
454,Mr GLYNN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,We have provided against all that.,57
455,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"My object is to show honourable members that great danger is to be apprehended if we allow a few monopolists to purchase a patent and then refuse to allow others to share in its benefits, except by paying prohibitive rates. The manufacturers of the Wagner and the Mann railway cars were ruined by the Pullman Car Manufacturing Company, which captured every important invention used in carbuilding. The other works were crushed out, and a gigantic monopoly was reared upon their crumbling remains. Then, again, the whole world is today paying tribute to one man in Pennsylvania for the use of the Westinghouse brake.",58
456,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,That brake has proved of the greatest advantage to the world.,58
457,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"No doubt. But since it was invented many others which were equally as good have been designed, but have been crushed out by the power of the monopolists.",58
458,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The proposal in the Bill will help to crush out all new patents.,58
459,Mr OMALLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"On the contrary it will enable every man to place his invention upon the market. It is only fair that the Courts should decide what is reasonable or unreasonable. It has been pointed out that one man may work for thirty years upon an invention, whilst another may hit upon an important discovery by a flash of thought, as did Holliday of San Francisco, the inventor of the cable tramway system. All these diverging circumstances in connection with inventions cannot, however, be sufficiently provided for. We must recognise the doctrine of the survival of the fittest. I am glad that the Prime Minister has endeavoured to embody in this Bill the principle that the people shall rule. If a man does not wish to sell his patent we should compel him to make it available to the public at a reasonable price. We know that inventors require the fullest encouragement: but, at the same time, we should protect the public against monopolies. Inventions of the utmost value and importance in mining operations have been purchased by two or three big monopolists, who have crushed out all smaller competitors. We must look after the "" little fellows,"" because the time has come when no individuals in the community should be allowed to profit by the misfortunes or follies of their fellows.  think we may regard this proposal as a crowning'piece of cheek on the part of protectionists. It is characteristic of the whole movement. First of all the boot manufacturers aimed at securing a monopoly of the trade in the Commonwealth by means of the high protective duties imposed by the Tariff. Then they claimed that all their machinery and tools of trade should be admitted free of duty, and now, forsooth, they ask that they should be granted the benefit of other men's brains. They want to compel inventors to sell the product of their brain work for years at any price that may be fixed upon by those who require to use the inventions. This Bill will prove to be so much waste paper if this provision is retained in it , and I shall fight it by every means in my power.",58
460,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Northern Melbourne). - I thought that the advantage of introducing such a provision as that now under discussion would be so obvious that no objection would be raised. I do not think any question of protection is involved. The conditions of the boot trade were mentioned only by way of illustration, and boot manufacturers are not more interested in this matter than are others. In these matters we must go back to first principles. Patents are monopolies, and some people think that no patents should be granted. The State having adopted the view that inventors must be encouraged to a limited extent, we must not allow patents to be so used as to prevent inventions from being employed to proper advantage. In some cases, manufacturers who have large plants purchase the patent rights of new inventions which would have the effect of displacing their antiquated appliances, with the object of preventing the new machines from being adopted.",58
461,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Does the honourable member know of any such instance 1,58
462,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"I have heard of several cases of the kind, and I can fully understand that it might be good business to keep a new invention in the background, at least for a time.",58
463,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,It would be bad business.,58
464,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"This provision is intended to improve the position of the poor inventor, who is only too glad to sell his invention if he can obtain a reasonable price. Under the British law the Crown can compel a patentee to make his invention available to them for nothing. If the Crown is to be allowed to use inventions without compensation, and we are to give to the patentees advantages which are not conferred upon them by the existing law, surely we are entitled to compel patentees to give to the public the benefit of their inventions at a reasonable price 1 May I also point out that we are really haggling over a matter which the clause already concedes in other directions. It provides that, in case of default on the part of the patentee to work his patent or to manufacture it within the Commonwealth to an adequate extent, or to grant licences upon reasonable terms, the Commissioner shall have power to grant a compulsory licence or to revoke the patent. Surely we ought to be as hard upon the vendor of patented articles as we are upon their inventors. A great deal has been said in reference to the liability of the poor patentee to be attacked upon all sides. But I would point out that he cannot be attacked unless with the consent of the Commissioner. Under sub-clause 2, no person can attack a patentee for not fulfilling the reasonable requirements of the public, unless he first obtains the leave of the Commissioner.",58
465,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,There is an appeal against the Commissioner's decision.,59
466,Mr HIGGINS,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"No . The applicantmust satisfy the Commissioner in the first instance, and if he cannot do so that officer will dismiss the application. There is no power of appeal from the Commissioner's discretion. That fact alone affords adequate protection to the patentee. I feel that honourable members who have opposed this proposal have done so chiefly because it constitutes a new departure. But, after all, it will inflict no hardship upon the patentee, and, therefore, I sincerely hope that honourable members may see their way to allow the clause, in its modified form, to be carried.",59
467,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I have been very much impressed by the arguments which have been used by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and particularly by the amendment of the amendment \ but, at the same time, I do not like the word ""default."" It seems to me that mere neglect on the part of the 11 i patentee to work his patent should not subject him to any oppressive treatment. In its modified form, however, the clause is not open to the same objection which I previously urged against it .",59
468,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," The Prime Minister has been able to give only one illustration of the necessity for such a provision as he proposes. The case which he cited had reference to certain machines, which are used in an industry to which consideration has been given by the State, in order that a demand may be created for the article which they produce. But I would point out to him that that case is already met by sub-clause 6, which declaresFor the purposes of this section, the reasonable requirements of the public shall not be deemed to have been satisfied, if by reason of the default of the patentee to work his patent, or to manufacture the patented article in the Commonwealth to an adequate extent, or to-grant licences on reasonable terms(a) Any existing industry or the establishment of any new industry is unfairly prejudiced. The one claim which could be urged in the case instanced by the Prime Minister was that the industry employing these machines was unfairly prejudiced. That case, therefore, is fully provided for by the provision in question. The only instance which was mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne was one in which the patentee or his assignee refused to sell a patented article. Such a case, I contend, is fully met by paragraph b of the same sub-clause. But the Prime Minister desires to go further arid to introduce the question of price. Such a proposal must tend to the injury of the poorer inventor. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne declares that the Commissioner must first decide that a prima facie case has been established. That is just One of the means which will be adopted for harassing the poor patentee. A complaint can be made to the Commissioner that the price demanded for any article is excessive. If the patentee is possessed of means, of course he will fight the matter, but the poor patentee will be compelled to prove to the Commissioner that the price demanded by him is not excessive. If persons wish to reduce the value of his patent, they will merely require to appeal to the Commissioner. If they make certain statements in order to support their complaint that the price charged for any article is unduly high, he will be compelled to bring rebutting evidence. This may involve him in a considerable outlay. The Prime Minister has expressed his admiration for the English Act. . Then why does he not follow the language which is employed in it ? I find, from the twentieth report of the Comptroller General of Patents in Great Britain, thatBefore the second reading of the Bill, strong representations were made to the Board of Trade by the Chambers of Commerce and others, that the clause as thus drawn was open to objection, and that unless amended it would fail to afford an effective remedy for the evils which it was deHartnoll, W. signed to meet, l t was therefore very carefully reconsidered with a view of seeing whether such of the objections raised to it as appeared to be well founded could be met without departing unnecessarily from the recommendations of the Departmental Committee; and in the result amendments were made in the clause, which were generally accepted as satisfactory. There they have arrived at what is generally considered a satisfactory solution of the difficulty. If the Prime Minister has a preference for the English Act, why does he not follow it in its entirety ?",59
469,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I am doing so.,60
470,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"In a matter of this sort, Great Britain has more to lose than has any other country in the world. I have shown that the Bill provides for the cases mentioned by the Prime Minister and by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. We shall incur great risks, and we do not know where the consequences may end. We shall also place the poor inventor at a greater disadvantage than before. Questions affecting his patent will be constantly raised under this provision by those who wish to depreciate his invention, in order to obtain possession of it at a lower price than he is entitled to receive. The Prime Minister admits that the gain will be slight. I do not think that any advantage will be derived from this proposal, and I contend that we should not incur these additional risks. We should accept the provision as it stands, for the best guide to the price of an article is its value to the public. Crown). Question-That the words proposed to be inserted be so inserted-put .

475,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I do not think the clause covers the whole ground. The Government should have clearly-defined powers to purchase any patent.,61
476,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,We can do that without any Act.,61
477,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"If the Prime Minister is satisfied that the Government have power to purchase any patent that would be beneficial for the whole Commonwealth, or for a State, it covers the whole difficulty we have been arguing lately. Mr.DEAKIN - We have aninherent power to buy anything Parliament authorizes us to buy.",61
478,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Take , for instance, the cyanide patent. Some similar invention may take place, the purchase of which will prove beneficial to the Commonwealth, and the Government might obtain the monopoly of it by paying a substantial sum.",61
479,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,There is no question about our right.,61
480,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I should like to raise another point, which I can best do by giving a concrete case. I have in my mind the case of the Sydney telephone switchboard. At the time we purchased that board, the Western Electric Company had patent rights for New South Wales. A switchboard sold by the Ericson Company was regarded by our experts as much superior, and the price of it was about £4,000 less than was asked for the board we purchased.",61
481,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,The Government could have taken the superior board.,61
482,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"To do so would have been .to outrage the spirit of the law, although we might, perhaps, have conformed to its letter. As a matter of fact, we did purchase some jacks, which were considered to be of a much superior character, from an agent in Victoria, but the agent for the Western Electric Company in New South Wales took the company from we purchased them to Court, and the Equity Judge gave us a good drubbingrightly so, I believe. I did not think we had any right to do as we did, and I was not aware of it until it was done. Ought there not to be some provision by which the Government can make arrangements to take an improvement upon terms which would be financially fair to existing patentees 1",61
483,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,I think we can do that under sub-clause 2. 11 I 2,61
484,Mr FISHEH,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"What is the objection to putting in the word "" purchase"" ?",61
485,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,Onl y that it is unnecessary.,61
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"The question is, should the Government be content to take an article for which patent rights exist when a very much superior one is offered 1 It is a question how far the Government ought to tie themselves up in such a way as to prevent themselves from taking advantage of the scientific inventions which are falling in upon us every day. In Sydney we are using inferior appliances in the Telephone Department because of the existence of the patent rights to which I have referred. In a matter of this kind it is only a question of payment between the Government and the patentee. If a Government took care that a patentee lost nothing, it should be at liberty to use any other invention.",61
487,Mr LE GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Darling Downs) There is one aspect of the question raised by the honourable member for Wide Bay to which I would direct the attention of the Prime Minister. It might happen that in one of the States a patented process for some mining operation was being sold at an extortionate price, and the Parliament of that State might desire to acquire the patent rights in order to enable the public to make use of the invention more cheaply. Under the Bill as it stands, however, the patentee could not be compelled to sell his patent to a State. A State could not compel him to sell what he has acquired under a Jaw of the Commonwealth. I understand - that the honourable member desires that power shall be given to the Governments of the States to acquire patent rights for use by the public on the same terms as those upon which they can be acquired for use in the Public Service.",61
488,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I am glad that the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has thrown more light upon my suggestion. Those who have any knowledge of Australia must know that there are in existence patents which it would be advisable for either a State or the Commonwealth to purchase right out for the benefit of the public. Such a step would also be beneficial to the patentees, because they would at once receive the profit of their inventions. I should like to see it specifically provided in the Bill that a patentee may go to a State Government and say, "" I am willing to accept a certain sum for the patent rights I hold within this State.""",61
489,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"There is nothing to prevent a patentee from doing that, but it will be necessary to insert a special provision in order to enable the Government of a State to say to a patentee- "" You must sell to us 3'our patent rights.""",62

493,Mr CROUCH,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION,"Where it is so used, the word ""attorney"" means an attorney under a power, and the person so acting would probably be a solicitor.

497,Mr THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," There to the Comare persons other than solicitors, or those who are at present practising as patent agreed agents, who might be equally entitled to become registered as patent attorneys. For instance, when the Commonwealth Patent Office is brought into existence the whole of those officers now employed in the States offices may not be absorbed into the Commonwealth service. Some of these might be specially qualified to act as patent attorneys, and I do not see any reason why they should be required to pass an examination, and to pay a fee of £ 5 whilst others, perhaps less competent, are admitted without complying with any such conditions. I suggest that, in addition to those who pass the prescribed examination, the Commissioner should register any person who supplies proofs of competency in accordance with the regulations. Many persons now engaged in Patent Offices would be able to comply with all reasonable requirements without being subjected to an examination, and persons who have been engaged in the patents business in other parts of the world might also be able to give satisfactory evidence of their qualification for the position. I hope that the Minister will consider the matter.",62

522,Mr FISHER,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I desire to - ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to a Brisbane telegram in today's newspapers to the effect 'that the Queensland Government have .been notified that the recruiting of Polynesians from the Solomon Islands - has been stopped, and that no further returns to the islands will be made. I wish to know whether the notification has - emanated from the Commonwealth or some - other authority - whether, in fact, the Prime Minister knows anything about the »matter.",65
523,Mr DEAKIN,PUBLIC SERVICE REGULATION," I was so closely engaged ^today-firs t with the Cabinet, and then with the Patents Bill-that I have not had time to deal with the papers of my Department for the last two days. I take it that the intimation has arrived from Mr Woodford, who is the British Resident in the Solomon Islands. If I find any information in the papers I shall inform the honourable member iov Wide Bay tomorrow. I shall ask the Attorney-General to convey to the Chief - Justice the intimation that inter-State members of the legal profession wish to do the Bench honour, and I have no doubt that a n arrangement for the sitting of the Court will be made to meet their convenience, 'The presentation of the evidence taken on Capital sites was delayed by the discovery at - the last moment that three sheets were missing. The missing sheets have been - obtained from Sydney, and I believe that - the report will be circulated early to>morrow. When the House meets tomorrow I shall probably have a statement to make', and perhaps a proposition to submit in (reference to the Federal Capital. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.2 p.m.",65
