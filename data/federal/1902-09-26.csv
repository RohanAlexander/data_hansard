1,Mr REID,Unknown,"As the Senate has adjourned until Tuesday week, it would be a great inconvenience to a number of honourable members if what I understand to be the intention of the-Government in regard to an extra sitting today and tomorrow were persisted in. There is a general .feeling on - both sides of the House that the business of the-session should be concluded as early as ^possible, and we on this side were ready to co-operate with the Government in finishing next week, but, as that is now impossible, .I:hope that they will meet our : convenience by allowing the - usual weekly adjournment-this, afternoon. Mr .DEAKXNi--The members of the Government are anxious to consult the wishes of the House. We are willing to sit to-night and tomorrow, and it is our present intention to do so, - but between now and the afternoon I will consult honourable members in regard to the matter. The action of the Senate in adjourning uutil Tuesday week was unexpected, and perhaps will lead them to take a new view of the position.",14
2,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown,"I endorse what has been said by the leader of the Opposition, and ask. the Acting Prime Minister to be reasonable, so that our friends may get away to their homes this evening. NA SOLDIERS.",15
3,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"It is stated in this morning's Argus that some soldiers who had been serving in South Africa arrived in Sydney without means, although pay was due to them by the military authorities, and as they were unable to obtain this money, or to get a free pass to Melbourne, - whence they originally left, they walked to Goulburn, and the mayor of that city is now interesting himself in their behalf. It is disgraceful that men who fought for their country should be treated in that way. Will the Minister make inquiries into the facts of the case, and, if they are as stated, will he take steps to see that the money due to the men is paid, and that they are returned to Melbourne?",15
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I have not yet seen the paragraph to which the honourable member refers, but I do not think the statements it contains are correct, because the Treasurer has placed at the disposal of the Defence department a sum of money to provide for the returning to their homes of men who have been landed at the wrong ports, and I have given instructions that Such men shall lie so returned. Some time ago we had to keep a number of men in the barracks at Melbourne for some days before there was an opportunity to send bhem to New South Wales and to other Stabes. The difficulties which mainly arise are due, however, bo the fact that the milibary authorities in Soubh Africa do nob always discriminate between soldiers who are sent from Australia.and - men who may have been Australians, but who were enlisted in South Africa. Besides that, men are frequently sent to the wrong ports. For instance, there were landed at Hobart the other day men belonging to the South African Irregular Corps, and others who were sent from South Australia and Western Australia. We paid the expense of returning those men to their original destination, and in another case we had to pay to bring men to Australia who had been landed in New Zealand. There are, however, a number who did not belong to any Australian contingent, and who now want us to convey them to any State t{iey like bo name.  abbenbion of the Minisber bo whab appears bo me the grossest negligence, in condemnation of which I cannot find language sbrong enough. I was informed, on good authority, in Adelaide lasb week, that some of the returned soldiers have had to sleep in the park lands there because they possessed no money, though large sums were owing bo bhem by the Imperial authorities, for which, in my opinion, the local authorities should, in the first instance, have taken responsibility, arid afterwards charged their payments bo the Imperial authorities. Will the Minisber inquire inbo the matter, and ascertain how many have not been paid ? I understand that some who have been back for months have not been paid. It is a scandal that men should be treated in that way.",15
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I do not know anything about the cases to which the honourable member refers, but if he will give me the names of the men who have been illtreated, or any obher information upon which I can base inquiries, I will have the mabber investigated. The Commonwealth Government is directly responsible for the payment only of the men belonging to the Commonwealth Horse, the States Governments having undertaken to pay the men despatched in the several States contingents.  long - to the Commonwealth Horse. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - In that case, unless bhere is something amiss with their claims, the military authorities are censurable, and I shall take prompt measures to deal with them. It is not because there has been any shortage of funds that men have remained unpaid, because the Treasurer placed Â£20,000 at the credit of the Defence department to meet all these cases. W it h regard to the statement of the honourable member for Macquarie, I have ascertained that the men referred to were not sent from Australia at all, but were mem| hers of the Johannesburg Mounbed Rifles i and Soubh African Lighb Horse. | Mr SYDNEY SMITH - Bu b are they nob 1 Victorians?",15
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That may be, ; but they enlisted in South Africa, department is in no way responsible for I them.",16
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Did they fight . matter up. alongside the men sent from Australia ? |. Sir WILLIAM LYNE That is the real question.,16
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That does not possible affect the responsibility of If any one is responsible, it is the Imperial authorities. In some cases where tralians have enlisted in South Africa, have been returned here, I have had them sent on to their own States, and am making claims against the Imperial Government for the expense so incurred. But I suspect that in the case under notice there is proof that the men had any claim upon department.",16
9,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"In view of the statethe ment of the Minister for Defence, that Imperial authorities have upon many casions neglected their duty, and not looked after the Australian soldiers who have fought for the Empire, will the Acting Prime Minister take steps to have this state of affairs remedied, or to protest against the occurrence of similar default in the future?",16
10,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The Commonwealth has advanced money to meet Imperial obligathose tions in order to avoid delay, but we Imperial Government. wish to mark the distinction between our direct responsibility for the Commonwealth contingents, whose members are to be paid out of our own pockets, and the responsibibhe lity which is really that of the Imperial authorities, but which we have assumed, and for which we expect to be recouped.",16
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Will the Acting Minister for Defence make strict inquiries into the case which has been referred to, and, if the men are stranded, have them sent on to their destinations, afterwards to his death. charging the Imperial authorities with the cost?",16
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That has been clone in every case in which the men had any claim bo be so breated. But whilst sent many valiant and good soldiers from Australia, the department have had also to deal with a few men who represent themthat selves to be what they are not.",16

16,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I wish to direct the atAustention of the Minisber bo the case of and Regimental Sergeant-Major Coffey, who was a member of the first Victorian Contingent, and, while on active service, caught a cold which developed into phthisis. The Imperial Government paid him a pension no until the 4bh Augusb, bub from that dabe the unbil the lSbh Sepbember, when he died, the man was in absolute want. I wrote to Minister for Defence in regard to the the matter, and was informed that the man ocshould make his claim upon eibher the Imperial or the State authorities. The man has since died. Eor some time befoie his death he was without medical comforts, and his wife and four children were practically without the necessaries of life. In these circumstances, I desire to ask the .Acting Minister for Defence whether lie will inquire into the case, and include it amongst which he proposes bo refer bo the",16
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"If the honourable and learned member will remind me of the matter, I will make inquiries from Secretary for the Department of Defence. I am satisfied that if the honourable member wrote to the Minister some action was taken by the department, and that representations have probably been made to the Imperial Government. If proper representations were made, I think ib is very likely bhat the man was .looked after prior",16
18,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,No .,16
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That is my impression, because instructions have been given that if any of these men cannot obwe tain their money and are in want, every consideration shall be shown to them, especially if they are ill . I cannot think the soldier referred to could have been neglected if proper representations had been I will make inquiry, and if there is no reason to doubt validity, a claim will be made upon the MOUNTKEMBLA DISASTER FUND .",16
20,Mr HUME COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question with regard to the money now being raised for the relief of the sufferers by the Mount Kembla disaster. Quite, a number of branches of the Australian Natives' Association, with which I am connected, have raised subscriptions for the fund. Various other societies, as well as members of the public, have done the same ; but an impression is gaining ground that the money so raised is not under proper control, and that it will probably be handed over to the New South Wales Miners' Accident Relief Fund, which is managed by the Government. A number of members of the Australian Natives' Association who have spoken to me about the matter are anxious that the money which has been raised should be paid direct to the widows and orphans for whom ib was intended. In these circumstances, I am impelled to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he can give me any assurance that these moneys will not be paid into the particular fund to which I have referred, but that they will be paid direct to those for whom they are intended.",17
21,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The matter is one over which we have no control, although we have the deepest sympathy with the object of the fund. As the honourable member considers there is some confusion in the public mind in regard to the question, I will undertake to make inquiries, and furnish him with the result. ELECTORAL BILL .",17
22,Mr SPEAKER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I have received the following Message from the Senate :Mr SWOAKHR,-The .Senate returns to the House of Representatives the Bill for "" An Act to regulate Parliamentary elections,"" and acquaints the House of Representatives that the Senate does not insist upon that part of its amendment to amendment No. .104 of the House of Representatives to which that House disagrees, and agrees to the consequential amendments in clause 140A, does not insist upon its disagreement to amendments Nos. 6, 58, 139, 141, and 196, and agrees to the consequential amendments of the House of Representatives in amendments Nos. 1.10 and :16i: The Senate insists upon its disagreement to amendments Nos. 21, 22, 23, 24, 114, ISO, and .192, as set out in the annexed schedule, and requests the reconsideration of the Bill in regard these amendments. The Senate, Melbourne, 25th September, 1902.

23,Mr KIRWAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, upon notice.1. Whether the s. s. Herbert, carrying mails between Esperance and other ports on the south east coast of Western Australia, has frequently failed to adhere to contract time. 2. Whether the steamer left Esperance on Saturday, 30th August, and took 83 hours to reach Albany, notwithstanding that the weather was very moderate. 3. What fines have been inflicted on and paid by the owners of the Herbert since they have been receiving Â£400 monthly to carry the mails on the south-east coast. Sir PHILIP .

24,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I notice that, according to these Estimates, the number of messengers employed in the House of Representatives is the same as last year. In Division 8, however, we find provision made for. three messengers for the Queen's-hall. Ib is seb forbh that these messengers were provided for in last year's Estimates, and I desire to know whether three additional appointments have been made.",17
25,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," The number has not been increased, but the messengers have been redistributed, and their titles altered. Messengers who were before allotted, I think, to the Senate to are now placed under the heading ""Queen'shall,"" as bheir duties, lie there between the R. C. BAKER, President. two Houses.

30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I think he is still underpaid. He is kept at his post at all hours, and should be fairly paid.",18
31,Sir GEORGE TURNER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,It is a matter with which the House Committee has to deal.,18
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I think the salary should be brought under the attention of the committee.,18
33,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I will call the attention of the House Committee to the fact that this officer certainly does appear to be adequately remunerated. Vote agreed to. DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS. Division 11 (Administrative)-:Â£S,135 .",18
34,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I see there is an increase amounting to Â£ 6 6 in employees. .one or more of the salaries. I suppose the number of clerks is the same as before, and of course I do not want to resist any fair claim for an increase.",18
35,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The amount named will be divided amongst six clerks.,18
36,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I do not - think this is time for increasing salaries, but-if the ing Prime Minister is satisfied that some one has hitherto been underpaid, and this increase is justified, I shall not resist i May I ask the way in which the money has been allocated ?",18
37,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The clerks amongst whom this amount is 'to be distributed receive salaries ranging from Â£80 to Â£260 per annum.,18
38,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Who have obtained the increases ?,18
39,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The amount represents, roughly speaking, an increase of Â£ 2 0 to each each clerk.",18
40,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Has an all-round increase been made?,18
41,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,No .,18
42,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"If these increases are to be of annual recurrence, the matter is a very important one.",18
43,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The P u b l i c Service Act is not yet in operation, but we have endeavoured to deal, with these cases as we should have done if the measure had been in force. No increases have been made in 6 5 the salaries of any of the better paid officers, but Â£ 1 0 0 per annum is being divided between six clerks in the department whose salaries range from Â£ 8 0 to Â£260 per annum. They have proved by their efficient service that they are worthy of a little more than they have been receiving. Mr 'WATSON - Who are receiving the increases ? The men obtaining the higher salaries or the men receiving the lower ones.",18
44,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,U n d e r these Estimates each of them will receive an increase ranging from Â£ 1 0 to Â£ 2 0 .,18
45,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Who is receiving the in- Â£ 1 0 increase, and how many are receiving the increase of Â£ 2 0 ?",18
46,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I cannot tell the honourable member from memory. I investigated every case, and although rejecting certain proposals, was satisfied that the sum which appears on the Estimates was not more that than was demanded in justice to the",18
47,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," Evidentl y the .Acting Prime Minister went carefully into this question and satisfied himself as to the wisdom of making the increases. But'from - his long association with things as they go in Melbourne he may have a unconsciously allowed the officer at the top Actto obtain a rise and the little fellow at the bottom to obtain a very small increase. If the Acting Prime Minister will give the t . committee an undertaking - that.he will look into the matter and see that the lower paid officers get something, I shall be satisfied.",18
48,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I know that they are getting something under this proposal.,18
49,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I wish to draw attention to the labour problem in the Rand. The representative institutions of the Transvaal have been silenced with the assistance of Australian soldiers, and for that reason labour there is unable to give expression to its desires. There seems to be an intention on the part of the Imperial authorities",19
50,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The honourable member cannot discuss that matter on this division.,19
51,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The division includes the salary of the 'Secretary of the department, and, if necessary, I shall have to move that that officer's salary be reduced by Â£ 1 . He is the officer who might have to deal with this-matter.",19
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I submit that honourable and learned member for Corio is perfectly in order in discussing, under this division, any question 'which comes within the range of the functions of the Minister for Externa] Affairs. But, in any case, 'the honourable and learned member can put himself in order beyond doubt by moving a reduction in the salary of the secretary.",19
53,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"T be honourable and learned member will be in order in discussing anything which comes within this division, but not in discussing anything outside. Mr - CROUCH - I understand that the secretary is the mouthpiece of the Minister in reference to external affairs. Thatmieans that, in all matters external to Australia, the administration is through the secretary, and I submit that I have a perfect right to speak on the subject which I have indicated, namely, the employment of Chinese labour on the Rand in South Africa. 'The CHAIRMAN - The honourable and learned member cannot possibly discuss that question on-this division of the Estimates.",19
54,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I hope the .Chairman will not give his ruling too precipitately. Although T do not see that I can have any sort of sympathy with the object the honourable and learned member 'has in view, a great principle is involved in the point-of order-raised. The CHAIRMAN , - The honourable and learned member for'Corio will not be deprived of his opportunity.",19
55,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That may be so, but still the question of the proper place at which the right should be exercised is of .great importance. I think the Chairman will admit ; Supply (1902-3). 16167 that all matters which - fall within the province of this Department of External Affairs are relevant to the Estimates of the department. Parliament might be so dissatisfied with the administration of the Minister for External Affairs as to mark its disapproval by refusing to vote a single sixpence on the Estimates for this division. Such an action would be of very serious consequence. As I said before, it is only the importance of the principle with which I am concerned.",19
56,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,If necessary I can place myself in order by moving a reduction of the salary of the secretary.,19
57,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That is - not necessary, I think.",19
58,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"In my opinion the the secretary, under the direction of the Minister, should have written protesting against the employment of Chinese on the Rand. The fact is that the mine-owners of Johannesburg are able to get a sufficiency of native labour. By the action of Australian troops', fighting along with the Imperial troops, these mine-owners have been put in a position of dominance, and are able to insist upon employing native and Chinese labour at a certain rate.",19
59,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Will the honourable and learned member resume his seat. If it is the pleasure of the committee that - the standing orders be departed from to allow a general debate on this item, I , of course, can have no objection. Otherwise I must confine the honourable and learned member to the item before the committee.",19
60,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"When the last Estimates were under consideration it was admitted that as a'matter of practice honourable members - were entitled, on the 'first item, to initiate a'general debate on - the administration of the department. Yesterday the Treasurer himself suggested that that would be the-easier course-to pursue.",19
61,Sir GEORGE TURNER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That is so.,19
62,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Unles s that right is admitted I do not see how honourable members can possibly-express an opinion on the general administration; and I trust that no hard-and-fast line will now be drawn * which will affect innumerable cases later on.,19
63,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I hope the practice common in most of our-States Parliaments will be pursued .here. It would be unfortunate if members were obliged, in considering the transactions of a department, - to confine themselves to moving reductions in particular items. It has always been considered in the States Parliaments that the first item in each division offers an opportunity of challenging anything and everything relating to the administration of that department. The widest latitude has been given, and the result has been satisfactory to honourable members, and advantageous in facilitating business. I hope that under the circumstances the Chairman, if he thinks it necessary, will grant the privilege which has been indicated.",19
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The practice which has been described by the Acting Prime Minister is that followed in the House of Commons, and it affords the one way in which honourable members can discuss foreign affairs. In England the Ministers' salaries are voted on the Estimates, and, in order to ventilate foreign affairs, it is the invariable practice to move a reduction of those salaries. In the Commonwealth, however, Ministers' salaries are provided by the Constitution, and do not appear on the Estimates ; and, therefore, the only opportunity which honourable members can have of discussing the whole range of the administration of the Department of External Affairs is by formally moving a reduction of the secretary's salary unless the latitude now suggested is allowed.",20
65,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"It is quite unnecessary for me to move a reduction of the secretary's salary. I am not asking for any privilege : if I am not within my rights under the standing orders, I do not desire to continue. I ask not for the favour to ""speak, but for the right, and, if necessary, will contest the position. I may point out that the Immigration Restriction A ct comes within' the province of this department,- and in order to show why we should exclude aliens from Australia, I might find it necessary to refer to the parallel case of South Africa. I should like to know whether I have permission to proceed.",20
66,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Before the Chairman gives his ruling, I should like to point out that the honourable and learned member for Corio has overlooked an important distinction. The honourable and learned member wishes to discuss the action of certain mine owners and capitalists in Johannesburg. If it were a matter of Imperial policy-if the intention were to discuss the action of the dominant power in any part of South Africa - ther e might be some reason for the course which the honourable and learned member desires to adopt. B ut is' it not reducing latitude of discussion to an absurdity when it is proposed to consider the attitude of certain private individuals in South Africa t",20
67,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That is not my object: my object is to discuss the inaction of the department in dealing with a certain matter.,20
68,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The honourable and learned member is suggesting that the Department of External Affairs should deal with a matter which does not in any way affect the policy of the Government in South Africa. It would be as justifiable to ask. the Department of External Affairs to deal with the attitude of certain private individuals in, say, Quebec.",20
69,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That is not the point at issue with the Chairman just now.,20
70,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I contend that it is the point at issue.,20
71,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The Chairman says that no general discussion can be allowed.,20
72,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The honourable and learned member for Corio wishes to discuss the attitude or the action of certain private individuals in South Africa ; and, in my opinion, that is altogether an absurd position.",20
73,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Tw o points of order have been raised, one as to whether it is Competent for the honourable and learned member for Corio, on the item of the secretary's salary, to discuss anything coming within this division or the administration of this particular department. The other point raised is whether it is competent for the honourable and learned member to discuss matters not connected with the administration of this department. The honourable and learned member was proceeding to discuss matters in connection with South African affairs, which, in my opinion, have nothing to do with the administration of a department of the Commonwealth. I therefore rule that the honourable and learned member cannot, under this heading, discuss the question he has indicated, although it is competent for him to discuss anything in connection with the department.",20
74,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Do I understand the Chairman to rule that it is not competent for nonorable members to take exception to the inaction of the Minister in regard to external matters-that is, matters outside of Australia-in connection with which he might have been asked to protest 1",20
75,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That is my position.,20
76,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Does the Chairman hold that it is not a matter of fair comment to say thai the Minister has failed to do something which Parliament may be of opinion he should have done 1 Surely that is a matter of fair comment, no matter' whether the honourable and learned member for Corio be right or wrong in the opinions he desires to express. If such questions are not open to discussion, a Minister may fail in the most important part of his duty to the people of Australia and the Empirebecause the Empire is involved-ran d yet any comment will be precluded. I hardly think the position has been fully understood; at any rate, I protest against the ruling.",20
77,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I may be misinterpreting the Chairman, but understood him to that say that the discussion of any subject will be in order if an honourable member can bring that subject into connection with the department with which we are now affairs dealing.",21
78,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That is so.,21
79,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Then I understand that the honourable and learned member for wishes to challenge some action, or inactionand inaction may be as important as action - of the department of External Affairs South Africa. Until I have heard what honourable and learned member has to say I do not venture to pronounce an opinion on the subject with which he desires to deal. But, judging from the few sentences we have heard, he appears to be challenging the administration of the department; under the circumstances, so long as he connects his remarks with the department, take' it that, under the ruling of the man, he is entitled to speak. It is admitted, of course, that in dealing with the ment of External Affairs we cannot refer Post-office administration, or vice As I understand the ruling, so long honourable and learned member connects he has in his mind with the administration of the Department for External Affairsand surely "" external affairs "" is wide to connect the department with every other - part of the globe-h e will be in order.",21
80,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"If the ruling of the man has the effect indicated by the Acting Prime Minister, the honourable and learned member for Corio ought to be allowed benefit of it . In the House of Commons, in the discussion on the item of Ministers' salaries, the.most unofficial'occur'rences .brought under the notice of honourable - bers. If a number of citizens in a town - Europe commit outrages on other citizens is open to any member of the Imperial Parliament to challenge the Secretary of State for .Foreign Affairs with neglect of duty in not making representations on the subject.",21
81,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Hear , hear-Bulgaria , for instance.",21
82,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"At present the range allowed is very wide, and it might create a bad precedent to curtail it , because this is the one opportunity which members have of canvassing the action of the Minister. Under these circumstances it would be unwise, under the ruling just given, to draw the reins too tightly. It is really essential to the working of parliamentary institutions on the Estimates there should be full scope for criticism* of the action or neglect of action on the part of Ministers or public officers. It appears to me that external embrace the affairs of the world, and a wide latitude in discussion ought to be allowed. When the department of the Treasury or the Post-office department is Corio under discussion members can be kept to narrow limits; but the department of External Affairs gives honourable members some in title to review the whole action of the ""Go the vernment or their inaction, such as in not making representation in any country in the world on any conceivable subject. It would be an abuse to carry this right to ridiculous extremes ; and we are now more concerned in preserving the principle which governs and, the right of criticism.",21
83,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Perhaps I did not I make myself quite as clear as I intended in Chairthe ruling I gave. If I was, understood to say that the'honourable and learned member departcould not make his remarks relevant to to the administration of this departversd. ment, I was misunderstood. What I as the did rule was that it would not be what competent for the honourable member to apply anything that was not directly connected with this department or its adenough ministration. I understood the honourable and learned member to be referring to the employment of Chinese by the mine-owners Chairon the Rand in South Africa. If the honourable and learned member can show a connection i between that matter and the the administration of the department, I certainly shall not rule him out of order.",21
84,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The action of those are honourable members who have supported memthe Chairman's first position on ""this of occasion, shows that it is not possible in it some instances, in this national Parliament, to put aside State and parochial ideas. My contention: is that in connection with the employment of. Chinese in South Africa, the department of. External Affairs, in not offering aprotest, has been, guilty of a serious neglect of duty. I wish to point out that in the first place we have' a certain responsibility for the present condition of things in' South Africa, inconsequence of our having sent troops to that country to quell the rebellion or war-as honourable members may choose to call it . We are from that cause, to some extent responsible for the state of tilings that exists there, now. That state of things is this: That the mine owners in South Africa;-largel y in Johannesburg-ar e unable to obtain a sufficient supply of native labour, and are doing, their best, by putting, pressure upon the Imperial Government, and in other directions; to import Chinese cheap labour, on to the Rand. That cheap labour will largelycompete with the large number of Australians who have gone over to Johannesburg, in search, of employment. Further than that, I have here a telegram' clipped from the London Times, of. 11th July, 1902, from which it appears that the Transvaal Government have actually arrested-chiefs who have tried to induce their natives to escape from the Rand. The' cablegram reads as follows:Some native chiefs have been arrested for inciting natives to quit the Band. An unsuccessful attempt was made at a rescue Then appears a ' telegram showing the real opinion of the Johannesburg.' people on the subject. It is dated 5th July, and says The. importation of Asiatics is politically most undesirable, and South African opinion will only tolerate it as a last resource when all other expedients have failed. Yet, in spite of this, I find in the Age of 21st August of this year a' cablegram from England, in which it is statedReuter's Johannesburg correspondent estimates that there ore only 620j000 - kaffir "" boys "" able for working purposes in South Africa. This number is quite insufficient to meet the labour demands, and the importation of Chinese coolies engaged for a term of j'ears, andunder contract to return to'their, native land.on its expiration, being seriously considered. If there is one thing, more than another which results, froma. war, especially when .that war is successful,, it is responsibility for the after administration, of the conquered territory. We ourselves; under circumstances which madeour action necessary and just, have dipped our hands Mr Crouch. in blood in South Africa. We, as a nation,, haveceased from following our ordinary peaceful course of non-interference with the affairs of the rest of the world, and have taken to-arms to assist in suppressing; tworepublics.. Whether, they were free and liberty-loving, republics does not matter. Yery largely through the-exertionsof Australianarms, as appears from reports of British generalssince the war, the Imperial Government was able to succeed in the war, and; the local representative institutions, whichexpressed to some extent the views of the South African, peoples,, have been extinguished. We cannot now escape from the responsibility of our own action. It is one of the consequences of taking part in a quarrel that in the peace that follows thestateof affairs brought about should not be altogether contrary to the wishes of. the. conqueror; and I venture to say. that it is not the desire of this House that our money and blood, should have been spent upon those South African fields, merely to enable the mine^owners of the Rand to be moreprosperous and opulent through, the importation of Chinese coolies, to compete with thewhite labour which is. now resident there - I venture to remind the committee that the promise was made time after time by Mr ChamberJohannesburg; 2nd July. lain that in the terms of settlement the Australian. States and other parts of the Empirewhich' had participated in the war should, beconsulted. I can point to"" speech after speech.made-on platforms in: England, where Mr Chamberlain said' that that promise would be carried out. Of course it has not been' carried out. But our Government might properly ask. that itsvoice should, be' heard ini this matter, and, as far asAsiatics are concerned; w c should' support, the non - representative voice, the Crown-colony voice, the crushed-by-Colonialoffice voice of; the Transvaal miners; and see avail- that, as. far as ourrepresentations can receive attention!in the counsels of the Empire, imported Chinese and other Asiatics shall not be allowed tocompete with the white is labour in. South Africa. I think that this committee will, be insympathy withi any action-that the Ministry chooses-to take in that direction. I sincerely trust that some : action will be taken, and. that, as a consequence of it, we-shall let it be known that, 1 so far as Australia is concerned, we desire white labour to be employed in these conquered territories, and that that is one the requests we make in virtue of the part we took in the war.",21
85,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I â d o not know whether the honourable and' learned member for Corio has seriously considered the whole of the - consequences which would follow from the adoption of the principle he has laid down in regard to this particular case.,23

87,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am far from denying, our responsibility for the partwhich tralia has played in connection with the cent war in South Africa'.

88,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,A Government of Crown colony type.,23
89,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"A Government of the Crown colony type, no doubt: but under circumstances which admit of the exercise of very considerable powers by an advisory counoil of the character mentioned. I as much as the people of thoseterritories will be in. the enjoyment of self-government to that extent, at all events, we should need to be very careful in expressing full, general views upon any question of. great importance to their internal administration. There are portions of the British Empire* which the views which are practically universal in Australia with regard to the employment of the coloured racesrepresentations are not maintained; and we should no more welcome a representation from, any other part of the Empire that chose to favour the encouragement of the employthewar ment of cheap labour in Australia than Africa would the inhabitants of the new Transvaal colony encourage any interferencewith them oiu our part of an' opposite nature. Mr CROUCH. - Arethe cases parallel %",23
90,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The cases are not parallel, but the principle, of interference-is. the of same in each. I will not enter into a discussionÂ°as to how far the institutions in the nature of. representative government which it is proposed to institute in. the Transvaal, compare with the so-called representation of Australian, European, and American inhabitants granted to them, by the former Transvaal Government. These are matters which it would be profitless to discuss at this hour. I am not drawing such a comparison, because, so far as the-honourable and learned member is-concerned, I am in closesympathy with Aushis view of this case. But while we reare entitled to express our personal opinions outside, that does not justify any usi n making official representations, action which, if they were to have any weight at all, must be backed by some effective action on the part of the CommonSupposing, we did termake a representation of the character be desired to the people of: South Africa admit because as I have said, the measure of inrepresentative government already accorded gives the people a voice-it may be an incomplete voice in our apprehension, but still, it isa. voice-in the management of on their own affairs, The probability is that the immense majority of the very citizens of those former republics, with the whom we have recently been in conflict, would not sympathize with us in. regard to this matter. On the contrary, we might find that, as they always freely employed the coloured labour of their own country, they would be quite willing to employ any n - coloured labour on the same terms-. We could, not count confidently upon the sympathy of; those people who, although they are for the time being deprived of their franchise, will have a measure of representation in the advisory councils. The consequence is. that although Australians in generally would be in. sympathy with' the opinions which the honourable and learned member has expressed, we should, be making to. a people who would not receive them with sympathy, and might regard them, as quite as much, an interference withtheir present policy as during they regarded our going to South at.all as an interference in. a quarrel, whichi they were-pleased-to think they could limit to one portion of the Empire. Under thesecircumstances,, therefore-althoug h it is perfectly open for any persons, or any private bodies of associations, to express their 1 , opinions with regard, to the employment of 1 coloured labour on the Rand-this is not a subject with which the Government of the Commonwealth ought to be asked to take action. By so doing we should possibly expose ourselves to a mortifying rebuff. We would not be considered by the citizens of South Africa as lending them any assistance-in fact, the probability is that our action would simply be interpreted as a desire to interfere in their affairs, arising partly from our antagonism to coloured labour, and partly from our interest as a rival gold-producing country, to deprive them of the labour which has been usually employed by them. Eor my own part, I regret the action taken upon the Rand, although I do not consider, from what can be gathered-and I have no special information on the subject-tha b the employment of either alien or Chinese labour is likely, under present circumstances, to enter into competition with white labour. The information I have is that the whites on the Rand are employed at os. a day. It is also generally understood--indeed , I believe it is incontestable - that the cost of living in Johannesburg is at least twice the cost in Australia. The consequence is that 5s. per day in Johannesburg represents not more than 2s. 6d. per day in Australia. Under the circumstances that is clearly not a class of employment or a rate of remuneration to which we can desire to see Australians aspire. We cannot imagine Australian labour desiring to enter into competition for such employment.",23
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,It is the of people there that has brought down wages on the Rand.,24
92,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That is true to a large extent: but the rates are also due very largely to the number of the indigenous inhabitants of the country. Though I myself regret to learn that there is any proposal to import more coloured labour to the Rand, j'et it remains true that even if such labour were entirely excluded, the people there would still be face to face with a far more serious problem than the Commonwealth of Australia or any part of it has to face owing to its large native population.",24
93,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,On e of the companies there pays 350 per cent.,24
94,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That may be so, but if one can place reliance on recent cablegrams Svhich have been published in the mewspapers as to the transference of Â£100,000,000 of war debt, the vast amount of interest on that sum will have to be paid, by taxation levied almost wholly upon the mine' owners of the Transvaal. The honourable and learned member will see that the mine-owners are not therefore escaping scathless. Whether or not they had the large share of responsibility which was attached to them in some quarters for the inception of the late war, it is quite clear that for whatever purpose it was waged, they are having allotted to them something like a fair measure of responsibility for the enormous outlay incurred. For these reasons I fail to see that this Government ought to have taken action in the matter, unless our counsel was in some way specially invited. There was a matter upon which, without being directly consulted, Australia had an opportunity of speaking, and that was in regard to the suspension of constitutional government in Cape Colony. On that question Australia had a proper opportunity of being heard, and the Prime Minister expressed the feelings of the great bulk of the people of the Commonwealth. That was a matter, upon which it was proper for the Government to speak, because an opportunity of speaking was presented to them, but in this case an opportunity for speaking has not arisen. So far as I know, this Chinese scheme is merely the project of a few men, of whom we have examples in Australia, who subordinate every other consideration to that of earning profit upon their investments.",24
95,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,And whocan only be number effectively opposed by a popular franchise.,24
96,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"There are men who pay the smallest possible heed to the consideration of the future of the country they may beimperilling by the introduction of large numbers of races, who within our experience cannot be said to be capable of taking any part in representative government: men who consider any country as no more than a field for investment, and with whom the profit they reap is the only measure of good government. That they should make such a proposition should surprise no one. We may hope that the I m perial Government, with their knowledge of the consequences of such a step, will not give their consent. If our opinion were invited, there can be no doubt as to what our verdict would be. But I repeat that no proper opportunity has yet presented itself to us of speaking on this question. If such ait opportunity is presented, I have no doubt it will be taken advantage of. But to act as the honourable and learned member for Corio proposes in regard to what, so far as I know, is at present merely a project, which may never be endorsed even in the country in which it is made, which may not be approved by the I m perial Government, and which may, therefore, remain merely a project, would not be wise. If we were to express an opinion in these circumstances, where should we draw the line in the representations we ought to make to other Crown colonies upon projects launched by them, which in our opinion may be as hazardous as that to which the honourable and learned member has referred t The Government may be acquitted of blame in not having taken any action in regard to what at this stage is a mere project. To bave made general unsolicited representations might have been an interference with the measure of autonomy at present existing in . those States, and might have established a precedent which in the future would be found very dangerous to this and other self-governing communities throughout the Empire.",24
97,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I quite agree that so far as South Africa and many other parts of the Empire are concerned, the circumstances surrounding the labour problem, especially in connection with the employment of coloured people, are so different from those obtaining in Australia, that the question must be looked at from a point of view different from that adopted here. While conceding that, and admitting that if representative institutions were in existence in that portion of South Africa which is immediately under discussion, we might leave it to the people there to determine the steps they should take, it seems to me that the most serious aspect of the question from a humanitarian point has been left out of consideration in the speech of the honourable and learned member for Corio, and in the reply of the Acting Prime Minister. regard the suggested importation of Chinese as a comparatively unimportant matter compared not with the suggestion, but, so far as the cables inform us, with an actual decision on the part of the High Commissioner that all the natives of the Rand shall be compelled to labour for the mine-owners by the imposition ""of an annual poll tax. I quite admit that with respect 45 x to the aborigines of Australia and New Zealand, and in every other part of the Empire, we have no right to interfere with their desire or opportunity to earn a livelihood for themselves. They should be given the fullest and.freest opportunity to compete upon equal terms, if not upon liberal terms, with those of us who have come into competition with them. But it is altogether another question, when in order to compel a pastoral people-and , generally speaking, that, I understand, is the characteristic of the natives of that portion of South Africa-wh o would be satisfied with the kind of living to which they were accustomed, and have no desire to work under the trying conditions in mining, to enter the mines.",25
98,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The trouble was to keep them back from the mines.,25
99,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"It surprises me that the honourable member should say that in view of the fact that before the Boer war occurred at all, a commission appointed by the Transvaal Government at the request of the Johannesburg mine-owners suggested that this poll tax should be imposed for the special purpose of compelling the natives to go into the mines. The proceedings of that commission were reported in the newspapers of a little over two years ago, and Earl Grey, the chairman of one of the big companies there, said that unless they could secure the imposition of a tax of that kind upon the natives, there would be no possibility of inducing them to work under conditions which would allow the mines to be cheaply carried on. We have been informed that this tax has now been imposed, and I say it is to the eternal disgrace of the British administration in South Africa that they should seek to compel the natives against their will to enter the mines to work under the mine-owners' conditions. stand",25
100,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,It is disguised slavery.,25
101,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"There can be no doubt that it is a form of slavery. It is something I equivalent to what I am informed occurs in Western Australia at the present time, where the natives are, it is said, indentured, but are really compelled to work for pastoralists, and are subjected by their masters to all kinds of corporal punishment if they break the letter of an agreement which their poor muddled or ignorant brains did not enable them to understand when they I signed it .",25
102,Mr EOWLEK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That was the Boer policy in South Africa.,26
103,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I do not care whose policy it was. If it was the Boer policy, more shame to the British Government to countenance the continuance of it . But one must not be led by one's indignation to enter upon matters that are outside the purview of Australian affairs. I have very strong opinions upon these subjeets, but I have tried consistently to adopt the policy that we have no right to undertake responsibilities and duties outside of the affairs immediately concerning our own people. I believe that we have already gone too far in that direction by assuming responsibility in respect of the administration of New Guinea. I understand also that the Government have taken some measure of responsibility in connection with the New Hebrides outside the mere subsidy paid for extending the trading relations of the Commonwealth. In these assumptions of responsibility I think we are perhaps going further than we at the present time can have any proper conception of. For that reason alone I have not a word of reproach to hurl at Ministers for not making the representations suggested. I should like to see bodies representative of public opinion in Australia, false action of this kind by expressing publicly their opinion of the illiberal, not to say unjust, proposition involved in the imposition of a poll tax on the natives of South Africa.",26
104,Mr THOMSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,They ought first to know of it for a fact.,26
105,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Of course, and I believe I have qualified what I have said by assuming that the cable reports upon the subject are correct. I cannot certainly say that they are, but I think it will be admitted that in regard to large public matters the cable reports are found to be reasonably correct. On the whole subject. I think that this Parliament should confine itself to Australian affairs, and for that reason I do not wish to say more than that I think the Government are wise in refraining from taking any action which would involve us in responsibility, or set up the idea that we are seeking to interfere with the affairs of the world at large.",26
106,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Western Australia) In view of the overwhelming rebuke which I understand the honourable and learned member for Corio directed at me, I hasten to assure him that I am thoroughly in sympathy with the object he wishes to attain. I do not for a moment believe that any policy which would have the effect of increasing the amount of native labour in the mines of South Africa, or of adding to that labour by the importation of coloured aliens from other parts of the world, is one that would have the support of the people of Australia. I am sure that it will not have the support of the Empire as a whole. I believe that the Imperial authorities during the short time within which they will have the affairs of South Africa under their control will not allow that policy to be developed to any serious extent. In view of the remarks with regard to the cruel treatment of kaffirs, I am somewhat surprised to learn that the objection to this treatment is directed solely against the Imperial authorities. There is no so-called civilized race on the face of this earth that has been more remorseless in its cruelty towards the native races than were the people of the Boer republics. I feel sure that whatever may be the conditions imposed upon the natives of South Africa by the Imperial authorities, their case' will be greatly better than it was under their old masters.",26
107,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The honourable member cannot justify a poll tax, surely ?",26
108,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"As regards this poll tax, of which we have heard very vague reports, I should say that, for my own part, I totally disapprove of any attempt in the way of a poll tax to drive the natives into the mines. At the same time, I recognise that the natives, in common with the whites, ought to pay some portion of taxation for the benefit of the country in which they live. It yet remains to be seen whether the taxation is of the nature which we have been given to understand it is, and whether its effect will be in the direction indicated. As regards this whole question, I must again express my surprise at the confusion of ideas which has led a number of people all over the world with whose views I am closely in sympathy to lose sight of the important fundamental feature in the whole of this difficulty. We have now in South Africa for the first time a condition of things which will give to the people the control of their own affairs, and I say it is for them to work out their own social, political, and economical salvation in - the same way that we have worked out ours in Australia.",26
109,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,When they get representative institutions.,27
110,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I shall give my honourable friend an instance of what has already occurred. We are told of the dominance of the capitalists and mine-owners in Johannesburg. A few months ago, for the first time in the history of Johannesburg, the municipal council - now established on a proper basis - has been able to impose a tax on land values throughout the municipality. There is a distinct proof that at last South Africa is beginning to enjoy representative institutions, and I have no doubt but that the future will justify those who hold that the war arose through the denial of representative institutions aud a free franchise to the majority of the people by a few who by circumstances were placed in power for the time being.",27
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Parramatta) The honourable and learned member for Corio might have made a great deal better use of this opportunity. He seemed much more anxious to demonstrate that we had been wallowing our hands in blood than to deal with the black labour trouble. The fact that we sent away troops and helped to slaughter a number of persons in South Africa seems to be his trouble. He has been doing a great disservice to a very laudable object. When he asks us to interfere with the internal arrangements of another part of the Empire, he asks us to take a course which would react on Australia in a most troublesome way. Is it for us, who are in advance of the world with regard to racial legislation, to invite interference with that legislation 1 Does the honourable and learned member suppose that if we interfere with the self-government of other parts of the Empire, we can resist their claim to direct their attention to our affairs ? We ought to be tlje last to go out of the confines of this continent to deal with any question of that sort. We should be studious in our avoidance of the troubles of any other part seeing that we are ourselves in secure possession of a splendid charter of self-government. If we interfere in South Africa in connection with black labour, they have the same right to interfere in Australia in connection with white labour. Unconsciously, the honourable and learned member is striking a serious blow at our system of self-govei*nment, which has enabled us to achieve such grand results. At 45 x z the same time, it does seem incongruous that, we who are bundling the Kanaka out of our confines, and resisting the intrusion of all the inferior races, should have been fighting in a country where there is such a tremendous supply of cheap, coloured labour. But that is our unfortunate position. We have no voice in their internal arrangements. This Government, representing the self-governing institutions of Australia, is asked to take an action which would inevitably strike a blow at our liberties. I can conceive of no policy more open to. grave criticism and to be resisted. I am glad to hear that the Government will not interfere in that way. The honourable and learned member's remedy is rather out of doors. It is within his right to ask his fellow citizens in public meetings to pass a resolution telling his confreres in South Africa how deeply he sympathizes with them in regard to the adverse conditions under which they suffer. I have no doubt, notwithstanding what has been said, that the labour conditions are very acute in that country. There are thousands of our own people who cannot get employment there, and it is all because of the tremendous competition with cheap black labour. I know some men who are coining back, and they all declare that a white man has the greatest difficulty to get employment in mining pursuits and similar occupations. If South Africa is to be completely in the Empire, in the sense in which Australia is, and is to maintain her free institutions, something will have to be done to curb the employment of black labour. The honourable and learned member says that we have no fear of competition from black labour, because white men will not descend to the local conditions. The same argument might very well be made to apply to Queensland. If the sugarplanters will only pay enough for white labour they can get all their work done. When it comes to making a choice between the black man and the white man, I shall consider the white man first every time. If South Africa is to be governed in the interest of the natives and to the exclusion of white labour, then a very serious problem will be presented to the Empire at large. I believe that South Africa is in a very disorganized condition. That is the inevitable result of the upheaval which took place. In time, no doubt, order will be evolved, but in the meantime the position is acute. There can be no harm in expressing our sympathy with the unfortunate victims over there, and in doing everything which is possible by constitutional methods, outside interference, to help them to remedy their difficulties. It would be at our free institutions if we began to assert a right to interfere in the internal conditions of any country' within the Empire. The honourable and learned member is taking a course which is calculated to alienate sympathy from a very deserving object. He talks about the denial of free institutions in South Africa. How did that unfortunate result come about ? It was incidental to the attempt to defend our country from those who wished to take away our free institutions. There was no ehoice left to us, and the honourable and learned member knows that the suspension of free institutions in that troubled country is only temporary. We have been repeatedly assured, upon the honour of the statesmen of the Empire, that the moment the South Africans prove their fitness to have restored to them free institutions it will be freely and generously done. What the honourable and learned member is pointing out is the consequence of belligerency everywhere. It is generally troublesome in its consequences to free institutions. I hope that he will be satisfied with the indications of sympathy which have flown out to him from all parts of the Chamber. We all agree with him that everything possible should be done to remedy the difficulties in South Africa. But when he talks about having wallowed our hands in blood he gives his own case away, and shows that he is more in sympathy with any movement which aims a blow at the honour and traditions of our troops and our relations to the Empire than with any proposal to remedy the labour troubles in South Africa.",27
112,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D, I think that the honourable member for Parramatta was labouring under a misapprehension when he charged the honourable and learned member for Corio with desiring to destroy British institutions.,28
113,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,It is quite a misquotation.,28
114,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The honourable and learned member was ready to shed his blood at Albert Park, if necessary. I have the greatest sympathy with him. . I agree with him, although I foolishly contributed to it , that it was a huge mistake for us to interfere in South Africa.",28
115,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I said nothing of the sort. I would not like to be mi&understood in that respect. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable and learned member said we wallowed our hands a serious blow in blood over there.,28
116,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Thes e natives belong to South Africa. Years ago when I went to school in America, I was taught that they did not belong to the Caucasian race. I hold that they have as much right to South Africa as we have to Australia. We are the invaders of their country. AVe went there for ""boodle,"" pelf, exploitation, and plunder. '",28

118,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Exactly; but the natives here are a different class of people. The black man was destitute of mental proportions, consequently he was incapable of running this country, and it laid idle. In South Africa, however, the natives have proved themselves more or less capable of work. I do not believe in slavery. Great Britain was the first nation to spend millions to free the niggers. She freed the niggers in her West Indian Islands at a cost of Â£33,000,000. It is very well to talk about sympathetic resolutions. One ham sandwich makes an infinitely better impression upon a hungry' man than do 40,000 resolutions of sympathy.

119,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I should like to hear something with regard to the proposed appointment of aSecretary to the Executive Council. Unless we are to have a peripatetic administration such as was recently threatened I can see no necessity for the appointment of such an official. The practice in Victoria has been to make an allowance to an officer already in the State service for acting as Clerk to the Executive Council, and I have not heard that this gentleman has taken to his bed through nervous exhaustion resulting from over-work.",28
120,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,No ; but he might be prostrated by having to .attend so many social functions.,28
121,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,-We do not require an officer to give his attention to matters of that kind. I should be glad to hear what the Acting Prime Minister has to say upon this subject.,29
122,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The provision for the appointment of a Secretary for the Executive Council was withdrawn from the proposal recently submitted with regard to the establishment of the Governor General, because it was urged that it was a matter that did not specifically relate to His Excellency's office in the same manner as did the costs and charges attached. Although at that time. I thought that this was a very important feature of the proposed new arrangement I withdrew it in deference to the wishes of honourable members, in order that we might consider the merits of the case in connection with the Estimates. The title of the office is that of "" Secretary to the Executive - Council"" instead of "" Clerk to the Executive Council.""  to pay the official Â£450 per annum to console him for the alteration of the title 1",29
123,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No . The Clerk of the' Executive Council has hitherto received Â£150 per annum, in addition to his income from other sources, apart from the Commonwealth, for attending the meetings of the Executive Council, and for dealing with the papers relating to its proceedings. Even for those duties the remuneration is entirely inadequate, having regard to the extreme importance of the business dealt with, and the continuously confidential position which the clerk occupies towards Ministers, on the one side, and the representative of the Crown on the other.",29
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Is it not a fact the Minister proposes that Â£600 shall be paid to an officer who will be practically a private secretary to His Excellency Governor General 1,29
125,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No ; I will explain what foundation there is for that statement. There is some, but the whole error has arisen through the introduction of the word ""private."" The officer whose appointment is contemplated will be a public officer, and his duties will be of a public character. Although the readjustment of the relations, so far as expenditure is concerned between the Governor General and the Commonwealth called attention to this matter, and pointed to the necessity of making some change, I was personally only too happy to seize the opportunity of carrying out what I had long believed to be a proper alteration. In New South Wales and Victoria, if not in other States, it has been customary to pay the officer who is merely Clerk to the Executive Council a larger sum than is here provided for.",29
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Bu the has not an additional clerk at Â£ 3 2 5 per annum.,29
127,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Yes . I am informed that in New South Wales and in Victoria the Clerk of the Executive Council has clerical assistance afforded to him.,29
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Then it is departmental assistance.,29
129,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"It is provided for on the departmental estimates. It has been the practice to provide at the expense of the department a clerk to assist in performing the work connected with the Executive Council. The officer whose appointment is here provided for is to be the Secretary to the Executive Council. That is to say, he is to be the Governor General's secretary in all matters relating to the public business discharged by His Excellency on behalf of the Commonwealth and having charge of all communications which pass between the Commonwealth .and the Imperial Government or the State Governments, or through the Imperial Government with other powers. His time will be as fully occupied when in the discharge of his public duties as that of most other officers in the public service. The duties are now discharged by Captain Wallington, who receives an allowance for acting as Clerk to the Executive Council. Eor years we had a special officer in Victoria at a salary of Â£700 or Â£800 a year, and clerical assistance was provided for him from the that Chief Secretary's office.",29
130,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That was some time ago. Has not Mr Brisbane been discharging the the work for some time past for Â£ 1 5 0 a year ?,29
131,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"At the time. I speak of Mr Brisbane performed the greater part of the duties of the Clerk to the Executive Council, but, in addition to that, the Clerk to the Council was receiving the salary I have mentioned, not because of the bulk of the work he was called upon to do, but because of its importance. I hope honourable members will grasp that what we propose involves a real - change. We intend to take this officer under our complete control, so that all public and official communications of the Governor General with the Imperial Government, and with the Governments of the States, or through the Imperial Government with foreign Powers, may beintrustedto an officer responsible to us, who shall be mainserious tained continuously in office, and shall have that knowledge of all matters dealt with from time to time which is really invaluable. Some of the issues with which the Executive Council has to deal relate to negotiations of long standing concerning our relations with the Imperial Government and foreign Powers. Among the communications which pass are some of the most confidential character, many of them containing information supplied to the Government of the Commonwealth and other responsible Governments by the Imperial Government affecting foreign Powers or our interests here or abroad. Occasionally, though perhaps not often, matters of this kind are of the utmost importance, and their revelation would involve most serious consequences. It is absolutely necessary, therefore, that the officer intrusted with these communications should possess the confidence of the Government and of the Governor General, through whom he eventually enjoys the confidence of the Imperial Government. The proposal is to take out of the hands of the Governor General's staff all the public duties connected with the office of Secretary to the Executive Council. The Governor General will continue to pay his own staff for his own private purposes, in view of the social functions which attach to his position. W it h that we have nothing to do. The Secretary to the Executive Council will have no such social obligations to fulfil. I have already told honourable members that I should strongly recommend the appointment as Secretary to the Executive Council of Captain Wallington, who is now acting as Clerk. He is a man who possesses an unexampled knowledge of the affairs of every State in the Commonwealth.",29
132,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Was not this office created for him ?,30
133,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,No .,30
134,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That is the impression.,30
135,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That impression is entirely erroneous. I have long had in my mind the desirability of making a change of this kind. I have been altogether opposed to permitting public business of the greatest importance to be dealt with by any young adjunct of His Excellency's staff whom he may select to transact it . I told honourable members recently of one instance that occurred in which loss-the loss of thousands of pounds - wa s occasioned by a mistake on the part of a member of a Governor's staff in decoding an important official proposal which passed between Australia and another part of the Empire. The mistake was made by an officer over whom we had no control, because he was paid by the Governor General.",30
136,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,We are paying this officer.,30
137,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Yes , for the purpose of making him responsible directly to us.",30
138,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,But he is being paid already.,30
139,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"He is now being paid as Clerk to the Executive Council, but we propose to appoint him Secretary, and to entrust to him the whole of the duties attached to that position.",30
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Will not the effect be to relieve the Governor General for the time being of the necessity of paying this particular salary ?,30
141,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No , the effect of it will be to place the Secretary of the Executive Council in exactly the same position as that occupied by the same official in the Dominion of Canada, where, owing to experience similar to our own, it was found to be undesirable to leave it to the Governor General to allot his official correspondence to any member of his staff. The Governor General chooses his staff very often for personal reasons. It may be comprised of members of his own family or of those who are closely associated with him, and the questions whether his officials possess the requisite knowledge or efficiency to enable them to competently discharge the highly responsible duties attached to his public functions is a matter between his conscience and himself, with which the Government have no right to interfere. We cannot offer advice to His Excellency as to or exercise control general over the officers whom he chooses. We are now proposing to change that system by making the Secretary to vhe Executive Council our own - officer, directly responsible to the Commonwealth. We shall thus bring under control the whole of the public correspondence which passes between the Commonwealth and the Imperial Government and other States.",30
142,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Will he be a member of the public service ? Mr .DEAKIN - Yes .,31
143,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Unde r what section of the Act?,31
144,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I cannot say at the moment, but he will be required to comply with the same conditions as all' other public servants. I can assure honourable members that, as a matter of experience, the absence of the direct control of the public correspondence of the Commonwealth has, in more than one instance, led to serious embarrassment. At the present time, if a paper is wanted, Ministers make application for it to their Governor, but delay sometimes occurs through the misplacing of documents which have passed through the hands of more than one aidede-camp. I have known considerable delay in the production of a document wanted by a State Ministry to occur for some reason of that kind.",31
145,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Thing s must have been carried on in a very slip-shod way in Yictoria.,31
146,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"My knowledge is not confined to the practice of any one State. Under the present system we have not the control which we should have of the communications which pass between us and the Secretary of State - for the Colonies, or the Governments of the States.",31
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,In what way will position of this officer differ from that of the Clerk to the Executive Council of State?,31
148,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The Clerk to an Exeand cutive Council, attends the meetings of the the Colonial-office. Executive, records its papers, and registers them as well. This officer will have charge of the whole of the correspondence which transmitted from theCommonwealththrough the Governor General to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to foreign and to the Governments of the States. He will be responsible for the coding coding of secret despatches, be answerable for errors and proper checking, and take upon himself tasks which now may be dischannel tributed amongst several members of the Governor General's household. The Cominstance monwealth will pay his salary, and will have the same right to dispense with his services as we have to dispense with the services of other public officials. sent occupant of the office has been with six or eight Governors, and has served i practically every State in has been behind the scenes in Australian politics for nearly twenty years past, and holds .the clues to transactions of a confidential nature which have occurred during that time.",31
149,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I think it must be agreed that, if the office is a necessary one, the gentleman to be appointed is quite capable of performing the duties attaching to it.  of increasing the Governor General's salary by decreasing his expenditure ?",31
150,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No. At present we pay this officer Â£ 1 5 0 a year, and we propose to increase his salary by Â£45 0 to make it Â£600.  over and pay him for the performance of work for which he is now being paid by the Governor General ?",31
151,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The Governor General allots the duties connected with the transmission, recording, and coding of correspondence among various members of his staff, and, while it is true that the creation of this office will decrease that work, the number of its members is practically determined by other considerations, so that the saving to the Governor General will not be worth mentioning.",31
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Will Captain Wallington communicate the contents of desthe patches to the Governor General ?,31
153,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Despatche s will pass a from the Ministry to this officer, and he will hand them on to the Governor General, upon his authority transmit them to In the same way, replies will be transmitted by the Governor General through him to us, and he will is retain and record them for us, and will be responsible for them. He will be in that way an intermediary between the Governorpowers, General and the Ministry.",31
154,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,It is a wrong position and dein which to place an officer.,31
155,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The experience of Canada shows such an officer to be the proper of communication between a Governor General and his advisers. I know of an in which a State Cabinet was kept waiting for papers for a fortnight because one aide-de-camp thought that they were in his possession, whereas they had been dealt The prewith by another.",31
156,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,When that happened n the Governor was not attending properly to Australia. He the public business.,31
157,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"A Governor cannot always prevent such occurrences. absent in the country from time to time on public business, and while he is away official communications pass through the hands' of the aide-de-camp whom he has left behind to attend fco them. But, perhaps, the replies to those despatches are dealt with and sent away by another aide-de-camp during his term of duty. The Commonwealth Government should have control of its despatches, and be the master of every officer who is intrusted with the performance of important public business. We have nothing to do with the Governor General's private communications and social invitations. He deals with them as he pleases, through whatever officers he chooses to appoint. Public documents and despatches, however, ought to be-within our control, and the officer who receives and records them should be a Commonwealth officer.",32
158,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," The position taken up by the Acting Prime Minister in defence of the creation of - this office cannot be successfully attacked. I quite admit that an officer who will be responsible to the Commonwealth Government for the proper performance of the work should be appointed to this position. AVhat I object to is the proposal to increase the expenditure of this sub-department by Â£ 4 5 0 a year. The Secretary to the Eederal Executive Council is to have a clerk at Â£32 5 a year. The Acting Prime Minister made a great point of the fact that it is absolutely necessary the secretary should be a man deserving the confidence of successive Ministries, but not a solitary despatch can pass through the office which will not be accessible to the clerk as well as to the secretary.",32
159,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The clerk will see the Executive Council papers, but he will not see the foreign correspondence, confidential despatches, and documents of that kind, which will go through the secretary alone.",32
160,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Will copies of foreign despatches not be kept in the office ? Is it proposed that these copies shall be always looked up in a safe, and be inaccessible to the office staff?",32
161,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"At the present time they are not in our hands at all j they are in the hands of the Governor General, who treats them as he thinks best.",32
162,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Will the Governor General still retain possession of some of these papers ?,32
163,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,No ; we propose that this He is officer shall retain them.,32
164,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Then they will be kept in the office, and the clerk at Â£ 3 2 5 a year will have access to them.",32
165,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The clerk may see Executive Council papers, but the officer who is to be Secretary to the Executive Council will deal with despatches and papers, which his clerk will never see. The clerk will have a room of his own.",32
166,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"But he will have access to the room occupied by the secretary. I want to show that this talk about continuous confidential relationship between; the secretary and the Ministry is all moonshine, and to protest against the appointment of a society favourite to this position.",32
167,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Canno t we discuss the matter without reference to individuals ?,32
168,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Every member must be the judge of his own actions in a matter of this kind, and I consider that I have a perfect right, in the interests of the public, and of men who have grown up and spent their best years in the service of the public, to protest against the appointment to this highly-paid office of a man whom I regard as a society butterfly.",32
169,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I wish the honourable member knew him.,32
170,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I know him by seeing him in the street, but I have never spoken to him, and am not under any obligation to him, so that I cannot be said to have any personal feeling in the matter. The Acting Prime Minister told us that this man has had twenty years' experience of public life.",32
171,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Yes , in almost every State,. as secretary to different Governors.",32
172,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,He has had no experience in Western Australia.,32
173,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I think that is the only State in which he has not acted, though he has visited it . Very few public servants know more than their own State.",32
174,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"He is, no doubt, acquainted with the private affairs of several past Governors, and knows a great deal about society functions, but he cannot have had experience in the real conduct of public affairs, unless he has gained it lately by reason of his connection with the Commonwealth Executive Council.",32

176,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Anothe r man would have to be trained for the position.,33
177,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Allowin g that he has some acquaintance with the conduct of public affairs, the duties which he has hitherto discharged are not parallel with those which the occupant of this office will be called upon to perform, and, in any case, those who have entered the public service as boys, and who have grown up in it, have earned the right by their industry and good conduct to appointment to offices like this. Before filling this position the Government should ascertain whether there is not already in the public service a man who is capable of discharging the duties attaching to it . I am sorry if my protest has had anything like a personal aspect; but if the Government will not undertake to invite and to fairly consider applications from the public service for the position, I hope the committee will strike out the item.",33
178,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," The main point we have to consider is whether it is l ight to create an office of this description. If we think that it is, the appointment of any particular person to the office is a matter not for us, but for the Executive, who will be responsible for their action to this House. We must not confuse the two positions. Do not let us, because of a possible mistake in the appointment, decide that the office is unnecessary. If we make this provision it will be the duty of the Government to consider the claims of every man in the public service in connection with those of Captain Wallington. While I do not assert that it is wrong, I rather deprecate the introduction of a personal element into the discussion of a public question.  himself said that the appointment was being made for Captain Wallington.",33
179,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No , I said that I would strongly recommend my colleagues to appoint Captain Wallington, and that I believed they would do so; but that cannot be said to be "" making"" a position for him.",33
180,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I do not think my honourable and learned friend would confuse us by introducing such considerations. If it was the intention of the Minister that Captain Wallington should be appointed he was right in stating it to the committee, and now that we have the information we have to consider whether the office is necessary. If I may give the committee the benefit of my experience as a Premier of one of the States for five years, I must say that an office of the kind is absolutely necessary as a means of conveying confidential communications between the Ministers and the representatives of the Crown. A man possessing high qualifications, whether he be the gentleman named or an officer taken from the public service, is absolutely necessary in working out a system of government which, to a much larger extent than some honourable members appear to think, involves confidential communications between the Government and the representatives of the Imperial authorities. It is so with the States, and I think it must be still more so in the case of the Commonwealth Government. I have come to the conclusion that the office is necessary. Of course, there are a number - of persons who would accept the position for one-third of the salary proposed to be attached to it . But we do not govern in that way. If we did,, we could readily obtain seven persons to do the work of the Eederal Ministry for Â£ 5 0 0 a year; but we feel that, granted the necessity for an office, it is our duty to attach a proper salary to that office in order that the best man for the position may be obtained. Since the name of Captain Wallington has been mentioned, I wish to say that if there is a man in the public service of Australia who is better qualified to fill this position, he ought to be appointed.",33
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,O r as well qualified.,33
182,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am not quite sure of that. Although Captain Wallington has not been, in point of official form, in the public service, I think I am only doing him justice in saying that he has really been just as much a servant of the State as if he had been appointed under the Public Service Act. I have known him personally for twenty years, and I therefore wish the committee to discount anything I say in regard to him, for I may be influenced by friendly prejudice. I cannot claim any personal intimacy with him ; but from force of circumstances, I was brought daily into contact with this gentleman, and I believe him to be singularly well qualified for the position. There may be another man in the service better or equally well qualified for the office, and, if so, the Government must consider his claims. We must never be led away from a proper regard for the claims to promotion of officers in the service. If I knew of any man in the service as well qualified to fill this office, I think I should abstain from saying one word to recommend the gentleman named ; but I honestly believe that for this particular office there is no man so well qualified as he is. Apart from that altogether, I hope that in dealing with the Estimates, we shall be quite frqe from pei""sonal considerations. If the salary is voted, the appointment will be a matter of Executive responsibility. Before making the appointment the Government are absolutely bound to satisfy themselves that there is not a person equally well qualified for the position in the public service of Australia. W it h that obligation, and that responsibility upon the Government, I think we have at present simply to consider whether the office is necessary, and whether the salary is too high. In my opinion, the office is absolutely necessary, and the salary reasonable. In these circumstances, I shall certainly support the vote.",33
183,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I That the item, ""Secretaiy to the Federal Executive Council, Â£600,"" be reduced by Â£200.",34
184,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Why not move to strike out the line "" Clerk, Â£ 3 2 5 "" ?",34
185,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am bound to take the Acting Prime Minister's declaration that a clerk must be employed, but we should be very careful not to increase the number of secretaries in the Commonwealth service. Great dissatisfaction exists because it is said that nearly every man in the service has a secretaiy, and that the secretary has a clerk, for whom the people have to pay. If members of the Federal Parliament can afford to spend Â£ 4 0 0 or Â£ 5 0 0 in seeking election to this House, to work here for Â£ 4 00 a year, and to allow their business to go to the dogs, as many of them have to do, surely Â£ 4 0 0 a year ought to enable the Government to secure a suitable Secretary to the Executive Council ? I could obtain the services of a university man- a man with 44 degrees attached to his name-to do the work for Â£ 4 0 0 a year.",34
186,Mr THOMSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Member s of Parliament can be obtained to do the work of the country for nothing.,34
187,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Certainly . The work which the Secretary to the Executive Council has to do is not sufficient to keep him employed for an hour a day. I agree with the honourable member for Coolgardie that the clerk will do the work. It is very funny to hear that certain private communications pass between the Government and the representative of the Crown which no one can see except the gentleman at the top. If there are such private communications, they must be a danger to the fabric of democracy in Australia. The Government have no right to have communications with any foreign Power about which the people are net entitled to hear. If ever I have] the honour of being Prime Minister the people shall know everything.",34
188,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The honourable member would not let his constituents know of every'communication that passed between him and his Ministers.,34
189,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I should at least let them know of all cbmmunications with Powers beyond the seas.,34
190,Mr WILKS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," The leader of the Opposition has requested the committee to remove all personal elements from their consideration of this item. I think it is move- wise that we should do so not only in regard to this, but in regard to all the items. On the evidence which has been presented, this office is necessary, but I do not think a department is necessary. There is a difference between an officer and a department, and I think the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, has put his finger on the weak spot. He realizes that it is necessary to grant a secretary to the Executive Council, but he is not prepared to grant both a secretary and a department. That is a danger which is associated with the whole service. Immediately a chance to create an office is discovered, an officer is appointed, and he at once starts to erect a department around him. In this division provision is made for a clerk at a salary of Â£ 3 2 5 per annum. That is a princely remuneration for a clerk. It has ""been admitted that a secretary should be appointed, and high encomiums have been passed by the Acting Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition upon Captain Wallington. It is said that his training and associations fit him for the office. Butithas also been admitted that his time will not be so fully occupied I as to necessitate the employment of a clerk to assist him. I would Suggest to the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, that he should withdraw his amendment, and that when we come to the line, "" Clerk, Â£325,"" he should move to strike it out. A clerk is an officer who performs the mechanical work of the department, and it is absurd that we should pay Â£32 5 per annum for the work in addition to a salary of Â£ 6 0 0 per annum for a secretary. out the provision for a clerk, this item can remain. The secretary's time will not be fully occupied, and he is not likely to be much out of pocket if he has to find some one to do the median ical work.",34
191,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,But we should be dismissing a good man if we got rid of the clerk.,35
192,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,No one will be dismissed.,35
193,Mr REID,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,No - the clerk will be transferred to some other department.,35
194,Mr WILKS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The whole range of the service will be open to him.,35
195,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,A salary of Â£ 6 00 is too much for any man.,35
196,Mr WILKS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"It appears that there is already a clerk in the office; but it is not necessary to dismiss him, seeing that he may be found a position in some other branch of the service. At any rate, my only concern is to watch the interests of the public. The Acting Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition occupy positions which compel us to pay attention to the opinions they express, and I feel that I must accept their statement that Â£ 6 0 0 is not too larsre a salary for the office. I should be glad if the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr. O'Malley, would withdraw his amendment in order that I - inay move that the item "" Clerk, Â£325,"" be omitted.",35
197,Mr SALMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Laanecoorie)' - I am sorry the Government have proposed to appoint a Secretary, to the Federal Executive Council at a salary of Â£600. When the last Estimates were before the Chamber there was a discussion in regard to the remuneration which was paid to the then Secretary to the Governor General for extra services rendered to the Executive Council, and honourable members may recollect that I very strongly advocated the claims of the occupant of that office for consideration at the hands of the committee. The item was passed, and I have not altered my opinion with regard to it, but I deplore the fact that the Government have manufactured another office, which in my opinion is ""not necessary.",35
198,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Was the honourable member here when I spoke ?,35
199,Mr SALMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,No .,35
200,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Ha d the honourable member been present he would not now make that statement.,35
201,Mr SALMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am only expressing my opinion - The argument used when this matter was discussed before-and I dare If we strike say it has been used today-wa s that it is absolutely necessary on account of the character of the communications which pass between the Commonwealth Government and the Home Government, that the officer in charge should be entirely under the control of the federal authorities. I do not agree with that argument. I feel satisfied that the gentleman occupying the very responsible position of private secretary and confidential adviser to the Governor General is quite competent to undertake the duty of acting as the medium of communication between us and the Home Government. The only danger to be apprehended is that of the divulging of confidential reports and despatches ; bub I cannot imagine an officer occupying the position to which I have alluded being guilty of anything approaching such conduct. I am prepared to vote against the item. I quite agiee with honourable members who are of opinion that an appointment of the kind would mean the immediate creation of a departmenb, the officers in which would arrogate bo bhemselves a posibion in the service which, in my opinion, they should not occupy. The greatest danger that the Government have to encounter at the hands of the people of the Commonwealth is due' to the multiplication of offices under'federal aubhoriby. As a supporter of the Government, I regret to find againbecause this is not the first time it has happened-the creation of an absolubely new office which had no exisbence under the States Governments.",35

203,Mr SALMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I know that the Minister for Home Affairs is very sorry to follow any example; he likes to lay down a line for himself. The honourable gentleman, while he is not prepared to follow anybody, would like us all to follow him ; but I am not prepared to follow in the direction desired on this occasion. _",35
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I have a groat deal of sympathy with the view expressed by the last speaker, while disagreeing with him in his statement that no such officer is required.",35
205,Mr SALMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I did not say that.,36
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"There is absolute necessity for such an officer, and I agree with the designation given him in the sideration. Estimates. In my. opinion the Acting Prime Minister is responsible for the whole of this debate. Instead of leaving honorof able members to infer from reading the item what the duties are-that is to say, the duties are what we think they ought be-the Acting Prime Minister tells that the officer is to belong partly to the Governor General and partly to the Execuand tive Council.",36
207,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I did not say that . officer would belong to the Governorhas General, but that he would have to be the Governor General's confidence.",36
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am now putting my own construction on what the Acting Prime Minister said, and if the intention as I have indicated, the officer will be in an entirely false position. I can conceive of circumstances, in time of crisis, when would be most inconvenient to have officer so appointed acting as a means communication between the Governor-Genevernment, ral and the Ministry for the time being. Such an officer ought to be absolutely under the control of the Government, and not in ments to be made. confidential relations with the Governoror General. One would think, on listening the Acting Prime Minister, that this one of the most important offices in the world-that there was hardly a man capable of filling it - and in that I think the has been overstated. We do require Secretary to ^he Executive Council, here we have a proposal to pay a man a salary, not for doing the real work, standing in confidential relations as between the Ministry and the Governor General. If the occupant of the office be paid Â£ a year he ought to be made responsible, and the real work not left to somebody else; and I protest against the creation of what may be called a merely complimentary office. I am prepared to vote the first item, irrespective of whom the occupant of the office may be, but I think that the whole civil service ought to considered in filling these superior positions. Our first duty is to officers of the service who have been struggling along for so many years ; and any officer capable of doing the end I would not support. work should have the preference. I want to guard myself against reflecting in any way on Captain Wallington, whom I believe to be a' very able man' in his particular line; but there are able officers in the service who, as I say, ought to receive con",36
209,Mr MCC AY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I gave way before in order to listen to the explanation the Acting Prime Minister, but I must confess frankly that I do not yet feel satisif fied with this item. There are two facts to which we cannot disregard. The first is us that we are saddling the Commonwealth permanently with another highly-paid officer, the second is that the Commonwealth has not yet come to grief in the absence of such the an officer. The present state of affairs not been productive of the disaster in that the Acting Prime Minister painted in .somewhat lurid colours. In the present financial circumstances of Australia, even if the permanent appointment of this be official would mean an improved conplaced duct of the business of the Executive Council, I think the existing arrangement it ought to continue for the sake of the an saving that would be thereby effected. of A great charge made against this Goand especially against some of the members of the Government, is that they are continually allowing new appointAs the States are, will be in a short time, face to face with to deficits, it is our business to save every was penny, and the present arrangement ought . to be continued at any rate until the financial stress is over. Sums of Â£ 4 0 0 or case Â£ 5 0 0 saved here and there will amount to a a very considerable sum throughout the but whole of the departments.",36
210,Mr SALMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,And the example will be but for far more valuable than the saving.,36
211,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"A postponement of the appointment would be an advisable step, 6 0 0 and it may be that afterwards there will not appear the same necessity for such rigid and lasting economy. I am not prepared to vote for this new appointment.",36
212,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"It was mainly in reply for to the honourable and learned member for Corinella that I rose before, but refrained from entering on several important topics be which have since been touched on as incidental to this particular matter. I quite agree that - there is necessity for economy, and there is no reasonable proposal to that I altogether repudiate the charge that this Parliament this Government have as yet been guilty of any departure from the rules of economy.",36
213,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I did not say that Government or Parliament had been guilty.' What I said was that we were regarded as being guilty, and that I did not want anything to be done to encourage the idea.",37
214,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That may be so, but is necessary to make this preliminary repudiwhere ation. However, I recognise the possibility of making a saving in connection with this proposal.

216,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"We are not going to able member for Tasmania, M ""- O'Malley, dismiss him. I am alluding to the clerk at Â£325 a year. When examining work that was being done, I could to see that it was a considerable payment for the duties performed. But the clerk has so well and efficiently a long time, that I did not wish to propose a change until a change should be obligaperson tory. It has been suggested, however, the Â£ 3 2 5 is a considerable salary for the discharge of what are practically - ordinary, regular, mechanical, clerical, duties ; and, in order to meet the views honourable members, I am prepared to promise that my colleagues and myself endeavour to find amongst the new appointments necessary under the Commonwealth, one suitable for such an officer, and to the claims of this gentleman the first congested. sideration, with a view of replacing him by a clerk at a smaller salary.",37

220,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"T have in my hand a document which has to be transmitted. That document consists of fifteen pages, and requires to be copied, and similar documents, also requiring to be copied, are passing to and fro every day. It is impossible to expect a man in charge of such or documents, who has also to perform other responsible duties, to do mechanical work.",37
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Is not all the work the of the Department of External Affairs so confidential, or nearly so ?",37
222,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No . As I said before, with a view to meet the views of honourable members, I am willing to undertake at the earliest possible moment to transfer this it permanent officer to some other department further assistance is required. The Minister for Home Affairs, who has under his supervision the electoral work and public service administration, may, I hope, be able it, to take the claims of this officer into is.a consideration, and thus leave us free to appoint a clerk at a smaller salary to do the mechanical work required in connection want with the Executive Council. By that means the saving desired by the honor1 will practically be achieved, and we shall the obtain what we want, namely, full connot fail trol by the Government.",37

I wish to know whether it is the intention of the Government to allow the office to remain as it is, or whether they intend that the secretary whom they propose to be appointed at Â£ 6 0 0 a year shall do the work ?",38
228,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"It will be necessary to leave this item as it stands until we are able to arrange a transfer. Until that is done the officer will continue to be paid out of this vote. As soon as the work in the department of the Minister for Home Affairs so develops as to require an officer of the standing of this clerk he will be one of the first to be transferred. After that his place will be taken by an officer paid at about the minimum salary of Â£100 or Â£110 a year, engaged to do mechanical work.",38
229,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Does that mean that until an appointment can be made in one of the other departments we shall have two men doing one man's work in connection with the Executive Council 1,38
230,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The opportunity is almost certain to arise before the close of this year. In fact, it may arise within a month, because the Electoral Bill is just on the point of being passed, and that will call for the appointment of at least two or three officers of some standing, who will have important work of a clerical kind to do in connection with the administration of the measure. When that begins, the gentleman who is now filling the position of Clerk to the Executive Council can be transferred. Then, again, the staff of the Public Service Commissioner must be completed within the next two or three months, and there is a probability of an opportunity for a transfer arising there. The first opportunity will be taken, and there is every reason to believe that an opportunity will arise within the next month or two. NOES. "" Mr MCDONA LD (Kennedy) - I am rather surprised that the honourable member for Yarra should try to take away from the Secretary of the Executive Council the clerk who has been appointed to assist him. I think that a man who gets Â£ 6 0 0 a year should have a clerk paid at about Â£300 a year to help him. It is not adding to the dignity of his position that he himself should be called upon to work.",38
231,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Does not the honourable member think that we should get a few messengers to help him ?,38
232,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Certainly; the moment an appointment such as this is made honourable members may rest assured that a number of other appointments will follow. That has been so all through in connection with the establishment of the federal departments.. The idea of giving a man Â£600 a year and then asking him to work is absurd. I am surprised at the Acting Prime Minister asking the committee to allow this clerk bo be transferred to another department. I understand that this gentleman is a very able man.,38
233,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Then he should be able to do the work !,38
234,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I do not think he should be compelled to do it, and under the circumstances I feel almost inclined to vote against the item and abolish the position of the clerk altogether. It is clear that if this officer is transferred it will not relieve the Commonwealth of the expenditure.",38
235,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,It will save a new appointment.,38
236,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,It is time enough to face that contingency when the appointment comes up for consideration. The present position simply means that a post similar to the one which the present clerk holds at Â£ 3 2 5 a year will be created for him in another department.,38
237,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Oh , no; that would be the case in ordinary times, but when we have coming into operation new legislation, for which there must be officers, new and important positions must be created.",38
238,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Then there is the question of whether the officer to fill the position of Secretary to the Eederal Executive Council should not be taken from the ser-' vice of. one of the States. I understand that there are officers doing similar work in the States, and why should an office worth Â£ 6 0 0 a year be given to a man who has not previously been in the public service ?",38
239,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Why not make the clerk the secretary?,39
240,Mr OMALLEY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Yes , give that rooster the salary.",39
241,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"If the clerk has been doing the work in the past, why not give him the Â£ 6 0 0 a year, and then we shall save Â£ 3 25 on the position? The attitude taken up by the Acting Prime Minister seems to indicate that he desires to create this position for a certain individual. An other item in the schedule, to which I would direct attention, is No. 7- "" Travelling expenses of honorary Ministers, being for actual expenses incurred, Â£100."" If honorary Ministers are to receive payment for the expenses they incur while travelling, why should not Members of Parliament be similarly treated ? I am not saying that I approve of that course altogether, but I certainly think that if honorary Ministers get paid, the same treatment should be meted out to Members of Parliament. I am opposed to the Ministers receiving this payment. When the honorary Ministers were appointed, it was done to satisfy certain States. The general impression was that we were to have seven Ministers. Then the Government found that Tasmania raised a certain amount of objection through not been represented in the Ministry. Therefore, they immediately appointed an honorary Minister for Tasmania. Then again, they appointed an honorary Minister for New South Wales, because that State held the premier position in the Commonwealth. In the case of one of them, we have been called upon to appoint a private secretary at Â£400 a year, to assist the honorary Minister, who carries on his own business during the session; and there are cases where the Senate has been practically shut up for a week or a fortnight to suit his convenience. Yet, in addition to paying Â£ 4 0 0 a year for his private secretary, we are asked to pay his travelling expenses.",39
242,Mr MAUGER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That is not fair in regard to a man who has made immense sacrifices for the Commonwealth.,39
243,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"It is fair criticism if this gentleman cannot attend to the business of the Commonwealth for which he is paid. I admit that he has done good work for the Government and for the Commonwealth. We all recognise his ability. But if we are required to appoint another Minister, the Government should come down to Parliament and say that seven Ministers are not sufficient to carry on the work of the Commonwealth. They should take the responsibility of creating another office. But they have not taken that course. They have seen fit to appoint two honorary Ministers, and now we are asked to pay their travelling expenses. It is not right. We ought not to do any such thing.",39
244,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I wish to explain that the item of Â£ 1 0 0 for the travelling expenses of honorary Ministers is not devoted to the purposes which the honourable member for Kennedy supposes. It is intended to pay the expenses of honorary Ministers when they visit some part of the Commonwealth to dischargeMinisterial functions or to attend when the presence of a member of the Federal Executive is required. The money is notdevoted to paying their travelling expenses on ordinary occasions. The vote is put down here to inform the committee publicly that honorary Ministers are required occasionally to attend certain functions which are important enough to require the presence of a Minister.,39
245,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Suppos e a member of Parliament is required to attend some important function, does he have his expenses paid? '""I??'",39
246,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"He exercises his own - choice as to whether he attends or not. But this is a case where a member of the Cabinet would have no interest in the matter, but must take a long journey to attend some important function, and is paid his out-of-pocket expenses.",39
247,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,There is no reason why he should attend at all.,39
248,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,On l y Â£ 5 5 was spent in this direction last year.,39
249,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The Government are now increasing the amount.,39
250,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No ; it does not follow that because Â£ 1 0 0 is put upon the Estimates that such an amount will be required in the course of the year. It may be that we shall not spend more than Â£ 5 5 , as was the case last year.",39
251,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"What is the meaning of item 5 in subdivision 3- "" Temporary assistance, Â£12.0."" Why should temporary assistance be wanted any longer ?",39
252,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I do not suppose it will be wanted, but one can never tell, especially in connection with the administration of new Acts of Parliament. For instance, the bulk of the Â£ 1 0 5 voted last year was spent in connection with the permit system which we were asked to undertake in regard to vessels leaving for South Africa. It was entirely unforeseen expenditure; no one could have expected it. The amount involved is too small to make it a charge against the Imperial Government, more especially as the system was not at all unfavorable to the interests of Australia.  Africa t",39
253,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Altogethe r rather more than 3,000. The money was spent in a totally unexpected direction, and, of course, if such occasions do not arise in the coming year the money will not be spent.  to ask the Acting Prime Minister what he is going to do about the salary of the Clerk to the Executive Council t",40
254,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I have already explained that, owing to the Electoral Bill, which will come into operation shortly, and to the work involved in connection with the office of the Public Service Commissioner, opportunities may be afforded for the transfer of the officer now filling the position of clerk. As soou as possible, he will be transferred to some clerical post probably under one or other of the new Acts.",40
255,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Will he be an electoral expert 1,40
256,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No ; he will be a clerical officer in connection with the administration of one of the Acts. The Electoral Act is going to cost for the establishment of its administration Â£35,000, and will involve a very large amount of work in connection with the preparation of the new rolls, the bringing into operation of new machinery, and so on. We propose to take the first opportunity, which we expect will arise in a few months, to transfer this officer to a position suitable to his standing in the public service. transfer will be an advantage' to him, because he will have opportunities of rising, if he exhibits sufficient energy and ability, which' he would not have if he remained in his present position. We shall then cast upon the secretary the whole of the work in connection with the Executive Council except the purely mechanical writing and typing, for which we shall appoint a junior officer at about Â£ 1 1 0 per year.  pleased to hear the explanation of the Acting Prime Minister, and as far as I am concerned it is satisfactory.",40
257,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Why should agentleman at Â£600 a year be expected to do any work 1  member know that it is only in keeping with the ordinary manner of heads of departments that they should not do much work? I have not had much to do with heads of departments in the federal service, but the little I have had to do with them in the State service of Queensland shows me that heads of departments are harder to approach than Ministers. They stick you outside their doors, and keep you standing there to be scrutinized by anybody who comes along, as though you were a proclamation. Perhaps the federal service may not be so bad as that. As the Attorney-General has given the committee an assurance that this item of Â£325 will be reduced, we cannot cavil at the action of the Government. We have lost on the last division, and must be satisfied. We know very well that the .whole Commonwealth is being accused of spending money very freely by the creation of various offices. This appears to be the only office created that has not had following in its train the appointment of half-a-dozen, or, perhaps, twenty, minor officers.",40
258,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Giv e them time.  department has been established for twelve months, and we find that the cost has only increased by a little over Â£600, whereas the cost of some of the departments. has increased by thousands per annum. We have not got that far in this instance. If we are to take up as much time upon the rest of the Estimates as has been taken up in discussing this vote of Â£600, we are likely to be here for the next four months instead of getting away next week. If there is one That thing which I like more than another it is political consistency, and I must say that some members of this committee are amongst the most expert political acrobats I have yet come across. Honourable members representing South Australia are always preaching economy and asking for the assurance of Ministers that they will not make this or some other appointment, but when they are given an opportunity of voting for a reduction of Â£200 they do not avail themselves of it .  ber see me voting against it 1   Australian representative present.  honourable member say so, because honourable members from South Australia aie always preaching economy, and yefc when large sums of money are going through in connection with these Estimates there is only one representative of the model State present.  regret that the honourable member for Maranoa should have cast any reflections upon the representatives of South Australia. People who live in glass houses should not throw stones, and in the matter of attendance to the duties of this House the representatives of South Australia compare, favourably with those of any other State. I happen to be the only representative of that State present today, because the other representatives, in common with most members of the committee, were under the impression that the debate upon the Budget speech would occupy at least a week. I rose particularly to say that I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Acting Prime Minister in connection with the vote for travelling allowances for honorary Ministers. I presume that when Ministers took it upon themselves to go beyond the Constitution in the' appointment of honorary Ministers, they did so for their own convenience. I remind honourable members that this House has been particularly generous to Ministers, and has given them their salaries of Â£ 4 0 0 each as members, or Â£2,800 more than has been accepted by Ministers in similar conditions in any of the States Parliaments.",40
259,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That is not so. No State Parliament was ever in the same position under its Constitution.  which this expenditure may be avoided. Ministers might attend these functions in other States themselves, and if they can not find .time to do so, they can certainly, out of the emoluments they receive, pay the expenses of honorary Ministers who are called upon to do their work. If the appointment of these honorary Ministers is intended to relieve them of their obligation to attend functions in the different States, the effect will be to relieve them of expenditure, and that is another reason why we 45 v should protest against this arrangement. I shall be prepared to support the honourable member for Kennedy should he persist in the amendment he has suggested, not because of the amount at stake, but because of the principle involved. Mr A . PATERSON (Capricornia) - I heartily support the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Kennedy. When it is considered that the Ministerial salaries amount to Â£15,000, it will be admitted that they are very liberally treated, and I think it is altogether too mean and too Scotch for them to say that they will not put their hands into their pockets to pay the expenses of honorary Ministers incurred in the performance of duties which they should perform themselves. The country should certainly not be asked to support any such charge.",41
260,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," To bring this discussion to an issue, I move That the item, "" Clerk Â£325,"" be omitted. The Acting Prime Minister has spoken in the highest terms of this officer.",41
261,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,We shall not get rid of him by omitting this item.,41
262,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I am just going to point out a vacancy which he might be called upon to fill. The Acting Prime Minister has given this officer a very high testimonial.,41
263,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Eor the duties which he has to perform.,41
264,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"And of course for other duties for which it may be found that he is equally capable if he is given a trial. I believe this officer comes from New South Wales, and that he was there regarded as a capable man. From what I have heard, I am inclined to endorse the high character given him by the. Acting Prime Minister, and I point out that if we omit this item, although there will be no clerk at Â£325, there will be nothing to prevent the Government saying to this officer, ""Here is another position, that of Secretary to the' Federal Executive Council. The salary is a little higher than that which you have been receiving, but we presume you will have no objection to promotion.""",41
265,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,He is not fit for that office.,41
266,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"If he is the capable man he is represented to be by the honourable gentleman, and by other honourable members who have spoken concerning him, there can be no reason why his promotion should be delayed. I have no desire to interpose between the Government and their administration of so small a depart-' ment as this, but now that we are out for economy a saving of Â£ 3 2 5 a year in a department is not to be despised, especially when it can be effected by the promotion of a worthy and capable man. The Acting Prime Minister says that this officer is capable only for the discharge of the duties he is at present called upon to perform, but I say that he may prove himself equally .capable in the performance of the higher duties of Secretary to the Executive Council. Probably the man himself does not know what an excellent officer he would make as Secretary to the Executive Council at Â£ 6 0 0 a year, as I am sure that the spur of the additional emolument would induce him to put forward his best efforts to give satisfaction.",41
267,Mr A MCLEAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I am prepared to go quite so far as the honourable member for Coolgardie, but I think the item might be reduced by say Â£200 in order to carry out the suggestion made by the Acting Prime Minister.",42
268,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I have before promised make that reduction, by the transfer of this officer within the next month or two, as soon as the Acts to which I have referred come into force.",42
269,Mr A MCLEAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Might well to do it now when dealing with Estimates 1,42
270,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"We must pay this officer the Â£325, as he is a permanent officer transferred from a State.",42
271,Mr A MCLEAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"If the Acting Prime Minister has undertaken to carry out arrangement I am prepared to accept his word. W it h regard to the item of Â£100 for travelling expenses for honorary MinisI ters, the vote does not amount to much, but there is an important principle involved. I cannot see why honorary Ministers should be paid travelling expenses any any other member of the House. They have never been so paid in any of the States.",42
272,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"This sum is not for ordinary travelling expenses, but only for special trips undertaken in connection with public business.",42
273,Mr A MCLEAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,But private memWe bers have to travel as well.,42
274,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,So have the honorary Ministers; but this vote covers only the bare expenses incurred by them in attendthe ing functions in the States which the other Ministers would otherwise have to attend.,42
275,Mr A MCLEAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"If they relieve other Ministers of duties which they are supposed small to perform, it is not too much to expect those Ministers to pay their expenses.",42
276,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Not in the least, if the committee choose to strike out the item.",42
277,Mr A MCLEAN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"If we keep on increasing the expenditure by small driblets in every possible way the aggregate will be very large. When the attention of the Acting Prime Minister was drawn to several increases in the salaries of clerks in the early part of this division, he was not in a position to give the committee any information. I hold that the committee should be given full particulars of every increase, however large or small it may be. When one State is compelled to go in for percentage reductions-and not its example will be followed by other States-it is a great anomaly that we should be increasing the' salaries of our public officers. By the vote I gave just now, I did not wish to indicate that I thought that the gentleman who is filling the position is to not worth the salary. I certainly think that he is well worth the salary, because I know that he is a most excellent officer and estimable man. I voted as I did to prevent the creation of a new office. I thought it not be as that if the salary were reduced to Â£400, the the office would not be filled.",42
278,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I had not the information at the moment it was asked for by the honourable member for Gippsland. An officer of the department was transferred to that another in which he conceived that he found a better scope for his abilities. His salary was Â£260, and the only appointment have made has been to fill that office at Â£180 a year, by taking an officer from the Naval branch, who otherwise would have lost his employment. That gave me more than a good saving to start with.",42
279,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAHN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,There were other increases.,42
280,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"In reference to the clerks who received increases, we followed the provisions of the Public Service Act as if it were in . operation. had first of all a youth who joined at a salary of Â£ 5 0 , and who had gone through twelve months' experience. W it h him the provision made is that from the 1st July to end of the year he is to get a salary of Â£ 6 0 , and from the 1st January next year a salary of Â£ 8 0 .",42

283,Mr MAUGER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Is he of age, and ought he to be paid a better wage than Â£80 a year 1",43
284,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"My recollection is that he is from eighteen to twenty years of age. Two clerks who were taken from the Tasmanian service, where they got Â£100 a year, have been tried in rhe department, and are now getting Â£ 1 2 0 a year. They have far more important duties to do in ""the department than they had to do in the State service. Then comes an officer who is doing work which last year was done by his senior, who has been moved up. He gets Â£ 1 8 0 a year now, as against Â£ 1 5 0 which he previously received.",43
285,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D, pounds is a very good increase.,43
286,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The officer is doing work which last year was done by an that can be done. officer at a salary of Â£240. When that officer was taken away, we moved up the juniors with these increases. The other officer has been in the Commonwealth since its initiation, and was very highly ported on by the officers last year. He had no increase last year, and he gets Â£20 increase this year. The increase is divided over two years. If my honourable friend takes into account the saving have made, and notices that this is a gradual moving up of officers according-to the ciples laid down in the Public Service Act, I think he will see that the recognition no more than the good work done by officers deserves. I must say I felt under an obligation to them, inasmuch as I - not only made this reduction, but, as honourable friend is aware, I have placed the services of the commission, of which he tion. is chairman, an officer whose work has to be divided amongst all the other officers, while he is saving the cost of a secretary to that body. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melspecially bourne) - I think it would a pity to strike out this item, in view of the promise which has been given by the Acting Prime Minisat all. ter.",43
287,Mr SOLMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I was in favour of striking out the item; but after the statement of the Acting Prime Minister, I "" do not think that we should be justified in taking that course. I deeply regret the vious vote which was taken 45 v z he have number of those who voted against the proposal to reduce the item of Â£ 6 0 0 cannot conscientiously, I think, refuse to accept the offer made by the Government.",43
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I appeal to the honourable member for Coolgardie to withdraw his motion, because it is quite clear from what has been said that the Government do not intend to appoint this clerk to the higher position. Supposing he was the fittest man who could be found, if the Government will not appoint him to the position, there is an end to the matter. If we refuse to vote this salary he will have to go about his business, I presume, until some work can be found for him to do. We ought not to deal in that way with an officer who has been brought over from a State service. Since the Government have Thirty promised to transfer him to another position whenever an opportunity arises, the least we can do is to continue his salary until",43
289,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Macquarie) This officer was transferred from New South ever Wales, and he was specially selected by reLord Hopetoun on account of his exceptional ability to fill the position. I am in a formed on very good authority that he is an excellent officer. It would be a great pity if an injury were done to an officer who has we served the State of New South Wales and also the Commonwealth in such an excepprintional manner as has been stated. I hope that he will suffer no injustice as he might is do if this motion were carried. I suggest the that he might be considered in connection with the appointment of secretary if he is have competent to discharge the duties; but my until that question is settled, he should at be allowed to remain in his present posi",43
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Parramatta) The statement made by the honourable member for Macquarie, if correct, puts a new aspect on this matter. If Lord Hopetoun selected this officer to come over to Melbourne, the question arises whether he was in the service of New South Wales",43
291,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I believe that Lord Hopetoun made a request for his services.,43
292,Sir GEORGE TURNER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,He filled a similar preposition j n the office of the Governor of ; but a very large New South Wales.,43
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"What had Lord Hopetoun to do with sending this officer over to Melbourne? I hope that he did not go about the departments for officers to come over here, and do this kind of work. It would have been in f r a dig. on his part to make a request for any officer, and if I thought for a moment that he did so, I should have a very different impression of him from what I have. We might leave the salary of this officer alone until something else can be found for him to do.",44
294,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I am inclined to think that the fears expressed by the honourable member for Macquarie of any injustice being done to this officer are purely groundless. That is not my intention, nor will it be the effect of my motion if it is carried. It is quite optional with the Government to promote the officer to the position of secretary. After the high testimonials which have been given by Lord Hopetoun, the Acting Prime Minister and other honourable members, I feel certain that the officer, whom I do not know, must be eminently qualified for the post. When the Government can reduce the cost of this department by the substantial sum of Â£ 3 5 0 a year, they have no shadow of excuse for not appointing him. Supposing that the item were omitted theremustbe other positions to which he could be transferred almost immediately. Neither on one ground nor on the other is there any excuse for allowing the item to remain. Honourable members who are continually talking about the necessity for economy will expose themselves to a charge of inconsistency if they vote against my amendment, which is intended to effect a saving of expenditure, and at the same time to secure promotion for a deserving officer. Mr R. EDAVARDS (Oxley) - I have no personal knowledge of the gentleman whose salary is under discussion. The only question in my mind is whether there is work sufficient to justify us in paying this officer a salary of Â£ 3 25 per annum. If the Acting Prime Minister is prepared to assure lis that it is absolutely necessary that we should have a clerk in the office, I shall support the item.",44
295,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"It is necessary to have clerk in the office, but I have promised to replace the present occupant of the position, as soon as he can be transferred, with a clerk at about Â£ 1 0 0 per annum. Amendment negatived. Amendment (by Mr MCDONALD) proposed - That the item, ""Travelling expenses oÂ£.honorary Ministers, being for actual expenses incurred, Â£100"" be omitted.",44
296,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Rathe r than have a debate upon this item of Â£100, I prefer to withdraw it . I am sorry that the work of honorary Ministers is not better appreciated.",44
297,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I object to the withdrawal of the item. I think it is only fair that Ministers who perform public services should be recouped any expense which they may incur, and it is most improper . to suggest that they should pay out of their own pockets money spent in the discharge of their Ministerial duties. I have consistently supported every movement in the direction of economy, but I think we should be trifling with the honour of the House if we did not insist upon the retention of this item in the Estimates.",44
298,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Macquarie) I hope the honourable member for Kennedy will withdraw his amendment. I understand that if an honorary Minister does not attend a particular function on behalf of the Government, a salaried member of the Government will be called upon to discharge this duty, and will be entitled to have his expenses defrayed. Therefore it is not likely that any saving will be effected by the omission of this item. The Vice-President of the ExecutiveCouncil has performed a great deal of useful work for the Government, and I understand that he is not being paid any salary.",44
299,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Hear , hear.",44
300,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I believe, fur- ' ther, that he did not receive one penny of the Â£ 5 5 which was spent last year in defraying the expenses of honorary Ministers. Mr MCDO if ALD (Kennedy) - The expenses of honorary Ministers should be paid by the members of the Government. In the first place, there was no need to appoint any honorary Ministers. If the number of Ministers first provided for was not sufficient, it was the duty of the Government a to ask for more. One of the honorary Ministers was appointed to ' suit the convenience of the Government, and the other office was created in order to give Tasmania representation in the Cabinet. When we agreed that Ministers should be allowed to draw their allowance of Â£ 4 0 0 a year as members, in addition to their Ministerial salary, I thought that would be the end of the expense connected with the Ministerial offices. I believe that Ministers are entitled to their, allowances, but I do not think that we should be asked to make payments to the honorary Ministers whom they have appointed to help them in their work. This is a matter of principle and not of amount. If we allow this item to pass we shall probably find expenses under one head and another so far increased that we shall be called upon to vote the equivalent of full salaries for the honorary Ministers. I shall press my amendment. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. (Parramatta) - No doubt the Government have acted in perfect honesty in submitting this item for our approval. I should not object to the honorary Ministers being recouped their expenses out of the departmental votes, but I object to affirm the .principle involved in the appointment of honorary Ministers. Sir GEORG E TURNER - There is no departmental vote out of which these expenses could be legally paid. The departmental votes are available only for the payment of travelling expenses incurred in connection with the business of the respective departments.",44
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Are there' not votes out of which Ministers can recoup themselves their travelling expenses t Sir GEORGE TURNER. - Yes, when they are engaged in carrying out the work of their respective departments.",45
302,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"There should be no difficulty in arranging to refund to the honorary Ministers any expenses which they may incur when they are engaged on public business.

303,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D, The Minister should give some information about this expenditure. Twenty thousand pounds is a heavy subsidy for the Commonwealth to have to pay year after year. It seems to me that the Ministry would do - well to intimate to the officer in charge of New Guinea that it is desirable to raise a little more revenue from customs duties.,45
304,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Fro m customs duties ?,45
305,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I believe in the imposition of customs duties to meet the expenses of Government, but not to keep alive rickety - industries at Castlemaine or elsewhere.",45
306,Sir GEORGE TURNER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The increase in customs receipts from New Guinea this year is estimated at Â£3,000.",45
307,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The annual report does not show how the money is to be raised. The revenue collected in the Possession during the year totalled Â£15,114, which is Â£1,279 in excessof that of any preceding year, whereas the customs dues totalled Â£11,389 10s. I d . , an increase of Â£567 12s. over the amount collected in 1899-1900. I do not find in the report any statement of the revenue derived from the various articles imported, 26 some fifteen lines of which are specifically enumerated, the value of the rest, classified 14 as "" other articles,"" being put down at Â£30,219.",45
308,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,What is the total value of 12 the imports t,45
309,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Â£71,118 .",46
310,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Then the Customs revenue is about 15 pei cent, of that amount. 1",46
311,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The honourable and learned member refused to agree to duties of 15 per cent, when the Tariff was under discussion in this Chamber.",46
312,Mr MCCAY,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Not to revenue duties of 15 per cent.,46
313,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The Administrator in his report makes a very fair suggestion. In recommending that the arrangement in regard to the subsidy be fixed for a definite period, he writesIb is scarcely necessiiiy for me to point out the advantage of this to both sides, the Federal Government knowing what they will have to provide in their Estimates, and the Administration of the Possession knowing the limit of the annual contribution to their revenue. At the same time. I think that the present subsidy is a very heavy one, and that some arrangement might be made by which the revenue of the Possession would be increased. There is another small matter to which I would like to refer, and that is that the bulky report of the Administrator which has been placed in our hands bears upon it the imprint of the Government Printingoffice, Brisbane, 1902, while the document is said to be "" Prinbed for the Commonwealbh of Australia."" Did the Commonwealth authorize the printing of it ?",46
314,Sir GEORGE TURNER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Not specifically. The Brisbane office has been doing work of this kind for the Commonwealth; but, no doubt, expenses can be cut down.",46

I understand that the steamer is available, not merely for the New Guinea service, but also for the service of some of the adjacent islands.",46

322,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Can it be said that the Imperial Government has given up all control of New Guinea, when at any time there may be difficulty about the adjustment of the boundaries between the British and German possessions 1 I think that we should have some explanation with regard to all these matters.",46
323,Mr GB EDWARDS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I wish to know from the Attorney General whether federal legislation will not be necessary to provide for the administration of New Guinea by the Commonwealth. I am very pleased to notice that the sales of land there have been restricted. It seems to me that we should do well to prevent the sale of land bhere albogebher, until we know better how the territory should be administered.. I would rather see the amount now derived from land sales added to the annual subsidy than permit land speculation there.",46
324,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The questions bo which the. honourable member for Coolgardie has called abbenbion were considered in connection with the annual Estimates for New Guinea. The chief source of increased Customs revenue there is a levy made upon the sticks of tobacco which are the current coin of the country, labour being paid for and goods purchased by them. It did not seem possible to materially increase the Customs receipts in any other way, because, as there are very few whites in the country, the consumption of dutiable articles is very small. The honourable member for South Sydney is right in assuming that the alienation'of land, the increase of customs duties, and the relations between the Possession and the Commonwealth will have to be dealt with in the measure which the Government hope to prepare during the recess for presentation to Parliamenb nexb session. Ab the present time we are merely continuing the existing methods of administration, and making what economies we can. There has practically been no demand for land in New Guinea, except in such areas as have had to' be refused.",46

327,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No ; but a larger amount has to be provided for this year, because last year's vote was only for a portion of the year. - Mr ELIAS SOLOMON - I understand that there has been some correspondence in regard to the action of Messrs. Philp and Co., who, it is said, are not complying with the condition.",47
328,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,1I have not seen it .,47
329,Mr ELIAS SOLOMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"1 think that the Minister should explain the reason for this subsidy, and why an additional subsidy of Â£2,000 has been granted for the extension of the services.",47
330,Mr SAWERS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I cannot understand why the vote for a mail service to Pacific Islands should be included in the estimates for the Department of External Affairs. All other mail services are provided for in the estimates for the Postmaster General's department. It seems to me that we should have an explanation of the reason why the Commonwealth is to pay Â£6,000 a year for a small mail service to the South Sea Islands. In addition to the sum which was previously paid by the New South Wales Government, there is provision made for a subsidy of Â£2,000.",47
331,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The additional amount was passed last year for the extra service.,47
332,Mr SAWERS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"What I desire to know is whether this expenditure is justified as relating to a mail service or whether it is to be regarded simply as a bonus given to Sydney merchants to assist them in distributing their goods in the South Sea Islands, and in that way to make a profit. These men protest against everything else in the way of bonuses, but it seems that they ask the Commonwealth to assist them in their business undertakings. If free-trade is a correct principle they ought to carry on their business upon commercial lines. If had an opportunity of testing the matter, I should decline to vote one shilling out of the Commonwealth funds to enable Sydney merchants to run ships to the islands for their own profit. Can this expenditure of Â£6,000 per annum for the conveyance of a small mail service- a mere handful of letters-to the islands be justified ?",47
333,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Has the honourable member read the reports ?,47
334,Mr SAWERS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,No .,47
335,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"He should do so,' for they put a different aspect on the matter. They show that a much bigger question is involved.",47
336,Mr SAWERS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I believe this is a subsidy granted for the assistance of certain companies.,47
337,Mr MCDONALD,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Burns , Philp, and Company.",47
338,Mr SAWERS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I am not going to mention names. I do not care who the merchants are. I should like the Minister to justify this expenditure by showing the extent of the mail service.,47
339,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I thought that the honourable member would have recalled sufficient of the discussion which took place upon this proposal last year to have rendered an explanation unnecessary The. payment of this subsidy was authorized by Parliament before it was made by the Government. The contract was not entered into upon the ground that the money would be well spent for the mere carriage.of letters once a month between Australia and the various groups of islands named, nor was it a proposal to give, any bonus to the merchants of Australia. Although there is a certain export from Australia to these islands, an equal trade, so - far as I am aware, is the return traffic in the shape of produce. The object which we had to serve was neither to facilitate the carriage of produce or the conveyance of mails, although both those considerations certainly had some weight with us in arriving at a determination. Our object was to insure a sufficient settlement in that no-man's land-the New Hebrides, in reference to which there is a joint agreement between Great Britain and France that neither power shall take over control. In the existing circumstances, the settlement of the islands was rapidly becoming wholly Erench. English settlers were being starved out, but an opportunity was afforded by this means of encouraging the settlement of Australians.",47
340,Mr SAWERS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That is another matter. The subsidy of Â£3,600 has been going on for years.",48
341,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"AV e took that over. All that we are called upon to justify is the new departure made to encourage Australian settlement in the New Hebrides. Our efforts have been successful. Some 50 or 60 fresh settlers are already there, and are preparing to take over their families, while others are following. It is expected that this will be the beginning of a connection with these various groups of islands-which , with the exception of the New Hebrides, are all under the British flag - that hereafter will be of considerable importance to the Commonwealth. AVe are spending this money, not for immediate, but for future results. There should be a reasonable hope that in the future these services may be made self-supporting. AVe cannot expect such a result for some years to come j but this subsidy, which the House in all the circumstances thought it judicious to authorize, is becoming of assistance in developing the trade both to and from the islands.",48
342,Mr SAWERS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Why call it a service ? "" Mr DEAKIN - It is because of mixed motives which led to this service being authorized that it is not thought to debit. the Post-office with what really the cost of action taken by the House with regard to its future Pacific policy.",48
343,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," Since this matter was last before the committee, I have given it some consideration, and am rather of the opinion that we made mistake in agreeing to it . As many honorto Australia. able members know we find great difficulty in obtaining the expenditure of a Â£100 or so for the development of our internal resources, and yet we seem to Caledonia. undertake these external responsibilities in the free and easy manner which is involved in the presentation and passage of these Estimates through the committee. From what I can glean, I believe that there likely to be complications with one other nation in regard to this New Hebrides business - A considerable - stir is beingafter made about the incursion of settlers from Australia, but I think it would be a good thing if the fever-stricken islands were confined to French settlers'. I do not know what degree of responsibility the Government are accepting as to the land which the settlers are taking up. I understand that there was some offer of land by Burns, Philp, and Co.",48
344,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"They offered it to the settlers, not to the Government.",48
345,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,It was stated at the time that the land was being offered to the Government for the use of any settlers who might care to take advantage of it . In any case it seems to me that we should pursue a wiser course if we refrained from prosecuting this enterprise beyond the Commonwealth.,48
346,Mr THOMSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," As one who knows perhaps as much about this inatter as does any honourable member, I support the Government proposal. I do so for what I believe are the very best of reasons. I have no personal interest whatever in the New Hebrides. I have only that interest which all Australia, if it looks rightly at the matter, has in the nearer islands of the Pacific.",48
347,Mr SAWERS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Is this not a bonus 1,48
348,Mr THOMSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am not speaking of what it is. I shall explain the whole position to the committee. Some honormail able members may be able to recollect the occasion upon which French marines the were landed on the New Hebrides. Who objected to that 1. Who secured the withfair drawal of the marines 1 The people of is Australia^-principall y the people of Victoria. And for what reason ? Because they recognised the fatal carelessness which had allowed New Caledonia, which was in the commission of the first Governor I of New Zealand, to pass into the handsa of a foreign power with threatened dangers",48
349,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"There is a difference paltry between New Caledonia and the New Hebrides, and it is all in favour of New",48
350,Mr THOMSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That may be; but it depends upon whether the honourable member is referring to the mining or agricultural wealth of those islands. In is regard to agricultural wealth, the New Hebrides are far better than New Caledonia. But that is not the point. Some little time the landing of French marines on those islands had been successfully resisted, representations were made to the people of this country, who were interested in the preservation of the independence of the islands, that whilst Australia had objected to the French annexation, it was doingnothing to retain the trade which at one time belonged wholly to Australia. It was pointed out that it was doing nothing to maintain British settlement in the New Hebrides ; that the French had subsidized the French New Hebrides Company to enter into trading enterprises there, to acquire land and to obtain settlement, and that it was seeking a preponderating influence which would settle the destiny of those islands. Those who had taken part in the opposition to the landing of the French marines were asked- "" Will you do nothing to support British settlement against this competition on the part of the French Government."" result of that appeal was that a large number of people here invested small sums in an Australian New Hebrides Company. They were told that the company was not intended to make a profit; that it was merely to retain British, interests in the islands, and they knew that probably the money which they put into the company would be lost. For some twelve years or more they entered into this struggle with the French New Hebrides Company, the French company being backed up by the secret funds of the French Government. In spite of that opposition, in spite of the immense sums which were spent by the French Government, they managed not only to maintain but to increase British trade with the islands, and also to increase to some small extent British settlement there. After it had lost Â£20,000 in this way the company found that it could continue no longer to induce private individuals in the community to provide funds to carry on the contest, and a proposition was made to Burns, Philp, and Co v some of whose steamers had been chartered - previously to carry on the trade.",48
351,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Was that after the reconstruction of the company ?,49
352,Mr THOMSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The company was reconstructed, but I am referring to a period subsequent to the loss of the additional capital that was obtained. There had been latterly a subsidy granted by the Victorian and New South Wales Governments jointly.",49
353,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That subsidy was increased about three years ago.,49
354,Mr THOMSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Yes ; I can say from my own knowledge that even with that subsidy a loss was suffered every year in the effort to maintain British influence in the ' group. The loss continued to such an extent that it was found impossible to go on, and an effort had to be made to get some one else to take up the service. Burns, Philp, and Co. took it up, and they also suffered a loss. I feel justified in saying that, although settlement and trade are increasing, no profit has resulted from their efforts, notwithstanding that they obtain a subsidy. I admit that as soon as the service can rest on its own bottom the subsidy should be withdrawn. But I assert that in the national interest it is very undesirable that we should allow these islands The to pass over to the domination of France, and to become a greater menace than is New Caledonia to Australia. There is a better harbour in the New Hebrides than is to be found in New Caledonia, and that is one reason why the French would like to get possession of the islands, and secure a naval base which would become a source of danger to us in the future.",49
355,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,.Does the honourable senator say that the results may be mo're serious in the New Hebrides than in New Caledonia t,49
356,Mr THOMSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I say that the naval menace would be more serious if the French had predominance in both places. Ships coming from Noumea through the reef-opening could be blocked by one or two men-ofwar, and the offensive armaments which could be used against the British fleet in Sandwich harbour of the New Hebrides could not be used at New Caledonia. We are entering upon our career as a United Australia, and one of our principal objects is to see that these islands shall not become the play-ground of foreign powers to a larger extent than at present, and thus allowed to introduce us to the troubles of European politics. I am satisfied that this expendinot ture, which, I hope, owing to increased trade, will be a decreasing one, is not only desirable, but will save a great deal of expense in the future. As to the land, it had to be acquired by the company, because the French were urging land ownership as a reason for French annexation. And I can tellhonorable members the precautions that were taken in connection with the acquisition of the land. Part of it had long been acknowledged to be in the possession of one or two Sydney firms, who had traded with the islands for many years before there were any French or English there. The other part was acquired from the natives, but never without the presence of the missionaries and others who could speak the. native language, and who could testify that it was freely offered and disposed of by the right owners. No attempt has ever been ma'de to make money out of the land ; and the present oner to the Federal Government is that a merely nominal charge shall be made. Naturally a commercial firm like Burns, Philp, and Co. look for some return from enlarging trade, but what has been desired all alongis settlement by the British people, not, perhaps, in large numbers, but sufficiently large to promote British interests, and to resist the claim daily made in Paris that the French are predominant in landholding, settlement, and trade. There can be no doubt the French trade' and French interests would become much larger if the subsidy were withdrawn. I never had, and have not now, any pecuniary interest in these islands, except as one of the contributors to what was merely a donation towards the maintenance of the British connection. The only interests I have are the interests of Australia.",49
357,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"- I have read the correspondence between Burns, Philp and Co. and the Prime Minister, and I am satisfied that, it was a statesmanlike act to subsidize the steam-ships. I should like to know from the Treasurer why Â£3,600 appears in the Estimates as transferred expenditure, while Â£2,400 appears as other expenditure.",50
358,Sir GEOKGE TURNEB,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Because Â£3,600 is the old liability, and Â£2,40 0 is the new expenditure incurred by the Commonwealth.",50
359,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"If the Commonwealth is paying so large a sum as Â£2,400, or nearly one-half of the whole subsidy, it is only right that other ports, besides that of Sydney, should receive some consideration.",50
360,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,But Sydney is the nearest port.,50
361,Mr CROUCH,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No . Brisbane is the nearest port; but as the whole of the Commonwealth is paying, I think occasional trips might be paid, not only to Melbourne, but also to Adelaide and Brisbane, where there may be a desire to open up trade with the New Hebrides, and so save the cost of transhipment at Sydney. Vote agreed to. Division 15 (Miscellaneous), Â£500.",50
362,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I should like to know whether the Government regard the recent investigation into the Immigration of Italians into Western Australia as closed. Considerable dissatisfaction is felt with the imperfect nature of the inquiry which was made by the magistrate appointed ""for the purpose. It is rather singular that the particular mining district to which the Italians have gone in the largest numbers was carefully avoided, as it would appear, by the gentleman who made the investigation. - Mr DEAKIN - We have since received returns from police officers and others in regard to that district, and I think the report is now complete.",50
363,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am aware that reports have been furnished, but still it is a pity that the magistrate did not visit that district. I also regret that greater powers were not conferred on the magistrate in the direction of compelling witnesses to attend in order to give evidence on oath. The i nquiry has not been as thorough as it might have been, and I should like to know whether the Government consider it closed.",50
364,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The inquiry is not closed against the receipt of any further information, and the intention is to use the report as the basis for the consideration of the question, in any of its phases, whenever it may arise. Under the operation of the Immigration Restriction Act we are keeping a careful catalogue of all entrances into all parts of the Commonwealth, checking and comparing them, and endeavouring to trace them when we discover any remarkable circumstances, such as the regular appearance of a number of immigrants of any particular nationality. It does not follow that because the report has been presented that the inquiry is closed; on the contrary, the"" report is only intended to throw light on the 'Continuous investigation which we now make into all the arrivals into the Commonwealth.",50
365,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," If the Government intend to press this investigation any further in Western Australia, I hope they will find a different commissioner than Mr Roe. First of all, this gentleman is said to have been extremely reluctant to leave Perth, and wanted all the witnesses to attend on him in that city. As the honourable member for Perth has pointed out, he absolutely neglected to visit the Murchison district, where there are, I suppose, ten Italians in the mines for one Italian working at Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie. That is a place where, if anywhere, he could have obtained direct evidence connecting the presence of these men with some contract or stipulation made outside the Commonwealth. By this time the head of the Government knows that the appointment of Mr Roe was not , one which would have been recommended by the representatives of ""Western Australia. An inquiry conducted as this has been cannot be effective. In order to obtain the evidence required it is necessary to have a man who is more of a detective than a police magistrate, because it is impossible to induce persons to come into open court and admit that the contracts exist. . In such a case the proof must be indirect instead of direct.",50
366,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"According to the report, contract has been admitted in at least one instance.",51
367,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I was not aware of that. I see that the sum of Â£ 5 0 0 is provided for the expenses of these investigations. The other day, in answer to a question, I was told that the cost of the reports of Mr. Justice Dashwood and Mr Warton into the pearl-fishing industry did not exceed Â£200. Does the Acting Prime Minister tell us that Â£ 3 0 0 more was expended by Mr Roe in his investigation in Western Australia ?",51
368,Mr DEAKI N,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"No ; nothing like it . I do not like to trust my memory, but I believe that the cost of the inquiiy by Mr. Roe is not more than Â£ 5 0 .",51
369,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Then what is the object of placing this sum of Â£50 0 on the Estimates ?,51
370,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,We have to cover the cost - of printing the report and other expenses.,51
371,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Do I understand that the total cost of Mr Justice Dashwood's report was only Â£155, including shorthand writing and other contingencies ?",51
372,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That is all that was paid to Mr Justice Dashwood for everything.,51
373,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Did that also pay for Mr Justice Dashwood's conveyance to Thursday Island ?,51
374,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Speakin g from memory, I think it did.",51
375,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Then I think the work was done at a remarkably cheap rate.,51
376,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The cost was very reasonable in both cases.,51
377,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"But there is no reason why Mr Warton's report should cost so much, since he was on the spot.",51
378,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"He had travelling expenses, and he had to get assistance for taking down the evidence. The honourable member may see the items if he wishes.",51
379,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,But there is no evidence in Mr Warton's report.,51
380,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Mr Warton took a certain amount of evidence.,51
381,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"But Mr Warton, as a Police Magistrate, was"" surely capable of taking down the evidence.",51
382,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am only speaking from memory, and the cost may not have been so much.",51
383,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I understand that the House will not have an opportunity this session to discuss the reports on the pearlAshing industry.,51
384,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,There may be an opportunity when we aie waiting for the return of the Appropriation Bill from another place.,51
385,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Possibl y I ought not to inquire whether the Government intend to act on the recommendations - iD these reports.,51
386,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The Government have not had time to consider the question yet.,51
387,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"In the meantime, is it not desirable that we should have a little more information about the pearl-shelling question?",51
388,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The Government are still collecting information, and within the last fortnight I have had an opportunity of seeing three persons who have a knowledge of the industry.",51
389,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"In my opinion, the public would have much more confidence in an inquiry made by a select committee of this House, than in an inquiry by persons who may or may not be indirectly interested in the maintenance of the industry.",51
390,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Tw o of the gentlemen whom I saw are engaged in the industry, and the other is interested on the opposite side.",51
391,Mr MAHON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That is just the trouble; it is very difficult to arrive at the truth when one side is extreme against the industry, and the other side is interested in its maintenance. Before we pass regulations, which may in One case mean the extinction of the whole township of Broome, we ought to. be perfectly certain of our course. I have no information at first band, but from what I have heard, the condition of affairs at Thursday Island and the condition of affairs at Broome are not on all fours. The regulations which might work smoothly in one case might work harshly in the other. That is a reason the Government might be well advised to have an investigation made of this matter by members of Parliament during the recess.",51
392,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I think that the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie is a good one, because it must be apparent to any one who has looked into the report of Judge Dashwood, that it is not worth the paper on which it is written. I trust that the - Government will hesitate, before departing from the policy already declared by the Commonwealth, in consequence of anything that appears in a report of that character. I do not wish at this stage to go into the matter in detail, but I will point to one thing in that report which condemns it out of hand. Judge Dashwood says in one paragraph that he has not been able to get any idea of the profits of the pearl-shelling industry-that if he had the account sales in respect of the shell that was sold he might be able to arrive at the profits, but that from the people whom he examined-thos e interested in the industry-h e could get no particulars as to the profits they made. Yet a few paragraphs lower down he states that it is impossible to carry on the industry profitably and employ white ciews. How was he able to form an idea as to whether the industry could be carried ou by white men unless he knew what the profits were? Previously he had said that he. had no idea as to the profits, and could get no particulars in regard to them. Yet he presumes to express an (opinion as to the possibility of employing white labour profitably. The whole report is vitiated, it seems to me, by an admission of that sort. I trust, therefore, that the Government will take some other steps before they abrogate the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act as applied either to Broome or Thursday Island.",52
393,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"There is no intention on the part of the Government to abrogate the provisions of the Immigration Restriction A ct in any way. All thati t is intended to do, as I have explained to honourable members before, is to endeavour to preserve the existing situation until the Government can lay before the House some proposals in regard to it . In the meantime we allow ships to replace those of their crews that are going away and new luggers to be manned, but we do not permit the settlement of any class of coloured labour in Australia.",52
394,Mr R EDWARDS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I wish to ask a question with regard to the item of Â£ 5 0 0 for the ""expenses of investigationi n respect to the Immigration Restriction . Act."" I notice in Division II , sub-division 2, that there are two sums of' Â£ 4 0 0 and Â£ 5 0 0 for a similar'purpose.",52
395,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,This sum is for the special investigation of Judge Dashwood and Mr. Warton.,52
396,Mr R EDWARDS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Does this sum cover the printing of the reports ?,52
397,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Ye s ; it will cover that.,52
398,Mr R EDWARDS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,And the allowances to both gentlemen ?,52
399,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Yes ; it will cover the whole thing. Vote agreed to. ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. Division 16 (Secretary's office)-Â£2,655 .",52
400,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," I m o v e That the item, ""Secretary and Parliamentary' Draftsman, Â£800,"" be reduced by Â£50. Honourable members will see from the schedule of Estimates laid before them that the sum of Â£ 5 0 , which last year was voted as an allowance to the parliamentary draftsman on account of extra duties discharged by him, is this year added to the permanent salary of that officer.",52
401,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The committee asked that that should be done last year.,52
402,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I for one objected to it. The allowance last year, as I under-' stand it, was given because this gentleman had been put to a great deal of trouble owing to the length of the session and the pressure of parliamentary drafting. In consequence of the large number of Bills that were introduced, it was said that he had had to do a great deal of extra work. I must say, however, that, judging from the expert opinions given by members of the Commonwealth Parliament qualified to express an opinion upon the drafting, it has not been such as to reflect any wonderful' credit upon the person intrusted with it .",52
403,Mr LE GROOM,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Yes ; on the whole 1 it has been very good.,52
404,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I have heard a considerable number of complaints by some honourable members as to the drafting. The right honourable member for East Sydney yesterday referred to the drafting of the Inter-State Commission Bill. This is part of the work for which the Secretary to the Attorney - General's department is responsible, though whether he did it himself or not I do not know. I do not for a moment say that he is incapable of good draftsmanship. I have rather reason to believe the contrary. But the best Act we have put through Parliament, so far as mere draftsmanship is concerned-and this has been pointed out by some very high authorities-is one with - which this officer had nothing whatever to do. I refer to the Customs Act. However, I do not express any particular opinion on that point. The point I take is that there is no possible justification for giving a higher salary to the Secretary to the Attorney-General's department any more than for increasing the salaries of the secretaries of the various other departments. The strength of the argument is all the other way. Allowing that there is required as Secretary to the Attorney-General's department a gentleman who has profes. sional experience, as well as other qualities, we must still remember that the number of individuals over whom he has to exercise control is small; and even when you add to that work the matter of parliamentary drafting, there is no reason for giving him a larger salary for it, because in many cases he gets some one else to do the actual work. There is, therefore, a wide distinction between the position of this officer and that of the Secretary to the department of Home Affairs, or that of Secretary to the depart- ment of Defence.  Defence Â£ 9 0 0 a year.",53
405,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That is because could not pay him less. He was. taken over with the transferred department, and the Minister for Defence told the House that he could not transfer this officer at salary than he was formerly receiving. in the case of the Secretary to the departthe ment of Home Affairs, we have an officer has to deal with an expenditure of about Â£170,000 a year, who has an enormous number of officers scattered throughout Australia, and has a large and growing department to control. Yet he has satisfied with a salary of Â£750 per annum. I do not wish for a moment to increase that salary, but I think the same amount is quite enough for an officer who has a very small department to control; involving a total expenditure of only some Â£2,600.",53
406,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Does the honourable member think this department can be measured by its expenditure 1,53
407,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I have just said that the department is not to be measured alone by that consideration, but that is one of the features which has to be remembered. We have to contrast the duties of this officer with those of the head of a department which has a number of sub-branches and an enormous number ofofficers over whom control has to be exercised.",53
408,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The honourable member forgets that the secretary to my department advises every other department of the States, and touches the whole of the other expenditure.",53
409,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I thought the Attorney General was supposed to do all that.,53
410,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,He is the Attorney General's chief officer.,53
411,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That is an argument for doing away with the office of the At torney-General altogether, and saving Â£2,000 a year.",53
412,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I said that this officer was the Attorney-General's chief officer.,53
413,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Are we to pay several other officers to do the work ? Admitting that the Secretary to the Attorney-General's department occupies a responsible position, I say, nevertheless, that his work is not so responsible and does not involve so much work, care, and anxious consideration as do the duties of the secretaries of some of the other departments.",53
414,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I take the liberty of differwe ing from the honourable member entirely.,53
415,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I suppose there is nothing like leather, and I can quite understand the magnifying effect of the glasses a lower through which the honourable and learned But gentleman looks at anything connected with law. But, in my opinion, judging not who only from the affairs of the Commonwealth, but from those of the other States as w e l l ; and comparing the Law department with the department of Home Affairs and the Defence department-and especially with to be the Customs department- I say that the duties of the permanent heads of those departments involve responsibilities which just if y their receiving at least as much, or even more, than the Secretary to the Attorney General.",53
416,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I do not find fault with the honourable member on account of his criticism, though he has quite misunderstood my interjection. But I do regret that his knowledge of the importance of this office has misled him into an entire misconception of the situation. First' of all, the Secretary to the Attorney-General is not a mere secretary of the department. secretary of the department, of course, it is quite fair to measure him by its expenditure and by the branches over which he has to preside. But this officer is chiefly, and practically, for the greater part of his time, the parliamentary draftsmen, the Crown Solicitor, and the assistant to the Attorney General in all the functions pertaining to his work.",54
417,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The parliamentary drafting work will not again be as heavy as it has been this session.,54
418,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That is his chief work, and. he receives for that practically the salary which is set down here. But because the department is so small it would be absurd at present to have a clerical staff in addition to the professional staff. At - present we have two professional men only, the chief of whom also discharges the duties of head of the department. But really the work which he does, and for which he is paid, is that of parliamentary draftsman and - drafter of opinions. In Victoria, the State pays its parliamentary draftsman Â£1,200 per annum, and does not think he is overpaid. You cannot have a man of standing in his profession engaged to undertake this work at a salary less than is here set down. I undertake to say that this amount compares favourably, so far as its smallness is concerned, with the salary paid by any State in the Union. The work this officer is doing here is done by more than one officer in New South Wales.",54
419,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The parliamentary draftsman gets Â£75 0 per annum there.,54
420,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"But this officer is not only our parliamentary draftsman. What honourable members are overlooking is the fact that in New South Wales and elsewhere there is a salary for a Parliamentary Draftsman, and another salary of Â£1,000 a year for a Crown Solicitor,while this officer is our Parliamentary Draftsman and Crown Solicitor. We in the Commonwealth, with this professional - staff of two men, and counting myself three, are doing work which in the States is divided between several sub-departments.",54
421,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"And we are paying the Crown Solicitor in New South Wales at the rate of Â£1,000 a year in fees.",54
422,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,No . We have as yet paid only Â£ 1 6 7 .,54
423,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I saw an official stateAs ment to the effect that he was being paid at the rate of Â£1,000 a year.",54
424,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That is an estimate made in the New South Wales office, because there they do for us all the work of an ordinary solicitor's office for Sydney and for the State of New South Wales, and we pay them in respect of that. But, happily, we have been, so far, fortunate that in nearly every case we have conducted we have obtained costs.",54
425,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Because actions could not be brought against the Commonwealth.,54
426,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am speaking of cases in which we have prosecuted, and we have been so successful in obtaining costs and damages, that, as a matter of fact, even if we did spend the amount stated, we should have the great bulk of it returned. This officer is doing work which in the States is done by several officers, and he is working under circumstances under which no State officer has ever had to work. I can appeal, not only to members of the profession, but' to any one who has had experience of a Crown Law office to admit, that at the commencement of this Commonwealth, we have had entirely novel work, the determination of the difficulties consequent upon the introduction of this entirely new Constitution and the imposition of this system upon six other systems, the consideration of laws of each of the States under which we are still working in. some of the departments, and the various other questions arising out of the administration of all these laws have been submitted to us to deal with. I can ' say without reflection upon any professional man in the service of the States that there is not one who has had the burden of the responsibility we have had to share during the last two years. We must have it until the legal position of the Commonwealth is settled, and at the present time it is far from being settled.",54
427,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The officer is well paid at Â£750.,55
428,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Not asaprofessional man.,55
429,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,What professional standing had he a little time ago ?,55
430,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,H is professional standing in New South Wales was excellent.,55
431,Mr WILKS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,We never heard of him in the courts.,55
432,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I am sorry to hear that the honourable member has had so little acquaintance with either legal literature or practice in New South Wales.,55
433,Mr WILKS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"We knew that he was connected with the federal movement, and that is all.",55
434,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"The honourable member knows this gentleman's standard work upon the subject, which is on the table of this House, and he should know that members of the Federal Convention admitted themselves under great obligations to him for his unwearied researches and, great knowledge of the subject.",55
435,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,A r e we to pay that now ? .,55
436,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"This vote is proposed, not because of any special work done in a special year, but because I venture to think, as every one will who is at all familiar with the nature of the work, that Â£800 a year is a small amount to pay a man who undertakes the responsibilities necessarily devolving upon the Law department of the Commonwealth. If we are to measure a salary by the work done, the salary here proposed is considerably under instead of over the mark. If honourable members are of opinion that the Commonwealth should take advantage of the experience and knowledge of its employees, and should not remunerate them for it, they will consent to cut down this salary. I venture to say that no officer in the service works longer hours. He has not only to attend during the usual office hours, but he must be in attendance in this House when measures are before us in connection with which his presence may be required. In addition to this, we are associated in the preparation of the opinions upon which every other department of the Commonwealth is now acting in every one of its branches.",55
437,Mr LE GROOM,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,He must work beyond his office hours.,55
438,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"He does, habitually. Honourable members will find Mr Garran and myself at the office at half-past five or six o'clock on many evenings for an hour to an hour and a half after everybody else has left the building, not from choice, but because of the work which has to be done. Any one who considers the importance, as well as its quantity, will agree that this is not an over-payment. I am at a disadvantage in appealing to honourable members who have not themselves. been engaged in this responsible task of advising every department of the Commonwealth since every department of the Commonwealth continues to appeal to us upon all the questions relating to the Constitution.",55
439,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,That is what he is there for.,55
440,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"Exactly ; but when the honourable member speaks of the work, my regret is that I cannot oblige him by some penal requirement to spend a week there in order that he might be able to estimate its importance.",55
441,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,I am making a comfor parison with the work done by the heads of other departments.,55
442,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am willing to compare the work done by Mr Garran, either as to its importance or to the length of time which its performance occupies, with the work done by the head of any other department. As an advocate of economy, I am not an advocate of high salaries; but I venture to say that a salary of Â£ 8 0 0 a year for the work performed by the permanent legal officer of the Commonwealth is much below the value set upon such work in any of the States, or anywhere else.",55
443,Mr SALMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," Before a vote is taken upon this question I think it is right that honourable members should realise exactly what this officer has to do. The honourable member for Bland, I am sure, recognises that an officer should be paid not according to the size or importance of the department with which he is connected, but strictly according to the work which he has to perform. The Attorney-General has pointed out that in Victoria there is a parliamentary draftsman who is paid at the rate of Â£1,200 a year.",55
444,Mr FOWLER,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,They are rather luxurious in Victoria; we cannot follow that example.,55
445,Mr SALMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I am not asking honourable members to follow that example, but I say that when a State finds it necessary to pay a professional man such a salary for doing only one part of the work which is undertaken by this officer, the circumstance is worthy of attention. I know something of the two-fold duties which this officer has to perform.",55
446,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Does the honourable member know as much of the work which the under-secretaries of other departments have to perform ?,56
447,Mr SALMON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"I know a good deal of it, and J believe that the majority of them are overpaid. I am prepared when the time comes to take action in regard to them, because I desire to see salaries placed upon something like a basis which we can afford. But that basis must have a strict relation to the work performed, and in my opinion the work performed by this officer is of a twofold character, and is well worthy of the salary which he is paid.",56
448,Mr WILKS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D," Honourable members who have had any experience in dealing with Estimates must be aware that each Minister holds the genius of Australia in the person of his under-secretary. This apparently applies in dealing with the Commonwealth Estimates as it has applied in connection with Estimates we have dealt with in the past in the State Parliaments. We know that every Minister protests that his under-secretary is the ablest man who can be got, that he is underpaid, and that he is making a sacrifice for his country. If I desired an additional reason for voting for the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland, I should find it in the great length to which the Attorney-General felt himself obliged to go in defending this officer. The' honourable gentleman introduced the personal question, which I object to at any time in discussing Estimates. This officer was last year paid at the rate of Â£ 7 5 0 per annum, and was given an allowance of Â£ 5 0 for extra duties. Surely those duties have not still to be performed.",56
449,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,Ye s ; they go on continuously. They include his attendance upon Parliament. I explained that last year.,56
450,Mr WILKS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"If we look to the near future, Parliament will be in recess, and this hard-worked officer wil l be relieved of his attendance upon Parliament for six or seven months. I think that a salary of Â£750 is quite enough for him. As to the comparison with State officers, it must be remembered that the States Governments have control of a greater number of departments, and the States' officers have more work to perform. Though this gentleman in New South Wales was well known in connection with the federal movement, the only office which he filled there was that of secretary to his father, and for that he received Â£ 2 50 per annum.",56
451,Mr DEAKIN,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,In addition to his private practice.,56
452,Mr WILKS,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,"That may be, but I agree with the honourable member for Bland that he will be well paid at a salary of Â£ 7 5 0 per annum.

455,Mr WATSON,TREATMENT OF RETURNE D,The Chairman has always taken the Chair previously in divisions.
