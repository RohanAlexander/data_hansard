3,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to table the report of the committee's inquiry into the and function of the Law Reform Commission of Australia. This report is the first comprebe hensive parliamentary review of the Law Reform Commission of Australia in its.almost 20 years of existence. There are two main aspects of the inquiry. Firstly, the committee examined the role and function of the Law Reform Commission as a separate and permanent law reform agency. Secondly, the committee reviewed the relacause tionships between the commission and other bodies with a law reform or related On the first point, we have concluded that the current role and functions of the Law Reform Commission are still appropriate. The independence and objectivity of the Law Reform Commission is founded in part in its statutory nature, and in part in the independlaw ent management and operations of the comchallenge mission. The commission is an important source of independent advice for the governour ment because of its capacity for accessing expert and representative opinion. The committee recognises that its national character is the distinguishing feature of the people. . Law Reform Commission. In the federal context, the application of complementary laws of each Australian jurisdiction is an important development. It would be appropriate for the Law Reform Commission to be to consider proposals for the complementarity of laws of the Commonwealth on the one hand and of the territories and the states on the other. The distinctive contribution that a permanent and separate law reform commission can Report make to the reform of the legal system lies in its capacity for detailed research, extensive and critical analysis. With regard to the second aspect of this inquiry, the committee examined the roles of some of the statutory and non-statutory bodies .which advise the federal government and considered the relationship each has with the commisThe committee found that there is value in providing a range and diversity of advice to the government, r-ognising the importance of current mechanisms in promoting cooperation between the Law Reform Commission and the other advisory bodies, and reducing role wasteful duplication in their operations. . The committee considers that there should greater. emphasis on promoting joint projects between the Law Reform Commission and state and territory law reform bodies. While the committee acknowledges that problems of a constitutional and jurisdictional nature may affect the selection of joint projects, the committee concludes that joint projects are both necessary and useful, bepart of the role of a national law reform commission is to assist in the; . systematic function. development of the law. The committee considers that the influence of the work of the Law Reform Commission over almost 20 years has been very significant. In the years since the Law Reform Commission was established, a great deal of reform work has been done, but the continues. The need for law reform has not diminished. The implementation of recommendations will lead to the correction of impediments to the smooth operations of the Law Reform Commission, and to. the enhancement of its value to the Australian Finally, I would like to acknowledge the work of the committee's secretariat. The committee secretary Judy Middlebrook, the inquiry secretary ,Claressa ,Surtees, and, the administrative officer Paula Baker all made significant contributions to .the inquiry and the report. On behalf of the committee; I thank them. Too often we as'members of parliament take for granted' our support structurecommittee secretariats, Hansard reporting and other facilities. It certainly assists in the paration of reports such as this to haveprofessional people in those positions. The parliament is indebted to them. I commend the report to the parliilment. , Mr CAPMAN' (Mitchell) (12.36 p.m.)There was general unanjmity among members of the Standing CoIllmittee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in its report on the Law Reform, Commission. The report was fascinating and far reaching. It was a reference from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who requested the committee to report in a fairly quick period. The committee was unable to keep to, the Attorney-General's timetable because there were lots of views on the role of the commission, its future and the purpose it has served over the past 20 years- , The report today, however, includes extensive evidence that was taken by the commit'tee. On balance, the committee decided that the only authority with a capacity to refer matters to the Law Reform Commission should be the Attorney-General. That was a unanimous view of the committee and one that was decided after the committee took evidence from the commission and other interested bodies. . ' , The clearer'management structure proposed by the committee is something that will iIllprove the efficiency and the timeliness of reports. One of the factors that hasdisiressed those interested in law reform has been the sometimes extensive delays in the preparation of significant reports. Sometimes this is not a matter that has been brought about by the commission being tardy but, rather, by the Attorney-Generar loading additional references onto the commission. The management structure, in my view, appeared to be deficient in a number of areas, and this report seeks to rectify that. Another sensible proposal is the recommendation that experienced practitioners be appointed as consultants and advisers to the Law Reform Commission. It is my view that a couple of reports-perhaps three-which attracted a lot of adverse attention from the community really were brought about because of the predominance, of an academlc type of prelegal involvement. The committee has rightly recommended that practitioners-legal people dealing with the law and the processes of law on the ground day to day...,-should play a greater role in the activities of the' commission. Some sta,tes have expressed the view that the UlW Refomi Commissiori has too readily involved itself in a wish to create uniformity and to overturn the interests of states in law reform. I have some sympathy with tha- view. It is my il,ltention to write an expression of concern, which will be'included in the report, indicating that the Attorney-General needs to adopt a great deal of care in making recommendations for the commission to research. There are so many areas needing law reform that the Australian Utw Reform Commission has plenty, of scope without straying into areas on the margin. We mentioned the need for complementary legislation. That is a new innovation for the commission to consider. Finally, I acknowledge the expression of concern byiny colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). He, wished to see the Australian Law Reform Commission renamed as the Commonwealth Law Reform Commission. He also expressed concern about the production of draft legislation. The production of draft legislation by the Utw Reform Commission is a lengthy process which takes a'lot of resources and time, but it is an interesting and useful tool to the commission in the progress of its work. I believe that the Attorney-General ought to always have the right to ask the commission to produce draft legislation and that, as a tool, the commission ought to have the freedom of using draft legislation. It, should 'not as a matter of practice develop the concept that draft legislation is the best way to have its will win the day. That is not what law reform is about,' in my view. It is about putting up interesting proposals which over a period of time mayor may not be adopted. (Time expired) Motion (by Mr Melham) proposed: That the House· take note of the report.",11

5,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginaf and Torres Strait Islander· Affairs, I present. the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, of the review of-the Auditor-General's reports No. 36 of 1992-93; No. 1 of 1993-94, volume 3, sections 1.13-39; and No. 27 of 1993-94, sections 16.19-24, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
6,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"The report I have just tabled is the review of several audit reports by the committee. Audit report No. 36 was a project audit on ATSIC's provision of community infrastructure. The committee is satisfied with the departmental responses to the audit office's recommendations. However, there are two areas of particular concern to the committee. These are in relation to the decision making processes of the regional councils and the additional responsibilities and _costs that might have been imposed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities as a result of the _changes in Commonwealth regulatory activities in relation to civil airstrips. Before moving to those issues, the committee commented that while it endorses the first key finding of the audit we believe that it does not go far enough. The audit office found: The respective responsibilities of Comf!1onwealth, State/Territory and local Governments tn the provision of community infrastructure to indigenous communities are unclear and ATSIC may be funding projects properly the responsibility of other levels of government. This finding is not new to the committee, which has been drawing attention to this problem for some time. The committee has gone further in previous reports and states that it is beyond doubt that in a great many instances ATSIC is funding services and projects which are the responsibility of state, territory or 10:cal governments. The committee is becoming increasingly impatient at the lack of action on many of the recommendations that have been made by the committee on this issue. The committee recommends that-the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) take urgent action through the Council of Australian Governments to. ensure that the diversion of mainReport stream funding away _from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander - people ceases and that he review the recommendations made by the committee on this matter over the last decade to ensure that they are being implemented. On the question of decision making by ATSIC regional councils, recommendation 5 of the audit report states: The ANAO recommends that ATSIC encourage Regional Councils to document reasons for funding. ATSIC strongly disagreed with this recommendation. It stated that regional councils are responsible for proposing _the allocation of funds and the administrative arm is responsible for the assessment of projects and docu.,. mentation and identifying need and does this as part of the current assessment process. There are two issues involved: whether reasons for regional council funding decisions should be documented in some way; _and whether a regional council's decisions are reviewable by another agency. Oil the second issue, the committee believes that the ANAO has erred in trying to impose bureaucratic accountability for political decisions that ATSIC regional councils have been elected to make. The committee believes that accountability should apply to the briefing and assessment prepared by ATSIC officers on projects which go before regional councils to assist them in making their decisions, and funds allocated to find disbursed by regional councils to ensure that they are spent in accordance with the' ATSIC Act and the priorities of the regional plan as determined by the regional council. The committee does not believe that the decisions of regional councils, provided they are lawful, should be accountable in the same way as· decisions made by public servants. Where approvals represent a significant departure from the priorities of the· regional plan, the committee recognises that community acceptance would be assisted if the reasons for the decision are publicly announced. Having regional cOllncils document their reasons for all funding decisions implies that decisions are subject to review by a superior agency. TIlis would be contrary to, the intent of the establishing legislation. The committee finds that, in making its recommendation, the ANAO did not take sufficient carein determining the intent of the ATSIC legislation. There are pitfalls for 'those who seek to assume a superior position from which to assess the 'correctness' of political deCisions. In the audit report, the ANAO makes itself the arbiter of the appropriateness of decisions made by the regional councils, by stating that: ... other needs, in the ANAO's view more pressing, were passed over. The committee believes that, given the legislated function of the regional council to make decisions, it is not appropriate for the ANAO to review the priorities determined by regional councils with respect to funding programs such as infrastructure projects. It is not a requirement imposed on federal cabinet, state cabinets or local government authorities to put in writing the reasons why some proposals were funded in the budget and not others. It is inappropriate to r:ecommend that the ATSIC . political structure should be required to do this when other levels of government do not conduct their political decision-making processes in this way. The committee recommends that ATSIC encou,rage regional councils to announce the reasons for funding decisions whenever possible.. The opposition members of the committee, while agreeing on the remainder of the report, have dissented on this last recommendation. Whilst I leave it to them to explain their position, their recommendation seeks to further curtail the independence of the regional councils. I, along with other government members, am disappointed by the decision to dissent as we went to great lengths within the committee to try to accommodate all views and gain a consensus on the issue., (TIme expired) Mr Gibson-As no other member is rising, may I continue with my remarkS, Mr Speaker? .",13
7,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,ThehoDourable. member may continue.,14
8,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES," The other major area of concern. to the. committee in Audit report No. 36 deals with the .additional responsibilities and costs being imposed on indigenous communities through recent changes in C()m1l10nwealth service and regulatory arrangements for civil airstrips. The audit report also pointed to a .lack of access and equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in relation to the remote air service subsidy scheme. . . The Royal' Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended that the operation of the aerodrome local ownership scheme be extended to Aboriginal community councils. Despite the Commonwealth claiming to support this recommendation, it has in fact . withdrawn. from· the ALOP. The department admitted that no consultations were held specifically with Aboriginal 'and Torres Strait Islander communities before the ALOP was dropped. The committee recommends that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) review his department's response to recommendation 78 of the royal commission given the Commonwealth's support. for this recommendation to ensure that effect is given to the thrust of the recommendation. The corrimittee had difficulties with the department;s reasons as to why Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities did not have equitable access to the scheme. There is clearly a lack of understanding by the department of the air service needs of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, particularly those of out-stations. There is also a clear lack of understanding of the entitlements of such commtm,ities. The access and equity strategy is meant to ensure such entitlements are recognise-l and services provided equitably. The problems identified in this report show that the department's implementation of the Commonwealth's access and equity strategy has been quite ineffectual. There is a lack of a clear implementation strategy for the access and equity strategy as it relates to aviation. From the evidence provided to the committee, there appears to be a total lack of appropriate performance indicators for implementation of social justice measures, particularly as they relate to minority groups. The committee recommends that the Minister for Transport undertake reviews of both the Department of Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority to ensure their active compliance with the Commonwealth's access and equity strategy and social justice principles. This review should result in e-ch agency having both a clear set of social justice objectives with appropriate performance indicators and a clear set of access and equity objectives with appropriate performance indicators. The committee also recommends that the Minister for Transport, in deciding on the future of the remote air services subsidy scheme, ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are fully consulted and that they have access to basic air services where no suitable alternative mode of transport is available. I will end my comments there in deference to the Deputy Chairman of the fIouse of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl).",14
9,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"I must apologise to the House and my friend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) because I was coming into support him, but it completely escaped my mind that I was due to speak and follow him. I do so with a great deal of pleasure. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is functioning extraordinarily well. We have a very big task. I would like to compliment the chairman, the honourable rnember for Moreton, for the way he is conducting his duties. This particular report causes us a lot of concern. We believe it is essential that Aboriginal ""and Torres Strait Islander people should see the result of all of the money that is being spent. All Australians are aware that the Commonwealth and the states are providing large sums of money for the ,benefit of Aboriginal and Torres .Strait Islander people. As one goes around the country speaking to individuals and groups, one realises that there is widespread concern that it appears that a lot of that money is not getting down to the grassroots level. Last week, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), the subcommittee dealing with the implementation of the royal commission recommendations visited a number of centres in Western Australia. We went to Broome, Karratha, Killgoorlie and Perth.",15

12,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,"Fraser) (12.53p.m.)On behalf of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the· Arts, I - present the committee's report entitled Greenhouse response: effectiveness of the implementation of an interim program--:a review of Audit report No. 32 of1992-93-an efficiency audit of the implementation of an interim greenhouse response, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed. MrLANGMORE-The· efficiency .audit that is reviewed in the report I have just presented found a serious discrepancy in the development and delivery of, an important government initiative. The audit dealt with the administration of the national energy management program that is managed by the department. The current program· had its origins in an interim package of greenhouse measures announced in October 1990. The Department of Primary· Industries and Energy was given the responsibilityofirilpleof menting these measures. It responded by inadequate, expanding its existing energy management program, which was by that time little more than a carry over from the 1970s oil shock. The expanded program came to include over 50 subprograms which varied widely in nature and scope and which shared extremely limited financial and human resources. Despite this expansion of the program, the department failed to give sufficient priority the program, and its response can· scribed as nothing more than. half-hearted. The auditors found that the department not taken sufficient action to implement the package of measures announced by the go"": vernment, despite the sense of urgent priority that the government had intended. It also appears that insufficient funds and staff have been provided to enable the department develop a more appropriate program. The strably committee felt that the government failed give adequate direction to the bureaucracy to allocate sufficient funds or staff program. Consultants were also commissioned by the department to conduct an evaluation of the on program. The consultants found that only two of the 25 major subprograms could be regardtee ed as being highly effective. They also found that, at existing funding levels, the program would contribute only about 10 per cent the required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and even then only if the· program was made more effective. Fortunately, it appears that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is acting the auditors'findings. The audit was an important catalyst for change, and the auditors House. believe that their presence contributed to the department acting more respqnsively towards the implementation of the program. The process of change initiated by the audit to have gained momentum with the report the consultants. Howevei, greatly increased financial staffmg resources must be committed to allow the program to expand to a level that will more towards attaining the government's greenhouse gas· emissions reduction target. The current level of expected funding for each the next three financial y-as is grossly given the potential annual savings of $1.5.billion that the government estimates could be realised if its target is achieved. The committee has made several recommendationswhichreinforce the findings of both the auditors and the iridependent consultants. If implemented, our recommendations, along with those of the auditors and the consultants, will provide a basis for the major to expansion and improvement of the program, be dewhich is certainly required. Next year the parties to the United Nations had Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was recently ratified by Australia, will meet in Berlin· to review global action on climate change. Australia must be able to show that it is playing its part. Our commitment to programs such as the national energy to management program will have to be demonbetter than the· half-hearted approach to taken so far. The committee intends to monior tor administration of the· program to ensure to the that this will be the case. Before concluding, I would like to warmly thank the committee secretariat for their work this report, and in particular Gabrielle Jess, who wrote the draft. Ian Dundas, the.commitsecretary, oversaw the preparation and Sue Irvine and Marlene Lyons edited the report and prepared it for publicatiori. I would also of like to thank my fellow committee members for their active cooperation in the preparation of this unanimous report and, by the way, to congratulate the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), one of the committee on members, on her promotion to the opposition front bench. I commend the report to the",15
13,Mr TRUSS,COMMITTEES," This is the second time this year that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on seems Environment, Recreation and the Arts has by reported to parliament on an Auditor General's efficiency audit, and for the second and time this year the committee has found it necessary to bring down a report concurring do with the Auditor-General's pretty scathing criticism of the administration and management of a government program. There is no doubt'that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has failed·to demonstrate due care, diligence and enthusiasm to ensure the success·of this program. It must be added also that the.' Minister ·for the· Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) seems to have taken little. action to ensure that this program,. which ·was ·announced witll.great fanfare and enthusiasm, has come to any kind of successful. conclusion .. The national' energy management plan is a part of the government's greenhouse response strategy and is obviously designed to reduce Australia's greenhouse emissions. This program contains a diverse range of measures which are, .at best, designed to bring about a reduction. in carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to only 10 per cent .of our required target. Nonetheless,this program is central to the national greenhouse response strategy. It is important that Australia is not only seen to be taking positive steps in this area but is also achieving worthwhile results for oUf'environment. The administration of the program' was reviewed by the Australian National Audit Office and its effectiveness has also been assessed by independent consultants. Both assessments found that there were serious shortcomings in the program and its administration. In particular, the department .was found to have failed to respond with the level of urgency suggested in the government's announcement of the program. This led to unacceptable delays in most elements of the program that were eventually. developed. Those elements that were developed were found to be less than fully effective. As the chairman of the committee said, only two of the 25 measures implemented in the program were considered to be reasonably effective. The department has taken steps. to' remedy the situation, but the program remains grossly under-resourced. It has to be said that. there must be considerable doubt as to how much commitment there ever was to the national energy management ,program. Certainly the commitment that was there when the program was announced has dearly faded. Funding reached $6.8 million in 1992-93 but has declined to $6.4 million in 1993-94. The budget announced earlier this month provides only $5.59 million for each of the next four years. When that amount is divided amongst 50 separate,' subprograms, clearly there is very little money available to achieve anything worthwhile. It seems as though this program was announced so that we could be seen to be doing something about greenhouse emissions to satisfy international observers and local conservationists. We have never devoted adequate staff or financial resources to achieve any kind of worthwhile result. The excuse put forward by the department was that therewereinsufficient people available even though we have a public . Service comprising over 150,000 people. At that time there were 4,000 people in the Department of Primary1ndustries and Energy but it. is clear that the staff were allocated to other areas because the commitment in other area- - as greater. I would like to say a lot about the subject of greenhouse emissions. There would be real benefits to the Australian economy and the environment in having effective programs in that regard. However, this report is abbut government management and the way in which a particular program was handled. The minister took little interest in the day-today affairs of this program even after there was an indication that little was being' achieved. There was plenty ·of publicity but, seemingly, a lack of responsibility.. It was all said by John Wicks, the First Assistant Secretary to the department, when giving evidence to the' committee. He said that when there was only $1 million available the department took the view that the government was only half-hearted about it and it was not worth trying. That half-heartednesspermeated the attitude of the department. towards this program and, naturally, it has been less effective than was intended when the government made the announcement and this. was certainly not the objective of the Australian people when supporting this kind of initiative.",16
14,Mr NEWELL,COMMITTEES,"Richmond) (1.04 p.m.)The report entitled .Gr.eenhouse response: effectiveness of the implementation of an interim program-a review of Audit report No. 32 of 1992-93-an efficiency audit of the implementation of an interim greenhouse response presented to the· House this afternoon is in some ways an indication of the level of commitment the government and bureaucracy have given to the reduction of greenhouse gases.· This is a policy thai this government will need to follow. As the goals -. honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) pointed out, the report· does point to· some inadequacies in the administration of the program. I would like to correct a comment made by the. honourable member for Wide Bay. He said that this is the second report that the Standing Committee· on Environment, be Recreation and the Arts has presented to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and ritories (Senator Faulkner) this year. This report is a response to the implementation of the energy management program conducted we by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the audit of that program con63 ducted by the Australian National Audit Office. The audit office, I think quite correctly, Was tralia. critical·of the management of the program and the commitment that has been given thus f(ir. As the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) pointed out, the consultants who also independently assessed· some of. the programs found that only two of them were completely followed through and implementsented ed. A number of. other programs or subprovery· grams were only partly implemented. Without doubt, as the honourable member for Wide Bay indicated, if the government and the country at large are to respond in effective manner to the likely greenhouse avoid effect, there has to be a lot more commitment, and that commitment must come from both funding and a commitment within the bureauthat· cracy to have that funding act effectively towards the targets that thegovemment, in this case, will need to set. As to the overall effects of the greenhouse gas emissions, there is still considerable debate. However, most people recognise the need for us to adopt a no regrets policy on that. While a no regrets policy will not necessarily lead to a reduction in greenhouse gemissions, it certainly is the base from which we must start. The government must be could prepared ioput the money into ensure thaJ staffing levels which, as has been indicated in the report, are not present are there and that the we give them the regulations to implement the targets and strategies which have to be implemented in terms of achieving our stated It does appear that the stated goals,' as we define them, are somewhat elusive in that sense. That is to be regretted because o(the need for the implementation of these targets. Overall, as the honourable member fOr Fraser indicated in his remarks, there are benefitS to gained from pursuing this, The net benefit, if we measure it in an economic sense; can be Terportrayed ·as· some $1.5 billion through achieving the targets. On the 'way through there will be some difficulty. Certainly, when look at the estimates of the net greenhouse gas emissions for 1987-88, we find that some per cent of greenhouse gas emissions are contributed through energy production and distribution, and the· use of energy in AusTo put in place targets or policies which will see that 63 per cent and the total amount produced come down will cause some problems. Even. the honourable member for Wide Bay, while he is very rightly endorsing the thrust of this report the committee. has preto the House today, would no doubt be concerned about the way some of the policies might be put in place· to achieve those targets, particularly the types of industries which might be affected immediately. In an implementing these targets, we also have to the soft targets first .up. We. have to be prepared to think in terms of the long term, where we need to go and the sort of support is put in place. Some of the .legislation which I anticipate will come into the House this week or next week, such as the ethanol bounty fuei amendment bills, is part of that. (Time. expired)",17
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Jenkins)""'I call the honourable member for· Pearce, who will speak from the dispatch box. Congratulations!",18
16,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"Pearce) (1.09 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I suppose we say that this report entitled Greenhouse response: effectiveness of the .implementation of an interim program-a review of Audit reportNo;32 of 1992-93-an efficiency audit of the implementation of an interim greenhouse response had its genesis in the conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 at which Australia, along with a number of other countries, agreed to pay some definite attention to the problem of greenhOuse gas emis-' siqns, Australia signed that cOllvention and agreed to adopt all interimplaniling target. The Australian people who were concerned about u- entering. into agreements. such as this on an international level will be. pleased to know that Australia did so with 'a caveat so that we could implement progra.m that was not detrimentcl1 to our nation's industries and qur economic well-being, There is always a great need to bring about a balance in these matters. Certainly for some of us progress is not fast enough, butthere has been a considerable move by governmentS and industry to address this problem- It is heartening that changes are taking place, but it was disappointing that the governmentand perhaps the minister in this case-has not seen fit to follow up this program a little more vigorously. The Auditor-General's report was very critical of the way Australia has gone about adopting and implementing . the recommendations in its plannjng. So we continue to be less than vigorous in the way we ,pursue the. greenhouse. gas emission problem. . , The concern I have is that it seems that the government has used this on an international basis as a platform for grandstanding and also for playing to environmental groups in our nation, with no real intention of coming to grips with the greenhouse gas emission problem- That is evident not so much ill the way the departments have gone about their task but in the lack of commitment to funding this program, the lack of commitment'to follow up and the lack of real concern about where the program is going: Australia's contribution to net global greenhouse house gas emissions is particularly high. We rank 15th on the list of world contributors and we have the third highest source of emissions on a per capita basis. It is estimated that; by the year 2005, over two-thirds .of Australia's main greenhouse gas emissions will be due to the supply and use of energy. Our two largest users of energy are transport and manufacturing. Which each account for just over onethirdofAustralia's total energy use. They are significant figures. That we need to participate with the rest of a the 'world in reduction of greenhouse gas emissiolls is not· in question. Improvements need not be. costly or daunting to industry both from a competitive point of view and a profitability point ()f view; Industry can increase its profitability and its competitiveness, a while simultaneously preserving our environment and cutting its energy costs and thus the emission of greenhouse gases. ' A significant contribution could be made to the competitiveness and profitability of industry with greater assurance from the national energy management program in achieving more efficient means of energy with a resulting low cost. The department has stated that it is under-resourced and underfunded. I find ita little' curious that this should be the case because the government .has implemented an extra 2c tax on leaded fuel. Yet we are not really putting that tax back int9 solving this problem. The other problem is our road funding, which has been reduced again. The condition '. of our roads can increase our energy use and our output of harmful. gases into the atmosphere. So there are. two positive ways we could address this problem. The sum of $140 million in income will be raised from the additional 2c excise on lead that is now being implemented. 'We have put $100,000 of that money into looking at the' problem of lead and emissions. (TIme expired) .' Mr CHYNOWETH (Dunkley) (L14p.m.) - Back in September 1987 I asked a question of the then Minister for Science and Small Business, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), in relation to, the greeneffect. I ani pleased in some ways to say that it has been taken up by CSIRO and xarious other bodies. ,However, I am not pleased about the. outcorne and the progress we are making in relation to the greenhouse effect and the actions the government is taking. I first raised this issue in 1987, and in 1988 I put amotion to this House that we recognise the serious environmental threat posed by the greenhouse effect and various other conditions. I also mentioried that I had written to Senator Richardson,as he then was, indicat- . ing that I would like something done abOut it. I went through a whole list of various problems that I believed had been caused by the greenhouse effect, based on articles in the papers of the' day.

19,Mr DODD,CAPE YORK PENINSULA,"Leichhardt) (1.16 p.m-)­ I move: That this House: (1) recognises that Cape York Peninsula is a vast, diverse and important region of tropical Australia that is(a) econorriically' important as a resource base for the mining, fishing, tourism and pastoral industries;' , (b) culturally important as the traditional homelands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait er people; and . (c) ecologically important as one of the world's last monsoonal regions undamaged by industrialised society; .' (2) notes that. a unique Commonwealth-State agreement has set up the Cape York Peninsula Land Use Strategy (CYPLUS) as a framework for making deci-ions about how to use and manage the natural resources of Cape York Peninsula in ways that will' be economically, culturally and ecologically sustainable; (3) commends, the outstanding work that has been done by the CYPLUS Task Force and representative community groups during the past two years on Stage I of CYPLUS gathering information about the environment, the community and the land use; . . (4) calls on the Queensland and Commonwealth Governments'to adequately fund Stage II of the study which is intended to develop the policy and framework for hind use decisi,on making on Cape York; and . . (5) emphasises that a key component. of funding for Stage II must be full support lor bQth a Community Regional Advisory Committee and for the various community interest groups on Cape York.' put this motion before the House because it to is about time the Cape York Peninsula Land Use Strategy, cOl!lmonly called CYPLUS, got recognition and accolades that it deserves. for CYPLUS is an outstanding example ·of'cooperation between government and the community in relation to land use management. I am pleased to say that that cooperation is happening in my electorate of Leichhardt. have been land use studies done around adthe world, most notably in Canada, however will none have had the opportunity to examine such avast and relatively unscathed area of land at such a critical,time in its history. When the Goss Laborgov-rnmentcame to power in Queensland in December 1989, 137,000 square kilometres of the Cape York Peninsula were subject to many competing interests. There were plans fora space base on the peninsula; property developer George Quaid had just finalised the freehold purchase of the massive Starke property on the east coast; there were successful mining operations at Weipa and Cape Flattery; pastoralistsheld 54 per cent of land tenure; and four-wheel Islanddrive enthusiasts pushed their vehiCles all over the peninsula's rough dirt roads. At the same time, many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities were without basic infrastructure' such as regular power, water and communications services, and some conserva- . tion groups were calling for the whole of the Cape York Peninsula to be nominated for World Heritage listing. Cape York Peninsula is a very remote area, larger thali the state of Victoria. It is home to around 11,000 people, over 50 percent of whom are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in communities of 200 people or more, most· of which are located near the coast. Because of the penirisula's monsoonal tropical climate many of the roads are inaccessible for up to half .of the year during the wet season, from November to three April. Air and sea become the only reliable forms of transport at this time. Clearly, Cape York Peninsula is one of the last great wilderness areas in the world, but it is pressure from a range of often competing interests. . To summarise, the peninsula is economically important as a resource base for the mining, fishing, tourism and pastoral indusstanding tries; culturally important as the traditional country of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and ecologically important one of the world's last monsoonal regions undamaged by industrial society. Rather than sit back and let the region developed in an ad hoc, unsustainable way Goss Labor government took up an offer team up with the Commonwealth to conduct a land use study to develop a framework for making decisions about how to use and manage the national resources of the peninsucongratulate la in ways that will be economically, culturalment ly arid ecologically sustainable. The decision to go ahead with the CYPLUS process has been of positive assistance to as a federal member. The factors that I tioned above regarding the diversity of interciation ests and remoteness and isolation make it very difficult region to service as a local I will certainly· be doing my utmost to each· ensure that the Commonwealth continues.to provide adequate funding for the strategy. The CYPLUS has been funded jointly by the Queensland state government and the Comthe monwealth to the tune of $7.6 million for stage one. Work on the CYPLUS is being carried out in three stages and public participation must be an important part of each stage. Stage which· is nearing completion, is information collection. Through public participation, information needed to decide which current and potential land users on the peninsula ecologically sustainable is being collected. Stage two is policy making. Community concerned. groups will use the information from stage one and combine it with the social and cultural priorities needed to build the land use strategy which will be made up in a number of land use policies for the peninsula. Stage is the implementation. Plans and policies will· be reviewed in this stage and put into the practice. As I said, stage one is nearing completion. The information collection has under been organised by a task force of seven people. Five members of the task force are located at the CYPLUS office in Grafton Street, Cairns, and another two work from Brisbane. The task force has done an outjob over the past two years. I have attended a number of informative briefings at the Grafton Street office and have been kept as up to date on the progress of stage one. The task force's commitment to public be participation has been exemplary. It has been the matched by the enthusiastic response of all to the key community groups representing the major interests in Cape York Peninsula. These community groups have played a crucial role in the development of the strategy and I all the groups on the committo the process. These groups comprise the Cape York Land Council, the Cape, York Peninsula Pastoral Advisory Group, the Cape York Peninsula Development Association, the me Cairns and Far North Environment Centre, the menCook Shire Council, the Port Kennedy Assoand the Queensland Mining Industry a Council. These organisations have .all been MP. contracted to liaise with their members and other to provide direct input into the task force's information gathering process. There was an understandable suspicion of CYPLUS prqcess when it was first established. Unfortunately, there is not a long history of genuine community consultation by government in Queensland, especially with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island groups and one, conservation groups. TheCYPLUS has involved a complex process-some have, said the too complex-with the Queensland Office of the Coordinator-General playing a key adminare istrative role. I praise the Commonwealth's role in this process,as do most of the groups Unfortunately, some groups have accused the Queensland government of some delay. It is not my job in this spee-h to get stuck into the Queensland government, but it is important that there be no further delays, The aims of the CYPLUS are too important for any further delays. Delays have affected all the community groups. I strongly urge everyone to get together and get the process moving. That is not to say that the CYPLUS has not made great achievements. As the member for Leichhardt, I have dealt with all theparticipating,groups on a' regular basis. Over the past year,. I think it would be fair to say that of pepple and their aspirations. all the feedback has been 90 per cent positive. There has just been some complaint about delays. The Queensland bureaucracy ought to get on with the job. As I said earlier, stage one of the process is information collection. An outstanding range of information has been collected and collated for input into the geographic information system, or the GIS, computer. There are two main information collecting programsthe natural resource and analysis program and the land use program. The natural resource analysis program is a scientific research program, collecting and mapping broad scale information on the natural resources of Cape York Peninsula-its geology, soils, ground water, vegetation and fauna. ,There are 19 research projects being carried out by the state and Commonwealth agencies, coordinated by the CYPLUS task force. The budget for the program is $4.7 million. The natural resource analysis program started during the dry season of 1992-93 and will continue during the wet and dry seasons of 1993-94, with final reports to be completed by June 1994. Teams of researchers are scouring the peninsula, doing wetland surveys, documentingfish and crustacean species, examining the evolution and character of the coastal environment, measuring changes in the earth's mag,. neti<;field over the peninsula, mapping ground water and mapping the distribution and types of. insects, flora and fauna. All available scientific data on the peninsula is being collated and put into .the GIS computer. When all the information is collated, the GIS will provide storage and a means of analysis of integrated information which can be used to build a land use strategy for the Cape York Peninsula. It will be a phenomenal chore. The second information collecting program is the land use program. This program will utilise information from the natural resources analysis program and combine it with social and economic data to, provide individual reports on topics such as fire, land degrada:tion, tourism, pastoralism or population and to provide overall reports on the state of the economy and the environment and the needs ' Once the land use program is completed we will know more about the Cape York Peninsula than we, do about any other region in Australia. 1 doubt whether there' will be a region in the' world of comparative size that has been studied in detail more scientifically and socially. (Time expired) MrGibson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak. ,",20
20,Mr KATTER,CAPE YORK PENINSULA,"It was fascinating to hear the last speaker, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). I tried to take down notes on what he was saying. For the second time at the end of one 'of his speeches I had absolutely no notes. Even if I was collecting only notes to attack what was said, I have nothing to attack here at aIL The honourable member spoke about a proper and orderly development, which is a lovely motherhood statement. We can stand up and report ad nauseam a series of motherhood statements, but let us get down to practical facts. The fact of the matter is that actions in this place by the government of the, honourable member and by his government in Brisbane have created a great Berlin waH-flot of a social or political nature, such as the Berlin Wall, but one of an economic naturestretching from Townsville all the way up to Bamaga and almost all the way down to Normantop. The Cape York Peninsula and part of the east coast down to Townsville is now surrounded by a giant Berlin wall. If we want to understand the significance of that, we should look at the Century mine, which, has the biggest zinc deposits .ever found in the world's history-I think that is a fair enough statement; I do not think I am overly. representing .the resource-that· is to have a slurry pipeline to take its product from the mine site itself to a port. The length of the slurry pipeline will be- I cannot quote the exact figures-about 150, maybe 200, kilometres to the Gulf of Carpentaria. To' get to that area it will need to go through a number of areas that are under some form of Aboriginal title, As a result of the media and the expectations placed on people there by the Queensland government, and because of attitudes that have developed unfortunately over a protracted period,' they are. fairly adamantly indisposed to allowing that pipeline to go anywhere near their land. Even the proposed surveying group that would look at alternative sites was not allowed on the Doomadgee Reserve at all. The net result is that the pipeline probably has be diverted to Karumba. That is an extra 150 to 200 kilometres at an enormous cost of millions of dollars for every five or 10 kilometresof pipeline to the project. I teU the story to indicate the difficulties that are involved now in developing any of these resources because of the great Berlin wall which has. been placed around North Queensland. The Century deposits have been held up-I venture to suggest that hold-up is very serious-for a protraCted period. In times of normal zinc prices, the Century deposits are worth to this country $100,000 million a year. Similarly, the proposed development at Weipa would result,. in times of normal aluminium prices, in nearly $1,000 million a year... So, in those two developments alone, both of which have been held up in part or in to to as a result of the Mabo legislation which was passed in this House and the concomitant moves by this government and its sympathy with that sort of thinking, the net result has been that' at the present moment $2,000 million worth of development income per year for this nation is lost and could be lost completely. I have my doubts as to how these people will proceed in the future. Shelbourne Bay with its. silicon sand deposits is an interesting ca.se. If we want to know why our country is going broke, we need look no further than Shelbourne Bay. The last time. I looked, which was a few years ago; we were exporting silicon from this country for $55 a tonne. However, when· I was in the Queensland government, one year we imported back nine tonnes of silicon as optical fibre .product into Australia and we paid $3.03 million,a tonne for it. It was 99.98 per cent silicon, almost pure, when it went out and .it was pure silicon when it came back in. If we want to be technical, we .are exporting the same number. of molecules of silicon out of the country as we are importing into the country; they have just been rearranged. But the rearrangement has been worth over$3·million a tonne to the Japanese economy. At the present moment we are producing hundreds. of thousands oftonnes of silicon to and exporting it from Cape Flattery; which is north of Cooktown. But, when an Australian developer attempts to develop the resource at Shelbourne Bay, he is. told he has environmental problems; he has Aboriginal problems; he has Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority problems; and he has Beach Protection Management Authority problems. In fact, he has so many problems that we can forget about the resource completely. But that resource·in the two-inch thick, very heavily documented proposals 1 saw, which were the mining proposals. for that area of Shelbourne Bay-:-:the Australian owned lease, I emphasise, at Shelbourne Bay-was. to produce 100,000 to 200,000 tonnesof hightech silicon at about $20,000 per. tonne per year. Even· though I think some of those figures can be a little optimistic, there is no doubt that we are talking here about a facility that will be worth $2;000 million a year to the Australian ecoriomy. So the giant Berlin wall that has gone up atound Cape York PeninsulaI' has resulted in the stopping of the Century dev-lopment, the Weipa d-velopment and the Shelbourne Bay development, each of those projects being worth $4,000 million a year to the Australian economy. Let me just come back to Shelbourne Bay for one moment. There cannot, by definition, be a green issue involved with the big dune at Shelbourne Bay which is owned by the Australian company. It is blowing' into the ocean. We have the navigation charts which designate that dune as being a certain height at the turn of the century; it is now only half that height. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to work it out. The leading end of the dune is now protruding about 50 or 100 ,metres into the Pacific Ocean and dissipating on the ocean floor from which it cannot be recovered. There is no issue here. Within 70 years there will be no dune at all; the whole dune will be gone. This nation will have forgone an income of $2,000 million. ,As well as that, Australia could project itself by producing high quality silicon. We could produce it far more cheaply than any other country. Because our original resource is 99 per cent pure silicon, instead of having to go through five processes, we would only need to go through three processes. Then, because we are able to do that, we will be able to produce a silicon product. For those who are very environmentally conscious, let me state that this nation would automatically become the world leader in solar energy because we could produce photovoltaic cells at about, half their present We would cut the cost of the entire input item, which of course is silicon, clean in half. Solar energy, at this point, through photovoltaics, is competitive at peak hours in the middle of the day but far from being competitive overall with, coal fired power stations. However, most certainly, at peak hours we could achieve a similar pricing structure to that provided by the coal industry at present. We are forgoing all of these wonderful advantages for our nation for no purpose except a blind adherence by the media and people in this House who are continuously intimidated by references to the greenies or people of Aboriginal'descent. I say in defence of the black people on Cape York Peninsula that every time a development has gone ahead, it has been at their expense. The mining companies have not made the effort to try to provide something for the locals. Heaven only knows, when Charters Towers was given a choice of having a uranium mine there or not having one there, when We were told we got the pollution, but Townsville got the jobs, needless to say, that community rose as one and completely defeated the project. Similarly, that is the case with the black people. I hope I have somesmall contribution to make to the black people of the peninsula in trying to educate, them as to how to proceed.I told them to market themselves aggressively and negotiate .aggressively. At the end of the day, I ask this House to please understand that we are dealing with intelligent people, who have their own concerns. If there is something in it for them, I can assure the House that the majority of them will b- in favour of the project, but if there IS absolutely nothing in it for them, they cannot be convinced and, naturally, they will object to it. Those are the things that we should be addressing. (Time expired)",22
21,Mr GIBSON,CAPE YORK PENINSULA,"In rising to support this motion moved by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), I must comment briefly on some of the points made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) who, once more, has cost. done himself and his party no credit at all with the comments he made. Firstly, most of his comments were absolutely irrelevant to the motion and had nothing to do with the Cape York study. MrKatter-That just illustrates your ignorance.",24
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CAPE YORK PENINSULA,Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member for Kennedy was' heard in silence.,24
23,Mr GIBSON,CAPE YORK PENINSULA,"Secondly, his speech was full of the usual paranoia and scaremongering that we have come to expect of every speech the honourable member makes in this House. He made.! no positive contributions with regard to the very valuable work that is being done in the Cape York land lise study. In fact, he started bringing in all ,sorts of other issues that were totally irrelevant to the matter, as he well knows. , ' In one of the major parts of his speech, he went on about the Century mine. He claimed that, because of Aboriginal interests in that issue and their concerns about the pipeline that was proposed to be .built, somehow ,this project is being stopped. What he failed to us was that the Century mine is not in the Cape York land use study area; it is under Gulf of Carpentaria. In fact, it is oot even. of the study that we are talking about in this motion.' ' He also made 'comments .that were quite incorrect. He Claimed that $4,000 million worth of government projects have been power. stopped because of Aboriginal, environmental or other concerns. That is a total untruth. That is a total distortion of the facts. None of these projects have been stopped. The Weipa with project has not been stopped, nor has the Century mine. Yes, they are having to deal with certain issues that the Aboriginal comAboriginal munitieshave raised and they are having to deal with environmental issues, but that is purpose of this Cape York land use study. The whole purpose of the study was to bring all interested parties together, to study all issues involved and to make' sure that every interest group involved on Cape York has their views known and takeninlo account. - Current and future needs on the Cape York Peninsula, can be properly planned to talce account of all the different interest groups all the different factors, such, as protection our environment, protection of Aboriginal sacred sites and their other interests,·· the protection of pastoral interests and the protecinitiatives, tion of ordinary residential interests in Cape York Peninsula. We do not need to hear the typical ravings that we have heard today from the honourable member for Kennedy, who has once more reinforced the view that the National Party has totally lost the plot with regard to adequate planning and adequate consideration of all interests; If he had his particular constituency's interests at heart, he would be fully embracing the Cape York land use study because it is designed to protect the constituexpired) encies that the National Party claims to represent. Of course, National Party members fail to represent them because the government represents pastoralists, _farmers and, miners better than they will ever do. It is, about time the honourable member started to take account of the real Interests instead of getting up here Claiming that he is tell there to protect his constituents and making ludicf(')uS comments about a giant Berlin wall the being built around Queensland. There have part been more development projects and more jobs created in Queensland than in any other . state in this country.· That has been under the Goss Labor government. It is certainly a hell of a lot better than what his government was able to produce in the 30 years that it was in I would like to mention a particular element of this Cape York land use study, and that is regard to Aboriginal. and Islander interests. As the House knows, I chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I. have a particular interest in this and am the pleased that part of this land use program is designed to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests are reflected in all the projects that occur on Cape York and that the cultural significance of traditional lands is recognised as a legitimate land use in its own . This project will provide a specific indigenous viewpoint on the use and management of and land and sea resources and relies heavily on of consultation and meetings in all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the peninsula. It will look at existing management processes or programs,such as the the community ranger network, and potential for further community based resource management.The Aboriginal and islander part of this Cape York land use program will be managed by the task force and the Aboriginal aod Torres Strait Islander i-terest group. I welcome the work that is being done on this program and congratulate' the Aboriginal and islander representatives involved for the professionalism they have shown. I also congratulate the Queensland and Commonwealth governments for' this study. (Time ,",24
24,Mr HAWKER,CAPE YORK PENINSULA,"I am pleased to.joinmy colleagues in speaking on this motion. I note that! am the only nonQueenslander speaking,' so I might bring a refreshing viewpoint to the debate. I remind everyone that we are talking about an area of land about the size of Victoria which, as the honourable member for Leichhardt(Mr Dodd) has pointed out, has a population of around 11,000 people. It isavery large area of land with a relatively small population. One of the primary objectives of the Cape York Peninsula land use study must be to find out the values, needs and aspirations of those residents and also to ensure the sensible, long term sustainable use of Cape Yorkland. In the short .time. I have available, I want talk about one particular group in this region: the cattle producers, the pastoralists. Having met some of them, my coricern is that they are being very much overlooked in this whole study. I noticed that the honourable member for Leichhardt mentioned the delays that have been going on. I would suggest· that these delays are part of the very significant problems. It is creating uncertainty. It is obviously making it very difficult for people to see where their future is. We are talking about around 100 familiesa very small but, nonetheless, significant number. More importantly, this group has the potential and opportunity to make a very significant contribution to our. economy; My concern is that the cattle producers' views are being very much overshadowed by other groups, such as the environmentalists'views and some of the Aboriginal interests. I think it is vital that in this study the economic, cultural and. ecological interests are ba:lanced and not tilted very heavily one way. Clearly, there are areas of environmental sensitivity. Obviously, there are areas of strong cultural significance for Aboriginal communities. But, very clearly, there are also significant areas in this very large area of land of great potential for agricultural development. It was estimated in 1989 that the turnoff by these 100 cattle producers was around 16,000 head of cattle. That is far below the levels that used to be maintained in the past. Unfortunately,. that trend of decline has been continuing. But now technology is available that could not only reverse this declining trend but also make massive increases in the productivity and the level of production. Technological improvements that would be abie to cope with the physical constraints and the difficulties of high rainfall that sometimes, while reliable, is highly seasonal could be of major significance. As I said, the turn-off was around 16,000; it could be increased to a quarter of a million head of cattle per year which would produce a gross income of $80 million-a tenfold increase on the current position. The technology is there and the opportunities are there but, because of this to uncertainty and delay, the surface is not even being scratched. At least 80 percent of the land used by pastoralists would be left in its natural state, and 20 per cent of it would see some pastoral improvements in this. regard. Obviously massive gains could be made through technology.We would have to have proper access to roads and to finance. Obviously there would have to be some changes in government policies to allow this development. But I think it is very important for this group to be given proper credit for the work it is doing.",25
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CAPE YORK PENINSULA,"Mr Andrew)Order! Iinterrupt the honourable member for Wannon to point out that the time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjoumed, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order ·6£ the day fof the next sitting Monday. The honourable member for Wannon will have leave to continue his remarks when the debate is resumed. NA Mt GIBSON (Moreton) (1.46 p.m.)I move: That this House: (1) notes that Parliamentarians for Global Action (Australian Parliamentary Group) supports the initiative to request an advisory opinion from the World Court on the illegality of the use of nuclear weapons; (2) requests the Minister for Foreign Affairs to express Australia's support fcir this initiative; and (3) calls on the Australian Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to: (a) make submissions to the International Court of Justice at the Hague (the World Court) supporting the aim of declaring nuclear weapons illegal; and (b) support a fumre UN General A-embly vote in favour of having. an advisory opinion from the. World Couit. on the illegality nuclear weapons written into international law. If anyone seriously doubts the value of .this course of .-ction in calling on the World Court to declare nuclear weapons illegal, let quote the.words of Mr Niall MACDermot QC, a former Secrt<tary-General of the InternationStates al Commission of Jurists. He said: It would be naive to imagine, in the present of world tension, that a declaration of the illegality of the use of nuclear weapons,. even if made such an authoritative body as the World Court, would lead the nuclear nations to eliminate from their strategy, still less to agree at once abandon them . It would, however, mark ant step forward in awakening the peoples and governments of the world to the extent to whiC;h modem military weapons have outrun all the cOl1cepts of the international law of war, as well all morality and humanity. Anyone knowing the history of nuclear weapons will realise why this motion has security been moved today. While many people. reto, member the 1980s as being swept with greed, it was also a time which saw an explosion the number of nuclear weapons possessed countries around the globe. In 1945 there were two nuclear bombs in existence; years later in 1986 there were nearly 70,000 nuclear weapons in active operational forces. That is an enormous amount of destructive force in anyone's language. 'Currently there are nearly 50,000 active nuclear weapons in the world. In conventional terms this represents 2.2 tonnesof TNT for every person on the planet. There has been a healthy reduction of 20,000 missiles over the last eight years .. However, there are still far too many. These 50,000 missiles have a total explosive fire power equal to 900,000 Hiroin shima bombs. The Hiroshima bomb, dropped consume the south with fire. in the last days of the Second World War, killed an estimated 140,000 people. If one nuclear bomb killed that many, how many would 50,000 missiles kill? We now know in that modem bombs are 75 times more powerfinancial ful than the one dropped on Hiroshima. The United. States has 16,750 nuclear weapons;Jhe Commonwealth of Independent States retains almost twice that number. Great Britain has 200; France 525; China 435, and of India, Pakistan· and Israel are all believed to have nuclear missiles. These figures are more than just numbers or statistics; they reflect a capacity to absolutely annihilate our species and all others on the planet, and such statistme ics should horrify any reasol1able person. . To prepare for nuclear' war the United spent $38 billion in 1993 and,over the next 10 years, will spend $350 billion. Just state imagine how else that money could have been spent. If other nations' expenditures are by included in this charge for mutuallyarsured destruction, it would add up to an extraordi:.. them nary amount of money that could have been to ,bettertised to eliminate poverty, illiteracy and an importdisease throughout the world. With the - nd of ,the Cold War, security basic considerations have become more difficult. as There is, in fact, a greater mood of uncertain. . ty as to what global security arrangements will be in place in the 21st century. One option that nations should. not revert and in fact should not be allowed to revert to, is that of obtaining and using nuclear in weapons. Security and certainty will not be by found where nuclear, weapons exist. They promote fear and escalate violence. and. they 41 should be banned by international law. .There are many prevailing examples of how nuclear weapons are creating a disturbing uncertainty around the globe; Everyone in the House is aware of tht< crisis currently unfolding on the Korean peninsula. North Korea is refusing to allow United Nations.' agents to inspect lts nuclear facilities. North Korea is a signMory. to .the non-proliferation treaty. put refuses to, allow compliance checking. In response to this recalcitrance, the United States has deployed patriot mi,ssiles to South I):orea case the north fulfils its wafJ1ing that it will ' In the Commonwealth of. Independent States, the Ukraine .gov-rnmentis holding out on dismantling former Soviet·nuclear missiles the hope of receiving greater United States aid. No nation should be allowed to hold the rest of the planet to ransom with nuclear weapons, Closer to home, both India, which exploded the nuclear bomb in 1974, and. Pakistan are believed to have a nuclear arsenal. Regularly we have witnessed tensions between th-setwo nations and both have recently substantially _increased their conventional weapons holdings in th- ·fornl. of new jets. That tension is still a cause of great concern for the 'rest of the community: . At the time of the Gulf Wa- in 1991 it was estimated that Iraq was only one year away from developing a ,nuclear bomb. What would have happened if Saddam Hussein had managed to obtain one? No doubt we all remember how he fired Scud· missiles on Israel. What if they were nuclear missiles and what if Israel then decided to reciprocate by sending nuclear missiles? We would have had an enorrrlous outpouring of nuclear weapons around the world - Our world is full of .complexities and conflict. Many of the disputes present us with an incredible, frightening reality. While many of these disputes art1 complex, solutions must be found which avoid the use of force. Peace must be sou,ght as a first resort, not at the end of the battle. Nuclear weapons must be eliminated before they are able to eliminate us; That iswhy this motion has been moved today: to - ensure 'that nuclear. weapons are banned. Other weapons of mass destruction are now forbidden, such as biological and chemical weapons. All members w.ill be aware of the role Australia played in seeing these conventions negotiated and implemented. The World Court project to declare nuclear weapons illegal is a joint project of the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms; theInternational Peace Bureau and the Intetnational Physicians for - the Prevention of Nuclear War. The aim of the ptoject is to obtain an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice at The Hague, colloquially known as the World Court, as to the criminality of . nuclear weapons in international law. The International Court ofJustice WaS established by the UN charter and the court may give advisory opinions on. any· legal-question at the request of any bodyautborised by or in accordance with the United Nations charter to make such . a request. In; 1993 the World HealthAssembly, which is the goverriing body of the World Health . Organisation, referred to the World Court the question of whether the use . of nuclear weapons-was contrary to international law.· In November 1993 a motion was tabled to seek a somewhat wider ruling on whether use or the threat of use was illegal. This was eventually withdrawn following heavy pressure from the United States, the United Kingdom and France. However, the case put forward by the World Health Organisation is now proceeding. Written submissions have been requested and ,need to be lodged by . 10 June 1994. The hearings are not expected to take place until 1995. A group of parliamentarians in this parliament who are called Parliamentarians for Global Action, which is an international .parliamentary assembly, are calling on the Australian government to support this proposal to be taken to the World Court. We ask the· Australian government to make a submission to the International Court - of Justice supporting the aims of the World Court project to declare nuclear weapons illegal. The present position of the - government is not to support bringing the case befor- the World Court. In a letter dated 4 May, the Minister _for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, outliried the Australian positiori on this initiative. He says that he supports what is known as stable deterrents, which rely on the belief that horrific outcomes of a nuclear confrontation are enough to dissuade it from ever happening again. It also advocates continuing progress towards disarmament by the nuclear weapons states through treaties in which Australia will seek to play a central part. -.The government is suspicious that the World Court may actually find that the use of nudear weapons may be acceptable in some circumstances, such as in retaliation to a first strike or in response to a massive conventional attack. My concern is that this line of thought belongs to the era, of the Cold War. We· have moved on from the Cold War and we need to change our policy to reflect that. Nuclear deterrents should not rely on the grotesque premise of stable deterrents but collective security through an assertive securiclare ty council involving the cooperation of nuclear powers. It is unlikely that the court would legitimise the use of nuclear weapons but, even if· it did, the principles of internaused tional law as they exist in the 1990s would have to be articulated for public consumption and understanding. Thegovemment's present position should be changed because it assumes that the views of the nuclear weapons states are the authoriof tative voice Of humanity. However,it is because of the policies of the nuclear nations that an advisory opinion should be sought the nrstplace. This country, under Labor, has been more independent in its international outlook dealings than at any other time in the nation's history. However, a few legaCies of reliance on our great and powerful friends remain. should be capable of taking a principled moral decision on the legality of nuclear weapons and· articulate it before the rest world. The aim of this motion today is to rid the planet of a menace that has the potential to destroy us all. Can anyone legitimately stand in the way of this aim? . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Andrew)Is the motion seconded? Mr Chynoweth-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",26
26,Mr LIEBERMAN,NUCLEAR WEAPONS,"-':Nodo one can doubt the obvious sincerity of· honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in wanting to achieve a safer world-if not for ourselves, certainly for our children. Regrettably, the coalition cannot support the motion in its present form for good reason. The reason is that the quest to ban nuclear weapons would be adhered to if it were forced-if it were law-by the very countries striving to prevent irresponsible countries from using nuclear weapons to gain ascendthis ancy over other innocent people. The coalition strongly supports any move to prevent the proliferation of nuclear pons. That can and is being done through treaties, such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty. on Bufthe coalition cannot support m.oves to denuclear weapons illegal because, terrifyall ing and repugnant as those weapons are, nuclear deterrents do work and have worked. Thankfully, nuclear weapons have not been in a war since 1945. That is because nuclear weapons held by countries such as the US, the former USSR, the United Kingdom, France and China possess a strategic nuclear capability sufficiently credible to deter· an exchange' of nuclear weapons. That isa matter history' as well as a matter of fact. The present government, of which the honourable member for Moreton is a signifiin cant member, does not agree with the honourable member's point of view on this particular matter. Successive Australian governments of and all political colours have agreed to host military facilities which playa significant role in the strategic nuclear capability of the We United States. If we were in government-'-we and will be after the next election-we would continue to do so because the possession by of the the United States of a credible strategic nuclear capability is a key factor in preventing global nuclear wars. The coalition does not believe that our quest for peace in the world and the efforts of.organisations such as the United Nations should be made illegal. Like everyone in Australia and in the free world, . the coalition heartily wishes that nuclear weapons did not exist. We hope that one day that situation will, in fact, occur. ,We not believe, however, that having the the World Court declare these weapons illegal will in fact make them disappear. The leadership shown by the United States in the last few years in achieving agreements for disarmament and for the destruction of .nuclear weapons .by that nation and"" by others is 'having a significant effect on the quest by all enof us to achieve a safe world and to rid ourselves finally of nuclear weapons. , If we were to make a judgment by passing motion, all we would do is embarrass and hinder our ally, the United States; as well as other countries which ate working very hard weato achieve peace and safety. It would have absolutely no impact alall Oil those countries which seek to .acquire nuclear weapons in defiance of the international nuclear non-proliferation system-and the honourable member for Moreton mentioned North Korea in his own contribution. Just imagine the Saddam Husseins. of this world responding to a declaration by the World Court that nuclear weapons are illegal. Just imagine, as the honourable member for Moreton said, what would have happened to those innocent people i.n Israel if Saddam had rained on them missiles with nuclear capabili"": ty to achieve his territorial and strategic claims, He did not have them· because of the non-proliferation agreements-agreements·that do work,· .even though they do not work as effectively or as quickly as we would all like. Saddam Hussein would have no respect at all for a declaration of a court making these weapons illegal,although our allies, such as the United States and the UK, would of course comply with those orders. The world would be less safe simply because many people in this world, such as the Saddams, do not respect the law. They certainly do not respect international la:w; they respect only the law that their own power and tyranny can bring upon innocent people. The end of the Cold War has dramatically reduced the threat of global nuclear war-and I think my friend the honourable member for Moreton concedes that point. As a result, ,the United States and Russia have significantly reduced their nuclear arsenals. In particular, they have withdrawn inherently destabiIising nuclear weapons .such as warheads on short range ballistic missiles and seaborne cruise missiles. With the threat of global nuclear diminished-but not, it must be stressed, eliminated entirely-iUs the proliferation of nuclear weapons that now poses the greatest nuclear threat to regional peace and hostility. I think my friends would agree with that statement. North Korea, which has been mentioned already, .is strongly suspected of developing nuclear weapons, and is developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering them onto targets in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China-our allies, our friends and also our strongest· trading partners under our ASEAN and other world trade arrangements. Why would this. parliament wish to jnflict on those friends of ours further danger from the threats that come from North Korea today by forcing allies to rid themselves of nuclear weapons that are kept only as a deterrent? I am sure that the honourable member for· Moreton would not suggest that the United States of America, our ally, holds its remaining nuclear weapons as a threat against the world. I am sure that it is common ground on both sides that they hold the remaining weapons as deterrents against the aggressive use of nuclear. weapons against the free world. Therefore the coalition regrets that, for the reasons that I have explained, it cannot support this motion. But the coalition takes this opportunity to emphasise and recommit its support for all international mechanisms aimed at preventing. the proliferation of nuclear weapons and its belief that such mechanisms should be strengthened wherever possible. We support the indefinite extension of the nuclear proliferation treaty. Honourable members might be interested in taking note of that. The treaty comes up for review in 1995-a short time away. We support accelerated work on a comprehensive test ban treaty: We support the missile technological control regime. And we support very strongly the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Building international support for these international treaties and organisations and ensuring compliance with them is our best hope for containing nuclear proliferation.",29
27,Mr CHYNOWETH,NUCLEAR WEAPONS,"Dunkley) (2.05 p.m.) war - As a member of Parliamentarians .for Global Action, it is a pleasure to stand here today and speak on a motion regarding nuclear weapons. In my maiden speech back in 1983, I described what would happen and the consequences to my electorate of Flinders, as it was at that time, were a lO-megaton bomb to hit it. I doubt whether things have changed since then. Australia has had a lead",30
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NUCLEAR WEAPONS,Mr Andrew)Order! I indicate to the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) that whispering has never been one of his strong points and that it is audible to the chair at this stage.,30
29,Mr CHYNOWETH,NUCLEAR WEAPONS,"He makes a good interjection now and again. Australia has been a leader in the world on many issues and in many areas, especially in peace and disarmament areas. We have led in the introduction of legislation on chemical weapons and various other matters, and we have changed the opinion of the world. There is no doubt that we can do the same again if we go to the international court with a good· argument in .favour of banning and outlawing nuclear weapons. Chemical weapons and biological weapons - weapons of mass destruction-are all pretty weak compared with nuclear weapons. 'Nuclear weapons are infinitely more dangerous than any of these.' They are not my words; they are ex-President Bush's words. He obviously had some experience on this matter, and he claimed 'Nuclear weapons are infinitely more dangerous'. In today's Sydney Morning Herald, the headline . on the front page states'N Korea rejects nuclear checks'. Some of us are putting forward the suggestion that if nuclear weapons were illegal we could go in and check them, but by not supporting this motion we cannot do that. All we can do is stand off and take information from the CIA. That is quite interesting. The article states: . . . the CIA has said that the communist North's extensive missile program is part of an effort to prove that its nuclear arsenal can strike all the major cities in Japan and Korea. If I remember rightly, the CIA was involved in the start of the Vietnam War. I would hate to see what could come out of this. I say to all leaders of all nations all over the world, 'Just be a bit cautious in anything you get from the CIA and anything in relation to North Korea. It is a dangerous situation which could lead us into another war.' I will just read .out some information to honourable members from the Defence Monitor: . US. nuclear weapons were designed and produced to counter Hitler's Germany-they go right back to that time-Hirohito's Japan, the Soviet Union, Mao's China and the Warsaw Pact. These enemies no longer exist. So why do we need those weapons? It Continues: · The United States is the world's number one military power, with or without its huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, andean attack any target with its vast array of powerful nonnuclear weapons. · Nuclear weapons do far less than. constructive economic and political relations with other count"" rieS to prevent attacks on America. · It costs American taxpayers $31 Billion ea-h year to buy, operate and maintain US. nuclear weapons and weapon delivery systems.· . It later states: The military of the United. States is far superior to the armed forces of the regional ""bad guys"" . . . The USA has 20,000 nuclear weapons; Iran has zero, as far as we know; Iraq has zero; Libya has zero; North I):orea has zero; and Syria has zero. All of those countries may have one or two nucle-r weapons, but we do not know. The countries that I have named are the bad guys, yet the US has 20,000 nuclear weapons. That is a big difference. Nuclear weapons serve no military purpose, especially· given the US's superiority in conventional weapons. The United States is the world's No. 1 military power with or without its nuclear weapons. Many military officials have recognised that they no longer need nuclear, weapons and have deliberately sought to build up stores of powerful, smart non-nuclear weapons . Did all the nuclear weapons prevent the Vietnam War, the Korean War, the Cambodian War or the Iraqi War? They did not prevent any of those wars because they could not be used. They are worthless. People say that they are a deterrent and that they might stop a war in some other country. But look at all the enemies. Russia has disintegrat.ed. It is not an issue any more. Why do we need nuclear weapons? The only reason we need them is a huge, powerful lobby of some people in the US, the UK, France, et cetera, which is putting pressure on us to support them. We should put forward a motion in the International Court of Justice to oppose and ban nuclear weapons, (Time expired)",31
30,Mr HICKS,NUCLEAR WEAPONS,"While acknowledging the good intentions of the honourable member for. Moreton (Mr Gibson) in moving this motion, I feel it is not a reasonable response to the nuclear weapons issue. Seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice would be about as effective as some of those 'nuclear free zone' signs we have seen around some of the local councils which have cost ratepayers money. While not being flippant, I wonder what a direct hit from a nuclear weapon would do to some of those signs. This motion is really in that vein. I acknowledge the concern of the honourable member for Moreton and the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynow-th), because I know that theirs is aloilgstanding concern. But the honourable members know that international law is not a fixed, immutable code and that any judgment on the legality or otherwise of nuclear weapons is of little practical use, particularly where some maverick nations are involved .. However, there is no doubt that the proliferation and possible use of nuclear weapons remains an issue of great importance to the international community. As honourable members maybe aware, the publication entitled the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists displays a clock on its front cover depicting the latest estimate of how close the world is to global catastrophe. In some of the, more heated moments of the Cold War, this clock stood very close to midnight. Thankfully, it now stands further away. According to the MayJune edition of the Bulletin of· the Atomic Scientists, the clock stands at 17 minutes to midnight. This change in the. world's nuclear circumstance has been brought about largely by. the end of the Cold War and the welcome and rapid collapse of communism. It may be tempting to think that the decline in the rivalry between the West and the East has meant that the risk of nuclear conflict has disappeared. Nothing could be further from the truth. With the end of the Cold War, new concerns and worries have replaced old, not least in relation to the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons. We may no longer have to worry greatly about the risk of a nuclear first strike from the Eastern bloc. However, today we must be concerned about the increased possibility of low level nuclear threats and nuclear proliferation. The world cannot discount the possibility of accidental or unauthorised limited nuclear strikes. No amount of well-intentioned legal argument at any forum will be enough ;to prevent a holocaust. In relation to the former USSR, there are several scenarios in which an accidental launch of nuclear weapons may occur. Poorly maintained weapons or faulty command and communication structures could be a source of risk for accidental launch. Other possibilities include the provision of incorrect or misinterpreted information to the nuclear command. We must also consider the danger of unauthorised nuclear strikes. Examples include the maverick general who has command. of nuclear weapons, the mad submarine captain or the terrorist. Concern has been expressed about the possibility of rogue elements in the former USSR, including Mafia style criminal organisations, conducting nuclear terrorism. These scenarios have long been subject matter for popular fiction, but these nightmares could well become a reality. The President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, obviously shares this concern. At a recent conference of the successor. organisation to the KGB, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, President Yeltsin urged the service to be vigilant about the threat of nuclear terrorism. The director of the FBI, Louis Freeh,believes that the interest of Russian organised crime in selling nuclear weapons or materials stolen from the former Soviet republics is the greatest long-term threat to the security of the United States. Australia would also do well to consider the danger of nuclear terrorism. Thankfully, experts believe that the chance of unauthorised nuclear launch from nations of the former Soviet Union is remote at this time. However, should the top state structures of these nations ever collapse, we cannot be sure that nuclear launch codes and other necessary information will remain in safe and sane hands. An example of the potential danger is the present tension between Ukraine and Russia, both nuclear armed states, over Crimea. Associated Press recently reported that the Russian defence minister, Pavel Grachev, has warned that a military conflict in Ukraine . could spark a civil war engulfing the rest of Ukraine. Of course, the former USSR is not the only source of nuclear risk. For sometime there has been a concern about nuclear anned Third World nations. Proliferation of nuclear anned Third World states has the potential to increase the risk of accidental or unauthorised strikes. Proliferation also increases the chances of possible panic situations and may mean that, future conflicts could result in nuclear blackmail. North Korea and its possible nuclear arms building plans may one day prove a case in point. While personally believing that the motion is not an appropriate response to an issue' of global concern, I respect the intention of the honourable member for Moreton in SUbmitting it to the parliament. I am not wishing to play the role of scaremonger in this debate. However, it is my finn belief, that the world, including Australia, must take ;into full account the current and potential nuclear forces of the post Cold War era. I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to consider what Australia can sensibly do in'the international arena to ensure that nuclear conflict never occurs on this planet.",31

32,Mr ALDRED,THE FAMILY,"Deakin) (2.16 p.m.)I move: That, while welcoming the fact that the overwhelming majority of Australians choose to live in intact families, this House: (I) expresses grave concern about the acute social and economic pressures that have brQught about a situation where (a) 40 000 families are expected to become homeless in 1994, (b) 800 000 children live in homes where neither parent is employed, (c) the divorce rate is 40 per cent of the marriages taking place annually, (d) 5072 children aged between 5 and 17 were sexually abused in 1993 and (e) 5479 children aged between 5 and 17 were physically abused in 1993; and (2) calls upon all political parties in this House develop policies that: (a) aim to weld the family together and sustain it throug- adverse circumstances; ""(b) in the, taxation area positively discriminate in favour of the family; lind (c) in the operation of the Family Law Act emphasise reconciliation where possible. The ardoUr with which Australians from all spheres of life-'-all tiers of government, political parties,' community groups, - hurch groups, iQdustry groups, trade unions,even vice-regal personages, and, of course; the inevitable social engineers-have taken' UP' the gauntlet on behalfof the family in this International Year of the Family is in itself proof of the universal realisation of the importance of the 'place of the family in Australian society. ' Thiscnicial family 'role is a fact'which some members in this place, notably some on the coalition benches, have been fully aware of for years. We have also been aware of the fact that, increasingly, goveinmenLpolicies, particularly thos,e of the Labor government over the past decade-although not solely these-have resulted in a gradual and gruesome assault on what has traditionally been the backbone of society. Irefer once again to the millions of families which make, up the bulk of the Australian population. There are those, like Ms Jennie George of the ACTU executive, whowish to believe that 'the family is a relic of the past'. Such 'people say that ollly 15 per cent of the population live in the traditional or rionnal family-a statistic based on families made up of married couples with two children. It does not include couples without children; couples with one child; couples with three, four or more children; couples with grown-up families; bro:"" thers and sisters sharing a home together; couples with children, who share a home with grandparents; or sole parent families. In fact, contrary to the protestations of Ms George and her ilk, 85 per cent of people'in now this country actually live in a family situationThe picket fence is still' the nonn, not the bizarre exception. However, what is happening behind the picket fence is a different matter and in many inst,ances a great cause for to concern. Marriage' breakdown, spiralling divorce rates, the apparent escalation of domestic violence and child abuse, and the increasing number of street kids are some illustrations of society's malaise vividly portrayed in the news media ona daily basis. To be more specific, according to the Salvation Army report of 1993, 40,000 families are expected to become homeless by the end of 1994.' There are 800,000 children living in homes. where neither parent is employed. According to the AostraJian Bureau of Statistics, the divorce rate is now close to 40 per cent of the annual marriage rate. Over 5,000 children aged between Jive and 17 years were sexually ,abused in 1993; Almost 5,500. in that age group were physically abused in that same yt<ar. This is probably a very conservative estimate, because we are dealing only with reported ;cases. Despite the fact that a number of surveys have shown strong support for family values""'-such as the South Australian survey conducted by MCGregor Marketing in May 1993 whi-hshowedthat 78 per cent of the people in that state support a return to traditional family.values-:-families are increasingly under threat. Obviously, judging by the statist:cs quoted previously, it is the children who suffer the most. . Dr Don Edgar, the recently retired Foundation Director of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, believes that children have insufficient time with their parents and that little effort is put into stimulating their first cruciaJ.years of development In an article in the Age of 22 January this year entitled 'Children are losers in modern family life: expert-, he said: People tend to forget that divorce disrupts children and.that divorce produces poverty for women and ch!ldren, .and both of these are very damaging for chIldren In the long term, This is a view shared by the general public. A recent child-care survey commissioned by the Melbourne Herald-Sun, which was published last month on 11 April, established that child care is no substitute for the love and attention of a mother iri the home. More than 80 per cent of respondents criticised formal child. care and many said that it broke the special. bond' that should exist between mother and, child. .' This survey was published at about the same time as similar findings were documented by Ms Helen Leach in her book entitled Children First. Ms Leach maintains that children should be cared for by parents until the age of three. On 18 April, the National Secretary of the Australian Family Association commented: The mother is really best placed to give that one-toone interaction the child requires, but the government still discriJ1linates against mothers who choose to stay at home. The Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, warned on 14 April of the effects of 'an even greater abuse of children brought on by the pressures resulting in the breakdown of the family unit'. He said that Australia had 'totally failed' many of its young people. He found that de facto arrangements where the father was not the natural parent had resulted in the occurrence of sexual abuse of children rising by 600 per cent. He believed that the steep rise of single parent families in Australia to between 400,000 and 500,000 was leading to children being unable to cope, committing suicide and having other associated problems. Mr Burdekin went further to describe as 'a disgrace' the fact that every young male prostitute on The Wall in Darlinghurstwas a ward of the state. Even the Governor of New South Wales, Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair, was reported in the, Herald-Sun of 19 April as voicing his concern on the fate of the average Australian family. He said: In the International Year of the Family, we have no reason to feel complacent about what we have done to the family, with every third marriage failing and alternatives to a conventional family unit-which are less ideal for the raising of children-now widespread and accepted, even encouraged within our society. The vocal minorities referred to by the governor have been dominating political debate in this country for too long, but they would not have such influence without the strong support of government, especially the federal Labor government that has existed over this past decade. This is a disgrace, but an equal disgrace is support given to it by the media and the entertainment industry which, at the same time, have done much to denigrate tradition.al family values which, over the centuries, have been the basis of holding the family together. The average night's television entertainment often comprises far more the bizarre, the seamy, the ugly and the violent than· the wholesome. Sexual depravity is the norm and marital fidelity is non-existent or scorned. In a Herald-Sun article of 26 April entitled 'In teel trouble',' Ronald Conway makes the same point about the film world with his subtitle 'Ordinary people are under siege as Hollywood spins out of control'. Mr Conway refers back to the Hollywood. of yesteryear when 'wholesomeness was not a target of ridicule and patriotism was not a dirty word'; Mr Conway believes that conservative critics such as Michael Medved could be right when they say that the industry seems to have declared war on mainstream suburban life. He said: Traditional families are presented as crawling vicious repressions, terrorists are portrayed as freedom fighters, military commanders as fascists. This comprehensive assault on the integrity of the traditional family is continuing to have devastating effects in Australia and elsewhere. Research by the University of Illinios in an analysis of crime in 171 United States cities showed that the divorce rate was a reliable predictor of the robbery rate. In 1992, Canadian research found that sons often turn to crime when their parents break up. The 20 March 1993 issue of the Economist points to Princeton University research showing that children from broken families are more likely to drop out of school, the girls are more likely to have a premarital birth in their. teens and the boys are more likely to be unemployed. A damning indictment of the effect of the absence of a committed father is contained in a 1992 publication entitled Families without fatherhood by Dennis and Erdos. It says: Physical weight, height, educational achievement, criminality, life and death itself are on average connected with the presence or absence of a committed father. In Western Australia in 1992, statistics from the Longmore Remand and Detention Centre involving 409 young people showed that less than 20 per cent lived with both their parents and 75 per cent did not live with their fathers. The evidence is overwhelming that the traditional family environment is the one which is best suited to the"" rearing of children.· T, therefore, .call on all political parties in this House to promote policies which, in accordance with the. wording of this motion, weld the family together and sustain it through adverse circumstances; in the taxation area positively discriminate in favour of the family; and, in the operation of the Family Law Act,emphasise reconciliation \Yhere possible.",33
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE FAMILY,Mr'Snow)...:-Is there a seconder to the motion? Mr Andrews-I' second the motion and reserve my right to speak.' '. .,35
34,Mr LATHAM,THE FAMILY,"Werriwa) (2.26 p.m.. )This.motion is a good indicator of the confusionfacing the Liberal Party in the 1990s. It is trying to work out whether it iSl;! conservative party ota liberal party in the classical with sense. From this motion the judgment to be made is that it is a .very conservative party, even reactionary. Implicit in the motion is the a assumption that traditional nuclear family is the only family around which government should make policy. The Liberal Party in the 1990s believes in only two families-the nuclear family and the royal family. That is a great problem it has in its' policy making. For people who are not married; who have a wife that works, who have notgol dependent children, who are engaged in a homosexual relationship or who are part of an extended family, they take no part in Liberal Party thought ot· policy. No party can appeal· to a broad range of Australians in the 1990s when it focuses on a minority of Australians. As the honourablememberJorDeakin (Mr Aldred) confirmed, this is a. motion with a white picket fence. This, motion confirms how inadequate the Liberal Party has become in terms of understanding social change and understanding the proper role of government. Government responds to' the choices that individuals make, it backs those choices in and supports them with effective government policy and programs; There is no role in our society for a government to impose on people its image of good family life. That is exactly what this conservative party tries to do. This is an exercise in social engineering. It takes what it regards as a good model of a family and says. that every Australian family should fit the model and if it does not something is wrong. Th- figure-quoted by the honourable member for Deakin are virtually meaningless because the root cause of any problem in our socie-y is social disadva.ntage. If we take any disadvantaged commupity the figures for marriage breakdown will. be higher, as they will for many other sOCial problems. The Liberal Party 'has no understanding of cause and effect. This motion shows that it has no understanding of the way .in which social problems arise and the way in which they can be corrected. Further, the motion does not recognis- the immense diversity of Australian society .and family types in the 1990s. We cannot talk about family values in a meaningful way unless we recognise diversity. The term 'family values'; which is a throwaway line in politics, has become an empty piece of rhetoric. Whatdoes it stand for? The only thing it can stand for is to recognise that family types, structures and individual choices are so (jiverse that we cannot pinpoint one set of values for all people in society and act as the basis of government policy. This motion shows conclusively that we cannot go back to the future. We .cannot go back to an Australia where the majority of families consisted of the nuclea- family structure-the male working, the wife at home, dependent children, the picture of the Queen on the wall, and children singing 'God save the Queen' every morning. Those opposite cannot go back to that because Aqstralia has gone way past that. Austr-lia has moved past,' while the' Liberal Party and its thinking have stayed rooted in the 1950s and 1960s. There is no set formula for families; One need only, look at the figures to understand howfamiHes have changed and evolved through the years. There are three main sources' of change. There are fewer people married and staying married ihaneverbefore. In 1975- for instance, 15 percent of marriages were' preceded by a couple living together. In 1993 tha- figure was 60 per cent-by choice, by individuals making a choice about the lifestyle that best suits their needs and preferParty ences. One-parent families in 1982 comprised 7.75 percent of all family types. That figure in 1992 was nine per cent. The important thing to understand is that one cannot stereotype the one-parent family as being a teenage mum, because teenage mothers comprise only three per cent of one-parent families in Australia. Eighty per cent of one-parent families are people in the age group 25 to 49 who have made a choice to divorce or to break their de facto relationship. It, is their choice to make; it is not for, people in parliament to lecture them about their free individual choices. Births outside marriages have increased from 13.7 per cent in 1982 to 24 percent in 1993. The honourable member for Deakin refers' in his motion and his speech to the divorce rate. He should be congratulating this government if he really believes in what he is saying because divorce in Australia per 1,000 ma.rried population has come down from 12.5 per cent in 1982 to 11.5 per cent in 1993. The divorce rate under this government is down. So if he, believes his rhetoric about family values and the importance of the traditional nuclear family, the motion should congratulate the, government for the fall in th- divorce rate. In truth, the government. can take no credit because it is not the role of government to say to people, 'You shall divorce' or 'You shall not divorce without reconciliation', as implied in the motion. It is not the role of government to make those decisions. Individuals should make those decisions. They are not to be stood over by social engineers. The other change is that more women are working. The labour force participation rate for women has increased from 41 per cent in 1973 to 51 per cent in 1993. Government policy should be framed around that movement, around the preference of women in the 1990s to find work according to their own choice and personal preference. As a proportion of all couples in Australia, the number of partnerships where both partners work has increased from 42 per cent in 1982 to 53 per cent in 1993. One has to recognise also the growing diversity of Australian society. The Liberal is never comfortable with migrants or multiculturalism. The reality, however, is it is more likely for a multicultural community to produce extended families, particularly with some of the southern European and Asian migrants coming to Australia. One also needs to recognise the diversity of Aboriginal family structures and homosexual couples. We know what the Liberal Party thinks about homosexual couples in Tasmanian law. It thinks that states rights are much more important than hum'an rights. When one listens to the honourable member for Deakin one can understand why. ' In my own electorate of Werriwa there are 130,000 people, and 27 per cent or, 35,000, of those people, according to the 1991 census, live in the traditional nuclear family. That not even a third of the people in my electorate fit the criteria and outline set by the honourable member for Deakin in his speech and motion. That is why the motion is flawed. Setting policy around such a small part of our society is inevitably flawed. Government must support the lifestyle choices of individuals. government cannot do that, it lets down the country and those· individuals. I am happy to report that this government has been supporting the choices ofjndividuals and those social trends. Social security policy has given support to sole parents. Additional family payments have been made for low income parents. We have ended the discrimiJ1ation against women through income splitting for social security and the outstanding initiative in the white paper of the parenting allowance. The number of child-care places has increased in support of working parents from 46,000 in 1983 to 237,000 in 1994. That is an increase of 400 per cent, backing in the choices of women to break the models set by the honourable member for Deakin-a model rooted in the 1950s-and to take their rightful place in the work force. Let us look at the measures proposed by the honourable member for Deakin. He is saying that we should weld families together. What about choice? What about the choice of individuals to find their own family structure and to find their own family values instead of fitting the stereotype that is being proposed? He says that we should positively discriminate in the taxation system in favour of nuclear families. In my electorate discriminating in that fashion would mean discriminating against the 73 per cent of people in Werriwa who do not fit the stereotype. It is a bad type of discrimination that discriminates in the minority. The honourable member for Deakin goes on to say in his motion that the Family Law Act should proceed only with reconciliationreconciliation ahead of divorce. What is the role of government? Is the role of government to say to people, 'We know more about your relationship than you do'? If people have made a free, adult choice to divorce, should government come in and say, 'No, go back to is, the drawing board. Spend a few more months together reconciling your differences and come and tell us, the social engineers, what outcome you have arrived at""? That is not the role of government in the 1990s. .The opposition should believe in individual If choice, as a true liberal party in the classical sense would-not a conservative party engineering results in our society. Sensible government policy in the 19908 does not have to demand a situation whereby a couple is happily married, Anglo-Saxon, with 2.3 kids, the wife at home, a white picket fence and a picture of the Queen on the wall. Any organisation-a church, a trade union or a political party-that tries to defy social trends and remodel society in its own image will fail, and it will crumble. ThaUs what we see of the Liberal Party in the 1990s.",35
35,Mr ANDREWS,THE FAMILY,"Menzies) (2.36 p.m.)This year, the International Year of the Family, is an' invaluable opportunity. to address some of the issues facing families in Australia at this particular time. It is quite ironic that this debate has been brought onby the opposition in the debate on private members business. It is the first time this year that the International Year of the Family has been mentioned in this chamber and the first time there· has been any debate on the subject at all. All the raving by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) about what his government is doing about this matter is such that the government is not so proud of it to even bring on a debate, make a ministerial statement or even raise a question in this chamber. What we hear from the honourable member for Werriwais the continuation of the great lie about families in Australia and it indicates the problem of talking about families. The honourable member for Werriwa constructs a straw man which ,he can then strike down by saying that only' 15 per cent of families constitute whatever his traditional family is. That depends on the parameters he sets for the traditional family. If he wants to set parameters which say that only oile parent can be working and that a family has X number of children, they are the parameters he is setting. The reality in this country is that 86 per cent of all families are couple families. If we look at the practice and the aspirations of ordinary Australians, despite all the doom and gloom we have had from sociologists and experts in the past two decades, we see that they are practising normal, conventional family life. Most of them are proud of it and most of them aspire to it. Even when' they fail, they aspire to it again, which can be seen in the large number of people who remarry following divorce. We get this notion that anyone who wants to speak about the conventional family-as if it were something of a relic of the past-is in some way intolerant or' is being prescriptive. We are talking about what is the norm for ordinary Australians-conventional family life-and that is something which some of us are going to stand up and say more about. The statistics quoted by the honourable member do not make sense either. It is certainly the case that more couples live together before going into marriage, but the great majority of them then marry. The honourable member talks about 25 per cent of children being born, out of wedlock as if that is something about which we ought to be proud. The United States, where the figure is now 24 per cent,has had three congressional inquiries over the last three or four years to deal with what Republican and Democrat alike have identified as being the major social problem facing that nation. Yet we have this nonsense from the honourable member for Werriwa, who says, 'It is okay, we do not have to worry about it.' The honourable member quotes the divorce rate as falling from, 12 to 11 per thousand. Where did it start about a decade and a half ago? It was four per thousand. The honourable member can quote statistics saying that we have a great fall from 12 to 11 per thousand. That is a threefold increase over the last decade and a half; so it is hardly anything to be proud of. All the time we are being told that in no way can we define a family and, in no way can, we say that there is anything ideal about ,the family. All we have to look at is the practice of ordinary Australians. Eighty-six per cent of all families are couple families. That is their ideal and that is what they aspire to. It is about time we stood up and said, 'Yes, what you're doing is deserving of encouragement' and not put forward the sort of nonsense we have had from the honourable member for Werriwa. We have had Professor Cass, the chairman of the IYF council, running around this country saying that we cannot define a family and that there is no such thing as an ideal family. This is an interesting notion from Professor Cass because I searched the library for some of her writings and I can quote what Professor Cass once thought was a family in Australia. She stated: There is no great difficulty in defining the family in contemporary, Western, industrialised society: the husband, wife and their children, the ""nuclear core"" living as a separate unit in its own residence. This is what Professor Cass once said about the family, but she now turns around and says that there is no ideal and we cannot talk about what a family might be. If we cannot talk about an ideal or an objective in terms of family policy, then we can have no policy itself because the notion becomes meaningless. Time is limited, unfortunately. There ought to be some hours given to this subject in this place and not just the few minutes which have been given. The reality is that, over the last decade, ordinary families have suffered economically. A decade ago the top one per cent of earners in Australia earned as much as the bottom 11 per cent; whereas now the top one per cent earn as much as the bottom 21 per cent-a doubling in that group made up of the poor. Statistics prepared by Anne Harding at the university here in Canberra indicate that - families with children constitute the poorest group in Australian society. One can go and on and on with the statistics. The reality is that, under the government of thoseopposage ite, ordinary-Australian families became off in the 1980s.",37
36,Mr ADAMS,THE FAMILY,"I am amazed that the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) seems to blame the federal government for marriage breakdown and the dissolution of families. The federal government over the last decade has ensured that social services are geared to help families deal with the many problems of society's changes. Society and its values are quite different from those that existed just after the Second World War. Technology, transport and educaand tion have changed. Even the definition of family has changed. Families are even broader now. At a tiine of immense growth after war many young couples could afford make a home for themselves rather than live with parents, and the definition of a family was seen then as a male, a female and children. The male was the breadwinner and the female the homemaker. Not surprisingly really, many men came home from the war to find work and dispartner, placed many of the women who had carried out those tasks while they were away. range of employment was more limited than it is now. The male would have done his apprenticeship or have started with an emchildren ployer when he was 15 01'16 and then conmothers tinued with that employer all his working life. in 1982 to 5,4 per cent in 1992. There were opportunities to start at the bottom of a company and work one's way up. Public transport was the main transport for most working people and the motor car was _used for recreational purposes. Education was geared for a range of jobs that were available for the young coming out of school or for entry into apprenticeship schemes. How different it is today. The male is longer seen as the breadwinner. Both partners often contribute equally - and there is an expectation that each shares equally in family responsibilities. Work has changed. The hours are shorter, the pay greater, but the security is less. Contract workers no longer have the ability to control how long they stay working on for one person .. It is often left up to the demand and the success of a business. The - of certainty is finished. There are no tariff worse barriers and we have market driven wage increases. Remember \Vhen wages were set on the needs of a family by arbitration? The other side of the House cannot argue for _market economics and deregulation on one hand - and then say these matters do not affect family life or change society. Young people needmore training. Companies no longer want someone to start at the bottom and work up. They want workers who slot _into specialised areas that require off-thejob training. With education .comes information; People are not prepared to accept work home conditions that they have put up a with before. They know things can be better. Couples are more careful about marriage than. the they used to be. They marry when they are to older or they do not marry at all. Australian social trends in 1994, compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, reveal two that between 1982 and 1992 the number of single men getting married fell from 55 per cent per thousand tQ 41 per cent per thousand. People still want to share their lives with a whether they are married or not. The number of de facto cOllples increased by just The under SOper centbetween 1986 and 1991. This study exposes the myth,the belief, that teenage mothers are the prime source of bc;>rn outside marriage. Births from aged under 20 fell from 7.2 per cent . The idea - of marriage has changed, too, along with the concept of the family. Families can be defined as those in a household. There may be no blood relatives or it may mean a mother, grandmother and child. It may mean a father and son or it could mean two single parents getting together to share costs. A family means that there is someone who cares no for you when you need help, to share joy and sorrow and assist you to survive in an ever increasingly changing world, People are more mobile; they travel more and. experience other cultures. Australia is fortunate to have people shortly, the eastern. forests of Victoria from different cultures arriving in this country all the time and. has. benefited greatly from them.",39
37,Mr SPEAKER,THE FAMILY,Order! It being 2.45 p.m;; in accordance with standing order I04A debate is interrupted. The debate is adjourn-d and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monindustry day. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking. when the debate is resumed. NA Families,40
38,Mrs SULLIVAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is important that in this, the International Year of the Family, law-makers. vigorously affirm the preeminent importance of the family in Australia.The family is the foundation of society. Without strong family units there can be no community-without community there is no nation. From the time of the food gatherers, the family unit has been as essential for the survival of the human race as the law of nature has been for the animal kingdom. Governments cannot, nor should they, attempt to take the place of the family. Families tell government What they need. Government does not tell families what is good for them: You cannot build a house from the roof down-it must be built from the foundation up. The society, made up of family units,. is supreme. It dictates the· form of government, the role of government, and determines the limits of its power. The role of government in our society must be to assist and encourage the family with its needs and aspirations-in thosewords of great social· and political inspiration, 'Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' . Timber Industry",40
39,Mr SNOW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the next few weeks a south-east region advisory group will be formed to cover the timber industry. This follows many years of uncertainty in the timber industry, which has culminated in the state and federal governments agreeing on coming together with a plan for the south-east forests of New South Wales and, I believe - This agreement is extremely important because I believe that it covers important environm-ntal concerns as well as the needs of a viable timber industry, an industry which is based on the a sawmill industry but which has, as an . adjunct, the woodchip industry. The reason we have to have the woodchip is that we need to have some way of disposing the offcuts of wood that cannot be used, wood that would otherwise be left to rot or bum. This combination of not only governments but also industry unions and environmental people with environmental views has meant that, following joint scientific studies and other methods, we have come up with an agreement t-at will give us a viable but environmentally sensitive. industry. Secondary Schools: Tax",40
40,Mr HAWKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the last session I drew the attention of this chamber to a kit that has been circulated amongst secondary schools entitled 'Paying tax'. This kit is designed to encourage secondary students to learn all about paying tax before they have learned about earning a living. The other half of this story is that the federal government is now trying to tum teachers at these secondary schools into bounty hunters. The. federal government is offering $3 a head to every teacher who can sign up a student to take on a tax file number. That is right-$3 for each scalp. It sounds incredible-$3 to sign up taxpayers! At the same time, the government never remembers that it ought to be paying some compensation to the poor businesses that have to keep collecting tax. The fact is that taxes are so complicated. For example, it costs more to administer the fringe benefits tax in some sections than the amount of money that is actllaJly collected. Of course, there is no compensation to business. These priorities just highlight what an extraordinary approach the Labor Party has to the whole question of tax. Kits are going into schools telling people how to pay tax. Teach- . ers are being turned into bounty hunters by being offered $3 a head. Yet where does the government talk a:bout how people actually earn a living? The first thing we have to do in life is earn a living before we can pay tax. But the priorities of this government see,Ol to be the other way round ...... people have to pay tax, they have to have tax file ntimbers, and if they, happen to earn a living that is just incidental. (Time expired) Liberal Party of Australia",40
41,Mr HAVILAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was na'tioilalsupport listening with great, interest to the debate about the family a minute ago and some of the points that \\fere made, particularly by honourable member for Werriwa (Mr 1.a- . tham). He made several good points but I noticed a couple in particular. One was about the complete failure of the Liberal Party, abuse. supposedly the party of the rights of the individual and freedom of choice, to allow Australians to make their own choices about the sort of family they live in. The other point he made was that most social problems can be traced very much to social disadvantage. The Liberal Party will never understand that. Even though the Liberal Party riowhas its own political in order, with the very wealthiest born to rule families at the topof the tree, as we saw last week, it cannot be regarded-even more' so now--:as a.legitimate party to run this country because it does not. understand social disadvantage. The born to rule set is very much back, charge in the Liberal Party. They want to tell people how to run their families and how to run their lives., This party needs mote than change in leader to, change policies and change what the party does or does I)ot stand for. In the case of the Liberal Party, it it d()es not stand'for, because it does not to. stand for very much at all at the moment,. apart from continued wealth, privilege and elitism. Life Education MrTAYLOR (Groom)-It is extremely disappointing that, while drug abuse is costing Australians over $14 billion each year, we see further cuts in funding for life education-,from $350;000 in 1992-93 to $200,000 in 1993-94 and to a maximum of $110,000 in 1994-95. Past funding has enabledlif- education'to, support state and territoryorgahisations which are delivering a' drug abuse prevention program to over one million school children each year across the nation and carrying out research into the needs of high school students. ,.Life education is continuirig to cut costs and improve' productivity. However, without the .it previously' enjoyed, its efforts to maintain its research, program development· and vitalmanagemerit' support the will be seriously jeopardised.Life education is the major deliverer to Australia's primary schools of positive health based educational _programs directed at preventing substance In this the International Year of the Family we must strengthen, not weaken, 'our efforts' to combat the forces that are undermining family life. Our children are the nation's future. Surely life education programs' are making a'positive contribution to family life. I hope that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) will reconsider the family latest retrograde budgetary measures. .Hospitals:' Victoria",41
42,Mr CLEELAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Victorian public hospitals,' both metropolitan and rural, arecIose.to breakingpointdueto a continued relentless reduction of their budgets following the introduction of casemix funding. All in Victorian public hospitals have suffered,but some have' been more seriously affected than others. Medical, nursing, paramedical, admin'a istrative and other staff are being pressed to work harder for. less payments. Staff numbers have been reduced often with little regard for is what the persons involved, some of whom have seeQ1 given years of. dedicated service. This has further eroded the morale of the' reiriaining staff. Presently, the managers of Vietoriim public hospitals are at'their. wits' end trying to figure out how to cope with the n,ext rqund of budget cuts. ' . It is widely accepted that Victoria-s public hospitals were"" inefficient 'and overstaffed. However, most of what maybe corrected over a short period has.' already been achieved. Victorian public hospitals need time to make adjustments. Enough is enough, for the time being at least. It is ironic that the panacea of casemix funding is being promoted in other Australian states by the Victorian government as the prospect of collapse of many public hospitals seems real indeed. That is not my view; that is the view of Mr Buntine, the Senior Vice-President of the Australian Association of Surgeons, as reported in today's Australian. Opposition Policies",41
43,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It has been a big week in politics, The dream team, the young Turks, the honourable member for Mayo (¥r Downer) and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr 'Costello), have finally buried the hatchet-some would say. in the doc's back. Funny, is it not? Here we are looking for an opposition to say something radical on the question of deregulation, privatisation, regional economic development and foreign ownership of the media and all we get is the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) telling us that in the interests of individual freedom there ought to be more cigarette advertising around the place, a cigarette led recovery. That is what we are going to have. Where would we be without the redoubtable honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who reckons that foreigners-by this he means the International Labour Organisation-should not dictate laws in Australia. No wonder the ,Liberals cannot win an election. The honourable member for Bennelong would quite happily see our industry and our media owned by foreigners or in the hands of local monopolies, but mention ILO and he squeals about foreign domination. I have a bit of .advice for the Liberal Party: why not announce some real policies, the ones the real Labor stalwarts actually believe in? Why not defend Telecom, Australia Post, Australian National Line and the concept of public enterprise? Instead of whingeing about 'the ILO, why not take control of our financial markets and 'call to heel those pirates who thrive in the deregulated financial market? Task the honourable member for Mayo to please comedown and do something special. Kennett, Mr Jeffrey: Wind Farm",42
44,Mr CHYNOWETH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"For some time now I have been saying a few words about Mr Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett. I do not want to disappoint honourable members so I will say another few words about him. The state government in Victoria has recently cancelled a wind farm, with wind generators, at Lakes Entrance. The reason it gave for doing this was. the high .cost of maintenance. All it has to do is look at Esperance, Western Australia, where these wind turbines have been going for many years, to see that these 'generators have saved many hundreds of thousands of dolhlrs. But not Jeffrey Kennett. He cancelled this wind farm in Victoria. Why? Who knows? Pr()bably because he wanted .to get a. bit of commission from Pacific Power or something like that. He has decimated the Latrobe Valley and has also now taken away the opportunity to reduce the 32,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas produced in Victoria from coal powered generation. Jeffrey Kennett is not only putting hot air into the atmosphere,by his own mouth; he is also adding it from the Latrobe Valley. He is putting more and more carbon dioxide into our air"" upsetting ,the balance of our environment. Why is he doing it? To save a few measly dollars and look after a few of his friends who own the power industry, in Victoria. He should be ashamed of it and should quit straight away. Veterans Affairs",42
45,Mr RICHARD EVANS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,":-On 5 May 1994 I brought to the House the concerns of a number of local constituents regarding the provision of services to veterans in Western Australia., In particular I noted some c;:oncerns over the transfer to private ownership'of the old Hollywood repatriation hospitaL I would like to clarify and correct a number of those statements. . The radiography and pathology units still remain on site at the Hollywood Hospital. The St John of God Hospital has purchased the equipment and operates the pathology unit, leasing space at the hospital. The improvement has been enough to warrant the introduction of a CAT scan unit in the near future. Similarly, the radiology unit has a full complement of staff and is run by Sprague, Cam and Glancy. As a result of the current laws governing ownership and the' operation of pharmacies, the pharmacy is operated on site by the previous chief pharmacist. It is operating effectively and is providing an excellent service to patients. Previous medical records for patients who have visited the hospital in the last four years are kept on site with other records archived for easy access. The cooperation between the RSL, the Hollywood Hospital and the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is welcomed. I would like to give them every possible support and encouragement. It is clear that the new operations of Hollywood Hospital are paving the way for improved and effective care of Australia's veteran community. Students: Legal Rights",42
46,Mr SLIPPER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"A federally funded body is telling Queensland students that they can do as they like and that teachers have no right to discipline them. A know-your-rights kit is about to be distributed to school children by the National Children's and Youth Law Centre, a body set up to promote the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and bankrolled by the Australian taxpayer through the Australian Youth Foundation. While the rights of parents and teachers overlooked, the kit details the legal rights of students in schools. Nothing is said about their responsibilities to society or to fellow members of the school community. Students are advised that teachers have no right to search students or their school bags even in pursuit of drugs-and if they do so, a criminal assault is committed.. Even lockers are immune from search. Students are told how to avoid being arrestappointed ed on drug charges and what to do if they are. In particular, the searches and confiscation section has infuriated the Queensland Teachers Union. Teachers have said that they will continue to discipline unruly and disruptive students and work to keep schools as safe environments. The union is claiming that teachers have every right to temporarily take objects from students to prevent classroom disruptions. Teachers are already struggling to maintain discipline in schools. The state education minister is understandably concerned about the distribution of the kit. Sure there is nothing wrong with students and all people· knowing their rights, but they should also be made aware of their responsibilities. This misguided project .is a gross misuse of taxpayers' money and must be stopped immediately in the .interests of students, teachers and society. Electoral",43

51,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES," I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Wednesday, 18 May 1994, of Sir John Oscar Cramer, Minister for the Army from ,1956 to 1963 and Mt<mber of the House of Representatives for Bennelong from ,1949 to 1974, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profoun'd sympathy to his family in their bereavement John Oscar Cramer was bomon 18 February 1896 at Gaspard, Quirindi in New South Wales. One of six children, he was educated at the local Gaspard Public School. After leaving school at the age of 14, Sir John worked on thefamily farm and then managed a small family owned fruit shop in Quirindi. Monday, 30 May 1994 REPRESENTATIVES In 1917 Sir John moved to Sydney; where he was offered work with Paramount Pictures Film Exchange: In 1920 Sir John and his brothers, Charles and Roy, set up a small real estate business on the North Shore in Sydney. Those who knew him knew that he retained his interests in this business well into his retirement. Prior to entering federal politics, Sir John was actively involved in local government, holding significant positions including Chairman of the Sydney County Council and Mayor of North Sydney. Sir John is recognised as one of the coin founders of the Liberal Party. He was heavily involved in the push for the establishment of levels of government. a Commonwealth-wide party and, while his efforts earned him as many enemies as it did friends, they were rewarded in 1944 when Robert Menzies launched the Liberal Party of Australia. At the age of 53, Sir John sought and won pre-selection for the federal seat of Bennelong and was voted into office in the 1949 federal election. He professed to being an incurable addict in relation to public matters and gained immense personal satisfaction from public life. Although there were many things about parliamentary. life which frustrated him, he felt greatly privileged to work with men and women who in his opinion were imbued with an inner spirit of service to their fellows. Following the federal election of 1955, Sir Robert Menzies appointed Sir John to his ministry· as Minister for the Army; He retained that portfolio until 1963 when he chose, at the age of 67, to return to the backbench. From 1 March 1950, Sir John served as a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works and chaired the committee from 1954 to 1955. He also served as a member on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1970 to 1972. He led an Australparticularly Ian delegation to the 14th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in the Bahamas in 1968 and was an observer at the South Pacific Conference in Fiji in 1970. In the Queen's Birthday honours list in 1964, he was knighted in recognition of his long and valuable service in the interests his country. His political career continued 919 until he retired from parliament in 1974 at the age of 78. . Sir John's life was not without personal tragedy. He was predeceased by his son, John, who died in 1964, and his wife, Mary,who died in 1984. In the true form of his generation, which lived through some of Australia's toughest. years encompassing World. War. I, the Great Depression, World War II and the period of postwar reconstruction from 1945 to 1950, Sir John served his country welL He will be remembered for his unceasing efforts public service and for the political contribution he made at both the federal and local . Few members in the House are contemporaries of Sir John Cramer. I happen to be one Sir of them. I got to know him quite well. We used to share parliamentary offices in Sydney. In those days, we used to alI go to the Commonwealth Bank cafeteria for our meals. He would hold court most days and give stories of federal politics and personalities. For anyone who has not been here, things were different before 1975. They changed in atmosphere substantially. after that time. Before then, there was a substantial degree of fraternisation amongst members. None have brought me more pleasure than the conversations I had with Sir John Cramer. He was a very decent individual and a very nice man. Everyone who knew him liked him. On behalf of the government, I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in its bereavement.",46
52,Mr DOWNER,CONDOLENCES,"The opposition wholeheartedly supports this motion of condolence for Sir John Cramer. Sir John Cramer's record of community service and his work for the political values in which he believed left an indelible mark of achievement on his fellow Australians. His passing will be mourned, by those he loved, but also by all those in whose service he worked so hard and for so long. Members of his family, to which he was utterly devoted, will feel his loss above all. In .sending them our sympathy, we know that they will be sustained and comforted by of the knowledge that, for Sir John, they were always the centrepiece of his life and that they provided him with the real motivation and support for his lifetime of achievement in commercial and public life. Many others will mourn Sir John's death. They include his many business associates,all those who benefited from his work .in ·so many community organisations, all those he represented for so long in the federal electorate of Bennelong and many others who were grateful for what this great Australian did for his local community and 'his country. Today I want to focus on what the passing of Sir John Cramer means to my party, the Liberal Party, and why his life and work are so inseparable from our party, whose founding owes so much to him. John Cramer and his family were an example of what hard work and dedication to duty could achieve in a land of opportunity. They were part of a true pioneering spirit of old Australia which built the strong foundations on which so much has subsequently been achieved. John Cramer's record of service to the Liberal Party is a record of how the party began, how it attracted people of drive and talent, appeal grew and how it became the dominant political force in postwar Australia. John Cramer's career was living testimony to the Liberal commitment to'duty, family, individual worth, initiative, freedom and social obligation-all values which were a driving force in Sir John Cramer's life. John Cramer typified many of the people who actively supported the United Australia Party in the 1930s and early 1940s and who played a central role in the founding and growth of the Liberal Party. John Cramer w.as a person who placed a high importance on public duty. He· was a pers-)fl who had achieved personal success through his own hard work, who overcame many difficulties and who had a great love for his country. He was a person who believed that Australia's success had been built on private enterprise and individual freedom and who wanted to ensure that those principles . were always advanced. He was a person who totally rejected the notion of socialism in Australia, which the Labor Party at the time strongly advocated and which he saw as a fundamental threat to Australian democracy. John 'Cramer was also a person with a very clear view about the social and moral values which he saw as fundamental to Australia's past successes and essential if Australia was to realise its full potential in an economic as well as a social sense. For him, an unshakeab.le .commitment to family life, ""Ioyalty to pnnclples and a strong moral code were the foundations ofastrong and secure Australia. John Cramer and so many of his generation were inspired by these beliefs and values. As such, they were drawn to the liberal-conservative. tradition of Australian politics. John Cramer was a.man who was never content with stereotyping. He was. a man whose achievements in life reflected his own family background and his own drive to succeed. His grandfatber came to Australia from Gennany and, with very little to support him, toiled hard in rural New South Wales to build a better life for his family. In his memoirs, John Cramer describes his own childhood on his father's farm near Quirindi as very poor in tenns of money but rich in tenns how its of happiness and family life. John Cramer and his family were also strongly and proudly Catholic at a sectarian time i!l our history when being so had its costs. It was from this background that John Cramer Came to Sydney in 1916 with ,(4 in his pocket and hope in his heart. He decided with his brothers, to establish-from scratch ---;-a real estate business in the northern suburbs of Sydney. In doing so, he experienced all the highs and lows of struggling to establish a small business; His courage, detennination, integrity and business acumen guaranteed the success of bisventure. To a record of growing business successes in the real estate and building industries, John Cramer added an expanding involvement in political and community life."" In the 19308 and 1940s he became the Mayor of North Sydney and, l-ter, Chairman of the Sydney County CouncIl. In both offices he achieved great advances in community service and grt-at support and recognition for the role of Australia's service personnel. . John Cramer had a long and active involvement in the United Australia Party in the 1930s. He became one of the very early advocates of the need for a nationwide party in the liberal conservative tradition the UAP. He became convinced that such a vision would only be realised if UAP figures in New South Wales took the initiative. On most Thursdays throughout 1943, John Cramer gathered with those who shared his vision in the Blue Room Cafe in Rowe Street, Sydney, to discuss how a new nationalparty to oppose Labor could be formed. Withstanding th- pressure from UAP diecountry, hards in other parts of Australia and. the manoeuvring from other groups, such as the Commonwealth Party and the Liberal Demorealised. cratic :party, John Cramer and his colleagues worked tirelessly to convince the New South Wales branch of the UAP of the need to change, and ultimately succeeded. That success led to the founding of the Democratic Party at the 1944 state election in New South Wales and ensured that subsequently a ine nationwide party in the liberal tive tradition was both necessary and inevitable. It was Robert Menzies who galvanised this new political mood, who brilliantly outmanoeuvred' Labor in the late 1940s, and who proved a .leader of unmatched skill durability in Australia 's ppliti-al history. In terms of creating the momentum for the founding of the Liberal Party, it was a small group of visionaries in New South Wales who were of critical importance and the work of John Cramer within that group was absolutely vital. John Cramer became an early member of the Federal Council of the Liberal Party. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, he won the seat of Bennelong when the Menzies government was swept to office iil the famous 1949 election and he held that seat continuously until he retired in 1974 at the age of 78. He served as the Minister for the Army from 1956 until 1963 and helped to forge a wide range of regional defence associations which have been built on in the decade since. Johti Cramer was an integral part of a coalition government which rebuilt the foundations of postwar Australia and provided good and stable government for many years. But his legacy to the Liberal Party. lies in much more than the high offices that he held and the length of service that he gave. His true legacy lies in who he was and the vision to replace that inspired him. We in the Liberal Party deeply regret that Sir John Cramer will not be with us later this year for our 50th anniversary celebrations. His personal qualities and values, as well as his own achievements and commitments to the wider community, epitomise what our party stands for. At a difficult time in the history of Liberal and conservative politics in this it was John Cramer who had a bold vision of what we .neededand the courage and determination to help ensure that vision was He was a man who knew and overcame much prejudice in his life. He treated others on the"" very 'Christian basis of what they believed and how they act-d-not what school they went to, what formal education they had or what religion they belonged to. He expected others to treat him the same, and genuhis success in business, community and conservapolitical life was on that basis. Sir John Cramer has an honoured place in the history of the Liberal Party. He also· has an honoured place in the hearts of many Australians, particularly those in his local and community whom he served in so many capacities. John Cramer belonged to a generation that saw a special honour i.n public duty and community service, and his achievements in both will benefit Australians for generations to come. Withhis passing, the Liberal Party has lost one of its founding stalwarts and the Australian community has lost a man who did so much to improve it. I commend this motion to the House.",47
53,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"It is a privilege to rise in support of this motion of condolence for the late Sir John Cramer. I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) in that regard. As the Prime Minister pointed out, Sir John Cramer was born last century on a farm in the Quirindidistrict. His life spanned some 98 years of remarkable change. The Australia of 1994 is a very different place from the Australia of 1896. For example, in place of the once a week mail delivery in Quirindi, we now have faxes, mobile phones, radio, television and a twice a week mail delivery. There are some things·· that.· will never change and, in particular, certain· aspects of Sir John's farm upbringing will endure forever. In his a.utobiographyentitled Pioneers, Politics and People, Sir John reflected on both the fond and funny memories· and the hardships of thoSe early years on the land. He said that he would never forget: . . . the periodic droughts, the need to cart water keep stock alive ,and for domestic purposes, the ravages of grasShoppers, butterflies and insects, and the plagues of locusts and mice. Then there was damage by rabbits, the slidden hailstorms and the heavy, biting frosts . . . Indeed, it is a sad irony that on this very day, as we speak in support of this condolence motion for Sir John Cramer, there are too many farmers across the southern .half of Australia facing those rigours which are once again due to the severity of a savage drought. While the challenges may have shifted slightly, there can be no doubt that a farm upbringing teaches you about the very essence of life-the hardships; the joys and the ups and downs it brings. On the lighter side, Sir John recalled his father's interest in racing dogs and, in particular, his champion dog with a rather politically incorrect name. I will not tell members of the House its name. They can look it up. He recalls how the district carnival races in those days used live hares and even cats as lures for the dogs. They would take a dog a quarter of a mile down the paddock and would then release a cat about 100 yards from the nearest protective shed. The result may have been bloody to see. In the early 1990s Sir John developed his conservative political leanings. He developed his confrontationist style at school and later in parliament, and often observers compared it with that of a bull at odds with a gate. His country upbringing gave him an understanding and close friendship with members of the then Country Party and particularly with people like Sir Arthur Fadden. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, in 1916 John Cramer moved to Sydney and began to pursue his interests in real estate, Paramount Pictures and other business. .With the onset of the Great Depression and its devastating. effect on people1s lives,! Sir John began to consider political solutions to Australians' problems. ,After a period as Mayor of North Sydney; Sir John, as one of a group, including Sir Robert Menzies, moved from the United Australia Party, the group holding a special conference in Canberra. The delegates then assembled in Albury, in the to electorate of· Farrer, in December '1944 to approve unanimously the decision - to form a new Australi-n parti---and so it was that the Liberal Party of Australia was born. A good illustration of Sir lohn 's tenacity is that at a branch meeting in Bennelong in his electorate he was asked,' Mr Cramer, do you owe your allegiance to the Pope 'or to the King?' The question was disallowed, but Sir John jumped to his feet saying that he wanted to answer it anyhow. In his reply he said. that it was an insult to be asked such a question as he was a .loyal citizen of Australia and as a Catholic he thought it was not anyone's business but his own and it had nothing to do with the Liberal Party or with politics; His answer was greetedwith ·applause:Thankfully this question .would not be asked today, reflecting how things have changed. We can well do without this kind of sectarian politics and prejudging of people on their upbringing and background. Heorice tried to explain to an'outsider what it was like to be in parliament. He told that person to imagine that there was a fellow with a machine-gun behind every bush and that one had to steer oneself through this hazard to make .progress in parliament. That is possibly about right. Sir John was critical of parliament and believed thMthere was much room for improvement However, he quickly pointed out that he also held the Australian system of government in very high regard. He thought the great weakness in a human being was the desire to pass the buck. He once said that everyone wanted to blame the .other fellow. He made that point in respect of governments, politicians, bosses,unions, workers, companies, the press and even husbands and wives. IRclosing; I draw. the attention of the HoUse to the 'last page of comments Sir John made in his autobiography. He said: Allhurrian beings 'should feel responsible for themselves, for their actions, for their decisions. They should also, be ,entitled to the benefit of own effort, and their, right to justice under the law of the land. The complete human being must also have c0111P-­ sion for his fellow man and get great happiness out of the spirit of giving rather than receiving. The world would be a wonderful place if only everyone lived by the code of faith, hope and charity. To the members of the Cramer family, I extend my sympathy on behalf of the members of the National Party. I support the comments of the Pritne Minister ,and ,the Leader of, the Opposition, aQd 1 !Salute Sir John Cramer's contribution to his party and to our gn-at country.",49
54,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"l would like to join the Prime Minister(Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia(Mr Tim Fischer) in this condolence to John Oscar Cramer, the first member for Bennelong beThat tween 1949 and 1974- To live to the age ,of 98, no matter what your politics, your relibelonged gion, your nationality; is a remarkable achievement. He pr-ated' the Commonwealth of Australia. There were'three great influences in his life: his family, hjs strong Catholic and his highly successful business activities. He was different from many parliamenta1949. rians now in that he entered parliament as a breed. remarkably successful businessman., He retained his business pursuits throughout whole time he was in parliament, and at the age of78 when he. left parliament he returned to those business pursuits with great gusto. was a very good. local politician.

He was very much one of the formative influenBennelong, ces on business, and small business developthe mentin particular,.on the lower North Shore. The Leader of the Opposition has already documented the contribution that John Cramer made to the formation of the Liberal Party. He held the seat of Bennelong with one near fright in 1961, when Harry Jensen ran him to within 300 votes in the credit squeeze election when ArthurCalwell was Leader of the Labor their Party. Apart from that he 'held the seat very comfortably through that 24-year period. I ' found him a person possessed of a very robust sense of humour. It was once said of him that when he was Minister'for the Army and was reviewing a passing-out parade on' a large parade grourid he turned and said, 'General, this would make a remarkably good subdivision.' He was a person who preserved his interest in real estate matters and in small business throughout the whole of the time that he spent in politics. , He was in a sense a person who came before .the age of career parliamentarians, although he himself had a very long parliamentary career. He followed the path that is not followed quite so. frequently now of people who have, a long tutelage in local government or semi-government instrumentalities and then go into federal parliament. seems to be more of a rarity these days than it was in the 1940s and the 1950s.

Those who attended the mass for him at St Marys in North Sydney represented the entire spectrum of Australian He politics. It was appropriate that two of the mourners at his funeral were the former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and Lady the Sonia MCMahon, the widow of the former He Liberal Prime Minister Sir William McMahon, of whom Sir John Cramer was a very close friend. On behalf of the electorate of I record my gratitude and that of people' of Bennelong for his long and 'dedicated and committed service to the people of Bennelong. We send our sympathy to his family. We celebrate a remarkably long, and robust life and express our great admiration for the contribution that he made to those values that he held dear and to the people of Australia.",51
55,Mr DOBIE,CONDOLENCES,":-As one of the few remaining members of the federal parliament who sat in the federal parliament with Sir John Cramer-I believe there are only four of us here now, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-it was my. privilege to represent the current Leader of the Liberal Party, the Leader of - he Opposition (Mr Downer), at the funeral on May 24. As I said to the family on the day-they too were quite amused-I was one of the earliest people on this side of , the House to hear from the Leader on Sir John Cramer's funeral day. But we did not say anything to anybody else who was there. Sir John Cramer was one of the founders of the Liberal Party who will go down in Australian history as a great man, not only as the member for Bennelong, but for the total public spiritedness and real activity of his 98 years. The present member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who has himself celebrated his 20th anniversary in this place, gave an outstanding eulogy to Sir John. It merely remains for me to pay tribute to the great impression he made on me-and he certainly did. His son ErIe has had a medical practice in my electorate for many years and still lives down there. I have maintained a family connection over a very long period. I do not plan to repeat what has been said about Sir John already in this tribute, but I must say, as I said to the. family on the day, that I have been heartened by the fact that Sir John was 78 years old when he retired from his very active life as the member for Bennelong. The fact certainly gives me great hope and a certain further ambition. But I must correct one difference I have with the Leader of .the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer): for 78 of Sir John's 98 years he was interested in dealing in land, not farming it. I think that should be recorded Sir John Cramer taught me the precision of punctuality. His family,' grandchildren and great grandchildren will understand when I say that when we shared taxis for years from the hotel to the airport-we had to' share in those days.,-he would reprimand me every time. I was 10 seconds late. However, he was a much greater man than such trivialities. When one thinks of Sir John, one thinks of his dearly beloved .and tremendously supportive wife, Dame Mary Cramer, who died some years ago after 62 tlz' years of what had been a vety fulfilling life together. Those of us who were at the funeral thought as much of her that day as we thollght of Sir John. He would have been just as pl.eased with that. ' Tribute has been paid to Sir John being an active Catholic. When asked, he used to say that he was an active Christian. He was very proud of his Catholic Church but he was also very proud of being .a Christian- On his funeral day, his Cathol,ic priest said-I also make the point-that Sir John was the grandson of a Scottish Presbyterian grandmother. I give my conqolences to all members of his family and thank them for the wonderful life he gave not just to North Sydney but to the whole of Australia and to many people not connected with the Liberal Party. I pay condolences and tributes.. . '",52
56,Mr CONNOLLY,CONDOLENCES,"l too am one of that sQ1a)) band of people who h!ld the honour to have association over some years with Sir John Cramer.. He was. in every se.nse of the term a big man. He was abig man in the political sense and certainly in .terms of his community involvement. In the Sydney City Council' he set a standard for borrowing funds overseas, which I thirik would be to the credit of any Treasurer in the Australian parliament at present. He did outstanding work as Mayor of North Sydney Council and also as the federal member for BenneJong. On page 222 of his biography, which happens to be the last page, he made the point which I think was emphasised .very '. clearly· by other speakers here today: ' The complete human being must also have compassion' for his .fellowman and 'get great happiness out of a spirit of giving rather than in this tribute. receiving. Throughout his life Sir John Cramer set an example of community, spirit. He set an example of what the individual could do for the community in the wider sense of the word. It is interesting in that context to note that he claimed·· that throughout his life, especially his public. life, he had carried crosses. The first was his real estate occupation, the second was. his Gennan ancestry and the fhird was his(::atholic faith. It must be remerilberedthaf.he was in public life throughout the period Qf the· GTt-at War, as well as the Second World War. Consequently, we can see the difficulties he would have had at .. that particular· time, . having .a Gennan n.ame. Reference to his Catholic faith has already been well documented by my colleagues. It is also true that during the 1930s through to the 1950s, Australian politics was unduly affected by sectarian divisions. Just as the Australian Labor Party clearly had a substantial number of Catholics within. its midst, it also followed that in the conservative parties non-Catholics made up the majority. Nevertheless, Sir John was the first to break that mould. Others followed him to the extent that today, the Liberal Party is truly a· universal party which covers people of ali faiths. It is also worth noting that Sir John referred to the need to have a national conservative party, though. based in the Burkean .liberal tradition, which would bring within. itself all components of the Australian community. For example, I am sure he would have taken great pleasure to know that hi his oWIlstateofNew South Wales we have in Helen Shan-Ho an Australian-Chinese member of parliamentthe firstfor this n.ation;. I hope we will see future years a greater expansion of the coverage of 'the various ethnic communities within this parliament so that the Liberal Party can be the inclusive party which Sir John played such a substantial role in creating in the years between 1941 and 1944. , 1 send my sympathy to his family. I think I should finalise my remarks by making the point that, a few days before his death, an ABC television crew in-erYiewed Sir John ov-r a number of hours to take on record the substantial contribution he made to the creation of the Liberal Party of Australia. That will be his testament to this great year, the 50th anniversary of the party. Mr .MACK ·(North Sydney)-Irise to support this. condolence motion. Sir John Cramer represented many thousands of resithree dents of my electorate on the lower north shore over the years, He was probably the most· dominant figure of the lower North Shore for most of the 20th century. That is not an exaggeration. He was an aldennan of the North Sydney Council for 10 years, councillor· of the Sydney County Council for 14 years and the federal member for Bennelong for 25 years, fighting his way through 10 very controversial elections. On two occasions it was very close: the election in 1961, which the honourable member for Bennelong has mentioned, and again in 1972. He also ran a very successful. but very controversial real estate agency in the area for nearly 60 years. He had few setbacks although, as he pointed out himself, the three crosses he had. to bear, I think, caused problems for him in local government. In 1941 he lost office after 10 years in the North Sydney Council. I think it was because of prejudice to his ancestry and the very great sectarianism that existed at that time. He wasalways a prominent figure, both here and locally. He was a physical giant and, for many who did not know him, he had a stentorian voice and he gave forth many forthright and controversial views. When the Whitlam government was elected in 1972, he said: We are now living in Australia under a communist umbrella. He also said in the same speech-and I think in many in the coalition might still agree with this: No-one can deny that all the cranks, odd-bods, drug addicts, homosexuals, abortionists, pornographers, women's Iiberationists and all the demonstrators in the World were brought together to get Labor into power. But, on the other hand, many in the government ranks would agree with his very forthright views on growth and development, particularly of natural resources. He was a very strong ,. supporter of Arthur Calwell's immigration policies and the call to 'populate or perish'. He was a great orator right through to his nineties and gave many great speeches locally. I remember recently at the North Sydney olympic pool on its 50th anniversary he welcomed everyone to the pool pointing out that· he was the owner because of the 25 names on the opening plaque he was the orily one still alive, He still made the front pages of the local papers on regular occasions right up to the last few months. In the public arena, he was confrontational in the extreme, but personally he was a gentleman. While he gave me many lectures on my misdeeds at local, state and federal level, privately .he was extremely helpful. I think he has left many legacies for the people of the area. His politiseven cal views were certainly unambiguous and .consistent, u11like those of lived with a very clear sense of personal and political. values and had a life of amazing longevity and achievement, which is, something to which we can all aspire.

76,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"which includes the direct payments. I will give an indication of some of the real increases in direct payments over the period March. 1993 to March 1994. The following real increases were achieved: 15 per cent real to single age pensioners;57 per cent real to single unemployed people renting; 31 per cent real to sole parents with two children renting; n'early 80 per cent real in additional family payment for children tinder 13 years; and 153 per cent for teenage children. Asttidy published two weeks agoby Ann Harding, which takes account of income support, found that 'due to government policy there had been a marked improvement in the real incomes of the poorest Australians'. 'Need I say that the measures I announced in the white paper this month will build on those achiev-ments by reducing unemployment, removmg poverty traps and introducing the parenting allowance, which will mean that 120,000 low income families will receive on average an extra $59 a week. When one looks at the impact of the changes in the tax, system and the social security system and the· transfer of payments, system, one sees that the picture in relation to the people who are in the lowest deciles of income in this country was dramatically , improved. As I said earlier, householddisposable income has risen every year the government has been in office because more people in households are in work. I conclude by making the following point. The question comes from the Leader of the Opposition, whose policy is to have no underpinning of award payments and conditions in this country. He would have a free:' fall of wages, particularly seeing to beat-tip on people on $360 and $370 a week. It is a shame that the Liberal Party has always supported these policies,· but it is a double .. ,, shame, in still supporting them, asking a question without any integrity. , D-day Commemoration",55
77,Mr FITZGIBBON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime ' Minister advise the House of the reasons for his attendance at the D-day commemorations in Europe?,55
78,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I am pleased to be attending early next week ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, D-day.",56

82,The D,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"day landings were a dramatic at'tempt to gain a foothold on continental Europe from which Nazi Germany could be driven back and it is one of the best examples ever of successful international cooperation. It was primarily a United Kingdom-United States operation and most of the troops participating in the landings were from the United Kingdom, the United States and from Canada, but Australia also made a noteworthy contribution. All told, an estimated 2,600 Australian servicemen actually took part in the landings or the related air and sea operations. Australia's main contribution was through the RAAF, which had several squadrons under the empire air training scheme and which operated in effect as Australian squadrons. As many as 2,100 RAAF .aircrews were involved. Probably around 500 navy personnel were among those embarked on ships associated with the famous .channel crossing. Some commanded some of the small vessels which typified the D-day landings and became such a powerful symbol of the struggle against Nazi occupied Europe. A small number of Australian army troops also took part. Australians today probably cannot imagine the odds that these young men faced as they went into the battle against an enemy deeply dug in and solidly prepared against attack. Losses were high in the early days of the invasion and ground was won only after bitter fighting. Many of the Australians were subsequently recognised for the great gallantry and courage they displa Australia also made a substantial contribution to the.war effort in Europe, again !)uffering enormous losses. More than 6,000 Australians lost their lives in the battle in Europe World War II. Among those 6,000, 3,486 died while serving in Bomber Command-a casualty rate as high as that experienced by Australian soldiers on the Western Front in the First World War. I recently received Ii letter from Rollo Kingsford-Smith DSO, AM, DFC, who was Commander of the 463 RAAF Lancaster squadron. Mr Kingsford-Smith believes that these Australian airmen have not received due recognition for their sacrifice, and I hope that during my visit I will be able to go some way toward rectifying this matter. It is worth quoting a word or two from the letter: In the terrible winter of 1943-44, the average command loss rate on each raid was 5.1 per cent and the first tour of operations was 30 trips-few survived. Young inexperienced crews coming into my squadron knew their· death was almost certain yet their morale was always high and they fought the Germans and the weather with equal determination. Other Australian squadrons and Australians in RAF squadrons would all tell a similar story. During my trip I will take the opportunity to pay tribute to the sacrifices made by Australia '.s service personnel both on D-day and in the European theatre of the Second World War. I. will take the opportunity to visit the air forces memorial at Runnymede, not far from London, where I will also recognise the outstanding contribution of all our personnel in Europe. In Normandy I· will visit a new memorial for the pilots who fought so bravely against such odds during the battle of Normandy itself. During my visit I will be joined by four veterans of· the European operations. Other Australian veterans will be travelling separately to the commemorations. I am sure all members of the House and all Australians will join me in expressing. our thanks to them, to the thousands of other Australians who served with such courage and distinction in that 'great battle; and to their families and the families of those who died. tJn-mploymtmt",56

The then coalition government come to order. had appalling rates of economic growth and appalling rates of employment growth because it could not manage inflation and itcould not manage the economy. I have said often in this House, and I will, repeat it, that when this government took office in 1983 relief-not a sense ofdefeatbuHhe sense of relief-on the face of coalition ministers that the problem had' been passed to somebody else was palpable: As a consequence, we saw the fastest rate of employment gr()wth .in the OECD' in and Australia between 1983 and 1990. We often Fightback hear members opposite talking about New Zealand. 1I have made'the point in this House before, and I will make it again: until recently there were more people in work in New Zealand than there were in 1983. Until about nine months ago there were fewer people in work in New· Zealand than there were in 1983, and in this country there were 26 per cent more people .in work.

Native Title Land Fund",58
97,Mr DODD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Has the Prime Minister seen .Every reports that the .policy of establishing national Aboriginal' land fund is wrong and should be rejected? Will the government proceeding with the land fund?,58
98,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The government. will proceed with the land fund. It will do so for the .simple reason that, though the Mabo decision of the High Court and the subsequent passage of. the Native Title Bill .introduced great measures of justice to the opportunities of Aboriginal Australians to reclaim their hind, anyone who is even a moderate ,student of Australian history·will know that the nature of Aboriginal dispossession was such that those who were dispossessed of their land will not have the opportunity to claim the opportunities under the native title legislation. That is, having been dispossessed of it, they cannot make the traditional connection which is required under the legislation. It was for this reason that the government said it would introduce a land fund. Tha,tis, it would establish a revolving fund, funded by the budget,the aims of which, over time and with the current appropriations, would go to line land acquisition and land· management so as to advantage those who were dispossessed of land. and not able to claim any opportunity under the native title legislation. I was very pleased to read in the Australian that the shadow spokesperson for Aboriginal affairs supports the formation of a national land acquisition fund to provide land and housing for dispossessed Aboriginals. I also remind the House that in the Aboriginal Land Fund Bill 1974 the first supporting speaker on the then government side was Mi' Hyde, the then member for Moore. He was supported by the then Deputy Leader of the National Party, the then honourable member for Gwydir. In the article in the Australian; the shadow spokesperson said: As Aborigines were dispo-ed hundreds of years ago, I support the establishment of a national land fund in principle. The article continues: She also said she looked forward to a more bipartisan approach. to Aboriginal affairs with a major focus on health; change of leadership in any party gives a the opportunity. to freshen up attitudes and change positions. I thought the honourable be member for Hindmarsh being appointed to this position would give the opportunity to the opposition to rethink its position on the land fund. Quick as a flash the Leader of the Oppositionrebuked the shadowspokespersonfor her view.. As a consequence, she was rebuked for her perfectly reasonable .view. And the honourable member for Mackellar, for a perfectly unreasonable view, was twi-e hit with a feather and twice told to behave. One has to ask: what is the basis of objection to the land fund?· Is ita fiscal objection? It cannot be that, because the government only appropriates on the outlays· that are actually expended· on land acquisition and management. The rest is in··the revolving fund. So it cannot be a fiscal objection. If it is not a fiscal objection, what then is the objection? The opposition knows that Aboriginal people, having been dispossessed, cannot avail themselves of the native title legislation. What is the objection? The objection must be that it does not want to extend the opportunity of dispossessed Aboriginal people to purchase and occupy land. . The Leader of the Opposition has been talking about inclusion. I. thought he would . have taken· at least the opportunity provided by his· shadow spokesperson to take a new, principled stand.",58
99,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,A fresh start!,59
100,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,",A fresh start. It would be a fresh start for Aboriginal Australians rather than a fresh start for the Liberal Party; When I say a fresh start for the Liberal Party, I mean picking up on the history of the Liberal Party, which has supported similar measures in the past. So the Liberal Party position bode.s ill for the whole notion of inclusion. The first Australians-Aboriginal Australians; that category of Aboriginal and Islander Australians-long dispossessed of their land, unable to access it via Mabo, who can avail themselves of the government's land fund proposal and initiative. There would have been an opportunity on an inclusive, bipartisan basis to repair some of the ills of the so-called day of shame articulated by the former Leader of the Opposition. That opportunity was not taken, and I regret it very much. Budget 1994-95",59
101,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"lrefer the Prime Minister to comments made at the end of last week by Mr Don Mercer, the chief executive of the ANZ Bank, who described the budgetary settings as ones that put 'Australia back on the path to boom and bust' and that the budget was 'too little, too late'. Is his budget a recipe for yet another boom-bust cycle? Is the chief executive of the ANZ Ban1< more likely to tell the truth about the budget than government ministers? . a",59
102,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"What heavyweight question! Let me give the Leader of the Opposition a. broad view of the corporate response to· the government's budget. Firstly, the Housing Industry Association, not a known supporter of the government, has said it was 'Good budget news for housing': The prospect of strong employment growth with low inflation is good news for home buyers and the housing industry. . The Master Builders Assoc:iation put out a press release which states: Master BUIlders Association (MBA) welcomes the 1994-95 Budget. It went on to say: The 1994-95 Budget places the building and construction industry in a sound position to contribute to the reinvestment of Australia's infrastructure. I note in passing that we have just seen an increase in non-residential construction, which again indicates that that sector is strengthening. The Master Builders Association view is being corroborated in the outcome of those statistics. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, again not a supporting body of this government, has said: This is a very different approach from the past whiCh will do much to build busin-s confidence. It also said some other things that were not so complimentary. The A-stralian Mining Indus'try Council said in its press release: . Thumbs up for the Budget. The. federal government has brought down a Budget which did not jeopardise the growth and expansion of the economy. Mr Costello---,He is the ACTO legal officer;",59

114,Mr BRERETON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"-..:.It is in the face orthat campaign that I reitefate that the federal government, in contrast with .all of you opposite, in contrast with your cohorts in the state governments of ViCtoria and Tasmania, remains fundamentally .committed to proper protection for those who have been unfairly dismissed. The same cannot be said for the honourable member for Bennelong, who as late as a few days ago was talking of these new dismissal protection provisions needing to be suspended-the whole lot of the protections swept away; that was his plan. In other words, he would allow employers to sack workers with impunity. Under the IR reform act, the basis of our federal unfair dismissal protection is ILO convention 158. As I announced earlier today, the operation of the convention in Australia, and therefore the federal unfair dismissal procedures, will be amended to cap compensation for award employees to six months salary or $30,000 for non-award. employees earning less than $60,000 per annum. We will also be modifying the oims of proof in unfair dismissal cases to. ensure that it. is shared between employers and the dismissed employees. These amendments are aimed squarely at giving employers. the confidence to take on new employees as therecovery gains momentum. Finally, those opposite are presented with a real challenge. They can either support these unfair dismissal protections-the ones that are similar to those that exist in the majority of states-or today they can side with Victoria and Tasmania and say that no such protection should exist. Balance of Payment Figures",61
115,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How do you explain today's balance of payment figures showing that, whilst imports of consumption goods rose in April, imports of capital goods fell by 13 per cent? Is this another indication that there is no investment surge developing and budget forecasts of a massive increase in interbusiness investment are now in doubt?",61
116,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"What a lightweight question-one month's numbers! If this is the new team, well, well, well! I refer the honourable gentleman to Mr Ross Gittins's column in the sitting Sydney Morning Herald of last Saturday where he refers to a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade compilation of imports of capital equipment and makes the point about the difference between the different measures of investment, one being on a demand basisthat is, expectations of and demand for investment-and the other on the actual supply of investment equipment. . In. terms of supply, the graphic illustration shows the line running up the top of the chart from somewhere between $6 billion in 199192 and $7 112 billion in terms of equipment importations. I think the DFAL work is a more reliable guide than simply relying upon one month's balance of payment figures. I suppose he has to cut his teeth somewhere and the monthly balance of payment release may as well be the start, even if he has exaggerated the innuences which are there. Smoking",61
117,Mr GIBSON,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Can 'the minister advise the House of the health cost of. smoking to the Australian community and of what action the government is taking to curb the use of tobacco?,61
118,Dr LAWRENCE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I heard that indrawn breath and groan of dismay from those opposite, as well they might, because I draw their attention, and particularly that of the shadow spokesperson on this question, to the fact that nearly 19,000 Australians die every year from' smoking related illnesses. It is not a matter for light-heartedness. It is 52 people every day. Some 70-odd per cent of drug related diseases are from tobacco relat-d - auses. In other words, it is more preventable death and disease than from any other drug .. There has been a lot of authoritative research on this. As opposed to .the views of the honourable member for - ackellar, it has been going on for 30 years. She does not seem to have· noticed it. She does not seem to have noticed either that some $9 billion a year is lost to the Australian economy because of this drug. - ost of it is in health costs .. The research that has been going on for the last 30 years-and I am quite.happy to have a briefing provided for the honourable member for - ackellar-shows .that tobacco is a significant factor in lung cancer, the deadliest cancer in the country. Tobacco has also been linked to cancer of the mouth, the oesophagus, the larynx, the stomach, the pancreas, the cervix, the bladder and the kidneys. I-ould go on; The honourable member for - ackellar clearly needs a lecture on this question. It is .also a major cause of ischaemic heart disease, of circulatory disease, of high blood pressure, and of complications of pregnancy, including low birth weight. In fact, research that I undertook with colleagues showed very clearly that it had adverse effects on birth weight, muscle tone and reflexes of newborn infants. It is shameful that for years tobacco. companies were alI owed to link cigarette smoking with images that promoted health, youth and fitness. It is a shameful position which I am pleased the opposition in its official poli«y has recognised shOuld not continue-except for the honourable member for - ackelIar, who apparently had not heard her own party's policy or the research. She wants to continue to let. smoking be associated with those positive images. She wants the community to be denied the information that smoking causes illness and a slow and painful· death. Apparently· the honourable. member for - ackellar does not believe this information. I quote from her-over the cacophony of conservatives over there-that in her view the case has not been made out that cigarette smoking and tobacco are dreadful things. She is not certain about that. The honourable member for - ackellar says that 'because tobacco is legal, jtshouldbe allowed to be promoted'-despite all the evidence Chave just presented. Guns are legal. Should we allow those to be promoted too? - orphinejs legal too. Should we be pushing· that on television every night? The honourable member for - ackellar is clearly wrong on this issue. The A-A told her so; the Heart Foundation told her so; her own party told her so. It is time she backed down on this question. She should retract her personal views-not least because they are ill informed. Tomorrow, as part of Quit Week, is World No Tobacco Day. I know some of you might wish it was a 'No Bronwyn Day', but it is a no tobacco day. It is a very importimt occasion for the honourable member for - ackellar to acknowledge her error and to correct it. I know that the Liberal Party has had problems in developing a health policy, but what we have seen over the last few days is ridiculous. As I said on Friday, this would be funny if it were not such a serious issue. People are dying and the honourable member for - ackellar knows it. That is why I gave up smoking and that is why she gave it up. Why does the honourable member for - ackellar want to encourage other people to take it up? . I challenge the honourable member for - ackellar to stop ducking the issue and to stop running for cover. She should either retract her position or resign. The people of Australia do not want a health spokesperson who is so clearly an apologist for the tobacco industry.. In conclusion, - r Speaker, I draw your attention to one welcome change resultingfrom this debacle: the honourable member for - ackellar is avoiding television. Marijuana",61

Can the minister advise the House what would be the cost of expanding the ministry by two, resulting in 32 members, and extending the number of parliamentary secretaries? Can he advise the. House whether the government has any intention of adopting this .course of action?",63
136,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"'-Over the last week we have had a fresh start with the truth. Prior to recent events, the opposition tried to deal with reality in accordance with its likes. More recently there has been an effort to deal with virtual reality. The opposition has attempted to cloud itself with a coverage of performing in accordance with all the right sentiments. But when we or. the media, which has some interest in these matters, look at the detail, something totally different emerges.",64
137,Mr TUCKEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I refer to. relevance. I heard nothing in the question which invited the Leader of the House to comment on opposition policy. Therefore, his answer should be relevant to the question. Furthermore, if he has some spare time, he might talk about suicides and the serious issues of this place.",64
138,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Order! Resume your seat.,64
139,Mr TUCKEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,He is a very poor,64
140,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor knows better. There is no point of order.,64
141,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The first victim of this virtual reality atmosphere was the former Leader of the Opposition. On the same day as he found himself in the situation of challenge from the current Leader of the Opposition, the current Leader of the Opposition declared his undying fealty. Subsequently, he put out a statement in which he said: The numbers in the Shadow Cabinet and the Shadow Ministry have been reduced. This is part of our commitment ·to leaner and more efficient Government. The document which subsequently followed contained a proposition to increase the ministry by two and the number of parliamentary secretaries by at least two. The status of the honourable member who interjected during the Prime Minister's answer and who is yet to reveal whether he feels himself demoted on merit or for some other reason is indeterminate, but it appears that he is also a parliamentary secretary. The cost of this particular move, if implemented by a government, would· be as follows: an increase in salary for each minister would be $50,000, and there would be two of them. MrTuckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a further .point of order in relation to standing order 142, which states: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected This is quite clearly interpreted to mean that a minister should talk about his responsibilities. Furthermore, he should not be wasting the time of the parliament with trying to be funny when he misses out every time. He is no Mick Young.",64
142,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,There is no point. of order. Mr Richard Evans-He is a Billy Bunter though. .,64
143,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The minister will resume his seat. The honourable member for Cowan has consistently been interjecting in question time. I do not want to hear from him for the next hour. Under standing order 304A you may remove yourself. The honourable member for Cowan thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,64
144,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I have noticed that, whenever the honourable member for O'Connor gets to his feet to interject on a.point, hefeels that, at, least in his judgment, the opposition has something to conceal. I will go through the salaries of ministers, which is something directly within my purview as Minister for Finance. The salaries would amount to some $50,000 apiece. Expenses of office or costs met by the departments. for parliamentary secretaries would be about $8,000 apiece. Staff salaries would be $350,000 apiece' for the ministers and $80,000 for the parliamen:.. tary secretaries. The staff travel budget would be $105,000 for the ministers and $30,000 for the parliamentary secretary. Office space, depending on the amount taken, would be around $18,000. That does not give any indication of the expenses for each. of those minister in terms· of travel costs and travel allowances. There would be a very sub-tantial amount of money available for. that. The suggestion that. our commitment to leaner and more efficient government is somehow served by the expansion of the ministry is complete nonsense. ' It is also nonsense to suggest that expandand ing the shadow ministry means that a genetralians' rational change had taken place. The two leaders of the opposition are of exa-tly the same generation as the current two. It is even more interesting to look at the ages of theshadow cabinet. The average age has gone down from 48 112 to 48. In the case of - the government-,Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Whilst on previous occasions I have understood your reasons for YOlir rulings",64
145,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Thank you. Mr AtkinsonI think in this circumstance where the Leader of the House is raising the issue of the ages of the opposition shadow cabinet, it is clearly out ,of order in the context of the question. I ask you to get him to come back to the question.",65
146,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,'-l think the question did go to cost that would be involved. I am' having some difficulty understanding why age for funds. is of relevance. I ask the minister to come back to the question.,65
147,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Of course, if we were creased able to put this in place,it might give us an opportunity to lower our current advantage in youth over the opposition from 46 112, as it now stands, to something even lower.",65
148,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,Is that how it works! .,65
149,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"What we now have from the opposition members, who are firm believers in yirtual reality, is llnother fl:icade to make the public believe something other than what is the case. Of course, they are well served. We do not experience the same thing as the opposition. Some 20 percent of the members of the shadow cabi.net have been exleaders or deputy leaderS of the opposition. It is renewal of a type- but of what type I am not certain. It is certainly not the type that has been explained by the Leader of the Opposition.· . Interest Rates",65
150,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Does the Prime Minister agree with recent comments by the Reserve Bank Governor, Bernie Fraser, that Australians should factor into their borrowing decisions the possibilities of higher interest rates low wage growth? Is it the case that Auswill be exposed to higher interest previolis rates in the near future? MrKEATING-I thought that was a welltimed statement by 'the governor to remind people, particularly banks saying to borrowers that they can extend their debt, that they can take 0'0 other categories of lending under the collateral security of their home and lending at rates of 100 per cent of debt against properties was a timely reminder to the banking system, particularly the major bankS,that they have a role to perform in business in this country-to do that which they should be doing and have a mandate to do-as well as in housing. The advertisements on television piling up the swimming pool and the holiday on top' of the house are an indication of where the major banks stand. The regional banks, feeling that. they are under undue competition from the four majors, are lending at 100 per cent financing and that is not wise Mr Speaker, you might recall that in the One Nation statement the government in the rate of interest on non-callable deposits to commercial rates of interest which provided about $140 million worth of value to the banking system, in the main the major four banks. The purpose of that was to focus on business lending, and particularly small business lending, to improve manager-client relationships'to give managers the capacity to peruse and understand balance sheets and to 1?e ab1e to make judgments about the bankabilitY of a busim;ss .and develop client relationships with that business. , .It was also 'a device in the early days of the recovery to cover some of any of the attendant risk of more prominent lending to small business.. We are not - seeing the levels of lending which I think the. fotirmajor banks should be involved with. They say there is not the dema.nd. But it is a chicken and egg situation; . if they do not go looking for the business they will miraculously find there not much demand. The fact of the matter that housing has become an easy resort lending for the major banks. As a consetrend? quence of that, it has been proven over the last decade that housing has it very low level of ris--,......and this is particularly so with risk rates. under the BIS conventions-the banks are lending heavily for housing. I think the governor's remarks about housing lending that he made privately to the banks and then the remarks he made, over the banks' heads, to the public about the attendant risk of heavy financings of up to 100 per cent of equity and adding to that, are timely. As to the interest rate. implications, if we end up with a recovtax eryofthe kind we are seeing now withMr Reith-l thought we had a recovery.",65
151,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I am talking about a supposedly recovery accelerating beyond where now. We see .on average a 4 1h per cent forecast in the budget which through the year will mean we will be travelling at that or better, tl1ere will he a .demand for funds in the ec.onomy. Generally, when there is a demand for fundS we will see some price effect. That is different from the price effect coming from inflation. I should underpin the governor's con'fidence and remarks about inflation. should be taken notice of by the opposition which should at least wonder why that low inflation rate is there.' It is there principally because of wage restraint· and the recovery courtesy of enterprise bargaining and the accord which the opposition eschews. Mr Reith-You have comatosed the economy.",66
152,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Comatose the economy at four· per cent growth! I think the governor's remarks were timely. I would have thought the opposition, which says that it keeps an eye on borrowers' interests, would have taken some heed of the governor's advice and supported what he said rather than try to score a political point from it. Social Welfare",66
153,Mr CLEELAND,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I address my question to the Minister for Social Security. Has the minister seen the reported increase in welfare is dependency outlined in the ABS report is entitled Australian social trends? Is the for government taking action to reverse this,66
154,Mr BALDWIN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Yes, I have seen the report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics the to which the honourable member refers. I am also very conscious .of the abuse and misuse of the statistics contained in that report that have been made by various spokesmen from the opposition; The Prime Minister has already dealt with the issue of inequality, the impact of government policy and the fact that .the figures talked about were in gross terms and failed to take account of the impact of the transfer system. Another aspect that has been emphasised by the opposition's spokesman on social security, the honourable member for Berowra, is the number of people on welfare. He said in a press we are release a couple of days ago: This is a directresuIt of the Government's policies, which have had the effect of entrenching a welfare state. That is a very interesting proposition. Yes, there has been a significant increase in the numbers of people on various social security payments. That has been the result of a This variety of factors. We have had an ageing population, which has led to an increase in the number of aged pensioners, from around 930,000 ten years ago to about I1h million now. There have been significant increases in the numbers of sole parent and disability pensionersMr Ruddock--And unemployment.",66
155,Mr BALDWIN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"And unemployment, of course. But the difficulty faced by the opposition when it. has tried to attribute this to government policies is that the great bulk of that increase occurred during the period 1975 to 1983, that is, when the opposition was in office. That is obviously the case with the unemployment payments. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, we inherited a rate of unemployment close to 11 per' cent. Take the number of sole parent pensioners. This is a - roup that is constantly maligned by conservative spokesmen in our country-a group of people who need assistance which we are providing through the JET sch;me and in other ways. The suggestion has been made that government policy has somehow caused a massive increase. The fact is that from 1975 to 1983 the average annual rate of growth in the number of people on sole parent pension was 10 per cent. From 1983 to 1993 it has been three per cent. Again, if you look at all these categories of payments, you will see that the rapid acceleration occuned under your tenure. During the 1980s we have targeted the syst-m better, we have introduced more effective cpmpliance measures, we have improved the real 'level of benefit for. those who really need it and we have produced a more efficient and effective instrument for prevention of poverty in our society. Another point that requires emphasis is that you cannot just lookat the absolute numbers of people on the various payments. A good proportion of people on the various pensions and benefits are on less than the full rate because of earnings from non-government sources, from investments and from personal exertion. One of the impacts of government policy over the past decade .has been to significantly increase the proportion of people on various payments who are able to derive significant income from non-government sources. Take sole pensioners. The proportion of sole parents who are earning significant nongovernment income so that that reduces their pension payments has fallen. The proportion of sole parents receiving a full pension; that is, not having any other source of income fell from 84 per cent in 1983 to 50 per ce-t in 1993. A similar pattern occurs in all the. other payments: with the age pension it is the same thing; unemployment, the same thing; disability, the same thing. There have been Significant reductions in the numbers who are .s61-ly dependent 'on government payments for their income support. That is a deliberate consequence . of government policy, of measures to reduce the barriers to work force participation, such as the JET scheme, the disability reform program and the unemployment measures. They have been taken a significant step further recently with the white paper measures that have been announced, including t.he job compact and the measures in that area. Also in the social security area we have redesigned the income support system to comprehensively remove disincentives to work force· participation. That is the way to address this issue and get the numbers of people dependent on benefits down. . , In conclusion; it is rather extraordinary the way some of the opposition spokesmen have responded to this matter. We have been criticised for that redesign of. the income support taper which removes those disincentives and those poverty traps. The honourable member for Mackellar; in an extraordinary the newspaper piece two weeks ago, somehow accused us of changing the social security system in such a.wayasto entice people back into the work force and to induce people to report a higher proportion' of their earnings and put it. on the table. In the face of these sorts of criticismsMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order; On Monday,9 May, you gave an admonition to all ministers with regard to the length of their replies. 'It places in jeopardy the' proceedings of this place:' I invite you to rule accordingly with regard to this minister. . .' .",67
156,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The minister had indicated that he is in conclusion, and I am sure he is.' ', '",67
157,Mr BALDWIN,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"In ,conclusion, the honourable member for Mackellar accuses us in this article of trying to induce more people to increase their work effort, 'and to declare more of what they earn. What can we say in the face of those accusations but to plead guilty? Business Investment",67
158,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"l refer the Prime Minister to the recent warnings by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, that business investment is still 'dragging the chain', as confirmed. by last week's private hew capital expenditure figures for the.March quarter, down markedly. Do you stand by the budget forecast on businessinvestment? Why should business investment boom in the forthcoming financial year when it is still falling in the most recent quarter?",68
159,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"As I said during the week and as the Treasurer said in a press statement, the figures that we are seeing are very much in line with the budget forecast. Again, I refer to Mr Gittins's piece, 'Why you don't needlo worry about investment'. Mr Downer- You are not reading it again.",68
160,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I commend it to your reading; I do. Let me also remind.the opposition of this release of the Statistician: 'Company profits, Australia, March quarter 1994, company profits before income tax'. The opposition will see that the level of' profitability in Australia at the moment is' well beyond the late 1980s experience;which itself had no historical precedent, to a point which has absolutely no' historical precedent. The Leader of the National' Party asked: why would there be investment? Answer: because profits have never been higher, principally, because there is demand in the economy. Mr Tim Fischer-It is not happening.",68
161,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"It is happening. That was the point of the collation by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the data in respect of investment in equipment, that is that which has actually landed, not survey based. on demand or expectations but it actually arrived. So that is why in getting around the business community' in the last week or two-and I had -. chance to talk to the Australian Mining Industry Council with Prime. Minister Wingti of Papua New Guinea and other members of the business community in Melbourne-and particularly over the last week, they are saying that they are very confident about the prospects for investment, as I am, too. The opposition will look at these profit numbers and investment numbers as the months go on and again go back to the old chant: why weren't we there? The answer is: because you were not good enough to win; you came second at the last election. That is why. Mr MCGauran-Wait for the next election.",68

Landcare: Increased Tax Deductibility To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Parliament of Australia in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House that great efforts are being made to attain sustainable land use through landcare. At the present level of activity it will in the order of 100 years to achieve a stable landscape Australia wide (based on an accepted level of necessary vegetation cover). , Whereas environmental degradation on private land in Australia needs substantial expenditure to arrest and reverse trends such as inc-easiIlg salinity brought about by traditional practices of land utilisation. Such expenditure requires encouragement and some degree of support from the general population and tax payers. We request that assistance such as tax deductibility in the order of 150 per cent on approved landcare expenditure be granted.

Health Issue: Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the anomaly in the Resident Classification Instrument of nursing home residents. At present, funding to nursing homes is penalised by not allowing points for assistance to residents who are too ill or frail to be placed on a toilet or commode. This often means that the resident will be designated a lower category and therefore attract less funding although the care required may be Excessive. . Your petitioners therefore pray that the House review the Resident Classification Instrument in relation to Continence Management and the toiletting process so that equitable funding will enable the delivery of quality care to the incontinent frail person.

The Petitioners people of this nation. note particularly that: 1. Users of off-road diesel fuel currently receive a full or partial rebate of fuel excise. paid recognition that they should not have to contribute to road funding and maintenance in the same manner as on-road users of diesel fuel; 2. We object to being forced to pay fuel excise on diesel fuel and then being charged a tax, which the Government is calling an 'administration fee', to have that money returned to us as a rebate; 3. This tax sets a dangerous precedent and could lead to governments charging similar taxes rebates, such as those for personal income tax.

The governDuty ment is selling off the fann,piece by piece, with no long-tenn or penn anent benefit to the . The government has already indicated that it is considering privati sing Tullamarine airin port, the AIDC, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, arid a number of other major components of Australia's public assets. That may be fine; my party has a policy of privatisationof certain government assets. But the difference in the approach of the.Keating government and our party is that we look for apennanentbenefit. All of the policies of the on Keating government have been short tenn: 'Puta bit of bandaid over it, a bit of putty over the cracks, and let us move towards the next election.' Australian Defence Industries operates it heavy engineering facility in my electorate of Bendigo. It is more than likely that the 450 BUSINESS pennanent jobs at that facility could be sacrificed in favour of temporary positions in areas anywhere in Australia-short-tenn jobs. Orders The jobs that the AD! personnel hold down a high-tech, highly skilled defence area. They are pennailent jobs in an industry which is internationally sensitive, and which is involved instrategie defence issues, including the manufacture of ordnance and annaments, exceedyet they could be tossed aside to help this government create the illusion of growing employment. It really is an illusion, because the white paper does not provide employers with any incentives to create new and permanent jobs. The job compact is merely an' eleCtion ploy-a notso cheap trick, with $6.5 billion of taxpayers' money which the Prime Minister hopes will win him the next eleCtion .. , The .ALP and the union movemenf spent almosJ half a million dollars trying to win.the seat of Bendigo - t the last election. I am pleased to report - that they failed miserably. Th-y have now given . up .that fight, so the Prime Minister doe,s not care about the impact his job 'compact jnight have on Bendigo's local economy a-d' he is ,moving in the direction of prIvatisation of that facility. , . The white paper is all about tampering .with and reducing the. unemployment figures in time for an election. in late 1995; The starting date for most of the schemes announced in the white paper is 1 July 1995. There are 233;451 long-term unemployed. Mr Deputy Speaker, think about that large number ·of people-233,451-who have. been out of work in this country for.18 months or longer. Five months after. 1 July 1995, in abou.t October or November, the schemes announced in the white paper will still .have a months left to run. The Prime Minister will rush off. to the polls hoping that,. by taking these people off the long-term unemployed list and putting them into the job compact for between six and nine months employment, Ausiralians will, believe his illusion that the unemployment rate has fallen. It is an absolute disgrace that people's lives can be toyed with in this manner by any government in Australia. This is an attempt to manipulate the system. to the extent that people do not h-ve the opportunity to get a long-term job. There is no encouragement fqr the public or private sectors to improve, the economic situation so that people can get a permanent job in i-dustry and commerce. This government says,'Let usmanipulate the system. Let us get people off the unemployment list. Let us do this at a time when it will be favourable, for us to go into an election mode.' Look at the work . that was done on the green paper. A task force went throughout Australia; at huge expense to the Victorian taxpayer, and came back with a lot of answers which the government preferred to ignore. One of the green paper's major recommendations to the government was the development of infraStruCtl1re in regional areas of Australia. The budget did not allocate additionalrhoney to the development of infrastructure. The . goveinmenthas ignored that recommendation; it has walked away from. it. After all the work that task force did throughout AustraJia in trying to identify problems, I' shOuld imagine that the· chairman. of the task force, Mr Kelty, would be greatly upset by the government's inaction. .. . The development . of permanent infrastructure leads to permanentjobs.In regional areas of Australia in particular there is a need to develop infrastructure whiCh would.' support industry and commerce and create an atmosphere of economicdevelopment which would lead to permanent jobs. Australians will probably understand what Mr Keating is doing. I believe they wil,1. The electorate is very astute. The Prime Minister is going to, rush off to the polls"" hoping Australians will believe his iIlusion that the few rate of unemployment has fallen. Australians have more sense than that, and they will see this conjuring trick fot exactly what it is-an expensive, cynical exercise which shows absolutely no concern at all for the real plight of the 'unemployed or for the future of Australia. ' , The future of organis;ltions like Australian Defence Industri.es lies in the opportunity. to seek more work from the public arid private sectors, both here in Australia and overseas. With more work coming in, Austrillian Defence Industries could afford to train more apprentices and technicians and create more permanent jobs. Australia is facing a drastic skills shortage in many trades and at a variety of technical levels, because in recent years employers have been unable to afford to train more' apprentices. . The high cost of government services arid the on-costs which are reflected in the cost of employing apprentices and technicians in training are extrernely high, and yet this government has moved not one iota to try to alleviate those costs on employers. If the Prime Minister had the interests of Australia and all Australians at heart, he would be reducing industry and commerce overheads, stimulating the private sector and directing more resources into technician and apprentice training to create real jobs, not temporary jobs, especially in the cynical atmosphere at the moment where we are looking at an election, reducing the numbers of long-term unemployed and building up an atmosphere to go to an election in 1995. All he is doing with this program· is paving the way for six months to an election in 1995. I recently attended a graduation ceremony for some tertiary students at the Bendigo campus of La Trobe University. I felt deeply for the 814 people who had graduated. I wonder whether any thought has been given to those graduates and where they will find a job in the policies that are being implemented by the Keating government. Local Government: Funding",72
165,Mr LATHAM,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My grievance concerns the method of distribution of the $1 billion annual program of financial assistance grants to localg()vernment. It is now appropriate, in the context of a growth economy-4.5 per cent growth in the coming financial year-to drive greater equity into all funding programs. Too often notions of social justice are dealt with in a theoretical sense without a clear program of reform. An essential starting point is to ensure that funding programs effectively target the needs of disadvantaged areas and regions. This is a timely grievance, as the government is presently reviewing the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986. The review and its outcome should adopt the following principles. The first principle is to support the role played by local government in the provision of quality of life services. The stereotype. in Australian local government of roads, rates and rubbish is now as outdated and old fashioned as the Liberal Party. Four of the five quality of life services in this country provided by local government: libraries, child care, recreation and cultural facilities. Only education is kept as a state government service. Services like this are essential in promoting a better quality of life in disadvantaged areas and regions. In Australia, inequality Qepends as much on where people live and their access to basic services. as their access to satisfactory incomes. In affluent local government areas, people have better access through personal incomes and the purchase of private services. They can buy personal libraries instead of using public libraries. They can purchase cultural and recreational services instead of using community facilities, and they can purchase a greater amount of private child care instead of using publicly provided facilities. In less affluent, more disadvantaged local government areas, these public services take on immense importance and give immense opportunity for promoting the quality of life. The second reform that the act should embrace is to drive greater equity into the allocation of financial assistance grants to local government around Australia. The current system relies on equal per capita grants to each state. The State Grants Commission then allocates funds through the horizontal equalisation principle, which means it promotes equalisation of the capacity to provide services by each local government authority, not equalisation of outcomes for the quality of life in each local government area. There is only a loose correlation between socio-economic need and the scale of grants. In Victoria, for instance, in 1991-92, the most disadvantaged 25 per cent of councils averaged grants of $47.77 per capita, while the second most advantaged qqarter of councils-that is, those in the 50 to 75 per cent range-received $56.52 per capita. In Western Australia, the second quarter of councils received substantially lower per capita grants than the more affluent third quarter. In Tasmania, the second quarter received substantially higher grants than the more disadvantaged first quarter. The state local government grants commissions are not applying indices are of socio-economic need in the allocation of their grants. Australia-wide this results in $200 million of financial assistance and road grants to local government being provided to the 22 per cent most affluent and most advantaged .local government .areas. So, on needs based criteria, we cannot defend the way in which state grants commissions are currently undertaking their work and gearing up their funding formulae. There are two reasons for this. No state includes in its funding formula a reliable measure of socio-economic advantage and disadvantage. That in Australia in the 1990s is absolutely indefensible; In 1986 perhaps it could be understood because the ABS and the Australian Taxation Office had not devised indices of socio-economic advantage. But,as the current discussion paper provides, they are available and should be picked up in an amendment to the legislation and used by the state local government grants commissions. The second source of inequity is the distortion provided by the requirement for 30 per cent of funds in each state to be distributed on a per capita ,basis. This, too, is· indefensible in Australia in the 1990s when more disadvantaged communities need the funds that currently we allocate to each community, irrespective of its need; that is, the 30-per cent per capita basis. The third principle that should be followed in reviewing and reforming the legislation is the integration of specific purpose road grants into global grant allocations. At the moment we have a subst-itution. effect whereby, no matter the size of the road grants, the local government authority simply substitutes what it would have spent out of its own resources of revenue, replacing it with the revenue provided by the State Grants Commission and the federal distribution of grants. This was best pointed out by the Self report into local government finance in 1985. Even National Party members opposite could tum to page 351 of the Self report and read its conclusion: ... road grants to local government are very close to general purpose assistance, especially since nothing is done to counter substitution effects local government level and ensure that the money actually leads to increased spending on roads ... in the longer run it would be desirable to absorb the Commonwealth grant for local roads into the program of general purpose assistance. That is where the report ends its conclusion. Of course, this principle would be totally consistent with local government autonomy. If a local government authority wanted to take all the money that was allocated to it by the Commonwealth and through the state commis- . sion and spend it on roads, that should be its choice. Equally, if a local government authority, responding to local need and circumstance, wanted to take all the funds that had been allocated to it and spend them on libraries, recreational facilities or other quality of life services, that should be at its discretion. As a rule, the decisions thrust upon local government from Canberra are poor decisions; decisions that reinforce local government autonomy and local discretion are good decisions. That should be an important part of changes to the legislation. There is also a problem in the way in which state funding formulae currently disadvantage local government authorities in urban areas for the allocation of road grants when they have a . substantial rural road network. We have an artificial distinction and funding divide for so-called rural and so-called urban councils which takes no account of the unique needs in western Sydney, for instance, of classified urban councils which have substantial networks of rural roads. The fourth principle which should be followed in reforming the legislation is to restore. a component of local capital works program, such as that introduced by the honourable member for Cal are (Mr Simmons) during his term as local government minister. That was a very successful program that provided, in particular, disadvantaged local government areas with their best opportunity to provide the community buildings- the recreation services, the cultural services and the libraries that otherwise couldriot be funded out of their annual budget. To restore that program out of the current allocation of just more than $1 billion in local government grants would be of enormous benefit to at the disadvantaged areas and regions throughout Australia. In particular, the· government should be taking the Horton report into public library funding off the shelf, where it has sat since 1975. In Australia the upgrade of municipal libraries has not· been part of the general upgradeofedocation institutions in Australia in the 1980sand 1990s. This government has done it for child care, school education, TAPE and universities. Federal responsibilities to fund municipal libraries should be picked up in the review of the legislation- These library grants should be made through capital assistance to avoid the sort of substitution effect that occui's with grants for recurrent purposes, as we see with the current allocation of road grants. The fifth principle that should be adopted in reforming the legislation is to drive an efficiency dividend into local government by rewarding those councils that have reformed their management practices-that is, brought themselves out of the 1950s right into the 1990s through corporate styles of management, greater efficiency and corporatising various functions, as we see at the more advanced councils that have also engaged in innovative enterprise bargaining arrangements. Rewarding efficient councils would be a most worthwhile practice in the review of the local government legislation. I would recommend strongly that the federal grants be distributed in the following proportions: 70 per cent of the funding, that is, a little more than $740 million in 1993-94, for horizontal equalisation distributed by the state grant commissions; 20 per cent of .the funding, a little more than $200 million, for capital works funding distributed authority by local government authority, giving a high preference to quality of life services in areas of greatest socio-economic need; .and 10 per cent for efficiency incentives and rewards available to all councils distributed by local government state grant commissions. I look forward to the completion of the review and the incorporation of these' provisions in the ,legislation by way of amendment. Parkes E,lectorate",74
166,Mr COBB,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In the last two weeks while parliament was not sitting I have been busy travelling to the more remote areas of my electorate. I would like to share with honourable members some of my experiences and the concerns and difficulties faced by people in the bush. In the first week I travelled with the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who is at the table, on, what is known as, the Kidman, Way, or rather the un-ealed section .of it, which is libout half the ,road that exists between HiIlston in the south ;;md up through Cobarto 8purke,in the north,That stretch of road is about 408 kilometres long. and 190 of those.kilometres are unsealed. The significance of this route is that people can travel directly north from Melbourne right through to Mount Isa and Darwin on a sealed stretch, except"" for this small area which remains unsealed. It isa flat, straight stretch and construction costs to bitumen this road are quite low-of the order of $100,000 to $125,000 per kilometre. I believe it is ,a very important section, of road, because it would give an alternative route to road transport as well as to tourists and would tend to open up that particular inland section of Australia. We recorded a very good send off at Hillston where we climbed into a 400-horsepower Mack truck, driven by the sharlow minister for the full distance. About 100 people were there to see us off in theCarrathool shire. We went north from there, soon leaving the bitumen a few kilometres out of the town and on to some of the roughest road surfaces that any member would ever wish to travel on. We got to Mount Hope for afternoon tea. It was interesting to talk to some of the people there who had come from far and wide to meet us. One person who sticks in my mind is 8ernadette MCMillan, who runs the shop and the mail run in conjunction with her husband. ,She said to me that they have to change their car tyres every 15;000 kilometres; in other words, they change their tyres about three times a year. At $100 a tyre, it would cost. them $1,200 each year for car tyres just on one vehicle; whereas normally it would cost about $400. So the state of the road has added about $800 in costs to one smaIl business just from the cost of car tyres, let alone the cost of the wear and tear on the vehicle and on the humari beings who have to drive it. ' From Mount Hope we pushed north to Cobar where we had another amazing reception. ""We had dinner that night with all the. shires present, including the president· of the Federal Inland Development Organisation, Peter Laird. Next morning we pushed on toa construction camp halfway between Cobar and Bourke where again people appeared from hundreds of kilometres away to greet us and impress upon us the need to bitumen this road. From there we arrived in Bourke for lunch, and we had dinner with some councillors who were there for a central economic zone meeting. At the end of this trip, I am pleased to say, the shadow minister, having clearly seen the need to bitumen this road, announced that the coalition, upon return to government, would fully fund it and would do so within a reasonably short time frame. I think it was very welcome neWs to all the towns along the trip. We keep our promises, unlike honourable members on the other side, Mr Sharp-They just make promises and break them. MrCOBB-They do, indeed. They do daily. I undertook a second trip only last week. I travelled 1,700 kilometres from Dubbo, up to Brewarrina, across to Bourke, up to Hungerford, back to Wanaaring and then back to Dubbo. At Brewarrina I met with Feli MCHughes and Steven Carr, who are metre involved with the Aboriginal community that town. I had the pleasure of travelling over the town and surrounding district with them looking at some of the CDEP schemes that they are overseeing. I was particularly pleased to see that value for the taxpayers' of them. dollar is starting to flow through in tree planting, landscaping and other projects that are starting to be put in place. That night I travelled to Bourke. The next day I pushed on to Enngonia, about 100 kilometres north· of Bourke. The first· place I visited there was the school. I must take my hat off to Margie Haley, the principal, who has 23 children in the school-50 per cent of them are Aboriginal-as well as the preschool classes that are run there. There is no rubbish in the school, no graffiti and very low absenteeism; the school itself is a credit to her and should be a model for other schools throughout New South Wales. The school was concerned, though, that because the town is so small there is no 60 kilometre zone outside the schooL So when the children cross the main road they are sometimes subject to road transport going through at high speed. I will be following this up. About 100 to 150. Aborigines .1ive just outside the .town in the mission. Since the clinic sister has been taken out of the town, the ambulance service from Bourke, 100 kilometres away, has increased its trips from about one· every two months to about ont(every day. With about $400 per trip being passed on to the taxpayer, there is a very good case for a couple of clinic sisters to be put back in Enngonia to service the local population. Perhaps those in ATSIC and the fe<ieral Department of Human Services and Health should get their heads together and get a couple of Aboriginal clinic sisters, in particular, to live in Enngonia. Next we crossed the very rough and bulldust-strewn road to Fords Bridge. We had it lunch there that day in Max and Jean Bambrick's pub. A lot of local citizens came to meet with me. Naturally they discussed the shocking state of the road, particularly north from Bourke heading into Fords Bridge, and the desirability even to get down five kilostrips of black top so that at least when in they are travelling that road they have a chance to pass the road trains. When people . are travelling behind a road train they have to drop back two or three kilometres. We mentioned many problems. Woody weeds was one . Reg and Dot Hatch are experts on woody weeds because they have done a lot of blade ploughing and sowing of buffel grass, et cetera, on their property. to get rid of this. Woody weeds is now the biggest· problem in the western division of New South Wales. Various methods have been tried, apart from blade ploughing, such as burning, chemical control, biological control arid such things. A lot of research has to be done into this. Perhaps tax relief should be given in some areas because it is cutting the stocking rate on some properties by 20 per cent-up to 80 per cent in some cases. Some paddocks that could be mustered inha:lf a day now take more than a week. It also looks very bad aesthetically. Pushing north from there to Yantabulla, the citizens there raised. a number of problems with me; - will mention just·· two or three quickly. Citizens have to pay $3,000 for a·l 1/2 metre dish with a black box. By law they are only allowed to watch the ABC plus one commercial channel. People who live in Bourke not only do not have to buy a dish but can watch the ABC plus two commercial channels. For the life of me; I cannot see why these people are not allowed to watch the second commercial channel. The issue of telephones was raised. In this part of the world there are no untimed telephone calls. Whereas we can t-lk: for an unlimited amount of time for 25c, people out there get charged 25c every 4 Jh minutes. People who live out there, particularly the women, like to ring up their neighbour from time to time and have a chat for half an hour or so to regain their sanity, to find out what is going on and these types of things, but it is hard to do that when the meter is ticking away and they are being charged 25c every 4 Jh minutes. They also raised concerns relating to the ICPA correspondence allowance, which all primary children in that area partake of. It has been stuck on $500 per year for quite some time now and I think there is a very good case for having that lifted. From there I pushed north to. Hungerford and stayed overnight, and then next day went down to Wanaaring. The people· there raised numerous issues, including the road and the contact children's mobile, which services 130 children in an area the size of Tasmania. We talked about fuel taxes and the need for lights on the airport so that the royal flying doctor could land at night. From there I went back to Bourke and serviced other towns such as Byrock, Coolibah and Girilambone. Many issues come up in trips like this. I take great pleasure today in bringing before members of the House some of the issues which concern people who live in remote areas. I hope the government will Qe able to act on some of them. Judicial System: Victoria",76
167,Mr CLEELAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I listened with interest to the speech. of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I invite you to.come; down to the .state of Victoria to see what happens when Fightback is implemented by a conservative government. You can .have a look at the massive cuts in infrastructure. Obviously you support the closure of at least 20 rural hospitals. You stand here·as'a rural representativeand'say that you support it. I wiJIgoback to Victoria quite happily and say that the National Party in Australia supports the Victorian National Party in closing rural hospitals. r am pleased to be able to SaY that because that is what would - appen.with Fightback-$lObillion in cuts. You never read the document, obviously. The Victorian government is destroying the infrastructure of Victoria, .destroying rural . Victoria, closing rural schools, closing rural hospitals and takIng funding off rural councils for roads. This is obviously what the National Party supports. I draw attention to another problem in Victoria, which is a direct result of Liberal National· Party policy: the attack on the judicial system and On the very foundation of justice in this country. The massive cuts to the judicial system in Victoria are causing grave concerns across the board and are producing results' adverse to justice. My particular concern today is with the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme· Court of Victoria in the matter of the Queen v. Wilson and Griinwade. It involves a case known as the Jet Corp case. In my view, the Appeal Division of. the Supreme Court of Victoria came to a very perverse finding indeed-a finding which throws into doubt whether or not white-collar criminals can properly be dealt with by. the judicial system of blir country. It throws into doubt whether the Melbourne Club has more power. than even I suspected and it throws justice into doubt. Three of the five people charged have been convicted and punished and two were let loose by the Supreme Court. The essential background facts are in the judgment and it is worthwhile reciting from the judgment what those background facts are. They are vastly simplified, of course. It involves a company called Jet Corporation Australia;Pty Ltd. In September 1981 Huttley, a chartered accountant versed in tax minimisation schemes, Collier and the applicant Wilson became its directors. The Jet Corporation Australia Trust was,·according to its trustee, established on· 20 December 1981 and consisted of 100 units of $150,000 each. The trustee was JCA,· or Jet Corporation Australia Pty Ltd. At that. time a long established business known as Schutt Aviation was engaged in the acquisition, operation and sale of commercial aircraft, carried on in Moorabbin in Victoria. Wilson was involved with that, together with one called Sent and one called Forshilw. The purposes of the JCA Trust were to acquire the aircraft business for $12 million and then conduct it. Those who stood· to benefit from the JCA's acquisition and conduct of the aircraft business were Huttley, Collier, Dyer, Wilson and Sir Andrew Grimwade. The last is a well-known businessman, member of the Melbourne Club, prominent member of the Liberal Party and known to many. The simple facts of this case are not in dispute. A prospectus was put. out which was dishonest. Among other things, that prospectus said that Grimwade would be taking a subscription. in the trust. That was not true. Grimwade was paid $900,OOO-odd for lending his name to a false prospectus. None of these facts are in dispute. It was a major whitecollar crime one would think worthy of punishment. Yet, when we find out what happened, we really have to scratch our heads and ask seriously whether or not white.;collar criminals are dealt with properly in this country. The investigation was conducted by the National Crime Authority-it put together a brief for prosecution and the prosecution was conducted by the DPP of Victoria-and at the committal proceedings Collier, Huttley and Dyer pleaded guilty. Huttley gave evidence for the Crown against Wilson and Grimwade. The jury, after a long and complicated trial, found Grimwade and Wilson guilty. I accept that there were major problems in the trial. The bar of Victoria should really think seriously about the performance of the barristers in that trial. The Supreme Court, in my view quite fairly, criticised the. barristers concerned because they, quite frankly, made a mess of it. They prolonged the trial to the extent that that was the ground for the appeal. So herds a system ofjustic- in which three people pleading guilty have been convicted, . one giving evidence against two co-offenders, and the trial is run in such a way as to. make it complicated, to prolong the trial to nearly 21 months. One must also raise the issue that the judge was involved in other matters and could not sit consistently on the trial. What sort of justice system have we got when the judge who is supposed·to run the conduct of the trial is not even available for most of the trial period because he is on another matter? That is a grave concern in the way justice is run. The barrister, appointed I understand for Wilson by Legal Aid, was severely criticised by the appellate court. According to the judgment, he behaved in a way which was unnecessary and caused grave concern about the conduct of the trial. That is all very well. I am not here to support barristers. I want to know why white-collar criminals cannot get . convicted. Nevertheless, the judges raised that as a serious concern. In the course of the, judgment the judges raised this very interesting question. They said: The question we are to consider is whether, in the circumstances we have describeQ, there was a real danger that, as regards the applicant Grimwade, the jury failed to perform their function properly. That was a test propounded in R. v. Higgins ... and accepted by all counsel here. In whose perception is such real danger to be seen? That is the question. In whose perception is the real danger to be seen? Through whose eyes was justice to be seen to be done? Is it through 'the barristers, throug'h appellate judges of the Supreme Court or through the investors of Jet Corp, who blew all their money because of a criminal fraud? That is the question. In whose eyes is justice seen to be done? The judges asked that. They say: The answer to each question must be that the verdict is to be recognizably true and fair to an objective observer having knowledge of all the relevant facts and circumstances. ' It is interesting that Mr Chief Justice Phillips in the course of his judgment pointed out·that his and the court's judgment was not to be seen as a finding of innocence of Mr Grimwade. That is a· strange statement for an appellate court to make. I would have thought those who are practised in the law and who have heard· many judgments would consider that that is a strange thing for a judge to say. Hejs really saying, 'Despite the,fact we are going to overturn a decision, we do in the process of overturning the decision nevertheless make the point that we do not find him innocent.' If he is not innocent, why is he not found guilty? If he is .guilty, why has the system not properly found him guilty as the jury found him guilty and .found Wilson guilty? It is unbelievable that a 21-month before a jury finds a verdict which can then be overturned by an appellate court under these circumstances. I firmly believe that many of those problems in Victoria are because of massive funding cuts to judges and the court system. I think some people at the bar need a good examination. We all know-we are seeing it in other court casesarotmd Australia-that if one has the money, if one comesfrbm privilege and one has wealth, one can use our judicial system to extend and delay to .the extent that appellate courts will find that there is a problem with the trial because of length and delay. Then that person is off the· hook. If that is what this House accepts as justice in white-collar crime areas and if that is what the state of Victoria accepts as justice in white-collar crime areas, then, frankly, I do not like it. Let me remind the House that these are riot just my views. I have a great deal of respect for the President of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Staley, who was involved in raising these allegations-in fact, he was very prominent hi ensuring that Grimwade was brought to trial. There must be a lot of people out there who feel quite sick in the stomach as a result of this decision by the appellate division of the Supreme Court. It is time we had a good look at justice and at the way white-collar criminals seem to manipulate the system because of wealth and privilege.. Sydney Airport:· Third Runway ...'.

The range, of ,complaints has come from mothers of small babies, husbands of wives who suffer migraine headaches;·elderly people who feel, nervous, and other people who are just plain irritated by the problems that have arisen while the thirdruriway has been under construction. Let there:be rio doubt, the people of my electorate'are mad that they have had SO ma.ny overflights during .this period. r have been making Inquiries of.SydJiey airpOrt for all of this period, and in' a most pleasant and, I trust, most truthful way I have been informed that there will be no air traffic over the Sutherland shireorice the third runway is operationaL So it is a mixed bag for me: great pleasure that the third runway wi,1I be fully operational in mid-1995, not 1996 as originally planned; and further great pleasure from the confirmed advice from airport authorities that there will be basically no air traffic the Sutherland shire from that time on, On the other hand, these same airport authorities know how angry I have been on behalf of my constituents that the site, as well as the noise of planes; is going to be the cause of great irritation and disturbance to my constituents untilmid-1995. A very short distance south of my electorate is the sadly burnt out but thankfully regrowing Royal National Park. These same planes should have been flying over this national park; not over my electorate. Thank goodn-s I have not had the experience of the honourable member forKingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) of seeing an air accident within my electorate, albeit a long time ago. I pray that this will never happen in and around Sydney ever again. I would like to thank all of those constituents who wrote me.strong '.butcourteous letters complaining of the overflight of jet aircraft. I have written to each of them. I trust this grievance speech will be reported· in the St George and Sutherland Shire Leader- the Cronulla News and the K,ingsway News, as well as on my two new lOCal radio stationsafter all, I am giving them publicity today. I guess it can be said, and I am proud of the fact, that I belong to the NIMBY - not in my backyard-group.ofpoliticians. There is no cause for· a politician to be rude in his or her objectiovs to either flights or artillery and mine practice in the area he or she represents, but object to these things he or she must. I am happy to say that since 1966 I have in my electorate been relentlessly concerned abOutthe 'developinentof the major airport across the other side of Botany Bay. Come on air traffic controllers, fly some of those aircraft over the recovering national park instead of over one of the loveliest parts of Australia, the Cook electorate, as you noW do. This very day I had occasion to fly to and back from Sydney. We flewin a 737 over the national park, not over the Sutherland shire. This clearly sho_ws to me that it can be done. SO,air traffic controllers, how about changing the flights as of now, not waiting for another year? As we are talking in a grievance debate, I over thought! should mention that a number qf my electors have again complained to me in recent times of the ground tremors that have been brought about by the service activities at the big military camps in the Hughes electorate to the south of. Cook. I dl;lre say the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) has been receiving even more complaints than I have., It is one of the strange geophysical problems of Sydney that ground tremors at Holdsworthy and other military areas have a problem of being transported and felt, particuhirly at Grays Point and South Cronulla, within my electorate. These irritations are not regular,but they are disturbing to the people so many miles away from the event that is causing them. These were particularly bad when the Claymore mines were being tested during the Vietnam war. Though I have been aware of the army's cognisance of the effects of the artillery and mines on the environs at their camps, I maintain this again today to remind the army officials that it does still happen and that care should be taken by them when they participate in such practices. Flying over the burnt out national park today reminded me of the move by the wildlife foundation people to. do away with the large herd of Asian deer which has been in the Royal National Park for a very long time. For you, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher,. not coming from' Sydney, I point 01,It that the Royal National Park in Sydney is the second oldest national park in the wofId. It was beaten by the famous one' in the United States. It was one of the great tragedies of bushfires that took place in Sydney a few months ago that this huge national park was 99 per cent destroyed, with rainfonisiStotally eliminated. People are now saying they are pleased to see some regrowth. I just hope 'that the wildlife people do not shoot the deer in the meantime. Having spent many years of my life going down to the national park at dusk to see the little animals drink from Audley Dam and such places, I believe the deer have not made any problems for the Royal National Park. It is a nonsense for some of these environmental officials to think they should be done away with. In the minute left, I want to say that I have been made aware in the last week of the lack of government support of research into children's leukaemia and cancer throughout Australia. At the moment, my office is looking into this matter very closely to. see what will happen and why governments of all colours and all descriptions are just not helping. All the research that is done at the moment is done by privately raised funds in communities throughout Australia. Their progress has been dramatic. Ten or 15 years ago the percentage of children who died. was greater than it is today. (Time expired). Por1 of Geelong",80
169,Mr OCONNOR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in the grievance debate to mention the future of the port of Geelong in my electorate. When Labor was elected to power in. 1983, it embarked on a broad program of mjcroeconomic reform like. no other government had. attempted before in the previous two. decades. The government viewed the process of micro-economic reform as essential if the Australian economy was to successfully restructure and maintain its international competitiveness in the long term. An important part of that micro-economic reform agenda, which effectively commenced in 1984, has been the reform of the Australian May,.,,"".1994 waterfront. ,Plagued by gross e((onotllic ineffi;ciencies that had developed over decades.imd by low productivity allq high .levels pfjndustrial disputation, there was an urgent n-d to undertake meaningful reform and remove the the impediments that were .blocking·an improvement to our export performaIlce.The tortuous and essenti,al waterftollt ... refortJl .. priJgram began .in 1984.)Chadthree main e)el11ents: firstly, to overhaul stevedoring employment arrangements; secondly, to' implement port authority reforms; and, thirdly, to encourage greater competition 'in the industry and to ensUre the benefits of reform were passed on to' the users. In all of these areas of reform, the government .has been spectacularly 8ucc,essful. Those achievements include enterprise employment, which has brought waterfront employment in line with other Australian industries by making employers directly responsible for the recruihnent of labour, enterprise. training, wages and dispute settlement. Secondly, we have seen industrial award restructuring, which has resulted in'afarmore flexible and adaptable stevedoring work force. Thirdly, we have seen a rejuvenation of the wateifront work force, and we now have a far more flexible and adaptable work fqrce in that area. Also,a more competitive structure has been created at the port level with the removal of industry employment arrangements which allow different ports the ability to pursue different and more appropriate strategies to improve efficiencies. The scorecard is fairly impressive. C-rgo handling rates have risen by some '57 per cent. Ship turnaround times at container terminals have reduced by some 45 per cem. Improvements at bulk cargo handling ports have helped make Australian grainports-I include the port of Geelong .in this-among the most efficient in the world, with loading times on grain vessels reduced from 4.5 days in 1988 to 1.9 days in 1992. I am pleased to say that the port of Geelong in my electorate of Corio has embraced' the reform process with an impressive sense of professionalism and considerable enthusiasm. The port of Geelong istl1e city of Geelong's gateway to the world. It is our gateway to the intemational,commercial marketplace.' The portis:'a criti-al facility that ,links existing ro-d and rail infrastructure and a productive hinteTI-lJld to that international marketplace. Therefore, it wasab-ohitely critical that the quest ,for' greater operating 'efficiencies be pursued pr()fessionally and with a minimum of disruption at ;thatparticularfa,cility. This has been done and the results are quite outstanding:' "" "" As far 'as the achievements of the port are concerned, over the past three years there has been a. reduction of over 50 per cent in the permanent work force. But, more importantly, these labour reductions have been achieved in 'a spirit of cooperation, betweenm-nagement and labour and without industrial disputation. Manning levels currently are around 150' and are programmed to reduce to 100 by the end of the year. Also there 'has been a multiskilling of the remaining work force and an improvement in ship turnaround time at the port. There has been a reduction in operating expenses' and a lift in net profit. All these gains have been accompanied by increased benefits to the usersofthis port'facilitY. The port has pursued a policy of divesting itself of non-core assets and unproductive' assets and has, in recent times, einbarkedon Ii significant program of public, investment. ' Two major recent investments are the modernisation of the bulk handling facilities and the deepening of approach c.hannelst() the port. The modernisation, of bulk handling facilities at Lascelles wharf has cost $21 miIlion. The program will improve productivity by 60-plus per cent and attract more industry into the Oyster Cove industrial land development area. The"" deepening of approach channels by one metre for 27 kilometres from the port has been a $35 miIlion investment driven by the graiirandoil industries. That will be corripleted in. 1995. ' As far as its current economic and commercial performance are concerned, we have seen net profit increase' to $85' million. Total revenue has increased by 15 per cent to$20 miIlion in 1992-93. Cargo voiumes have increased by 1.1 million tonnes:-:one milliqn tonnes due to increased tonnage- of p-tr()leuin products and 700,000 due to increased top nages'of grain; In that time, the authority's expenses fell by 23 per cent to achieve that improved profit performance. It is against this background that one must view with some concern recent press reports in Geelong, suggesting, that the Kennett government in Victoria has plans afoot to disaggregate the port's assets and to sell them off to. the private sector. There are several significant disadvantages in this disaggregation suggestion. At a time when the port has achieved these record profit levels,the state government will' cut itself off from a significant income stream and any potential growth in that income stream in the future. There is also a potential for us to see a return to industrial confrontation. The needs of people Who are currently working at the port really need to be taken into account. I am yet to be convinced that a disaggregation policy will improve services to the port's customers. The port has certainly improved its marketing per.formance and this has been reflected in higher turnover figures. I want 'to comment in the time. I have remaining on the value of the port of Geelong to the Geelong community. It is something that ought to be injected into the decision equation when the Victorian government sits down and decides what policy it will pursue with regard to the port. Certainly, the port is a' critical piece of economic infrastructure to the City and to' the region. However, the authority, which has guided its development and its evolution, has played a far wider role in the economic forums of the city and in the life of the city. The Port of Geelong Authority has accumulated specialist skills and knowledge, which have been put to the advantage of the city of Geelong. It has achieved cooperation between management and labour which !think.is a model for enterprises in the Geeloilg region. ' , ' . More Importantly, it has been a catalyst for bringing together the private business community and the government sector. Those of us in Geelong who have been to the port of Geelong dinners, where issues of economic substance have been discussed and representatives of the private sector community and the government sector have come together around the dinner table to chew.over these issues, can see the value of the port of Geelong in that networking process within a local community. In addition,. the Port of Geelong Authority has been a catalyst for undertaking significant lobbying efforts on behalf of the Geelong community. I refer to the lobbying which took place to have the standard gauge route from Adelaide to Melbourne relocated from Ballarat through Geelong. The port of Geelong was one of the coordinating mechanisms that brought the Geelong Regional Commission, the port of Geelong, political players, local eJriployerS, local unions and local government together to pursue that lobbying task and to have the standard gauge rerouted through Geelong. It was a particularly successful undertaking. It was typical of the role that has been played over time by the Port of Geelong Authority in the economic life of Geelong. It would be disappointing to see the Keimett government implement .a policy of disaggregating the port assets and selling them off. It would lead to. the dismembering of the Port of Geelong Authority and the significant loss of this facility to Geelong. (TIme expired)",82

CRIMES (CHILD SEX TOURISM) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Standing Committee Report",84
174,Mr MELHAM,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present' the committee's advisory report,. incorporating a dissenting report, on the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. .ordered that the report be printed.",85
175,Mr MELHAM,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"by leave-I am pleased to be able to present to the parliament the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs' on the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Ame.ndment Bill 1994. I also table the minutes and evidence of the inquiry. On 4. May the committee was asked to consider the biII and prepare an advisory report. Since then we have received 40 submissions; forming over 300 pages of written evidence. We have also taken 350 pages of evidence at public hearings. It has been a tight schedule. . It is important that the parliament should pass a good bill, not just any bill. This bill should not, be passed without some essential amendments. The committee agrees with the objectives of the bill and the efforts to stamp out the conduct targeted by the bilL But we have to be careful. If we act in haste to address the problem of child sex tourism, there will be unintended consequences, including fundamental changes to our standards of justice. We want a model bill-one we 'can be proud.of and one which answers the concerns raised during the second reading ,. debate and during our consideration of the bill. We must get the' legislation right. The report we are tabling today includes 37 recommendations. which are aimed at creating better legislation-.:.better able to achieve its objectives at the same time better able to maintain the standards of justice which are the basis of Australian law. Australians travelling overseas have been able to abuse children sexually and escape the consequences of their behaviour once they have returned to Australia. The same conduct would be criminal if it were perpetrated in Australia. This conduct is repugnant to Australians and to the world, not least because of the devastating effect on children in the countries concerned. A secondary effect of this conduct is that it brings Australians into disrepute. Such conduct should be regarded as criminal, despite the fact that it occurs in other countries. Related conduct perpetrated in Australia-encouraging and benefitingshould also be proscribed in the Commonwealth Crimes Act. From the beginning of our consideration of the bill, concerns were expressed about provisions in the bill which, in the view of many eminent legal practitioners who gave evidence, contain unacceptable changes to criminal law principles and procedures. These include apparent short cuts to assist the prosecution because of the practical difficulties of conducting a successful prosecution. Examples are the reversal of the onus of proof in chiuse 50CC and the arrangements for estimating the age of the child in clause 50FA. The committee believes that certain clauses can be successfully redrafted to ensure the bill is effective and enforceable without abandoningthe safeguards that have been traditional elements of the criminal law in Australia. In reconsidering the bill, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and his department should consult widely with practitioners in' order to discover solutions to some of the practical and legal problems identified by the committee. The committee has been informed by the New South Wales Bar Association and by individual barristers, Mr James QCand Mr Sides QC, that they would be happy to assist the minister with the bill. These offers were made to assist the legislation to pass through both houses on a bipartisan basis. The issue of child sex tourism is an emotive and one, arousing universal feelings of revulsion and hostility. One might suppose that the bipartisan support for the bill's objectives would make the preparation of an advisory report a relatively simple task. However, the emotional and psychological context in which the bill has been studied has threatened to detract from a rational, balanced and considered approach to the draft legislation itself. Committee members have been lobbied by those who fear that the committee has wanted to water down the legislation. These fears are misplaced and misguided. The committee has been concerned to ensure that a bill which has almost universal political support for its fundamental objective is workable and effective. At the same time, it must maintain the presumption of innocence and ensure that persons charged receive a fair trial. If the parliament accepts the recommendations made by the committee in this report, the bill will be a much clearer and more effective piece of legislation. It will provide a stronger deterrent than the current draft, and it will be enforceable. The protection offered to children in countries outside Australia will be greater. Several witnesses urged the committee to put the finetuning of the bill above any considerations of urgency to pass it. The committee was'urgoo to recommend consideration of the bill by the Law Reform Commis:.. sion .. The arguments foX. passing. the .legislaAustralia. tion Jlssoon as possibl- gP to social policy consiqerations. The community,the government and members ofparliam-nt,iilCluding committee members, are anxious .to have the legislation in place as quickly as. possible in order to address the crimes encompassed by the .legislation. Nevertheless,the committee urges the parliament to.takeacc0unt of the legitimate issues and concerns raised by witnesses during the consideration of the bill.Addressing these concerns. will not result in undue delay; rather, delay-;-which should be no more than two months-will be time well spent to ensure the adequacy and effecti veness of the legislation. I thank my fellow members of the committee and the committee secretariat, especially Judy Middlebrook, Kelly Williams, Paula Baker, Gemma Searle and Lorraine Ball, who worked above and beyond. the call of duty. I commend the report to the House.",85
176,Mr CADMAN,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"by leave-I wish to join with the Chairn'lan of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the honourable member' for Banks (Mr Melham), and thank my colleagues on this committee. It has been an intense examination, and it has been' an emotive and difficult topic, given the time that we were allowed and some of the complexities of the legal issues that were raised. The staff mem bers of the committee' have been excellent .in their support and have worked extreme hours. This is the first reference of legislation a House of Representatives committee. It has been an interesting learning curve for us. In future .we will have discussions' with the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) as to the time frame and the prospect of quick responses to complex legislation. We would prefer to see fewer time constraints than we have had in this instance. .' The issues raised in this report ,and those identified by the committee as not being given full attention by the government have been quite diverse. Firstly, the committee realised how difficult it would be to gain sound evidence under the terms of pursuing somebody for a crime committed outside of The former Attorney-:General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), is in the chamber. I know that he would acknowledge some' of the difficuities experienced, first of all, with the war crimes legislation and the concept of pursuing somel,mdy for prosecution, albeit 40 years after the event, with evidence from overseas-bringing witnesses to Australia and cross-examining them hereor with people not understanding Australian law. There isa greater complexity in this legislation. With respect to the possibility of video linked evidence, there may be interference with witnesses as they provide evidence in a studio or in a venue where only. part of the environment can be seen. The prospect of intimidation, bribery and corruption in that process is a matter that concerns the committee. The role of state governments is also of concern to the committee. Much of the licensing process and the process by which paedophiles seeking to visit countries away from Australia's shores on sex tours gather together rests with state governments. State governments must have complementary legislation in place in order for this legislation to work.. The committee proposes that maximum offences be in place for crimes committed against children under the age of 16: We believe that, in sentencing, the courts should take note of the age of children, but that there should be no exception with respect to age, as to the government originally proposed in its legislation. I have a slightly different view from that of my colleagues which is not expressed: in the dissenting report. I find that, on balance; the proposition contained in recommendation 18 may allow otherwise sound prosecutions to fail. The obnoxious character of this trade .leads me to conClude that defence based on belief of age must be proved on the balance of probabilities. I am seeking to reverse the onus of proof on the probability.of.age. I think the defence needs to demonstrate beyond doubt that the person involved in this obnoxious process did have grounds to believe that the person was over the age of 16. My learned colleagues failed to convince me that there' needs to be consistency between laws which. apply to individuals coitlmitting 'an offence within Australia and those which apply to individuals committing the same offence in a foreign country. It is my belief that poverty will lead people to do practically anYthing to survive. Australian citizens and residents should not play any partin the abuse and the sexual exploitation of children under the age of 16 anywhere in the world. In addition, the committee decided that defence should be based on the belief of age. As I have said, we have considered that matter and my view varies slightly from that of my colleagues. We do not believe that consent should form part of the defence. So we have taken a stronger view than the government in that regard. We considered the issue of corroborating evidence and we do not believe that corroborating evidence is necessary. This legislation should be passed as quickly as possible. In light of our submissions and our careful work, the government should consider the legislation and return the House as a matter of urgency.",87
177,Mr DUFFY,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"by leave-As was indicated by the Chairman of the' House of Representatives Standing Committeecin Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), this was a very difficult reference for the committee. As the honourable member for Banks pointed out and as is contained in the foreword of our report, that arose because this issue is' an emotive one. It also arouses very strongJeelings of revulsion and hostility. In that context we, as members of the House of Representatives committee, had to examine in detail the provisions of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill, as we were asked to do. It is a first for this committee.' Most of these matters are referred toacommittee of the other place. On this occasion it was referred to a committee of the House of Representatives. Very briefly, I would like to endorse the comments made by both the previous speakers, the honourable member for Banks and the honourable member for Mitchell, in thanking the secretariat. The honourable member for Banks said that the secretariat went way beyond the call of duty and there is no question that that is correct. I also thank the members of the committee who, on Ii very difficult matter, worked very well together. There are 37 recommendations made by the committee. As is noted by the chairman in the foreword of the report, if the parliament accepts the recommendations made by the committee in this report, the bill will be a much clearer and more effective piece of legislation. That is what we are all about. I want to touch on one particular issue to illustrate the difficulty that we had and what we mean when we say that this bill needs some improvement. Clause 50FC of the bill provided that a judge may direct anew trial for an alternative offence. A day after we started these proceedings, a joint news release was put out by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). It said that the it to government had proposed workable and effective legislation to dramatically improve the chance of securing convictions of Australians who engage in this sordid trade in young children. Whilst every single person in this place agrees with the sentiments behind that; we could not agree that this legislation which we were asked to look at was either workable or effective. In fact, it was anything but that. One example of that was clause 50FC, which is referred to in that press release as part of workable and effective legislation. It was an attempt to reflect the common law position that a jury cannot convict an accused of an offence of an entirely different character from that alleged in the indictment, as set out in paragraph 6.4.1 of our report. This section attracted universal criticism. It attracted criticism from people such as Mr James QC and Mr Sides QC; Mr James's views are set out in paragraph 6.4.2. Even stronger was the criticism from Mr Sides QC. He said: This is an attempt to try and codify a procedural matter, and I fear that hi that attempt there will be miscarriages of justice. The procedures are already there ·to ensure,tl1at justice ,occurs, and I think there ought to be an attempt to qualify, or codify them, or put them in a straitjacket. I think that propOsed section, SOFe, in any shape or form,is necessary., ' The committee therefore recommends that clause 50FC be deleted. The reason I touch on that, is that, if this' committee is to work effectively, ,the ministers concerned-in this instance, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice--:,ought to show a little' more maturity than to' issue a press release on 19 May, after we had our first hearing on 18 May, pouring a bucket on the committee. They said that they rejected assertions that had been made in the standing committee the day before. They asserted that the presumption of innocence' and a fair trial' are established principles of Australian justice and that those rights would not be compromised' by this legislation. We did not agree with that. This bill needed to be tidie'd, up in more ways than one. It was anexe-cise which was extremely interesting. As the honourable member for Mitchell mentioned, it was ,the first time a matter such as this had been referred to a committee of the House of Representatives. We certainly hope that it is not the last time, although I mention another point raised by the honourable - ember for Mitchell - that we would not want the same time constraint placed upon the committee as, was the case with this bill. If we had a little more time, it would have' made it a lot easier on everyone, particularly the secretariat The bill, after we have been through it and have made 37 recommendations, is now workable and effective. Before the examination of this bill by the committee,it was not workable and effective. 1 only hope that the government takes on board the, recommendations of the committee to bring about legislation to stop and properly 'put to one side forever this revolting practice which is taking place and in which Australians are involved.",88
178,Mr WILLIAMS,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"by leave I am delighted' to be able to speak on this report, for more than one reason; Firstly, the bill has come forward with bipartisan support, but as a result of the committee's deliberations I believe it will be in a much improved form. The second point, which was touched do not on by, particularly, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), is that this is the first do not occasion on which a House of Representatives standing committee has had a bill referred to it for review and an advisory' report. In my former capacity as the shadow Attorney General I was delighted to have been, in effect"" responsible for that having happened. The cooperative - anner in which all members of the committee worked together, the resulting report and, if the recommendations are accepted"" the resulting legislation ,will stand as a monument to the participation of committee members in the legislative process. For once, the House of Representatives will, be seen to be participating in the proper drafting of legislation, something that in my experience in this House does not happen. The legislation was adventurous and innovative but unfortunately its format when presented did not strike an appropriate balance between the conviction of those guilty of the repugnant practices to ,which the bill is addressed and the interests of justice and, protection of those who' are unfairly or wrongly accused-the protection of the innocent. There was virtual unanimity of view among witnesses that the proper protections of persons accused of the offences to be constituted in the bill were not there. There was unanimity of view, except on one very small point, among committee members as to how those defects could be overcome. I commend the bill to the ministers for their very close consideration in the light of the committee report. The honourable member for Holt mentioned the press release issued by the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Justice (MrKetr) and the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). I endorse entirely what the honourable member for Holt said about the inappropriateness of the intervention of the ministers in that way. It was entirely wrong and based on wrong factual assumptions. I also support the comments ,of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), the chairman of the committee, as to the role of the secretariat staff, whom he named. They worked under considerabJe pressure to produce what,in the circumstances, is a report of a reasonably high standard.. I wish to be associated with the compliments paid to them. The report is important. It· deals with some important issues, including the definition of the very offences that the bil1 is concerned with, the onus of proof, the taking of evidence from overseas witnesses by video link and the proof of age in the absence of forma] records. Each of those issues goes very much to the heart of the administration of justice. I hope that this wil1 be a mode] for future consideration of legislation that would benefit in its formulation from detailed review and criticism and detailed participation by interested community groups. The response from the public in relation to this bil1 has been tremendous. It has all been in one direction-getting it right. There was no witness who gave evidence who in any way sought to detract from the objectives of the bilI.",89
179,Mr STAPLES,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"by leave-At the outset I would like to add my thanks to the members of the secretariat for their assistance in this very rushed process. The report we now have on our desks in parliament is literally hot off the press. That indicates a number of things which we do not need to go into other than has been expressed so far. I joined this committee only recently, Not having had any legal background, unlike most of my colleagues on the committee, I perhaps approached thiS matter from a different perspective and without the expertise or experience to comment on the more detailed technical aspects of the ]egalities of justice. One thing that we sometimes take for granted which we should not is our system of justice and also, to a certain extent,the standards in our society that have led us to appreciate the way in which people should be treated if they are accused of any particular crime or action in our society. We have developed .a system of justice over many centuries and, by and large, it works quite well. In other regards, we have standards in our society which are relatively new. While some may seek to criticise the systems in other countries where life can be considerably cheaper, it was only a short while ago that child labour and slave labour existed in our COllfitry. So we need to put that into perspective. My concerns· arise because during the conduct of this inquiry I gotea Jot of letters, as did other members. Very: few dealt with the ]egalities that the committee was considering in attempting. to get this bil1 right, and most agreed. with the committee that something had to be done and done quickly. I am concerned that many people were dealing with the issue in a less than legal framework, and were either misinformed or underinformed. I hope this report puts their minds at rest. Mention has been made that this is a model bil1; in fact, it should be a mode] bil1. We are embarking upon an extraterritorial form of legislation which is important in our region. As I understand it, we are the only country in our region to have legislation like this-some European countries have this sort of legislation-and as we are part of this region it is important to have this]egislation. It should not simply be a matter of model ]egislation. I think it also goes to a model of action. I draw the attention of the House to paragraph 2.16 in the report regarding the protection of witnesses. I think the intent of this legislation is something that very. few people in Australia and, indeed, other countries would find any argument with. My concern is that we make sure that this Jaw does what it sets out to do-that is, protect the children that we are seeking to protect from the actions of those Australians who do not have that attitude. My concern is that, should a case be brought before an Australian court, the Australian government and the prosecution have the responsibiJity of ensuring that a person, particularly a young chi]d,is given the full and total protection using every· resource possib]eand available to the Australian government. The last thing anyone would want to see is a prosecution against any person leading to any threat to a witness. We are all aware that in some countries big issues and lots of money are involved for the people involved in this trade, whether they bemilitary, police or others. I fear very much that any child used as a witness in a case like this would be at serious risk. That is ve(y .much a responsibility in bent upon· the· ministers, who· quite correctly bririg this forward, to. make sure that - and I would seek this commitment from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and anyone else concerned - every resource be brought to bear to protect any witness who was brought forward in this circumstance .. It is relatively difficult even within the Australian context, where we have some control, to ensure the protection .of witnesses, but a child in such a high risk situation, as he or she would obviously be in this event, would be even further at risk. I would not want it on my head,and I do not think anyone else would, that a law, if it were not backed up by action on the ground, to protect a child witness or anyone else could be responsible for even greater physical harm than occurs to that witness at the moment. That brings into play issues around the way Australia should be directing its aid resources and, both in a general framework, as highlighted in paragraph 2.16, and more specifically, how it should - be, directing those sources to protect any child involved in any case before this legislation.",90
180,Mr SINCLAIR,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"'by leave - I wanted to speak for several reasons. First, for the last parliament and this parliament I have been a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, yet in this particular inquiry I have played. no part. I have been overseas and therefore was unable to participate either in the taking of evidence or in the subsequent considerations .. For that reason I am able to step back a· little and at arm's length say· to the chairman, deputy chairman and members of the committee that I think they have reason to be proud of the work that they have done. To the staff, in particular, I would like to extend my compliments because I think it was not easy to complete the report in the form they have in the time available. l'hereport is a tribpte to them. . The second and perhaps.more fundamental reason. is that, as one who long ago had reservations about the way this House could best consid-r legislation, and who was in part responsible for there no longer being legis lacum- tioncommittees of this House, I think this report shows to the government an excellent way difficult and complex pieces of legislation can be examined, dispassionately and on a bipartisan basis on Jllatters of principle, reasonable accord reached and far better legislation, evolved. The one qualification I have is that I. regret that my good friend the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) is not in the House tonight to listen to this 'debate. Ministers need to understand .that for al! that they hold for the time being a high and mighty responsibility, they are after all initially members of this place and would - o well to listen to debates such as this and to participate in consideration of legislation for which ultimately they are responsible -.In that respect I am pleased to note that there is some reference to the need for complementary legislation. There is also reference---:I think it is recommendation 36-to the need for the ministers to consult with members of the New South· Wales Bar Association and with senior counsel who have offered advice and tendered re- evidence to the committee and whose advice I believe would be helpful in the redraft of the legislation which this report recommends. On the detail of the report, there. are three issues I want to raise. The first is that as one who has been involved, through my wife Rosemary Sinclair, with the prevention of child abuse in Australia. I am very much in favour of the purport of this legislation, but I am also in favour of the videotaping of evidence of children. Chief magistrate Ron Cahill of the ACT initiated this form of taking evidence. For all that I recognise the difficulties involved, I believe it essential that in the nature. and character of evidence being taken from abroad videotaping of the evidence of children. be permitted in this legislation. The second issue is that, nonetheless, I think we need to be aware of the onus of proof arid of the absolute need for any type of legislation not to deprive an accused. person of the rights of the presumption of innocence. I believe it is necessary to get a proper balance between those two. It is essential that there be capacity. to. take. video evidence in this field. The third issue I wanted to touch on is my concern that in the nature of the report a number of errors have been apparent. One'is the question of trying to determine the age of a child. It is absolutely essential that we do not leave the successful prosecution of an offence that takes place outside Australia to the determination of whether or not a child is under 10. That is ari extraordinarily difficult decision to take. I note the reservations entered by my .colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) with respect to the whole question of the presumptions and the beliefs that .an individual has, but at the time-his reservations will have to be proved on the balance pf probabilities-my concern !s that it is importanlthat there be a change In that age restraint. I am pleased to see that that has been recommended by the committee. I strongly recommend that to the government' because I think it is a sensible and necessary amendment. There are a number of matters which relate to the extent to which there is a constitutional capacity of '. the Australian parliament to address this type of legislation. I am quite convinced that it can be undertaken under the external affairs power. For that reason I have no doubt regarding the validity of the legislation. For all I noticed. that there was some evidence, contrary to that, I believe that there is a constitutional power. I commend the report, I commend the. committee and I trust that the government will introduce the amended legislation. as expeditiously as possible. MrLATHAM (Werriwa)""""':by leave-In speaking in support of the advisory report of the Joint Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 I wish to d.raw attention to three very important provisIOns. The firSt is the recommendation to increase penalties for those who derive profit and financial benefit from child sex' tourism to match the proposed penalties in the bill for those engaging in sex with children overseas. This is a very important provision because it proves to anyone suggesting that the committee's report, waters down the provisions of the bill that they are dead wrong-dead..set and totally wrong. 'foincreasethe penalties for sex. tourism operators arid organisers effectively targets the best pra'etical outcome from this legislation. The exploitation of children is bad enough,. but ;tour organisers not only exploit children; tbeyalso exploit those who have. a mental illness and who are disturbed enough to engage initheseactivities overseas. To exploit the exploiters, in my assessment, justifies a penalty, equal to the .17 years' imprisonment· proposed in the bill for those engaging in sex with children ()verseas. This recommendation in the report beefs up the most practical aspect and penalty that can same apply to make sure that these activities are not coming out of Australia' and engaged, in by Australian citizens. I also draw the attention of the House to the important way in which the report places a better balance on community expectations that arise out of the legislation. On an emotional issue like this there is sometimes a problem. The public expectations will run way ahead and well beyond any practical capacity of any legislation to get the desired results. In many r-pects the number of successful prosecutions WIll depend on the resources provided to the - ustralian Federal Police anq the prosecutors Involved .. But, most importantly, we should understand that the principle of deterrence underscores the legislation. This is also safety net legislation, not taking over the responsibilities of overseas parliaments to enact the correct legislation. I draw the attention of the House to an important part of the submission provided by the Attorney-General's Department that states: The .p-ilos?phy underlying the proposed offence provIsIons IS one of deterrence. The provisions are designed to act as a net to catch offenders who are found to have escaped the criminal justice system of the foreign country where the act has occurred. The prit)1ary responsibility for protecting children from sexual exploitation continues to rest, as it should, with the countries where the children are exploited. ' ' That very important :part of the submission, reflected in the report, should be made known to those organisations that have high expectations ,about the outcomes that will arise from the legislation. . The. quote from the submission of the Attorney-General's Department also makes mention of the great responsibilities of host nations. In this respect, once the bill is reintroduced and, I am sure, passed by both houses of patH ament, the government has a responsibility to adopt a regional approach to this issue, not to sit back having passed our own legislation. In all bilateral discussions and international forums we should actively urge the nations involved to take the· correct action in ratifying the convention on the rights of the child arid to enact in their own parliaments all the necessary legislation needed to make sure that child sex tourism occurs nowhere in the east and south Asian and South Pacific regions. I draw the attention of the House to the that India, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos have acceded to the convention on the rights of the child introduced by the United Nations in November 1989, but have not yet signed or ratified it. Malaysia has neither acceded to, signed nor ratified the convention. As our ministers visitthese countries and engage in discussions they could do nothing better than to urge ratification of and compliance with that convention to make sure the regional approach produces effective legislation in Australia and effective outcomes in each of the host nations. I join with the other members of the committee in thanking the secretariat and the entire committee for their consideration and work. This is a report that, when adopted by the government and reintroduced into the House, will substantially improve the effectiveness and fairness of the legislation. I am sure it will be welcomed by all Australians who have a concern about this very important issue.  bate on the study of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 marks an important innovation. This is the first time we have followed the practice, well tried in the Senate, of referring a bill to a standing committee of this chamber during its passage through the House. It is worthwhile noting the role that the former opposition spokesperson on legal affairs, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), and the current spokesperson, Senator Vanstone, played in the decision of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). Members on this side of the House have often spoken. about the need for time to adequately examine the implications of legislation. We are constantly warning the government of the unintended consequences of poorly considered and drafted legislation. I welcome the opportunity we have had.· to consider the legislation in more detail. It is a particularly positive step to be able to review this bill,especially given the issues and the sensitivities involved. As has been said by my friend the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), the issue of prostitution is an· emotive one. When it fact comes to child sex, the. emotions are more extreme. Everyone regards paedophilia as repulsive. The notion of child sex tourism and the carefully considered exploitation and abuse that it involves is even more repugnant. When we are faced with legislation on a matter that incites these emotional extremes, it is important that we can examine it in a calm and reasonable way. The concerns that have been raised over this bill show just how important detailed review and consideration can be. lt has been suggested that the bill reflects a tendency· to subtly reshape our criminal justice system so that, in effect, presumption of innocence is replaced by presumption of guilt. The Queensland Law Society and the International Commission of Jurists have warned that special care must be taken to ensure that this law does not· erode rights to a fair trial. Other witnesses have also echoed this view. There are fears that the many provisions. of the legislation are short cuts to conviction, that the onus is on the accused to prove his or her innocence, and it has been suggested that these aspects of the bill could create opportunities for blackmail. As the report has said, it is vital that the bill uphold the legal protections afforded to accused persons which are at the heart of Australia's criminal justice system. There have been concerns over the costs involved in administering the bill. The Australian Federal Police Union told the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that it believed that any law could not be enforced without a substantial increase in resources. The costs of defending a charge brought under this bill are perhaps even more concerning. Many of us in this parliament are already concerned that too many Australians get the justice they can afford rather than the justice they"" deserve. The evidence the committee received suggested that actions brought under these proposals could cost up to $400,000 to defend, leading to forecasts of two classes of defendants-those who can buy a thorough defence and those who rely on video links. There are also concerns over how it will be possible to prevent overseas coercion and enforce the laws of perjury and"" the like against foreign nationals in foreign countries. Finally, it is important to reiterate the report's statement that the committee has worked to produce a widely acceptable, workable and effective bill, not to water down the legislation. Three ministers-the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Justice, and the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley)-have already heavied the committee with a joint media"" release on the bill, despite the many concerns that have been expressed. It is worth noting-I remind the House that this is not the first time the Minister for Justice has failed to take the advice of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) on an important legal issuethat not so long ago, on the Crimes (Search Warrants arid Powers of Arrest) Bill, I had cause to talk to the Minister for Justice about his lack of support for the sensible views of the honourable member for Banks. It would be a great shame if ministerial standover merchants prevented further opportunities for furthet scrutiny of legislation when we have just learnt how it can improve such laws. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with a request for amendments. Ordered that the requested amendments be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate s requested amendmentsNA No. 1Clause 2, page 2, after subclause (4), insert the following subclause: ""(4A) Item 12A of the Schedule is taken to have commenced on1 January 1994."". No. 2Schedule, page 5, after item 12, insert the following item: "" ""12A. After section 7 .in Part 2: Insert: Concession to parental assets test -8. In detennining what benefit is payable under this Part, a parental assets test"" is not to be applied in the calculation of a student's living allowance if the parent is entitled to a Health Care Card issued by the Department of Social Security for the purposes of the National Health Act 1953.'."".",91
181,Mr FREE,SCHEDULE A,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) (6.46 p.m.)-I move: That the requested amendments be not' made. The government does not accept this request for amendments, which would have the effect of virtually removing the assets test from Austudy. The amendment is totally extraneous to the subject matter of the bill which relates to matters such as better benefits control measures and a legislative basis for Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children scheme. The opposition claims to support these measures but it is apparently prepared to put them atrisk by introducing an additional provision which it knows must be unacceptable to the government. The matter of the health care card provision has already been extensively aired in both chambers. The brief history of this matter is that an error in publicity material led some students to obtain Austudy on the strength of their parents or spouses holding a health care card, without the application of an assets test. Staff in the department's student assistance centres have been advised of this and the affected clients are being contacted by mail. Eligible students whose parents have a health care card will be able to receive Austudy until their parents' current card expires. Then payment will stop only where family assets exceed the Austudy limits. This should ensure that students whose parents have health care cards are treated equitably. The Attorney-General's Department is being instructed to· draft .an amendment to the Austudy regulations to ensure that students who are paid Austudy because a parent or spouse holds a health care card and who subsequently lose their entitIementwhen an assets test is applied will not have an overpayment raised against them. . On the question of students receiving benefits contrary to the Austudy legislation, legal advice has been given by the AttorneyEmployment, General's Department that payments made the strength of. a health care card have been contrary to the Austudy legislation. There is no evidence that any significant numbers of families were expecting to receive benefits and have been disadvantaged. Only a handful of families who received Austudy initially because of holding a health care have so far had to be reassessed, on expiry the card, because of assets. I remind the House that these are families whose assets generally have a net market value in excess of $700,000. However, now that the government has contrived to give the matter a great deal of publicity, if it were to agree to waive the assets test for health care card be expected that many asset rich but income poor persons, not necessarily primary producers but other business people with successful tax minimisation strategies, would obtain a health care card for the sole purpose of qualifying for student assistance payments. The cost could be in excess of $10 millidn a year. For that reason, the government will not agree to the Senate's amendments.",94
182,Mr ANDREWS,SCHEDULE A,"Menzies) (6.50 p.m.)The purpose of these amendments, which were moved in the Senate and carried with the support of not only the opposition but also the minor parties, in effect is to legislate for the government's stated commitment last year to waive the assets test, which it later reneged upon. The history of this matter ought to be set out at least briefly again on this occasion, because it indicates the reasons why the coalition is of the view that these amendments ought to be carried. Following last year's budget, in fact, in September of last year, a press release from the Department of Employment; Education and Training stated: Effective January 1, 1994 students from families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for maximum AU STUDY entitlements, w.ith means and assets tests waived. This measure is especially beneficial to low income families which are not on Department of Social Security or Veterans' Affairs benefits. That statement was then followed up in a series of publications from the Department of Education and Training,. the on most notable of which was the official not Austudy 1994 guide, A guide to parent finance, which is published jointly by the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training and the National Union of Students. In numerous places in this guide-and this goes to the students who are card or may think they are eligible for student of assistance under the Austudy scheme and their parents-is a statement such as this one: From 1994 your spouse's income will generally be disregarded for the period your spouse holds a Health Care Card. And: From 1994 the assets of both you and your spouse generally will not be counted if your spouse holds holders it could a Health Care Card. One could read on in other places throughout this guide. Quite clearly it is stated as official departmental policy that, if a health care card is held, the assets test which normally applies to the families of students in the situation applying for Austudy would be waived. It is that stated commitment, made in no less than five separate documents, on five separate occasions that I am aware of that we seek to hold the government to in relation to these particular amendments which were moved in the Senate. As I indicated when this bill was in the House previously, I was looking at the possibility of whether it was technically possible for these amendments to be drafted and incorporated as part of this bill. The advice was that that could be done and, therefore, the amendments were moved. I believe that it is an indication .of the seriousness of this matter that not only the opposition, in moving these amendments in the Senate, thought that the commitment which the government had made ought - obe honoured but also that other parties in the Senate, on reflection, believed that this commitment ought to be honoured. For the government simply to say, as it does here again on this occasion, that it cannot afford to honour these commitments or somehow that it ,will lead to more people making use of this particular prpvision than would otherwise make use of it is simply to ignore the fact that, in the first place, it was its stated commitment that was repeated on numerous occasions to students that led to this situation coming about. We are not sure what the size of the problem is. The minister says again today that there is no evidence that any significant number of families would not receive the benefit because of the changes that the government has made. But, of course, one can never telI exactly what the size is. We have been told by the government on numerous occasions. First of all the government said that there was something like $25 million involved. Then it was said that it was $10 million. We were told in one estimates committee that only 100 people would be involved, and the minister has said again today that there is no evidence Of any large numbers that would be involved. But, as the National Farmers Federation pointed out in a letter to the minister dated 27 September last year: Statistics provided to the NFF by the Departme-t of Employment, Education and Training indicate that in 1993 only 0.16 per cent of rural students applying for Austudy failed to receive assistance because of the assets test. The National Farmers Federation goes on to point out: In our view, the statistics do not give an accurate indication of the numbers of rural people who would like to undertake further education, but are unable to because of the Government's policy on asset testing. That organisation points out there that we simply do not know what the numbers are. If people are told that there is a provision which is not open to them, then they will not bother to apply in the first place. Therefore, ,to say that we have any idea of the numbers involved is simply nonsense. The minister made some comments about the fact that no overpayment - otices will be made where these payments have been provided and that parents of students, where the health care card was in existence and they applied for and were granted Austudy, will be able to continue to receive Austudy until the card expires. That can create the iniquitous situation for some students whereby, if a health care card expires after a period of six months and that six months just happens to be durJng their educational year, they could find themselves,having made provisions 01' arrangements for their education, in the position where some time during that course or that year those arrangements no longer obtain and, therefore, they have to face a wholly different financial situation. If the minister had said that those students could retain Austudy at least for the period of 12 months for which they had made some arrangements in relation to their education, then it would have been a much fairer system than he has indicated will exist under the provisions which he is indicating will apply should this amendment not be passed. But it does not deal with the exact problem in hand. We have students, particularly in rural areas of Australia, whose educational opportunities are clearly fewer than those in other parts of the nation. For example, the rural communities in Victoria issued a report, Austudy rural inequities, in which they pointed out that many families in rural areas of Australia have not the same educational opportunities, as do their cousins in the urban and city areas of Australia. They give examples, which I will not go into tonight, of three families. Even though the families would be regarded as being in a poor situation financially, because of the operation of the income and assets tests, those children generally do not have the same opportunities. Then we have reports going back to July last year. For example, there is Rural education crisis, which shows the percentage of total population participating in tertiary studies in different regions of Victoria. In the inner Melbourne metropolitan region it is 6.9 per cent and in the metropDlitan regiDn it is 4.4 per cent. But, when we gD .out tD the rural areas .of VictDria, in nDrth-eastern VictDria it is 2.3 per cent; in the nDrth Mallee, 2.4 per cent; in east Qippsland, 2-6 per cent; in the Wimmera, 2.7 percent; .in the GDulburn Valley, 2.7 per cent.. The VictDrian cDuntry average is .only three per .cent cDmpared tD an average .of 4.4 per. cent in· the. metrDpDlitan areas. Again th-s.quite clearly in'dicates ,the inequality in terms .of access to educatiDn .of students in rural areas .of Australia. The 1991 repDrt DftheNatiDnal BDai'd .of Employment, EducatiDnand Training reported that nDn-metropolitan yDung adults are participating in higher educatiDn at .one-half the rate .of their metropDlitan cDunterparts. One cDuld adduce mDre evidence frDm the fact that it is quite clear that the DPPDrtunities fDr rural students tD participate in tertiary and higher educatiDn, in many cases because'of financial cDnstraints, are simply not the same as they are fDr their rural counterparts. The minister may say that is an issue that .ought tD be addressed in .other ways and that there .ought tD be prDgrams in existence tD ensure that that is the case. But we are saying here, 'quite clearly, that this is a case where there can be nD questiDn at all that tltere was a stated cDmmitment-a cDmmitment made by the department in a press release; a commitment made by the department in terms .of the .official publicatiDn which wenttD thDusands upDn thDusands .of students and their families through .out Australia; aCDmmitment made in the applicatiDn fDrm for Austudy which, when we clearly read it, indicates that the health care card will lead tD the waiving .of the assets test; and in .other dDcumentatiDn; We are simply saying here that,having made a , cDmmitment tD the students of Australia and their parents, this gDvernment DughttD hDnDur that cDmmitment .and hDnDur it in a way which is fully in line with what it said at the time. It is interesting, perhaps ironical, that when Newell, N. J. this matter was raised in; I think, February .of this year the first response by a spDkesman fDrthe minister was that the gDvernment will attempt tD hDnDur its cDmmitment, suggesting that it knew that it was a commitment that it had made and it was nDtmerely, as the minister has pDinted .out again tDday, an errDr made bysDme unknDwn bureaucrat in the Department· .of EmplDyment, EducatiDn ·and Training. Whether Dr not it was, the respDnsibility rests with the gDvernment because it has said quite Clearly in a whDle series .of docu:ments that this wDuld be provided. It was i welcDmed at the time and, having been welcDmed, we believe the gDvernment .ought tD stand by its cDmmitment. QuestiDn put: That the motion (Mr Free's) be agreed to.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1994-95 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 May, on motion by Mr Willis: That the biII be now read a second time.",95
183,Mrs CROSIO,AYES,"prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (7.11 p.m.)-When speaking to Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1994 I think we have to take into account the white paper initiatives that are incorporated in the budget because it is a package that has tackled the most important problem facing thiS nation today-that is, unemployment. This package not onlyestabAYES lishes.the economic fundamentals that will set Australia on the' course of continued low inflationary growth but also delivers real, immediate benefits to the people on the NOES ground. The budget contains many innovative programs, but perhaps more importantly it contains vision:... - vision of an Australia with a five per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000 and vision of an Australia where the long-term unemployed are assisted back into the work force. Of cOurse, the opposition has been quite confused about this over the past few weeks. ori the one hand, the former Leader or the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), told the H04se· that the government has run up the white flag of surrender on full employment by aiming for an unemployment rate of some five per cent while; on the other hand, he said that five per cent unemployment is unattainable and should not even be aimed for. I think history will record with regard to the former Leader of the Opposition that it is probably the first time in any parliament that a leader of the opposition has spoken on a budget and 10 days later been deposed by his party as leader. I will not dwell on the statements of members of the opposition because, by their own reaction to this budget, I believe PAIRS they have made themselves largely irrelevant. I regard the job compact as one of the most important initiatives in 11 years of Labor government. I represent an electorate with an unemployment rate of 24.7 per cent.",98
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,Mr Snow)Order! Not only are honourable members standing but they are also talking. Would they please give attention to the honourable member for Prospect.,98
185,Mrs CROSIO,AYES,"The opposition is quite irrelevant in this House so whether its members stand, talk or whatever does not worry me particularly. But I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your .consideration and for bringing them back to order. As I was saying, my electorate has an unemployment rate of some 24.7 per cent, while 54.4 per cent of those unemployed people in my electorate have been out of work for more than 12 months. That compares with the national average of 45 per cent. I can assure the House that I have seen first-hand the misery that has been caused by long-term unemployment. The social costs of the long-term unemployed are obvious. Not only do we get income from aur jobs, but also we get our feeling of worth, our day-ta-day reason for existence, from' employment. The Australian economy is also missing out on the many years of experience that thesepeoplecoutd bring to industry. All honol,Jrable members, I believe, would have heard stories.about long term unemployed people who are well qualified for jobs they are applying for but are overlooked because many employers feel that, because they have. been unemployed for a long period of time, there must be something wrong with them. The job compact is a way to reintroduce the long-term unemployed to the work force. This is a very worthwhile and vital role for an effective government in the 1990s. By instituting the job compact the government is sending an important message-that employment in modem Australia is a right. It is a message that is fundamental to any social democracy. This government has really met objectives in delivering the goods for the long-term unemployed. I was very pleased to read an article by Geoff Kitney in the Sydney Morning Herald on 4 May. He stated: The job compact is a bold and imaginative concept that seeks to deal with a problem that no one been able to deal with effectively. When Mr Kitney said that no-one has been able to deal with the problem effectively he was, of course, including overseas governments. I was pleased to note th-the waincluding governments based in the United States as well as in the United Kingdom. We are acting bravely and compassionately in helping the long-term unemployed. Our· economy and our society will be the better for it. The introduction of individual case management is an important initiative. Unemployeci people could not be blamed for sometimes thinking that they are just another statistic. will be an enormous help for these people to have one contact,· with the CES or other employment agency, which knows their case, who cares about .them and who particularly takes on board the best way in which to assist them back into the work force. With the establishment of case management this will now be the reality of many clients who aTe presently regisiered with the CES. Those who are involved in the job compact, those in the youth training initiative, or those who. are regarded as a high risk of becoming long-ten'll unemployed will have an individual plan of as-istance drawn up for them and will have their progress monitored by an individual officer. . I w-s particularly pleased to see that the government has set the target of some 50,000 new apprenticeships and traineeship places by the year 1995-96. History has shown that an economic downturn does have severe effects on apprenticeships. The Carmichael report noted that it took until 1986-87 for apprenticeships to recover to their pre-1981 reces. sion levels. That is why I was particularly pleased to see that the government is promoting the extra apprenticeship· and. traineeship places. Even though industry may be reducing places on the ground because of incapacity to pay, the economy would be suffering from a very serious skills shortage for years to come if apprenticeships were not increased. The extra places will be created, I am pleased to say, in a number of ways. Employers will be given more incentive to take on has those apprentices and trainees. .Employer payments will be increased from their current levels to make it more worthwhile for employers to take on apprentices; In addition, the government will provide increased funding of $1.1 billion over a four-year period, 1993-97, to increase the number of TAFE places that are provided. A large number of apprenticesare employees of state governments, and state governments must seriously consider the human ramifications of cuts in apprenticeships. I would ask them to consider entering· into the spirit of the Commonwealth's initiatives in promoting extra places for our·youf.lg. people. It Other initiatives will see the jobsearch allowance.for people under 18 replaced with the youth training allowance. The youth training alJowance will be paid when the individual is undertaking training as welJ as looking for work. A whole range of e,conomicand social factors have led to a reduction in the demand for unskilled workers. The shift away from the primary and manufacturing sectors towards the service sector,means that employers are demanding young workers .with some training in the service industry. In addition, the advent of new technology means that the entry level jobs that used to be taken up by our young people are now very much different. The fax machine, for example, has certainly made the messenger boy redundant. The simple fact is that changes hi the world economy mean that people entering the work force for the very first time must be well trained .if they are to have a chance.. The youth training initiatives give them that chance. The national training wage will also greatly encourage employers to hire more workers as well as contributing to making Australia one of the most skilled nations in the world. Economic analysts show that employers will not. hire more staff just because wages come down. But, with theJraining wage initiative, employers not only have reduced the cost of hiring but also know that they will have a better trained work force and the benefits that flow on from improved training. The ACTU and many employer groups have endorsed the national training wage. Honourable members will understand my intense interest in this subject when I share with them the following quote from a brief on unemployment in my electorate that came from a document from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Educatiori and Training (Mr Snowdon). It says: The Fairfield region has' felt the greatest impact retrenchment from the manufacturing and construction industries in the south west Sydney area. The group which has been most affected by these retrenchmerlts is the unskilled labourers who are likely to face difficulties in the economic upturn when competing for jobs amongst job seekers who have better skills. ' I applaud any initiative which assists relatively unskilled people back into the work force. I particularly congratulate all ministers who . , were involved with, and responsible for this package. As mentioned in the budget, there are a number of changes to the actUlil social security system as we know it.. I have always believed that the welfare system, no. matter how good it is, must change to meet the changing times and we also must recognise if there are anomalies within it and take action to correcttllem. However, changes to social security recently announced by the government represent a very significant improvement to the system. A new situation calls for a new policy. We all know that the labour ,market has gone through enormous changes since the social security system was founded, and it is only natural that the system should be reshaped to suit the new situation. We all know that part-timejobs are increasingly popular both amongst' employers and prospective employees. It is also an undeniable fact that'many people take on part-time or casual work as they wait for full-time work The recently announced changes, I am pleased to say, recognise this reality and have made it financially worthwhile for unemployed people to accept part-time work. The new parenting 'allowance to be introduced from July 1995 is a very innovative and worthwhile initiative. The parenting allowance will reintroduce an element of choice for many families, allowing one parent to stay at home and care for the children. One parent will receive the parenting allowance free of any obligation to seek work. The payment will be available to low income families and families where one of the partners is unemployed. The parenting allowance will have a particularly large impact on my electorate of Prospect. One-third of the residents of the city of of Fairfield, which covers most of my electorate, are younger than 18. The female labour force participation rate in Fairfield is 58.4 per cent, and the state average is 64.8 per cent. It is obvious that the parenting allowance ,will benefit my electorate of Prospect greatly because the high percentage of parents who are already staying at home to care for their children will gain that extra benefit. , More evidence of the positive effect that the parentiQg allowance will have on families within my electorate can be obtained from figures on family income. As the, publication Families in Fairfield by the Ettinger HO,use Fairfield Family Resource Centre pointed out, 16.9 per cent of two-parent families with one dependant in Fairfield earn between $12,000 and $20,000 a year. The corresponding average for New South Wales is only 11.5 per cent, so any proposal to assist low income families with one parent staying at home is great news for my people. In this the International Year of the Family, what better initiative could there be? It is a very practical and valuable effort which shows that our government's commitment to the family is greater than mere words. Another initiative in the budget that I am sure all honourable members will join me in welcoming is, of course, the recogniti.on of Australia's World War II mariners. I know of many people within my electorate who served in an indirect capacity in World War II, whether. it was as.a merchant mariner, a member of the Women's Land Army, or even as someone who took an active part in the defence of Darwin. The simple fact is that World War II was a time when the efforts of every single individual were required to be maximised to ensure our survival as a nation and the survival of our freedom. Not everyone could be directly involved in the so-called war action, but all the people who contributed their efforts in World War II were heroes. They were nothing less than heroes, and they deserve our continuing thanks and support. The budget announcement that World War II merchant mariners would be covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act is a very practical way of showing them our thanks for what they have done. . I was also very pleased with a number of theheaIth measures within our budget. I was particularly delighted with the allocation for extra funding for the fight against breast cancer. I recently had the pleasure of welcoming to my electorate of Prospect the federally funded mobile breast cancer screening unit, which is now located in Fairfield for a number of months. I would like to thank particularly the two local papers in my electorate, the Fairfield City Champion and the Fairfield Advance, for publicising this service and letting women avail themselves of the opportunity to be screenedI was also delighted that more funds. have been allocated for the fight against breast cancer; It is, of course, an insidious disease that spreads through every part of Australian society. It is a disease that every woman in Australia is at risk of contracting. One in 16 Australian women will contract breast cancer during her lifetime. There are 5,000 new cases detected every year and 2,000 Australian women die of this disease each year. I refuse t.o accept that these deaths cannot be prevented. The allocation for breast cancer screening has been increased by $14 million in the 1994-95 budget, bringing the total funding to $41.8 million. I was also very pleased with the grant of $1 mill ion .per year for· the next three years to a foundation to be administered by the Ci:ancer Society to raise funds for breast cancer research. The government will also encourage private contributions by matching any private donation dollar for dollar up to a further $1 million per year; One thing I do regret, however, is that this issue has to be, to a certain extent, and has become, a political football between state and federal governments. An issue such as this should be above politics. I was glad to see the Premier of New South Wales welcome the increased allocation in the budget by our government for breast cancer. Another major initiative in the health field which received a substantial allocation in this budget is the national prevention strategy for child abuse and neglect. Twelve million dollars have been allocated to this program over four years. For too long child abuse has been treated with ad hoc programs which do not have prevention as their major aim. Child abuse is one of the major problems facing this country. There' ate 50,000 reported cases of suspected child abuse every year. The government must continue to do everything in its power to protect the most helpless members of our society, our children. Furthermore, it is obvious that child abuse has ramifications for the individuals involved and for society for years to come. Drug abuSe, homelessness, juvenile crime and mental illness are all partially caused and connected to child abuse. I sincerely hope that this program can assist in the drive to reduce Australia's depressingly high rate of youth suicide .. lam glad to see that the strategy is the result of cooperation between nongovernment - gencies and all three levels of government. It will require all energies to be harnessed in an effective way to. overcome this problem. This· budget takes on tough issues-issues like long-term unemployment and child abuse. This budget ensures that the recovery will be shared between alI of us. The 1994 budget is an imaginative budget, in contrast to what the opposition would have given us. The government had the imagination and ability to deliver the compact which will ease the long term unemployed back into the work force. The government has delivered a training wage which reduces cost and improves the skills base of our work force. It provides. young people with programs to improve training. The government has the imagination to modernise the social security system, to improve the incentive for the unemployed to take part-time work. The government has introduced the parenting allowance to give a boost to low income families in the Year of the Family. The government has delivered policies that try to solve in an integrated and inclusive way the problems that this nation is facing. The budget and the white paper on the commitment given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on election night last year that we would get the unemployed back into work and we would look after them in the meantime certainly deliver. The budget delivers benefits to people in electorates like my electorate of Prospect. To the long-term unemployed, to young people looking for training, to families· on low incomes and to women it delivers continued economic growth. It shares that growth with the less fortunate in our society. It is a budget of which this government can be justly proud. The challenge is now to ensure that the programs contained in the budget are implemented .in such a way so as to maximise fairness and efficiency, It is up to us to ensure that the targets set will now be met.. It is a chalIengethat this government is capable of meeting. I commend the budget and the package to the House. Debate. (on motion by Dr Wooldridge) adjourned. NA",98
186,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being almost 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the Ho.use do. no.w adjo.urn. .Aboriginal Affairs  a much maligned body. It has become a punching bag for almost every problem in indigenous affairs. ATSIC has been operational for only four years, so we can scarcely expect it to have solved the problems two centuries of European settlement has created. Unfortunately, it makes for an easy target by its very nature, the real failure. in indigenous affairs and the lack of coordination between different levels of government, agencies and individuals. As the Chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Standing Committee today said, 'The infrastructure responsibilities of the Commonwealth, the states, territories and local government are unclear.' The standing committee believes that ATSIC is funding services that should be provided by other levels of government and once again wants to see action taken to stop this waste of resources. However, the committee is divided over the level of accountability of the use of resources by regional councils. The Australian Natio.nal Audit Office has reco.mmended that ATSIC encourage regio.nal co.uncils to. document reaso.ns fo.r funding. It has been claimed by go.vernment members o.f the co.mmittee that this wo.uld impo.se bureaucraticacco.untability fo.r po.litical decisio.ns that regional co.uncils have been elected to. make. Further, the majo.rity o.f the co.mmittee repo.rts that the ANAO has so.ught to. establish itself as an arbiter of the appropriateness of regional council decisions, . imposing condiblow-out tions on political decisions not applied other level of government. The coalition members of the committee agree that the ANAO has no right to review the spending priorities selected by regional councils. However, we believe the decision making process over the allocation of funds should be more open. Question marks have been raised over the effectiveness of regional councils in getting money to the areas of real need in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. There are claims that funds are sometimes al10cated on the basis of nepotism. Having to give reasons for funding decisions when they deviate from the regional plan will ensure that the regional councils cannot be properly criticised unless there is a so. So it is in the regional council's interest to give reasons for funding decisions. Apart from anything else, it is common sense when dealing with public money to give reasons why programs have been funded. Although this is not relevant to the report, if the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) had been required to give reasons for funding, she would still be a minister today. Serious al1egations have been made over ATSIC's spending. In one case, it has been claimed that ATSIC funds were used by the Anyinginyi Aboriginal Health· Congress in fact Tennant Creek to provide bogus salary pay11,174 ments to non-existent staff and on personal expenditure covering everything from furniI ture to meals. Peter Shergold, the Chief Executive of ATSIC, told the Sunday program earlier this month that around five cases spending irregularities are currently before state or federal governments. The Sunday program quoted an independent report, the Daffen report, which said: Most of the top level staff in ATSIC lack experiteam ence. The economics and commercial staff are unskilled with no background in their respective areas, with the result that performance on management and commercial matters is extremely poor. . It went on to state: The lack of executive control has led to a major in staff numbers and salaries, with total to any lack of direction and purpose. It recommends that 50 per cent of senior staff positions in the central offic- be abolished and the money saved used to place staff in regions-in all, a total loss of 140 Canberra based positions or 30 per cent of its senior office staff. There have already been claims that the government has lost confidence in ATSIC and that it prefers to work through the Office of Indigenous Affairs in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. As the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) says, the Daffen report endorsed the coalition's policy at the last election. Perhaps the minister will recognise that in due course. ATSIC is doing important work but, if it is to remain credible, accountability at all levels good reason to do remains vital. Border, Mr A. Taylor, Mr M ..",102
187,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (7.34 p.m.)I would like to take this opportunity to add to the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the former Leader of the Opposition on 12 May in congratulating and paying fribute to the former Australian cricket captain, Allan Border. The statistics on Allan Border do not need repeating, apart from the that he is the highest test run scorer, with runs. He also played the most test matches, 156, and played the most as captain. think the most remarkable statistic amongst all that is that, despite playing so many test matches, he still had a test batting average of of over 50, which is in itself remarkable. . I think the most distinctive and memorable characteristic of Allan Border was his fighting qualities-his ability to go out under adversity and rescue Australia so many times when the was in trouble. Basically, his fighting, gutsy qualities really make him the personification of the little Aussie battler. I think it is land those qualities and the way that they were shown so many times on the test cricket field that people will most remember about Allan Border. . I have an additional memory of Allan Border. I can recall in January 1971 a game against him. It was one of his'very first matches for the Mosman cricket club Sydney. I was a youngster playing for the northern district club.' I recall""opening the bowling and taking the first wicket, Then this very short, little left-hander came into bat No. 3 and I thought, 'You beauty, IwiIl knock this bloke over. He does not look like too much of a problem.' I nearly did, too. first ball or two nearly got through. I am afraid to say that after that he treated my bowling in much the same way as he has treated most other bowlers around the world He gave me a bit of a touch up and I was banished to the deep backward square leg boundary. Unfortunately, on this particular ground there was a very short boundary and a leg spinner came on to bowl and kept dropping the ball short. This little left:-hander named A. Border kept bashing the ball straight. at me. Those who have ever fielded behind square leg in a cricket match will know that if the ball bounces in front of a person it usually spins past into the fence. That is exactly what happened to me, The only saving grace for me that day was that my team won the game, despite Allan Border scoring 50-odd runs. Talking of northern district, my former club, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the new Australian captain, Mark Taylor. Mark still plays for northern district, the club that he joined in September 1981. At that stage I was probably a lower grade captain and a selector at the club. I can recall at an early season training session being asked to go and bowl to this new player-also a left-hander, of course-in the nets. I went over and bowled a few, overs to him and he looked pretty good as well. Of course, I would say that is proved.' I was just talking to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) a minute ago. I remember that on that day in 1981 I had to leave practice early and go off somewhere else because it was the day of the New South Wales state election. I was handing out cards for the Labor candidate for the North Shore, against whom the'current federal-member for playing North Sydney was running. Mark Taylor. will bea fine Australian in captain. He has sco'req 4,275 runs at an average not much' under 50. I believe that is a fine,record, and it wellgeteven b-tter as he goes on. I congratulate Mark Taylor. I believe at the change ,in ,leadership of the Australian cricket team will be a lot more successful ,than that other well-pub1icised leadership The change on the opposition benches a few days ago. Cramer, HOD. Sir John",103
188,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT,":I want to join in the condolence motion in memory of the late Sir)ohn Cramer moved earlier today for which I, regrettably, was absen-. I think I am the only member of this place who served in the ministry with him, and I would like to place on record my respect for Sir John for the role he, played in successive cabinets. His biggest achievement was something that mayor may not have been, mentioned earlier today, and that was that throughout the period he was a minister he well and truly kept his feet on the ground and his ear to the electorate which he represented. As many honourable members would know, before and after he was elected he was a real estate agent. While many of us suspect real estate agents, I guess for reasons understood, Sir John, through his real estate contacts, knew so well that North Shore community of which he was part. He made a great contribution, always bringing the debate out of the airy-fairy and back to the world in which we as Australians live. As Minister for the Army, as a devoted father to his children, and as one of the founders of the Liberal Party he made a great contribution to the development of our nation. He was really a great Australian, and on behalf of Rosemary and myself I extend our sympathy to his children and join in the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) earlier today. The Family",104
189,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to finish off the speech on the family that I was responding to this morning inrelati.on to the motion of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) .in which I was defining th- faJliily and how it. has changed over the last.30 or 40 years. Technology h-s changed the\yhole concept of family, and. people are much more mobile than they used to be. Television links us to the rest.of the world withiominutes. of thingshappeiling: All .this rrieansthat newide&s are constantly being fed into soeiety, and thishas an effect on the tole of the family.' . Our challenge in goyernment is to keep up with those changes and to provide. a safety net for those who are not adapting to.'the in easily. We need to look at (jut education system to ensure that children are being equipped properly for finding meaningful employment and we need to look at the use of leisure time now and in the next ctmtury.We need to find adequate ways of ensuring that all the different family groupings can be properly and securely housed with access to transp(jrt and employment. We must also understand the new spiritual needs of people in this changing world. Many religions have already started down the track of understanding this change, but society is still dragging its feet. The federal government is pursuing all these directions' through specific programs, such as family skills training and family mediation, as well as through broader schemes, such as jobtrain and jobskills, plus the range of programs announced in the white paper. This government is dealing with the whole, not sectioning off parts ·ofartificially created groups that once may have fitted into somebody's model. We have to get away from the conservative view of family, because we are not only denying those outside.thisview but also .ignoring an economic unit that deserves much higher' recognition than it is getting. The household sector is the forgotten economy of the Western. world. Governmellt cannot make policy on matters such as unemployment relief and taxation if half the family and a third of the total economy are ignored. We need to. open our minds a little and broaden our family image. .Family can mean a hOllsehold, a street, a community or larger. It really means that we should care for our fellows, especially when they· are in difficulty, and. then' rejoice with them in their successes. I believe that the motion the honourable member for Deakin put forward this morning is not relevant in today's society. I. hope that it is buried in the mists of time that itcame from. . Central Queensland· Uniyersity . Mr NEVILLE (Hiilkler) (7.42 p.m.)-One of regional Australia's leading academic institutions has recently undertaken a quantum leap in regional tertiary education- The University of Central Queensland, now called the Central Queensland University, has taken a new name and corporate identity to reflect its strong and unique partnership with the flourishing Central Queensland region. Covering nearly a third of Queensland, its unique structure allows for' five campuses. Two of them are in my electorate of Hinkler and one is in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). The university-s new corporate image features a coat of arms emphasising that link in a number of ways. The central focus of this emblem is a pale-headed rosella clutching a Byfield fern. The pale-headed rosella, a native of Central Queensland, carries the CQU's new colours of gold, blue and green. The byfield fern, also unique to Central Queensland, is found around the Shoal water Bay area. . The arms also include an open book-that . of learning-and a gold sun, representing the Tropic of Capricorn. CQU's motto, 'Doctrina Perpetua' - Always' Learning-,-is apt when we consider the university's progress over the last 27 years. It has grown from the Queensland Institute of Technology (Capricornia) in 1967 to the Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education in 1971 and then to the University College of Central Queensland, during which time. I was privileged to be. a member of its council. It achieved full universitystatus in September 1991. It is a remarkable achievement and. it mirrors thespectacular growth - n the agricultural, mining, tourism and manufacturing industries in. the region over the same period. The Central Queensland University has developed as an integrated regional university with campuses at Rockhamptoil, Gladstone, Bundaberg, Mackay and Emerald. While to some this structure may seem to weaken the institution, to the contrary, it has strengthened the university and its support within the wider central.community. In the research field, the CQU has formed a number of important cooperative ventures with the CSIRO, the DPI and others, including the Koala Research Centre, the Tropical Beef Centre and the Mariculture Research and Training Centre. It is worth n()ting that the CQU's academic links have also extended well beyond Central Queensland to the Middle East and Asia. The university's international experience has also been used to benefit local companies looking to expand offshore through the· International Business Exchange of Central Queensland. Briefly, I would like to bring to the attention of the House some exciting developments in relation to CQU's two campuses in the Hinkler electorate, with the opening of facilities at both Bundaberg and Gladstone in the near future. This week, after five years of temporary accommodation, the first classes will be held in Bundaberg's new $2.5 million campus, although the complex will not be opened until 22 July. New facilities, such as a 200-seat lecture theatre, air-conditioned tutorial rooms, specific teaching laboratories and extensive landscaping add a new. dimension to tertiary education in Bundaberg. The Bundllberg campus currently caters for 150 full-time stUdents, with others in part-time and external studies offering first-year degree courses in arts, business and education, and sOOltinformation technology. Students may then complete their remaining two years at the. main campus in Rockhampton or elsewhere.' Similarly, Gladstone, with a student body of 600-110 full-time, 70 part-time and 420 external-is· undergoing expansion in both physical and academic senses. The new campus, set spectacularly on the Gladstone Marina, becomes operational this Friday, 3 June, and takes its first undergraduates next month. In line with Gladstone's strong industrial base, the local campus has a focus on engineering, technology and .. environmental management The federal g()vernment has provided $3 million for a new engineering complex which should commence construction around August or September. As well, the government has agreed to build a second engineering building. Together, they will enable Gladstone campus to offer both maintenance and process engineering experiences. I commend the government on these initiatives and trust the commitments it has given to Gladstone and the university will all be honoured. Currently, Gladstone offers first-year degree courses in engineering and information technology, as well as arts, business and education. It also has a course of associate diploma in electrical engineering, vital to Gladstone's expansion.

190,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT," I want to speak on a few subjects tonight. During the recess, forwarded to myparliamentary office was a document called 'From the Privacy Act: Personal Information Digest from the Human Rights Australia Privacy Commissioner'. It is significant that this digest is over 450 pages in length. When we are talking about privacy, it is rather revealing to understand how many people have access to other people's records. The Privacy Commissioner is there to ensure that this information is kept private,within those acts. I was rather surprised today to coincidentally receive a letter from a group of constituents, a firm of chartered accountants, who said: I enClose a copy of a remittance advice and cheque received on behalf of one of our clients from the Aboriginal and Torres· Strait Islander Education Unit. This may not sound strange however our client is neither aboriginal nor a student. An enquiry of an officer of the department concerned stated that mine was the second telephone call he had received today. in relation to cheques which had apparently be forwarded in error. The problem apparently occurred when their computer accessed data bases. within the government computers. Our client is listed with both the Taxation Office and the Department of Primary Industries . . . This matter raises serious concerns. I believe it does, too. Although in this case the person had no relationship whatsoever· with the program, he is to receive a cheque for $168.50. A person of less integrity might just have cashed it. The address for the service of the particular notice was that of the tax agent concerned, so there must have been a link-up between the tax office and the reasons. computers of this program of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education unit. It is a matter of grave concern when we are assured by the Privacy Commissioner in sending out this booklet that this type of would. not happen. It is not the first time has happened. I recently had cause for some concern about the Taxation Office· when a constituent received somebody else's in formaa tion. That other person obviously received the first person's information. I believe more than a digest of what can happen and who has access, to make sure that the privacy of every Australian, particularly of our ation records, is kept in the manner it should be. I could not let this opportunity pass without mentioning probably the greatest game of Allan football that I have seen in my lifetime in the State of Origin last Monday.",106
191,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I thought you were going to refer to Friday night.,107
192,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"Friday night is The another matter. I believe IIIawarra only won with the great effort by that Queenslander Fritz and his forward play. It was a most exciting episode from that point of view but not from any other. It is not in connection with the trumpet of the maroons that I want to speak, although as a Queenslander I thought it was a fine spectacle, particularly the last five minutes, when the Queensland team showed its depth and determination and won the game. Probably the most exciting was the last play and the nine passes that took the game from about three-quarters of the field from one side to the other and provided that touchdown. . I have heard the comment from many a New· South Welshman that if it were not for the two forward passes and the double movement, as they then suggested it was, maybe we would not have got away with it. I take their minds· back to last year's episode, when a try similarly scored by Queensland was disallowed. So the fate of the game depends very much on fate itself. The game was significant for a couple of First of all, nobody in the papers has commented on the fact that there were no brawls within that game. That would be the first time. I have seen such a State of Origin. People have commented in connection with thing the refereeing decisions. I saw some bad this decisions made, But people forget that the wisdom they get by being able to stop the camera and see a person onside or offside or phase of play is· not available to either the linesman or the referee at that time. It is a it requires split second decision. I believe that Queensland:s faith in the referee was tested-and it proved to be taxright-in that he was a New South Welshman. I give credit in those areas. I think Mal ..Meninga and Laurie. Daley are two of the finest sportsmen around. We heard about Border earlier tonight, but I give credit to those two fine sportsmen, as well as to the stage of play, the linesman and the referee. Air Safety",107
193,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (7.52 p.m.)issue of air safety has been highlighted not only by the crash of the DC3 at Kingsford . Smith and the Monarch Air disaster last year but also by the kaleidoscope of policy changes in the management of airports, air safety procedures and the provision of aviation trying to blow infrastructure. The anticipated growth in air traffic of at least six per cent in Sydney for the next few years and thespecffe of privatisation of airports mean that the:problems of safety will move to unimagined Jevels,ofcQmplexity. The rhetoric of the generally excellent record of Australian, air safety ignores the benefits relatively uncliJttered skies and good wea-her rather than outStanding management or sound government policy; Given the controversial nature of air safety and issues such as Badgerys Creek and. the third runway at Sydney, the 'rhetoric of public and parliamentary debate is often extreme. ' It was unforturiate that in, debating, the Excise Tariff Amendnient Bill 1994 the contributions ,of the honourable member for Fadden(Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) contained a mimber of incorrect, superficial and highly damaging personal accusations.' In relatioQ to the DC3 crash, the honourable member for Fadden repeated incorrect press statements that 'no air safety regulations governed the' operation 'of that particular DC3's flight': This was quite wrong. There are many regulations applicable; With the Bureau of Air' Safety ,and the Civil Aviation AuthoritycurrentIyinvestigating, it is irresponsible to prejudge ,and raise public alarm based on superficial press comment. . Statements such as 'aircraft flying over water should be within a one-hour range of alternative landing' are again superficial and wrong. The suggestions by the honourable member for Fadden that nothing is being done about aviation administration and that the CAA·is to blame 'are highly destructive. Many external and internal reviews have heen and are taking place, including those by the Safety Forum, Mr Terrell, Sypher' Meuller, Dr Ratner, and Coopers and Lybrand. , While I can understand the feelings of the honourable member fot Hume on this subject, his naming of CAA officers such as the South-East Regionall""lying Operations Manager, Mr Baston, and 'Mary O'Brien was unnecessary and an abuse of parliamentary privilege. Mr Baston, 'in particular, has a proud and successful 40-year career in the aviation industry, including 18 years in the RAAF. Mary O'Brien has been involved for 30 years. We should be' particularly careful 'in ,reflecting on the professional, reputations of indi.: viduals. Contrary to the·' allegations of the honourable member for· Hume, a great deal of of action took place with regard to Monarch Air and prejudging the outcomes {if investigations by the,Bureau of Air: Safety Investigation; the Civil Aviation Authority and the Coronial inquiry has no public benefit. Again, allegations that an ; airworthiness inspector who recommended grounding Western. Airlin-s in \\frigga Wagga iii 1993 was siaelii1{-d for this action' are, I am informed, incorrect. These accus'aiions should be referred to the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots and' the RegionalAirlines Association to estabiish the facts. . . The naming of people in parliament and media trials ,are no way to address flight safety issues, particularly when the due process cif the correct forums is proceeding. I have no brief for the CAA but, while it is responsible for enforcirl'g' regulations, these regtilationsarid policies are set by governments. In addition, the CAA' does not service or fly planes.lfit grounded every aircraft for breach or suspicion of breach of regulations, then every airline in Australia would stop. No doubt dozens of members would be on their feet emoting outrage at the bureaucratic frustration of commercial operations; There is no question that; as the honourable member for Hume stated, the financial - tatusof operators is a major factor in maintenance- manning and safety, but his suggestion that the CAA should take this' into consideration is misplaced, when regulations clearly prevent such action. Equally, it is outrageous that successive governments have refused to take effective actions, concerningairlirie insurance. The anger and frustration of CAA personnel must be understood at the unsubstantiated comments of members implying :corruption and incompetence, when the air safety budget has been cut by close.to 50 per cent. The safety division has seen a reduction from 700 to 500 staff in the last two years. There is no question that, given. safety funding cuts, deregulation, privatisation, the growth of air traffic and the ineyitable problemsensured by the intensification of air traffic in Sydney with runways carefully aligned with a major oil refinery and the densest population in Australia, a major review of air safety is required. This needs a royal commission or at least a specific parliamentary inquiry, not just parliamentary rhetoric. Antarctica Exhibition",107
194,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"Lyons) (7.57 p.m.}:-I congratulate the Tasmanian .museum and the Victorian museum which have put together in Tasmania an excellent exhibition. entitled - Antarctica ... Secrets of the Frozen World.' It is an exhibition that will be touring the capital cities of Australia and I am sure that every member of this House will be very pleased and very proud to see it. I congratulate the Mercury which has produced a very good supplement and done a lot of work in bringing together the promotional material for this exhibition. I late also the two museums which must have spent a lot of time and effort putting together submissions to the federal governmentwhich is a major sponsor-and the state government of Tasmania.. as well as many private sponsors. The Australian Antarctic Foundation has been a major sponsor and its charter is to encourage and educate people on Antarctica and I. think it is doing very well with this exhibition. Another Commonwealth contributor was the Australian Antarctic Division in Hobart which gave a lot of intellectual support and some of the real things, such as the apple and the living space, in the exhibition. The third Commonwealth agency which is giving support to this exhibition is the Visions of Australia Committee, which I believe is an excellent committee. It helped to promote the best of Australian exhibits by taking them around the country. I recommend the viewing of this exhibition to all members of the House when it arrives in their capital cities and commend it to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

196,Mr GEAR,PAPERS,"The' answer to the honourable member's question is as fol1ows: (1) Yes. (2)(a)-(b) With respect to the 1992/93 income year, a person with an accumulated HECS debt and a taxable income of less than $27748 would not be required to make a repayment tor that year, while a person with an accumulated HECS debt of at least $560 and a taxable income of $28000 would be required to make a' repayment of $560 towards the HECS debt as part· of. the. person's income tax assessment. (2)(b)(i) The deferred option of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme ensures that people with an accumulated HECS debt are not required to repay any part of,their HECS Debt until they can afford to do so. Ability to repay is measured by taxable income. While the person whose taxable income is below the threshold does not have to make a repayment, the person's HECS debt remains to be repaid in future years and is indexed to movements in the consumer price index to maintain its real value.

MrBiineyThe Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: As the Celebrate Australia Promotion in Japan was an initiative of the Australia Abroad Council implemented by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the question originally directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts on Celebrate Australia has been passed to me as the Minister responsible for this matter. (1) Yes. (a) In August 1991 the Australia Abroad Council asked the Embassy in Tokyo to examine the feasibility of conducting a major promotion in Japan and to recommend a strategy for an event best suited to Japan:This was undertaken by the Ambassador and a group of senior officers in the Tokyo Embassy, in consultation with the Embassy's Information Coordination Committee, consisting of representatives of Australian agencies and corporations in Japan and State Government representatives. A detailed strategy for a major promotion in Japan in November 1993 was prepared by the Embassy in December 1991. (b) The key findings were: while Japanese had an extremely positive view of Australia, it was in most caseS a stereotype perception based largely on Australia as a tourist destination there was little general recognition in Japan of Australia's potential importance as a centre of learning, a producer of high quality manufactures and as a country with a rich and diverse culture given that an event would be staged in a highly competitive and sophisticated marketplace where high-cost advertising was considered the norm, any major promotion would require a carefully-planned approach to merchandising and sponsorship would be required to ensure worthwhile publicity, or free advertising . such an event would stand. a better chance·of success if it was closely managed. by the Embassy in a way that would create synergies on which to build and exploit promotional opportunities Newspaper/date Cost The Nikkei (18/10/93) $193,000 Yomiuri Shimbun $36,000 Asahi Shimbun $36,000 CAMU also arranged a complimentary In addition to advertising arranged by the Celebrate number of print media display advertisements and component events. The cost of (3) None (4) Approximately $40 million (5) Yes (a) About one sixth, broken down as follows: Dept/agency NA Dept Employment, Education & Training (DEET) NA Dept. Industry, Technology & Reg. Development (DiTARD) Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) Australia Japan Foundation (AJF) (b) The Foreign Affairs and Trade 1993/94 Program Performance Statement under Subprogram 1.9 Information·and cultural relations in its outlook for 1993/94 identified that: - A major promotion ""Celebrate Australia"" will be held in Japan in November to improve Japanese awareness of modem Australia and to stimulate trade, tourism and investment' (6) A total of $1,449,000 was contributed by the major private supporters of the Festival: Qantas, Member companies of the Japan-Australia Business November 1993 was the optimum date because (a)it provided sufficient lead time, and (b) Japan tours by the Australian Ballel and the Melbourne Symphony had already been planned for that month, providing two ready made pillars on which to build a major promotional event. (2). The Celebrate Australia Management Unit (CAMV) placed advertisements in national newspapers worth a total of Yeri 18.5 million ($265,000 at the prevailing exchange rate) as follows: Source of funds Japan-Australia Business Cooperation Committee sponsorship (JABCC) Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).

The amounts each provided· have not, to my knowledge, been made public by these contributors. (7) As stated in the Tokyo. Embassy's strategy paper, the objectives of Celebrate Australia were to: begin the process of changing Japanese percep"" tions of Australia increase opportunities for Australian exports diversify and strengthen the Iinl<s between Australia and Japan in.a way which will benefit our 'political and economics interests (8) No. Theentin- Celebrate. Australia program wiis designed by the Celebrate Australia Management Unit (CAMU), established wit.hin the Tokyo Embassy in early 1992 to build . and manage a diverse program of component events in .accordance with a strategy devised by the Embas-y in December 1991. (a), '(b)lmd (c)N/A, See Answer to Question 8 above. "" (9) Celebrate Australia, as was widely reported, consisted of 100 major events in 33 centres around Japan. As listed in the official program, component events came under the broad headings of business, visual arts, performing arts, education and technology, entertainment and sport and people·to-people exchanges. In. addition, I am advised that the publicity momentum achieved in Japan by the organisers of Celebrate Australia resulted in scores of smalletevents organised spontaneously at the local level during November 1993, often by Australian expatriates, such as teachers, and in several cases with financial backing of local government and local businesS. . (10) The exact, amounts expended for Celebrate Australia by the di,fferentCommonwealth departments and agencies is set out in the answer to question 5 (a) above. I am advised that additional amounts expended on individual events by other companies and organisations ranged greatly, from just a few thousand dollars to several millions. Many events were or-anised by - he Japanese side with various parties, stich as sponsors, promoters and importers, contributing in cash or kind. Those costs are not known. (11) No. There was extensive media coverage in Japan of nearly all events in Celebrate Australia, including positive reviews of a number of cultural events. The Embassy in Tokyo holds.il publicity log 'compiled before, during and after Celebrate Australia which records more than 370 separate items of, Japanese print and electronic media coverage of Celebrate Australia. The Australian Ballet itself received excellent reviews in all of Japan's major daily newspapers and in a wide range of high-quality. specialist magazines. The most noteworthy of these reviews were in Japan's three largest national daily newspapers: 29 November 1993-The Asahi Shimbun (review of Giselle) 1 Decemherl993'-'-The Asahi Shimbun (review of program of three ballets) 2 December 1993-The Mainichi Shimbun (review of Giselle) 2 December 1993-The'Yomiuri Shimbun (review of Giselle) (12) All proposed events had to be endorsed by the Celebrate Australia Management Unit (CAMU); which operated from within the Tokyo Embassy to ensure that events were in accordance with the objectives of the promotion and were of an acceptable standard. The CAMU had overall·responsibility for the running of Celebrate Australia, though it did not directly select performers. This was done, . in some cases,by, Japanese promoters and, - in others, by individual event organisers and promot. ers in consultation with Australian· booking' agencies. The principal performers and the prime means for their participation in Celebrate Australia were as follows: Australian Ballet-invited in 1991 to tour in November 1993 by the Japan Performing Arts .

Playbox-invited by the Globe Theatre Foundation, Tokyo, apd then by the Aichi Prefectural Government, operators of the Perforining Arts ,Centre, Nagoya Australia' Ensemble-'-tour arranged through Australian agent . Mini-Arts Festival-Performers were recipients of grants by the Australia Council 'of the Arts and toured in support of the Embassy Cultural Relations Section's 1993 program Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre-assisted by the Japan Foundation Puppetry-invited by relevant Japanese counterpart/host organisations Wizards of Oz rock music promotion-all artists seleCted by Australian promoters in consultation with Japanese record companies Girlfriend-invited by Japanese record company Chrome, Stalker Stilt and Stretch Mark JIintroduced through their Australian agents to Sunshine City, Tokyo, and other Japanese venues in conjunction with the Embassy's 1993 cultural relations program (13) See the answer to question 12 above. However, ,I am advised that the touring parties of the main performers totalled 162 persons made up as follows;, Australian Ballet 85, Alan. Dargin 1, Playbox. 15, Australia Ensemble 6, Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre 12, Puppetry 3, Wizards of Oz 21, Girlfriend 5, Chrome 3, Stalker Stilt 6, Stretch Mark II 4.

(b) Giselle was selected from the Australia Ballet's repertoire by the Tokyo Performing Arts Foundation as one of three programs to be performed in Japan during Celebrate Australia. (c) (i) Yes (ii) I am advised that the Tokyo Performing Arts Foundation-as the largest ballet promoter in Japan-would have fully researched which programs would be likely to appeal to audiences in Japan. In the case of Giselle, the Australian Ballet's acclaimed production would have been an obvious selection since Giselle is widely perceived in Japan by ballet audiences as a benchmark by which performing standards are judged. (d) The tour was a commercial exercise and exact figures are not available. However, I have been advised that the promoter was extremely satisfied with both attendances and audience reaction. The same promoter has invited the Australian Ballet to tour again in 1996. (e) (i) The Commonwealth Government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs arid Trade, was a sponsor of the Australian Ballet's tour of nine performances in four cities of Japan. (ii) $200,000; (A) N/A; (B) N/A (16) Yes. (a) No. (b) The Globe Theatre, Tokyo, in conjunction with the Playbox Theatre. (c) Playbox Theatre was chosen because it was performing King Lear in 1993. The Globe Theatre only presents Shakespearian works. Traditionally, presentations of King Lear tend to attract larger audiences in Japan than other Shakespearian works. (d) I believe that the Globe Theatre, as the principal presenters of Shakespeare in Japan, conducted this research. (e) As the tour Was conducted on a strictly commercial basis, exact figures are not available at this time. The Japanese promoters have indicated that they were very satisfied with attendances and have invited Playbox to tour again. Due to demand, an extra performance was arranged in Nagoya (f) Yes, partially; (i) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; (ii) $45,000; (A) N/A; (8) N/A (17) Yes. (a) Yes and No. One hundred thousand copies were distributed and 989 questionnaires were returned up until 10 February 1994. (b) The public affairs staff of the Embassy in Tokyo. (c) As part of the ongoing work activity of the public affairs area of the Australian Embassy the cost has not been separately calculated (d) No. The results of analysis of the questionnaire returns will be included in the overall evaluation report which I am advised is· nearing completion (e) The preliminary evaluation is that Celebrate Australia was an outstanding success. I was delighted with the outcome of Celebrate Australia, which, by any measure, was the most comprehensive, ambitious and successful event of its kind Australia has ever mounted. (f) Data is being and has been gathered from a number of sources, including through surveying all participants, through reporting by those Commonwealth departments and agencies which participated in Celebrate Australia, through detailed logging of publicity and through soliciting of aSSessments from independent parties on the Japanese side, including a survey of Japanese perceptions of Australia by the Gallupaffiliate polling company in Japan, Nippon Research Center. Methods of analysis include performance as measured against pre-set indicators, comparison of publicity levels and objective measurement and assessment of outcomes against pre-set objectives. (g) No. (h) The questionnaire, in Japanese, was included as a tear-out in postcard format on each copy of the Celebrate Australia official program. All returned questionnaires are held by the Embassy in Tokyo. (18) Yes. (a) Generic (b) Yes. Commonwealth Employment Service: Ex-offenders (Question No. 874) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 3 February 1994: (1) Does his Department deem an ex-offender to be disadvantaged for the purposes of Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) employment positions .. (2) Is an ex-offender afforded any special benefits, concessional treatment or. exclusions that are also afforded to the disabled or wards of state; if so, which benefits, treatment or exclusions. (3) Is it a fact that CES clients who are not deemed to be disadvantaged and who overstay 6 weeks of employment in a CES position before applying for another CES position must wait for 6 months before re-registering with the CES but that ex-offenders are not subject to the same requirement; if so, why.· Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Ex-offenders are identified alii especially disadvantaged for purposes ofDEET labour market programs if they register with the CES within 6 mont-s (or 12 months fQr JOBSTART) of having been released from prison or detention, or have been ori remand for at .least 2- .weeks..... (2) Yes.· lobseekers who are identified as especially disadvantaged are eligible, after one month's registration, for DEET labour market programs. Especially disadvantaged clients include jobseekers with disabilities, ex-off!O!nders and youth at risk (including homeless youth and wards of state). , .Under the Disability Reform Package (DRP) there are some specific programs available only to people with disabilities. These are the Work Experience Program for People with Disabilities and the Post placement/l'raining Support for People with .Disabilities. These·are not available to especially disadvantaged ex-offenders unless they have disabilities which make them eligible. . Those people with disabilities being assisted uflder DRP have eligibility for these programs imineeJ,iatelyon.' registration. (3) All clients who have been unemployed for less than 12 months and who then enter and remain in employment for over 6 weeks, are deemed to be newly unemployed if they again become' unemployed. This, applies to ex-offenders as well as other clients., All may re-register with the CES immediately onbCcoming unemployed.

(2) Will the Minister attend the conference on commercial whaling as the' Australian n;presentative; if not, will an alternative Australian representative attend.",132
209,Mr BRERETON,NATIONAL TOTAL,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to .the honourable member's question: (1) The Australian Government has a long-term commitment· to a position of opposition to all whaling and to seeking a ban on all commercial whaling, while recognising that some traditional communities continue to require access to whaling and whale products to meet traditional cultural subsistence needs. With bipartisan support, Government has continued to support the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and its scientific committee as the appropriate intemational organisation through which to pursue conservation of all . species of whales, dolphins and porpoiseS. The Australian representatives to the IWC have instrumental in achieving support for all of the major conservation decisions taken by the Commission in recent years. We will continue that active member's pursuit of the Government's objectives. (2) The recent IWC meeting was nota conferquestion ence to discuss the resumption of commercial whaling. It was an intersessional technical of an IWC working group to discuss the proposed sanctuary in the Southern Ocean. It was held on Norfolk Island from 20-24 February ·1994 at the invitation of this Government, to ensure continued $318,475 in 1993; action on the sanctuary initiative. The working group's task was to examine a number of outstanding legal, political, geographic and ecological relating to establishment of Southern Ocean and to prepare a report and recommendations for consideration. at the 46th Annual Meeting of the IWC, which w,1I be held in Mexico Program. in May this year. Australia was represented at the meeting on Norfolk Island by the Australian Commissioner to the IWC and a delegation of six, including two representatives of national non-government conservation groups. Delegates of the twenty-six IWC member countries attending were welcomed behalf of the Government, by the Hon Janice Crosio MP, representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, and by the field President of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assemany bly on behalf of that body and the Norfolk Island community. In Mrs Crosio's welcome,' the Facilities Government's continued opposition to the resumpous tion of commercial whaling was maoe clear, as its strong support for implementation., in the Southern 0Fean. From the perspective of the Australian Government and other participants the working group meeting went well, with the support proyided by the Norfolk Island government and community any playing an important part in establishing an atmosunder phere in which constructive discussion was posSporting sible. The broad agreement reached by the working group that there are no irreconcilable difficulties remaining in the establishment of a sanctuary under the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling was a particularly significant step. Jobstart (Question No. 939) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister for Em'and ployment, Education and Training, upon the notiCe, on 24 February 1994: (l) What sums were paid to ADT Security in Jobsearch wage subsidies in (a) 1992 and (b) 1993.

Mr Lee- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows, based on information provided by Telecom: Campbelltown customers were included in a trial of a new, service,' ""ReachOutl', from September 1993 tO""March J994. The trial allowed custot;ners taking up the ""ReachOut"" option to make untimed calls to exchanges within a radius of 75 kilometres from Campbelltown at a cost of 35' cents per call. Under the .""ReachOut': option customers also were charged 35 cents for local calls. (a) Some 3 per cent of Campbelltown customers took advantage of the trial offer, with many of th- customers making substantial savings to their bills. "" (b) Telecom is now evaluating the results of the trial. Introduction on a permanent basis would be a commercial judgement for Telecom, and would be subjecUo regulatory scrutiny by AUSTEL. The main benefit for telephone users in the 046 zone, if the service was to be introduced permanently, would be to allow access to untimed calls to most of the Sydney area.

Shadow Minister for Finance for decision. Parliament House have been 7 CANBERRA ACT 2600 To indicate the Dear Mr Costello refer to your letter of 14 February 1994.ln which you reaffirmed your request under the Fn:edom of Information Act (FOI) 1982 to access'to all documents held by this Department relating to the Community, Cultural, Recreation and Sporting '.' Your initial request of I' December 1993 - as in relation to all documents relating to both the cases Community Recreation and Sporting Facilities Program and the Community Cultural, Recreational and. Sporting Facilities Prqgral)1l\nd it will be assumed, unless you advise otherwise,. that yO)Jr request relates to both programs. .' , With the commencement o(the investigation of your request it was realised thaI besides dOCuments in the Defence and Industry Division and Resource Improvement· Branch, .there are also documents in the Expenditure Policy Branch. To locate, examine and make a dedsionon the aOCU"" ments that exist in the Expenditure Policy Branch of this Department would involve' a substantial arid unreasonable diversion of resources. In effect it is estimated that some 140 hours of work would be to locate the potentially very few relevant documents .on some 160 files covering a period of five years. Because of the demands placed on the Expenditure Policy Branch in particular in the coordination of the Budget, it would be unreasonable to expect their resources .to be diverted to the Because of the nature of the work of the Expenditure Policy Branch, the documents would largely be cabinet documents in which there was a reference to this program in the context of a' new expenditure or savings proposal. This information would be in documents already on files in the Defence' and Industry Division, in respect of which Mr Winder be making a decision under the Act, and in any event would be highly likely to be exempt under Section 34 of the FOI Act because of Cabinet confidentiality. As indicated in the telephone discussion of 7 March between Mr Winder, First Assistant Secretary, Defence and Industry Division and Mr Davey, your Economic Adviser, because of the above mentioned problems involved in the inclusion of the documents in Expenditure Policy Branch in your request, it is necessary to refuse access under Section 24(1) of the FOI Act. It is therefore requested that you contact Mr Winder (ph. 2633454) with a view to making the request in a form that would remove the grounds for refusal (Section 24(6)(c) of the FOI Act refers). In accordance with Section 24(7) of the Act, the period commencing on the day you are given this notice concerning the intention of refusal and ending on the day you confirm or alter the request following consultation is disregarded in the computation of the 30 day statutory period for notification of a decision. In accordance with departmental guidelines and the guidelines set down in the Attorney General's Department revised FOI memorandum No 29 of 4 November 1992, your request for remission of the fees and charges was referred to the Minister for Finance for consideration. The Minister subsequently determined that, taking into account the provisions of Section 29 of the Act, the matters listed in the aforementioned memorandum, and the. contents of your letters of 1 December 1993 and 24 February 1994, remission of the charges was not warranted. The. decision was based on the fact that the documents held in Finance relate almost entirely to administrative arrangements, in particular of the annual appropriation for the program. Other documents relate to this Department's view of the adequacy of the methodology of the evaluation,. program. There are also documents belonging to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories which are the subject of your FOI request to that Department. It was considered that making the content of the documents held by Finance more widely available would not contribute valuable material to the public debate and therefore not be in the public interest. It was also considered that the documents have little or no bearing on the central context of the debate on the administration of the grants process. The Attorney General's guidelines indicate that consideration should be given to remission of fees and charges where the information is of a kind that would customarily be provided in an answer toa Parliamentary Question or if the information contained in a document would normally be provided to a Member of Parliament in accordance with the ""Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters"". It is not considered that the information falls into either of these categories. You should note that the Minister's decision to refuse to remit the charges is not subject to internal review. In accordance with Section 55 of the Act you may however apply within 60 days to the Administrative Appeal Tribunal for a review of the decision that you are liable to pay a charge. , Should you agree to the narrowing of your request as detailed above (ie. excluding the Expenditure Policy Branch documents), my preliminary assessment of the charge, calculated in accordance with Section 29 of the Act is as follows: (a) A charge in respect of the time spent on searching for and retrieving the relevant documents 6 hours 8 mins @ $15.00 per hour-$ 92.00 (b) Decision making 34 hours 40 mins @ $20.00 per hour-$693.30 (c) Inspection time. I hour @ $6.25 per half hour-$ 12.50 TOTAL-$797.80 In addition to these costs, should you require copies of documents at a later date as stated in your letter of 1 December 1993, a charge of tOc per page will apply. As the charge exceeds $25 a deposit of $199.45 is required. Within 30 days of your agreement to narrow your request you are required to either agree to pay the in respect above charge; or . contend that has been wrong- ) You should the charge fully assessed, ) give full or should be ) reasons for reduced, or ) so contending . withdraw your request If you fail to notify this Department of your agreement to the above charges within 30 days of your agreement to narrow the request, it will be taken that you have withdrawn your request.

214,Mr HOWE,NATIONAL TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. (a)(i) Seven persons will work full time on the review. Of these seven persons: the Director of the review, Ms Jenny Macklin, is employed as a consultant to me in my capacity as Minister; one person is on secondment to the review at SES band 3 for a 12 month period; one person is employed at SES band 1 level; there is one position, currently vacant, at Senior Officer Class C level; and three persons are employed, two at AS04 and one at AS03 level, to provide administrative support. (ii) No persons are employed on a part time basis, however a number of Departmental staff provide ad hoc services related to policy and administrative issues on an irregular basis. (b) The Director of the review is employed as a consultant to me as Minister for Housing and Regional Development. A Principal Consultant was appointed to the review from September 1993 until 29 March 1994. (c) The appropriation from the Department is $2 million over three years as from the 93/94 Budget.

Commonwealth Employment Service (Question No. 1104) Mr Reid asked the Minister for Employment, Education arid Training, upon notice, on 3 May 1994: How many persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service as looking for work had been registered for (a) less than 12 months, (b) 12 months, (c) 18 months, (d) 24 months, (e) 30 . months, (f) 36 months and (g) more than 36 months as at I March 1994. . Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable in each case, member's question is as follows: The number of persons registered as unemployed with the CES is not an indicator of unemployment and, as such, is considered unreliable. The CES register is an administrative tool which includes unemployed persons, people who were previously unemployed but have not notified the CES of their obtaining employment and employed people seeking improved positions. . A more accurate indicator of the number of unemployed by duration is provided· by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) which measures unemployment according to rigorous and specific standards set by the International Labour Organisation. ABS estimates are as follows: In March 1994, the total number of unemployed persons, in original terms (ie not seasonally adjusted), was 949,237. Of these, there were 350,972 persons who were long term unemployed (defined as 12 months plus) and 598,265 persons unemployed for less than 12 months. Of the long term unemployed, 117,521 had been unemployed for 12-18 months, 34, III had been unemployed for 18-24 months and 199,340 had been unemployed for 24 months or more.

NSW VIC QLD WA SA TAS NT Total The revised estimated outcome for Commonwealth expenditure in· 1993-94 is $58.3m. In addition to the above funds paid by the Commonwealth to the States, the States will be utilising an estimated $87.6m in reserves of Commonwealth funds provided in previous years. This will bring total Commonwealth funding in 1993-94 to an estimated $145. 9m. The expected amount of reserVes to be utilised by each State are: NSW VIC QLD WA SA TAS NT Total (3) ·Whatis the estimated future funding under State and the RAS for each State body. Mr Beddall- The Mjnist-r for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the the .following answer to the honourable member's (1) The funds provided by the Commonwealth Government to each State and Territory are: NA 1993-94 1991-92 1992-93 $M . $M $M (To 30/4/94) 48.770 61.231 4.420 32.338 15.059 nil 33.120 42.626 18.291 16.929 8.126 nil 20:981 37:239 11.110 3.014 3.442 1.288 2.175 i254 nil 157.327 168.977 35.109 . (2). All funds provided to each State and Territory under the RAS are provided to the State body which administers RAS. Therefore my response is the same as for (I). In the period 1991-92 to 1993-94 funding to the States was provided tinder both the RAS 1988 and RAS 1992 schemes. Under the current RAS 1992, all funding provided to the States is by way of grants. There are therefore no repayment conditions imposed upon the States for this funding provided by the 1993-94 Commonwealth. Under the previous RASI988 most funding $m provided to the State was also by way of grants. 37.1 Only amounts under part C (farm exit and household support) that are collected from those farmers 14.5 who did not take up the re-establishment grant (ie 15.8 they did not exit farming) are repaid to the 5.5 Commonwealth.
