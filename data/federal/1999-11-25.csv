It is the same, it was in June: we should adopt an exemption users. That should involve a more light-handed requirements, and stronger reliance on As far as I know, with the value added tax actually a reversal of that. There is not much is not much of a change to a more light-handed requirements-in fact, the reverse is the case. being offered is a change to self-assessment and audit you and get you, maybe, and that is hand, with the value added tax-the most complex can imagine-the work that business will regulation that is produced by this government harder in that regard and it will be more difficult although this is supposed to make They have also relaxed some regulatory arrangements ongoing compliance costs. The parliamentary the criteria will be well spelt out and so on, by business. It is very interesting if that is changes-and I hope that in his summing up constitutional drafting problem that was the whipped out and then brought back to us now. as to whether or not there really would be $100 here in extra access, because we have only been of the $200 million program.

I read in the Tradex Scheme Bill 1999 (No.2): than as permitted by regulations made for the legislation. In the original bill that was put was meant by 'consumed' or 'used', which could are totally used up such as grinding media, in another context, some components become part a comp.uter, for example. The legislation that what was meant by that terminology. It could into a zone was treated identically because of address that question and allows the regulations and 'consumed'. That may need to be varied for change between the original legislation and that discussions that took place between some of us stuff because there was a massive gestation and 'Investing in Growth' in December 1997. This now is a bit of a runt in development. In my and gave some expectation to the community are cumbersome and poorly used, partly of an age when tariffs were very high and, of money on all the paperwork and red tape that lower, the actual processing costs and the onwere developed at a time of higher tariffs, tariff regime. I will explain that a bit more. had separate corporations for exports and that was making computers in Australia, one-quarter was used here. Try and work out for this Tradex scheme or the current system it would be incredibly complicated because they streamline those to separate productions and of which go offshore and some of which come warranties, re-issue and repairs for things that demonstration models and samples. A whole if you put them back into the domestic market are applicable.

That will force an artificial is only doing one kind of business. That is not procedures create artificial corporate structures here is the other big no-no, the processing charges. The fact is that the Australian government into the country. Those entries are charged on per line. There is a charge for people bringing to be used in manufacturing to tell the government also be a charge when they export them because Tradex. This is where a lot of the confusion comes in. So we have got two splits. We have got where they are treated differently. We have got they are charged differently. Whether that line entries or on the new line entries is recompile their entries. The other point is that will still be on the components. This legislation Manufacturing in Bond legislation suffers Senate. Quite frankly, this government is pathetic-it punished.

For a manufacturer to keep track then pay the duty and, of course, the processing on the original lines, imposes a cost which is it is because why would you bother-why computers when your opposition gets a tax cheaper. There is no tax payable on imported Australia-not on the computer but on the components. We are offering the government a logical, doing right now is saying, 'It is off the paper.' out of spite.

It is is a government talking about investing in growth; I just cannot believe the rhetoric from those develop manufacturing industries and who are That particular amendment went to a Senate the legislation was unwise-that was not the imposed the duty. This Tradex legislation will The fact is the government is stuck back on from there.

The government wants even when they are transformed into a of all that stuff, .all those components, and charge as well, which I presume would be prohibitive. If you wonder why it is not working, would you bother investing in manufacturing break? That is what they get. Right now, it is computers, there is tax on computers made in sensible solution.

The committee actually agreed that word they used but it was to that effect if it do the same thing. It is the same mind-set. in about 1983 or 1984. It has not actually moved particularly in the last five years. manufacturing is about assembly, not about a to a finished product. That stopped back in about assembling components from all over the It involves a lot of transport, complex logistics controlled systems where people do not have manufacturing techniques, where stuff arrives in day.

Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DlMA) has set up a temporary student processing office at the Australian NA Embassy in Stockholm to process the rising level of student visa applications from nationals of Norway and Sweden. Four of the agents who wished to discontinue the service they have hitherto provided have been briefed on the changes and will refer students to the new office. A fifth agent . operating in Scandinavia, the Scandinavian Australia New Zealand Friendship Association (SANZFA), has already indicated it will continue with the existing arrangements between it and DlMA. (a) The application charge for a student visa is $290. This charge not only factors in the cost of processing student visa applications but also the cost of information technology initiatives and compliance activity in the student visa program. The $290 fee is a global one and applies to student applicants from all countries. (b) The Department of Health and Aged Care (DoHAC) has recently agreed for DIMA to con,duct a trial of new streamlined medical processing arrangements for student visa applicants from Norway and Sweden. Under the trial, student applicants from these countries will only be required to respond to a strengthened health declaration which addresses issues of public health concern. This is possible because of the very low rates of tuberculosis in Norway and Sweden and the fact that health costs associated with these students are covered by their Governments. (c) As a consequence of the re-opening of the student visa processing service in Stockholm, and the streamlining of health procedures, a quicker and more effective service can be expected. (d) The Regional Medical Director (Europe) travelled to Norway in August 1999 and met student agents to discuss their concerns. Panel doctors in 8 cities in Norway were also visited. A number of strategies were developed which directly address the agents' concerns about panel doctors. These strategies include: additional training and support to panel doctors; the dismissal of one panel doctor and appointment of several additional panel doctors; the introduction of a regular meeting of all panel doctors biennially, and further administrative streamlining. The issue of health processing for overseas students from low risk countries is being further examined in a current review of health requirements for temporary entrants. DoHAC has also agreed to test the low risk student market in Norway and Sweden so that their students initially have only to sign a strengthened declaration. Only those students who identifY a potential public issue in this document will be required to undergo fonnal medical processing. (e) The staff at the new visa processing office Stockholm will be able to provide students with student visa application advice and on other administrative issues - s they arise. (f) The opening of the student visa application processing centre in Stockholm will significantly reduce costs to students, including courier costs and, in the majority of cases, the cost of fonnal medical processing. (g) The Australian Honorary Consul in Norway has been briefed on new arrangements so that students in Norway may collect visa application fonns from that Consulate and forward them to Stockholm. The student visa processing centre at the Australstudents Ian Embassy in Stockholm will be the key point for enquiries from Scandinavian students. (2) I am advised the Australian ViceChancellor's Committee (AV-CC) wrote to the Prime Minister on the Scandinavian student visa issue. DIMA provided input into the Prime Minister's response to that letter, which I understand has been forWarded to the AV-CC. My Parliamentary Secretary who is responsible for the student visa program haS also written to the AV-CC advising of the new arrangements. (3) Discussions were held with the relevant education agents who operate in the student market in Norway and Sweden. Four of them who wished to discontinue the service they had previously provided indicated they did not wish to pursue fonnal arrangements with DIMA for the time being. DIMA has responded by re-opening a student visa processing office at the Australian Embassy in Stockholm. This should provide an improved service for Scandinavian students. (4) (aHc) Minimal to none. Visa applications from Norwegian and Swedish students will be processed by the new student visa application processing centre at the Australian Embassy, Stockholm. The DIMA post in Berlin will provide appropriate support as required. (5) The Government closely monitors Australia's competitiveness as an overseas student destination on an on-going basis. This is best done on an holistic basis rather than in tenns of single issues. On the whole, Australia remains highly competitive as illustrated by the fact, that overseas. student numbers, particularly for the higher education sector, have continued to rise despite the Asian Economic crisis. (a) The cost of an application for an Australian student visa is higher than that imposed by most of health our competitors. This, however, needs to be considered in the context of the more generous work rights that Australia provides to overseas students and the greater investigation and compliin ance costs associated with this. The more generous work rights can lead to a larger number of nonbona fide students seeking to apply for entry or seeking to subvert the work condition after arrival. The higher student visa application charge is designed to recover these compliance and investigation costs. (b) Australia has one of the lowest rates of tuberculosis in the world. This is in no small measure due to our strict health requirements. While there may be scope to streamline these to some degree (as evidenced by the Government's preparedness to trial a new arrangement for students from Sweden . and Norway), there is a clear national interest benefit in maintaining our· strict standards where are coming from countries with a high risk of tuberculosis. (c) Student visa applicants whose medical results are locally cleared experience no medically-related delays in the grant of a student visa. Those applicants whose medical results need to be referred to Australia for clearance may experience a delay of , up to 4 weeks in grant of their visa. New streamlined procedures to be tested in the student market in Norway and Sweden are likely to result in savings both in tenns of time and cost to student visa applicants from those countries. DoHAC will continue to monitor public health issues in those countries and will react accordingly if there is any cause for alann for Australia. (6) Refer to answer to Question 1 above. Goods and Services Tax: Government Levies (Question No. 908) Mr Crean asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 September 1999: (1) Is it stilI the case, as the Senate was advised on 1 June 1999 in a response to Estimates question on notice, Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, that according to the Treasury there is no settled policy for deciding which government levies are to be subject to GST and that before a policy can be agreed on, discussions will have to take place with the States to ensure a consistent application to all similar levies and charges. (2) If this is not the case, what approach will be taken in relation to the GST's application to government levies and charges. (3) Will he provide the full list of government levies and charges that will be subject to the GST, and those that will not. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (2) and (3) All States and Territories signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on the reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations in June 1999. In signing, States and Territories agreed that the GST should not apply to some taxes, levies compulsory charges. The principles for determining those taxes, levies and charges to be listed on the Treasurer's determination were agreed by the Commonwealth and all States and Territories June 1999. The parties to the Agreement are cUITently process of agreeing on a list of taxes, levies and other charges that meet these general principles therefore should be outside the scope of the GST. The complete list will be promulgated by a deteroped mination by the Commonwealth Treasurer as set compensation out in section 81-5 of A New Tax System Act 1999. Special Air Services: Counterterrorist (Question No. 933) Mr Edwards asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 September 1999: (1) What has been the cost of the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) since its inception. (2) How many Special Air Services Regiment (SASR) soldiers have been killed or injured maintaining the unit's operational readiness. (3) What sum has the Government spent on rehabilitating and deprogramming SASR soldiers as a result of physical or mental disability. (4) Has the use of gas and pyrotechnics changed sets. since the early operations of the Counter Terrorist Unit; if so, is it due to a high casualty rate. (5) Was the work considered what were the hazards. (6) Is the CTU considered to be non-operational; if so (a) is the rate of death and acceptable for a non-operational CTU, and (b) will injured soldiers be eligible to receive appropriate benefits, including a service pension. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The content of the following response does not include any reference to sensitive classified mation. Should the honourable member wish to obtain any further information, a private briefing by Headquarters Special Operations can be arranged through my office. (1) Costing information regarding the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) is sensitive and cannot be made public. (2) Since 1980, 20 deaths and approximately 35 serious personal injuries have occurred. Headquarters Special Operations is unable to determine the number of minor injuries or stress related injuries. It is estimated that there are significant numbers of unreported (mostly minor) injuries and stress related illness and injuries that are of a prolonged and nature and which are not manifested until middle age or after retirement from the Army. (3) Under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Comin pensation Act 1988 the Government provides .rehabilitation services to those members of the Australian Defence Force who are injured in in the compensable circumstances. In 1998/99 $4.05 million was spent on rehabilitation. Information on and how much of this amount was spent on SASR soldiers is not available. Systems are being develwhich, in the future, will enable attribution of and rehabilitation costs to unit level. (4) Yes. The use ofCS gas and smoke pyrotechnics has been substantially reduced since the early 90's. The reduction in the use of CS gas has been Unit due to a greater awareness of the dangers posed by these substances and as a result of some reported injury/illness. (5) Yes. Duties in the CTU were considered to be hazardous (along with most other facets of SASR training) and this still remains an area of employment where there is potential for death or injury. (6) CTU was and still remains categorised as non operational duty. Nevertheless, the capability has always been maintained at an extremely short notice to move. This drives the requirement to incorporate a high level of simulated realism into training activities against potentially hazardous skill (a) There is no acceptable 'rate' of deaths or serious injuries; every effort is made to minimise hazardous; if so, risks in training. (b) SASR soldiers receive the same level of benefits and entitlements as other members of the serious injury Australian Defence Force. Economy: Statistics (Question No. 952) Mr Crean asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 30 September 1999: (1) In what quarter of what year was the lowest infor- ever household savings ratio achieved. (2) In what quarter was Australia's (a) highest current account deficit recorded in dollar terms, (b) the highest ratio of household debt to income achieved and (c) largest foreign debt recorded, in dollar terms. (3) When was the largest (a) monthly trade deficit in Australian history and (b) quarterly decline in private expenditure on capital. (4) In what years since 1983 have export earnings from elaborately transformed manufactures faIlen, in dollar terms. (5) In what month of what year was the lowest ever manufacturing employment figure recorded. (6) In each of the above cases, who was the Treasurer. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) This can be obtained from the ABS publication, catalogue no. 5206.0. . (2) (a) This can be obtained from the ABS publication, catalogue no. 5302.0. (b) The ratio of household debt to income is not calculated by the ABS. (c) See ABS publication, catalogue no .. 5302.0. (3) (a) This can be obtained from the ABS publication, catalogue no. 5368.0. (b) See the ABS publication, catalogue no 5206.0. (4) See the ABS publication, catalogue no. 5302.0. (5) See the ABS publication, catalogue no. 6203.0. (6) This can be obtained from the Parliamentary Handbook or the Parliamentary Library. Goods and Services Tax: Compensation (Question No. 978) Mr Andren - asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 October 1999: (1) Is it a fact that (a) the GST compensation package for recipients of Commonwealth payments and self-funded retirees will not commen- until July 2000 and (b) people are having to pay a GST component now on things like car insurance, registration, house insurance, contents insurance, prepaid car services, NRMA memberships, club memberships, SUbscriptions, annual medical insurance and post office boxes. (2) If so, is the GST placing additional financial pressures on those least able to pay; if not why (3) Why did the compensation package riot commence in 1999-2000, given the transitional impact on low-income earners. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Government has legislated to provide an up front payment of 4 per cent on 1 July 2000 and put in place indexation arrangements so as to ensure that aIlowances and pensions increase by 2 per cent in real terms. The Government has also legislated to help maintain the value of the savings of senior Australians following the introduction of the goods and services tax by providing two savings bonuses for self-funded retirees. Self-funded retirees and persons in receipt of pensions and aIlowances can also benefit from income tax cuts and the new 30 per cent tax rebatelbenefit available on the cost of private health insurance which was introduced by the Government on 1 January 1999. (1 ) (b) The GST is payable in respect of supplies made from 1 July 2000 onwards. In the case of services where the supply of the service concerned spans the GST commencement date, that part of the service that attributable to the period after 1 July 2000 will be subject to GST and the GST will fall due in the supplier's first GST return. The ACCC price exploitation guidelines allow suppliers to include an allowance for this GST liability in the price charged for the service, in advance of the commencement of the GST, so long as the amount included does not exceed the net present value of the of the GST that they will be required to remit. (2)and (3) Some New Tax System measures have already commenced which benefit low-income earners. For example, the reduction in the wholesale sales tax came into effect during 1999-2000 (29 July 1999), and the 30 per cent tax rebatelbenefit available on the cost of private health insurance began on 1 January 1999. Provisions Jobs, Education and Training Program: Eligibility (Question No. 979) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 12 October 1999: (1) Is it a fact that assistance under the Jobs, Education and Training (JET) program administered jointly by the Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, is available to recipients of Parenting Payment; Widow Allowance; Partner Allowance; Widow B not. Pension; Carer Payment and some Special Benefit recipients, but not recipients of the Disability Support Pension. (2) If so, why are Disability Support Pension recipients excluded from accessing assistance under the JET program and what alternative assistance is available for such pensioners. (3) Is it anomalous that a parent in receipt of the Parenting Payment or a carer in receipt of the Carer Payment can receive assistance under the JET program, but that a parent in receipt of the Disability Support Pension with a dependent child cannot access assistance under the program; if not, why not. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Eligibility criteria for the Jobs, Education and Training program are the responsibility of· the Minister for Community Services. I understand that the Minister for Community Services is in the process of answering Question 980, which broadly encompasses Question 979. Job Network: Placements (Question No. 989) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 13 October 1999: When will he respond to the matters referred to him by the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services in my queStion No. 821 (Hansard, 22 September 1999, page 7830). Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 22 September 1999, the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services provided information regarding. the assistance provided through the Family and Community Services portfolio and asked me, as the Minister responsible for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, to respond to the parts of the question relating to Job Network. As a preamble, I must draw a distinction between the employment services offered by Job Network and those offered through specialist employment services funded through the Family and Community Services portfolio. The distinction lies in the level of disadvantage experienced by the job seekers: Job Network assists job seekers whose disability has a low to moderate impact on their work capacity,· while job seekers whose disability has a moderate to severe impact are assisted by specialist employment services funded through the Family and Community Services portfolio. Disability Support Pension recipients generally have a disability with a more severe impact and most of these people are assisted by the specialist employment services funded through the Family and Community Services portfolio. Overall, because Disability Support Pension recipients are a minority of all job seekers with a disability, the overwhelming majority of job seekers with a disability who receive employment assistance from the Commonwealth, are assisted by Job Network. The questions referred to me for response by the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services were questions l(a), 2(a), 3 and 4(a). I will respond to each in turn. (I) (a) How many persons with disabilities have received labour market assistance since the Job Network commenced in May 1998. through the Job Network. (I) (a) As at 31 August 1999 there were 156876 job seekers with a disability registered with Centrelink as looking for work and accessing various Job Network services. From 1 May 1998 to 13 August 1999, Job Network provided the following assistance: 26,174 job seekers with a disability were placed in a job through Job Matching (Flex 1); 5,077 job seekers with a disability commenced with a Job Search Training (Flex 2) provider; and 69,141 job seekers with a disabilitY commenced with an Intensive Assistance (Flex 3) provider. 7,657 of these had been placed in a job by the end of the period, with the majority still receiving assistance to prepare for and find a job. (2) (a) How many persons on a Disability Support Pension (DSP) have received labour market assistance since the Job Network commenced in May 1998. through the Job Network. (2) (a) From 1 May 1998 to 20 August 1999 there were 2,505 Disability Support Pension recipients who were placed in a job through Flex 1 or commenced in Flex 2 or 3. (3) How many persons identified in part (2) as being assisted through the Job Network were provided with (a) Flex I. (b) Flex 2 or (c) Flex 3 assistance. (3) From 1 May 1998 to 20 August 1999, the 2,505 Disability Support Pension recipients referred to in the response to Question (2Xa) received the following assistance from respective Job Network services: (a) 1,153 Job Matching (Flex 1) placements in a job; (b) 35 Job Search Training (Flex 2) commencements; and (c) 1,681 Intensive Assistance (Flex 3) commencements. Note: The total of Question 3 (a), (b) and (c) exceeds the number of job seekers in the response to Question 2 (a) because individual job seekers may be included in more than one of the categories in Question 3. (4) (a) How many persons on a DSP provided with assistance through the Job Network, have achieved some job outcome, either as (i) full-time or (ii) part-time employment. (4) (a) From 1 May 1998 to 20 August 1999, the following Job Network placements were recorded for Disability Support Pension recipients: 1,153 Job Matching (Flex 1) placements in employment, 569 in part-time employment and 584 in full-time employment. This included five placements for Job Search Training (Flex 2) participants, four in full-time employment and one in part time employment; 187 Intensive Assistance (Flex 3) outcomes, 35 for part-time employment (more than 15 hours and less than 20 hours per week) and 152 for full-time employment (20 or more hours per week). In addition, post program monitoring surveys from 1 May 1998 to 30 April 1999 indicate that 3 months after cessation of assistance: 20% of Flex 2 Disability Support Pension participants were in employment; and 19.4% of Flex 3 Disability Support Pension participants were in employment. Australian Defence Force: Health and (Question No. 1003) Mr Martin asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 19 October 1999: (l) How many vehicles owned and used by the Australian Defence Force have asbestos brake linings. (2) Does his Department consider that there is any risk to serving personnel as a result of exposure to asbestos brake linings. (3) Has his Department conducted any safety studies into the use of, or prolonged exposure to, asbestos brake linings. (4) Is his Department aware of any suppliers that are able to provide brake linings that are not made of asbestos; if so, (a) what are the names of the suppliers and (b) has his Department considered procuring brake linings from them; if not, why not. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australian Defence Force (ADF) Vehicles are categorised into three classes: Armoured Vehicles, Passenger and Cargo Vehicles and Construction and Engineer Plant Vehicles. The total fleet size is 14,454 vehicles. Currently, there are 3,780 Landrover Vehicles in the Passenger and Cargo class which have asbestos brake linings. The useful life of these asbestos brake linings expire in one year and they will be replaced with non-asbestos brake linings. It is possible that the 661 vehicles in the Construction and Engineer Plant class have asbestos brake linings as these vehicles are commercially procured. All of the remaining 10,013 vehicles have non-asbestos brake linings. (2) The ADF does recognise the hazard of asbestos contained in brake linings and has in place a comprehensive range of risk control measures to minimise the risk of exposure to serving personnel. The measures, detailed in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering instructions, EMEI Workshop E 410, Issue 2 dated March 1994, are taught and supervised for mechanics, and include: Asbestos may be found in clutch and brake linings, gaskets and insulation. ' Risk arises when asbestos fibres become airborne and are inhaled. A register of equipment containing asbestos is maintained by the Asbestos Control OfficerEquipment, at the Army Engineering Maintenance Agency. Risk assessments are conducted where asbestos is determined to be present. During all maintenance or repair a designer respirator is worn. Thorough Safety containment and disposal procedures, as well as appropriate warning sign age requirements, are detailed. Even when new replacement components may not contain asbestos, supervisors and mechanics are to ensure safe working conditions by assuming asbestos is present. (3) In 1991, Justice J.D. Enfield completed a study into asbestos within Defence, under the direction of the then Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel, the Hon Gordon Bilney MP. Justice Enfield's findings were detailed in March 1991 in the Report of Independent Review of Asbestos in Defence. (4) (a) and (b) The ADF is aware of suppliers that are able to provide brake linings that are not made of asbestos. The ADF has a policy that nonasbestos brake linings are used where possible. Suppliers of non-asbestos brake linings used by the ADF include: Diesel Division General Motors (Canada), Krauss Mafl'ai Wagman (West Germany), United Defence Systems (USA), IVECO (International Trucks Aust), Mack Trucks (Aust), Daimler Chrysler (Aub), Rover Australia, Case Corp Pty Ltd, Ford Pty Ltd, Kubota Aust, NS Komatsu, P&H Cranes Pty Ltd, Hitachi Corp, Jaques, Ingersoll Rand, tutts Tat Hong, Dynapac Pty Ltd, and Caterpillar. National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters (Question No. 1015) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 21 October 1999: (1) How many persons qualified as interpreters through TAFE and university conducted para professional or professional courses in 1997 and 1998. (2) Are similar numbers expected to qualify if the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters (NAATI) is successful with its policy to abolish such courses. (3) What alternative options will be available to ensure professional training. (4) How many public meetings were conducted during NAATI's six month consultation period. (5) Is it a fact that many who sought involvement were not given responses by NAATI; if so, why. Para-professional 1997/98 1998/99 First Professional Level 1997/98 1998/99 Advanced Professional Level 1997/98 1998/99 (2) NAA TI is considering whether to continue approval of courses at the six institutions and has yet to make a decision. It does not have the power to create or to abolish such courses and therefore has no policy in this regard. There is no requirement for institutions offering translation and interpreting courses to have NAATI approval. Graduates of institutions with NAATI approval are recommended to NAATI for accreditation on the basis of their result in a fmal examination Set, delivered and assessed by the training institution. Graduates of institutions without NAATI approval seek accreditation through the national NAATI examination. If the NAATI approval of courses were to be discontinued, graduates could still gain accreditation through the NAA TI testing system. (6) What measures were undertaken to ensure independent oversight ofNAATI's transparency in this matter. (7) Were public hearings conducted; if so, how many (a) hearings occurred, (b) witnesses were interviewed and (c) submissions were received. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NAA TI is a company jointly owned by the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments (except the Northern Territory) and governed by a Board of Directors. Therefore it is not subject to ministerial direction on its daily affairs. NAATI has provided answers to questions 1 + 5 and 7. I have responded to question 6. (l) The following table summarises accreditations resulting from (a) graduations from the courses NAATI approves at a total of six institutions (4 TAFE Colleges and 2 Universities), (b) tests conducted by NAATI and (c) accreditations based on overseas qualifications. Accreditations By overseas asBy Course By NAATI Test sessment Total 193 197 390 171 201 372 156 322 48 516 114 415 25 554 5 21 27 5 12 18 (3) As now, student demand will dictate the number of courses provided. The continuation of NAATI external examination for accreditation purposes will ensure a standardised benchmark for both employers and the profession. Whether or not it continues to approve some courses, NAATI has proposed that a minimum period of training becomes a pre-requisite for all candidates seeking accreditation through NAATI's national examination system. This should improve the standards of accredited interpreters and translators by providing training programs that are designed to meet the particular needs of students. (4) None. The consultation process so far comprises: February 1999 NAATI provided a copy of the March 1999 The (NAATI) Future Directions paper, including the issue of course approval, released to AUSIT and the NAATI Regional Advisory Committees which comprise representatives of service providers, educational institut.ions, practitioners and the profesSIOnal association. Responses sought from all parties. May 1999 NAATI Board considered responses received, noting a diversity in views concerning the proposal on the courses approval issue. Board decided to seek further consultation. August 1999 The Board considered further submissions by the University of Western Sydney and the Victorian Regional Advisory Committee and decided to provide one further opportunity for consultation. Specific invitations for submissions were issued to 34 training institutions, 10 service providers and, again, the 8 Regional Advisory Committees. November 1999 NAATI has received a further (5) Yes. NAATI did not wish to respond .to individual submissions but rather to respond With a report on the collective view when all submissions had been received. NAATI made some informal responses to early submissions by telephone and during its normal consultations that form part of every Board meeting. NAATI will respond to those who contributed when all submissions have been received. (6) As a company NAATI reports to its Members (representing State/Territory (except the Northern Territory) and the Commonwealth government) at general and extra-.ordinary meetings of the company. Implementation of NAATI's initiatives and work plans are subject to the provision of financial contributions by the Commonwealth and State governments, decided at the annual Ministerial Council for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The Council has not yet been asked to consider any specific proposal to change NAATI's co-rse approval regime, although I am aware that options are being canvassed. (7) Refer to (4) above. Defence Estate Organisation: Properties proposal to its Members (representing State/Territory and (Question No. 1017) Commonwealth Governments). Mr Horne asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 October 1999: (1) Is he able to provide information on the role of Defence Properties in (a) the sale of a fully refurbished three bedroom cottage at Stockton Rifle Range for less than $6000 and (b) the supervision and protection of three buildings at Stockton Rifle Range which have been systematically vandalised and burnt to the ground by arsonists. (2) Will the buildings referred to in part (1)(b) be replaced; if so, when. Mr Moore---The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Defence Estate Organisation, t-ough a local real estate agent, has been endeavounng to sell the Stockton Rifle Range cottage for $1,000, which was its reserve price when it was auctioned on 29 May 1999. In the event that a sale is n,?t achieved Defence will consider removal or demohtion of the cottage. The cottage had not been refurbished. (b) Following the closure of the Stockton Rifle Range and the withdrawal of the Defence employed range warden from the range, the. Defenc- Estate Organisation engaged a commercial secunty firm to undertake periodic security patrols of the property. However, because of its location and the nature 37 responses which are to be of the property, it has been prone to vandalism. analysed and considered by the Board of Directors. (2) No because Defence is to dispose of the property. 'Due to the vandalism problem, - he Defence Estate Organisation intends to demohsh the five remaining Defence-owned timber buildings, all of which have been assessed as being oflow or no heritage significance. Royal Australian Navy: Prison Work Camp (Question No. 1023) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 October 1999: (1) Has the Navy lodged a submission with the WA Government seeking to run a work camp for prisoners in that State; if so, (a) on what date was it lodged (b) what is the proposed location of the work ca-p, (c) what tasks does it propos- - hat the prisoners perform, (d) are these tasks additional to the Navy's normal operations or do they replace the functions of existing personnel, (e) how .--ny prisoners does it request and (f) ho- ma>: clVlhan or uniformed Defence personnel Will be Involved .in managing the proposed work camp. (2) Has the State Government made a decision about the proposal; if so, what are the details. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The Navy was in fact approached by Western Australia (WA) Minister for Justice proposing that a work camp be established at Garden Island as part of the WA Ministry of Justice Adult Program Work Camp Project. This proposal was received on 12 May 1999 and is currently being considered. (2) As this matter has been initiated by the State the Government of Western Australia, any issues relating to it need to be addressed to the WA Minister for Justice.",176
