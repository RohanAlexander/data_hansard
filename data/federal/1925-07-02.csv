AIR-CRAFT MANUFACTURE.",15
21,Mr LISTER,ASSISTANCE TO FRUIT AND,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. What is the Government's regard to the manufacture of Australia ? 2. Is any provision being made in this year's Estimates to provide orders for the manufacture of ajir-craft in Australia? 3. Is it proposed to provide a greater number of modern aeroplanes (apart from the "" Seagulls "" on order) for the use of the Royal Australian A i r Force? 4. When is it proposed to place in commission all the "" g if t "" aeroplanes which were received from Great Britain after the war?",15
22,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,ASSISTANCE TO FRUIT AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Realizing the importance from a defence point of view of the manufacture of air-craft in Australia, the Government placed an order for the manufacture of a small number of aeroplanes,, used for training, with a firm in Sydney in 1922. The machines produced were satisfactory, but the firm ceased to operate before completion of the full contract, and so little was achieved. During last financial year a sum of £25,000 was provided for the reconditioning of air-craft in our possession, and it is believed that the experience gained in that work by the firms concerned will be of considerable value in helping the Government to arrive at a definite policy regarding the manufacture of complete machines in the near future. 2. No. The machines now in our possession will meet the training requirements at present. It is probalble, however, that a certain amount of reconditioning will be required. 3. Sufficient air-craft is now in our possession to equip the units provided under this year's programme. A re-equipment of these units with more modern types will, however, be necessary in the future, when the units have reached a stage of training which wil l warrant it . 4. The units now in existence are equipped with air-craft received as a g if t from the Imperial Government, but the whole of the machines forming that g if t will not be in commission until, at the earliest, financial year 1926-27. WINES. TEAD. E DESCRIPTION.",15
23,Mr LISTER,ASSISTANCE TO FRUIT AND,"the Minister for Health, upon notice I. Has he noticed that certain advertisements are appearing in the daily newspapers claiming that certain wines are rich, ferruginous, blood-making, and blood-enriching, and suitable for invalids and convalescents? 2. Has the department made any analyses or tests of the virtue of those claims? 3. Will he say whether these claims can be substantiated, or are they purely advertising tricks ?",15
24,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,ASSISTANCE TO FRUIT AND,"It is not known what particular preparations are policy with referred to, but the Department of air-craft in Health, in association with the Department of Trade and Customs, have for some years prevented the appearance on labels and printed matter accompanying some imported "" medicinal"" alcoholic preparations of any claims for medicinal qualities. The Department of Health has no control over preparations of this kin d made in Australia. NA COMMISSION . CLAIM OF H . DEAN AND SONS.",15
25,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"Newcastle) [2.41] - I move1. That a select committee be appointed to inquire into the claim of H . Dean and Sons, of Newcastle, New South Wales, against the War Service Homes Commission. 2. That sueh committee consist of Sir Elliot Johnson, Mr E. C. Riley, Mr Seabrook, Mr. Josiah Francis, Mr Coleman, Mr Gardner, and the mover, five to form a quorum; with power to send for persons, and papers, and records, and examine judgment in connection therewith, to adjourn from place to place; and have leave to report from time to time its proceedings and the evidence taken; and that such committee do report this day three months. This motion affects one of my constituents, and is really an echo of the administration of the War Service Homes Commission, as it concerns occurrences that go back as far as 1921. Although I have no sympathy with many of the claims that have been made upon the Commonwealth Government respecting the construction of ships and other things, yet this case appears to me to merit at least some consideration. The War Service Homes Department persuaded Messrs H . Dean and Sons to enter into a contract for the supply of bricks. This company was at first opposed to anything of the kind, because that portion of its works manufacturing bricks was not then fully developed. The company comprised really a family of tilemakers, although it made bricks for local clients. The polioy of the department at that time was to draw supplies for the construction of the war service homes from various makers throughout the district. The department had decided to build some hundreds of homes in the district, and as the ordinary supply of bricks was unsatisfactory, it proposed to control the supply, so that the work could be proceeded with post haste. The department wrote to this company, as I shall show by the correspondence, and asked it to contract for the supply of bricks. I propose to read some of the correspondence sent to Messrs. H . Dean and Sons by the department's representative, i u whose name the arrangement was made. The first letter reads as follows :The quantity of bricks being supplied by you to this commission is very unsatisfactorv. We are of the opinion that is partly due to your being under the impression that our business is only temporary, and therefore do not consider it good business to yourself to give us absolute preference. We wish to assure you that our constructional programme is permanent and that our requirements will only be met by the receipt of 250,000 bricks per week for at least ten years, and a continuance after that of a slightly less quantity for an indefinite period. It is not the policy of. the commission to acquire brickworks or commence new works of sufficient capacity to supply the whole of our requirements. This policy will only be adopted as a last resort. We are in a position to make an agreement with you to accept the maximum quantity of bricks for which you are in a position to guarantee delivery, say, from 50,000 to 75,000 per week for three, five, or more years. An agreement to this effect would enable you to extend your plant if necessary, and would guarantee your output. We would ask you to give this matter your full consideration, the decided advantage of such an arrangement being most obvious.",16
26,Mr HILL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,Who signed that letter?,16
27,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"Mr Cook, who represented the department.",16
28,Mr HILL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,He did not.,16
29,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"The next letter readsIn furtherance of our verbal discussion, would you forward a written statement regarding your supplying this commission with your output, giving the following particulars :(a) Period for which you are prepared to grant output. (b) Quantity you anticipate being able to supply. (c) Price for-(1) , common; (2), O.K.; (3), callows; (4), clinkers; and (5), various fancy bricks, if any. (d) Conditions. Please repeat in detail the above particulars and any otlier matter with reference to same. The third letter is as follows: We would advise that you supplement or vary the agreement of which we have written the following as an indication according to what you consider a fair basis. We, the undersigned, hereby agree to supply bricks of quality and size to submitted sample. We also agree to supply bricks at the rate of 200,000 per month from 1st October, 1920, to 1st April, 1921, and after that date we agree to supply 250,000 bricks per month until 1st October, 1923, the price to be 63s. per 1,000 for good quality, common, as sample, War Service Homes Commission to take delivery at kiln. We agree to load all lorries or drays with all dispatch. The following will be the only recognized conditions that will vary this agreement :-We would ask you to go into this matter and enlarge on the above as you consider necessary, returning same to us. That letter is signed also by Mr Cook, who was (hen in consultation with the Sydney office of the War Service Homes Commission. The following is another letter ou the same subject : I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 11th instant, and note that you are not agreeable to arranging a contract. You actually state you are not in a position to make one. From the interviews we have had, I was under the impression you were prepared to grant this commission your whole output, therefore we cannot understand why you are not in tion to make a contract, as it would hold good whether your output was nil or 100,0(JU per week. As we must, and intend, to assure our brick supply-and , if necessary, will commence construction of works large enough to supply our whole output-w e would be glad to know if we are to rely on you for bricks or not. As a business man you will , of course, realise that your word is not sufficient for us, and is necessary that matters be arranged definitely beingby contract. We realise it would be necessary for you to use a large proportion of your bricks on your works until such time as they are completed. We should be glad to bear from you. It will be seen from that Messrs. H. Dean and Sons anxious to enter into a contract, the writer, to force the company made the threat that the department prepared, if necessary, to open up it3 own months. works. The technicality upon which Crown appealed to the Full that the agreement did not make provision for Henry Dean and Sons to do certain private business. Honourable members will recollect that at about that time the policy of the commission was altered by the substitution of tion by day labour for construction by contract. The result was that Henry Dean and Sons were deprived of their contract with the commission, and were left to bear all rhe expense to which they had been put in order to fulfil their part of the agreement. They tried to induce the commissiou to make a voluntary settlement, but the commission, while admitting that the contractors had a moral claim, contended that they had no legal standing inasmuch as the agreement had not been signed by the higher omcers of the commission in Sydney or Melbourne. Failing to get a settlement, Messrs. Dean and Sons, upon the advice of their solicitors, sued the commission. case was heard by a judge and jury. The defence offered by the commission was that no contract had been made, and ex- . Mr Watkins. ception was taken to the admissiou as evidence of the following memorandum from Mr Cook, district officer at Newcastle, to the Deputy Commissioner for War Service Homes in Sydney:Commonwealth of Australia. War Service Homes Commission, Newcastle District Office, Carrington Chambers, Watt-street, Newcastle, 21st September, 1920. a posiMemo to Deputy Commissioner, Sydney. Subject : Brick supply, Henry Dean & Sons. In answer to your verbal request for the result of interview with Mr Dean, of Henry Dean & Sons, on the 20th inst., I wish to inform you as follows :Mr Dean was very much against making a it 'contract at the present time, his reasons (o) Uncertainty of output. (b) Requires every second kiln to carry on with construction of new kilns. (c) Necessity to complete various outside orders in hand. letter that (d) His main reason is the necessity of a were not guarantee on our part to empty a kiln of 80,000 in four (4) days. and that I explained personally that the quantity of to do so, output did not effect the making of a contract, wa9 as I am assured this firm is aiming at an outp u t ' of 200,000 per week within twelve (12) the It was finally agreed that a contract be made Court wai on basis as follows :1. War Service Homes Commission to take the whole output of H . Dean & Sons' brickworks from date of signing contract for a period of five (5) years. 2. Henry Dean & Sons agree to erect additional open kilns and one Hoffman construc- pattern with all possible dispatch. Open kilns are now in course of construction. 3. When the output reaches 130,000 weekly, Henry Dean & Sons to have right to disburse all excess outside of contract. 4. The Commission guarantees to empty' each kiln of 80,000 bricks within five (5) days after twenty-four (24) hours' notice of opening has been given to Newcastle office of Commission. 5. If Commission be not in a position to take delivery of any particular quantity of bricks, District Works Officer, Newcastle, to authorize Deans to disburse outside of contract. This clause not to prejudice Commission's liability to take output to 130,000 weekly. 6. The price for good quality common brick, equal to submitted sample, to be 63s. per 1,000. The 7. The delivery to be taken by War Service Homes Commission at kiln. 8. Henry Dean & Sons agree to load all lorriesor drays at kiln with alt dispatch. 9. Price as aforesaid to be varied only by(a) Increase or decrease in award (?>) Increase or decrease .10. Delivery to be subject to climatic conditions. We would be glad if you would have this legally phrased in the form of a contract, inserting any additional matter which may be necessary, but not drastically altering the general conditions, and return to this office to be submitted to Mr Dean for approval and signature. The Crown endeavoured to suppress that document, which definitely committed the commission to this contract, and upon the basis of which Henry Dean and Pons incurred heavy expenditure in order to extend their plant. The court gave a verdict in favour of the plaintiffs, the amount of compensation to be decided, presumably, by' arbitration. The Minister for Works, when replying, may tell the House that about nine other judges have heard this case, and have given judgment in favour of the Crown; but the point that I wish to impress upon honourable members is that the facts were heard by only one judge and a jury, and that court found for the plaintiff. The commission appealed to the Full Court, not upon the merits of the case, but upon a technicality, and the Full Court reversed the decision of the lower court. Not desiring to continue this costly litigation the firm again endeavoured to get a settlement by agreement with the commission, but notwithstanding that the lower court had found in favour of the plaintiffs, the Government would give them no satisfaction. When the case was taken to the High Oourt it upheld the decision of theFull Oourt upon the point of law-of course, without hearing the evidence. strange fact, however, that some of the judges of the High Court, in deciding similar cases in Victoria, upon the evidence gave a decision directly contrary to that which they gave in the appeal of Henry Dean and Sons. The case was determined solely on a legal point. This man and his sons were induced by the department to enter into a contract and incur expenditure. They did not' want the contract, and did not seek it ; practically at the request of the department they accepted it. But almost immediately afterwards they were informed that the policy of the rates of labour in brick- department had been altered, and that, yards. although they probably had a moral in cost of claim, they had no legal claim, and coal. if the case were taken to court the department would fight it. I believe that I am right in saying that any person in the British Empire who fails to receive satisfaction from a British court has the right of final appeal to the King. Surely, therefore, these people are entitled to have their claim further considered. A select committee should be appointed by this House to inquire into the merits of the case, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to agree to its appointment. A full investigation should not occupy more than one month. The amount of the claim does not concern me greatly, but I am concerned that the right thing should be done. The Minister may say that Cook, the district officer at Newcastle, had no power to enter into a contract. He was, however, the responsible officer of the department in the district, and the Government should accept responsibility for his acts in the same way as a private employer is held responsible for the acts of his servants. I hope that the House will agree to the motion.",16
30,Mr HILL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"Echuca-Minister for Works and Railways) [3.7] - The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) has, no doubt, acted in good faith, believing that an agreement or contract between Messrs. Dean and Sons and the department existed, but I shall endeavour to prove that at no time was any contract or agreement entered into between the War Service Homes Commissioner and the firm in question. Mr E. RILEY - Was there an understanding between them? It is a . Mr HILL - It is a common practice for departments, when endeavouring to fix up contracts, to first arrive at a basis upon which business can be effected. I shall endeavour to show that Cook in this case acted only on behalf of the War Service Homes Commissioner. The brief history-of the case which has been prepared shows that Messrs. .Dean and Sons made representations in 1922 in connection with an alleged contract for supplying bricks to the commission. The matter was investigated by the then business advisor to the commission, Sir Jame3 MCCay, who submitted a report, dated the 13th June, 1922, in which he expressed the opinion that no contract had been entered into, and that Messrs. Dean and Sons had neither a legal nor a moral claim for compensation. Of that view the firm was advised, but on the 24th March, 1923, Dean Sons issued a writ claiming £26,500 from the commission for damages for breach of an alleged contract for the supply of bricks. I may say, in passing, that today the firm would willingly accept £11,200 in full settlement of its claim.",18
31,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,I know nothing about that.,19
32,Mr HILL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"The Deputy Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, who went exhaustively into the matter, recommended that the case should be defended, as he was of the opinion that the plaintiffs had no valid ground for their claim. Mr. Weston, of counsel, concurred in that opinion. The case came on for hearing before Mr Justice Campbell and a jury on the 29 th September, 1924, when the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff with damages to be fixed by agreement between the parties. I am not a lawyer, and I do not pretend to know much about the law, but that seems to me to have been a most remarkable finding.",19
33,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,He was the only judge who heard the facts.,19
34,Mr HILL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"On reviewing the verdict and the opinion of counsel, the commission decided to institute an appeal to the New South Wales Pull Court. Tho appeal was heard on the 17th November, 1924, by Mr Justice Street, then Acting Chief Justice, Mr Justice James, and Mr Justice Ferguson, and the court gave a unanimous verdict, with costs, in favour of the commission, thus reversing the verdict of the lower court. Messrs. Henry Dean and Sons then gave notice of their intention to appeal to the High Court, and on the 9th January the Deputy Commonwealth Crown Solicitor in Sydney received from the firm an intimation to this effect. On the 2nd February the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), Mr C. Dean, and Mr Read, a solicitor, waited upon the Prime Minister in Sydney, and submitted the following proposals to him for a settlement of the matter:1. That' the finding of the jury be accepted ; or 2. That a select committee be appointed to consider the whole matter and award his clients such amount as they deem just; and and 3. That in the meantime it be agreed that time is not running so far as the appeal to the High Court is concerned. The solicitor for Messrs. H . Dean and Sons submitted their case in writing. The matter was then considered, together with the evidence and views hy the Crown Solicitor! This officer reportedThe real question in the action was whether there had been any contract at all between the parties, but the action was conducted under the obsolete procedure in force in New South Wales, and the case seems to have centred on the question whether there was a memorandum of a contract sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds. The case was tried before a judge and jury, and a more unsuitable case for trial by jury could hardly be found. I agree with that , and I m a y say, in passi n g , that in cases in w h i c h the Governm e n t is sued by a p r i v at e person before a j u r y the j u r y is generally incline d to favour the private person. The Crown Solicitor's report proceedsPersonally, I am satisfied that the action would never have been instituted if the trial would have had to take place before a judge without a jury. In my opinion there was no evidence whatever of a contract between the plaintiffs and the War Service Homes Commissioner. A Mr Cook, an officer of the commissioner, carried on certain negotiations with the plaintiffs with a view to entering into a contract with them for the supply of bricks to the commissioner, and a number of terms or heads* of agreement were undoubtedly agreed to. Tbere is no suggestion that Mr Cook had authority to bind the commissioner, and it is clear that he never ""even contemplated doing so. The very document put forward as a memorandum of a contract shows clearly on the face of it that it is not a memorandum of a contract at all. It is a report by Mr Cook to the Deputy Commissioner, and' explains the negotiations, and as far as the contract is concerned it states- "" In answer to your verbal request for the result of interview with Mr Dean, of Henry Dean and Sons, on the 20th inst., I wish to inform you as follows :"" Mr Dean was very much against making a contract at the present time, his reasons being (a) uncertainty of output; (b) requires every second kiln to carry on with construction of new kilns; (c) necessity to complete various outside orders in hand; (d) his main reason is the necessity of a guarantee on our part to empty a kiln of 80,000 in four (4) days. 4 "" I explained personally that the quantity of output did not affect the making.of a contract, as I am assured this firm is aiming at an output of 200,000 per week, within twelve (12) months. "" It was finally agreed that a contract be made on basis as follows:-1 . War Service Homes Commission to take whole output of H . Dean and Sons' brickworks from date of signing contracts for a period of five (5) years. 2. Henry Dean and Sons agree to erect additional open kilns and one Hoffman pattern with all possible dispatch. kilns nre now in course of construction.) 3. When the output reaches 130,000 weekly, Henry Dean and Sons to have right to disburse all excess outside of contract. commission guarantees to empty each kiln of 80,000 bricks within five (5) days after twenty four (24) hours' notice of opening has been given to Newcastle office of commission. 5. If conunission be not in a position to take delivery of any particular quantity of bricks, district works officer, Newcastle, to authorize Deans to disburse outside of contract. clause not to prejudice commission's liability tfi take output to 130,000 weekly. 6. The price for good-quality common brick, equal to submitted sample, to be 63s. per 1,000. delivery to be taken by the War Service Homes Commission at kiln. 8. Henry Dean and Sons agree to load all lorries or drays at kiln with all despatch. 0. Price as aforesaid to be varied only by(a) increase or decrease in award rates of labour in brickyards; (b) increase or decrease in cost of coal. 10. Delivery to be subject to climatic conditions. We would be glad if you would have this legally phrased in the form of a contract, inserting any additional matter which may be necessary, but not drastically altering the general conditions, and return to this office to be submitted to Mr Dean for approval and signature.""

The C r o w n Solicitor's report proceeds as f o l l o w s : A lot appears to have been said about Mr. Cook's authority, and holding out, and so on, but it is obvious that Mr Cook was not the Commission, and there is not a shadow of evidence that he had any authority to bind the Commissioner by a contract such as that set up or that the Commissioner held him out as having any such authority. But all this is quite unimportant, as there is clearly no contract even if lie had full authority. (Open As regards proposition (1), viz., that the finding of the jury be accepted, I think that it ought not to be agreed tb because I think 4. The that the finding is not in accordance with the evidence and is contrary to fact and is bad in law. As regards proposition (2) viz., that a select committee be appointed to consider the whole matter and award the plaintiffs such amount as the committee deem just, I think that it sliould not be agreed to, as a similar This course would have to be followed in otlier cases if the plaintiffs should choose to ask for it.

H is r e p o rt proceedsAs regards proposition (3), viz. : that in the meantime it be agreed that time is not running, so far as the appeal to the High Court is concerned, I think that it depends on the acceptance of propositions (1) and (2). But it strikes me that the plaintiffs seem to expect all take and no give, as they ask the Commonwealth not only to abandon its legal rights and to grant a concession as well, but they neither give anything nor abandon anything. The appeal is the plaintiffs' appeal, and they, like other appellants who resort to a court, should be bound by the rules of the court. "" My opinion is that the Commonwealth has nothing to fear from the appeal to the High Nothing Court. My opinion is also that the judgment of the Supreme Court is right and just. My opinion is also that the action is one which ought not to have been brought."" The representations of the firm's so l i c it o r and the available facts in the case were considered by the Cabinet, w h i c h decided that the proposals s u b m it t e d on behalf of Messrs. H .

Dean and Sons on the 2 3 r d A p r i l , 1925, and without calling upon the commission's counsel to address the court, dismissed it with costs. As to the facts of the case, the writin g relied upon by the firm to establish a is the letter o l the 21st September, 1920, from the District Works Officer at Newcastle to the then Deputy Commissioner at Sydney. It is, in effect, nothing more nor less than a report of negotiations carried out by an officer, and agreement reached on certain points subject to the execution of a proper agreement in writing to be submitted to Mr Dean for approval and signature. agreement was neither drafted nor submitted to Mr Dean, negotiations lapsed because of the decision of the Commissioner set out in the following letter dated the 13th November, 1920, in reply to the proposal submitted by the Deputy Commissioner, Sydney, to enter into a contract with Messrs. Dean and Sons. The letter reads: "" With reference to your memorandum above referred to, having in mind the fact that the price of coal at Newcastle is very much cheaper than it is in Sydney, it appears to me that 63s. is too high a price for a contract of the nature you have in view. After full consideration of all sides of the question. I desire to inform you that providing the price of bricks is 60s. per thousand loaded into drays or trucks, as the case may be, and that such price will only increase in so far as there is an increase in the wages fixed by the Arbitration Court ancl that the price of bricks, adding this increase, will at no time be greater than 10 per cent, less than current market rates, negotiations may proceed. The same provision to apply in the case of a decrease in the current market rates. Please report further as to the result of negotiations."" The result of the further discussion between the Deputy Commissioner and Mr . Dean is sot out in the following report from the Deputy Commissioner, Mr . Hutchings, dated the 26th November, 1920 "" In further reference to the above memorandum I have to advise that I placed your views before Messrs. Dean and Sons, but the firm regrets that they are not able to quote any lower price at the present time than 63s. per thousand. They are at present engaged in the duplication of their works, which duplication will be completed within six weeks or two months from this day. I have arranged for them to supply in the ordinary way of business, and not subject to contract, bricks at the previous rate agreed upon, i.e., 63s. per 1,000, and they indicated that when the duplication is in full Ur. mu. order they may. consider a contract for an extended period for a lesser sum than 63s. per 1,000. The matter then dropped, as very early contract in 1921 the Government decided to abandon construction by'day labour, and, in future, to submit all constructional work for completion by contract with private builders. Assuming that there was a contract in existence, the commission to February, 1922, should have ' taken 10,140,000 bricks, but in that period it ordered in the ordinary course of supply 329,000. In sworn evidence Mr Dean Such an admitted that he at no time complained to the commission of any breach of the and the contract, and statedI do not say it was a serious breach of contract, because I did not know that a contract was in existence, and I did not know whether I could enforce a contract at that time; I was not sure of my position. I will say that mucb.",20
40,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,That shows he did not seek it .,21
41,Mr HILL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,It shows that there was no contract.,21
42,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,Is Cook still in the Department ?,21
43,Mr HILL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"I cannot say, but I shall find out if the honourable member wishes me to do so. I give some excerpts from letters received from Mr Dean and signed by him. The first is dated the 2nd June, 1922, and is as follows: Let me ut once clear your mind of any impression of any claim made by me on behalf of my firm to the War Service Homes Commission for compensation for an alleged breach by the commission. I mentioned that your a contract had been drafted for the supply of 520,000 bricks per month, and when the terms were mutually agreed to between us, I was told that the draft would be sent to Sydney for completion. The contract was never completed. When I asked wby the delay I was told that a change of plans had been decided on. . . . If we acted foolishly in doing this before a contract was made, I can truthfully say it was done from an honest desire and determination to do our best to meet the wishes of the commission.",21
44,Mr MAXWELL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"Was that expenditure incurred by Mr Dean with the knowledge of the Commissioner, pending the execution of a contract ?",21
45,Mr HILL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"I am unable to say whether it was incurred with the knowledge of the Commissioner, but it is probable that part of it was incurred with the knowledge of Mr Cook",21
46,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,Who had drafted the working terms of the proposed agreement.,21
47,Mr HILL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"The next letter is dated the 9th August, 1922, and readsI mention this to clear away the statement that I alleged the existence of a contract, and asked for compensation, for an alleged breach of the commission. I never made any such statement. Not for nn alleged breach of contract; that has nothing to do with the matter in my mind. Why that is brought into such prominence I do not know. I have made no claim on that account.",22
48,Mr MAXWELL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"If there was no contract, what was the cause of action ? He says he did not allege a contract.",22

Dean and Sons, and only on the jury finding that there was a contract. A body of laymen is not a suitable tribunal for determining, as a matter of law, the existence of a contract, and, as one judge remarked, it was a puzzle to find any evidence of a contract. Messrs. Dean and Sons appealed to the High Court, the highest legal authoa r i ty in the Commonwealth, and that court dismissed their appeal. They now seek to make the matter a political one. This, on the question of principle alone, is wrong, and every member should take grounds. a firm stand and definitely insist that he will not be a party to such tactics.",22

58,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"The proper way in which to deal with any complaint against law is by an alteration of that law, not by permitting an individual who is sufficiently influential or persistent to induce members of Parliament to allow hie case to be dealt with on other than legal This claim has been pursued f u l ly in the courts, and the decision of the courts has been against it . Therefore, it must be accepted by this House that , is the claimant has no legal right.",22
59,Mr WATKINS,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,Did he not do work at the instance of the department ?,22
60,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"I shall refer to that. comThe inatter must bedealt with on there is no legal right. Then the question arises whether there is any moral right which this House should enforce after the inquiry and report of a select committee. P r i m a facie a citizen of Australia has the rights that the laws give him ; but there are no means of enforcing what are known as moral These are obviously the subject of grave differences of opinion. Parliaments exist for the making of laws to determine what the rights of citizens are, in order that disputes' shall not be decided according to the indefinite and - It more or less varying standards of moral right. When a citizen has failed to establish his rights in the courts of the country, relying upon the laws applying to his case, which this Parliament and other Parliaments have made, that ought to be the end of his claim. But there arc other considerations affecting this case. I understand that the claim is based upon what has been done by a subordinate officer of a Commonwealth department. This Parliament and the Government are in the position of trustees of the public funds, and if they distribute public money to persons who can induce members of Parliament to move for a select committee, and not to persons who are not sufficiently influential to induce members to move on their behalf, we enter upon a very dangerous course. I am debating this motion entirely as a question of principle. suggest that no citizen is entitled to act upon an expectation that a contract will be made, and then to make a charge upon the public funds as though a contract had been made. Our duty is prima facie to make laws and leave the courts to adjudicate upon the cases brought uuder them. The courts, having administered the laws, their decisions should be regarded as final. If the laws do not meet with the approval of this Parliament or other Parliaments that have made them, the Parliament concerned should take action; but it is emphatically not for Parliament to sit as a court of appeal from the ordinary tribunals of the country. If we once begin to do that, it will mean that any individual - vvho is sufficiently persistent or influential will be able to get his case reheard after it has failed in the court. Honourable members must know that every day of the year there are citizens who fail in claims brought sometimes against other citizens, and sometimes against the Government, and they fail often upon what are called technical points, which means that claims are not claims recognized by the laws made by Parliament. this instance the claim appears to be based upon a change of policy by a governmental department. Substantially it appears to reduce itself to this-that a citizen of the Commonwealth had reason to believe that a certain policy would be pursued, by a Government department. He extended his works or incurred other expenditure upon the faith Mr Latham. of that belief, and in so doing took an ordinary business risk. The department's policy was changed. Now, if this Parliament is going to admit, in effect, claims for damages owing to changes of departmental policy, how wide the field that we open to possible claimants! All kinds of legislation affect the rights of citizens, and in many cases new legislation, or changes of departmental policy, result in pecuniary loss to citizens. The most conspicuous example of the kind is legislation affecting the tariff. Changesin the tariff undoubtedly affect the pecuniary interests of large classes of the community. Is it to be dreamed of that the public funds are to be held responsible for I a change of policy, whether made by responsible Ministers in control of a department, or by Parliament itself ? I put it to the House that the claim is unreasonable, and that if it were admitted we should have as a common practice the appointment of committees of this House for the purpose of considering what, in effect, were appeals from our courts of law; and deciding those appeals, in accordance, not with the laws which Parliament has made, but more or less with the indefinite ideas of honourable members of what was a fair thing. For those reasons, I oppose the motion. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [3.41] - Honourable members have just listened to the argument of a lawyer who is speaking on behalf of the Government. I do not understand legal points myself, but the position as it appears to me is that the War Service Homes Department decided to build 200 houses a month. Ib approached Dean and Sons, manufacturers of bricks, and said, "" Your plant is too small; duplicate it and supply our requirements."" This company, in goodfaith, dealing with an officer of the detheir partment, extended its plant to supplyrequirements. A considerable expense was. In incurred. The Minister today read a number of documents which showed, undoubtedly, that the department had a. knowledge of the negotiations between Dean and Sons and Mr Cook. Had the policy of the department not been changed, the contract would have beencompleted. In this cowardly way advantage was taken of a small business company with little capital. Notwithstanding the legal quibbling which we have just heard, and the talk about standing on legal rights, I maintain that any citizen of this country has the right to appeal to this House for justice. I am surprised that honourable members opposite intend to vote against the motion. It is an old institution that the Speaker has the right to receive petitions, and the most humble citizen of Australia can petition to this House. This company has the right to come to this House to obtain justice. M t . GREGORY - After its case has beeu defeated in court? Mr E . RILEY - This case went before a jury and Dean gained a verdict. appeal was made, and the case was lost on a technical point. Honourable members opposite set the law on a pedestal, and contend that it should not be criticized. This Parliament is above the courts of law in this country. The judges are the employees of this Parliament. We provide them with their salaries, and if their decisions are wrong, this Parliament should put them right. The honourable member for Newcastle has a right to move in this House for a select committee. The investigations of the committee would cost the country nothing. Its members would give good service free, hear the facts, examine documents, and the House. I am not a legal man, and I look at this matter from a common-sense point of view. I am surprised that honourable members opposite, who profess to be democrats, deny the right to a citizen of this country to appeal for justice to this House. I shall vote for the motion.",22
61,Mr MAXWELL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"Fawkner) [ 3 . 4 6 ] agree with the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) that we should very careful indeed in appointing selectvery committees of this House. I also agree with the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) that we have no right appoint a select committee to sit in judgGovernment? ment on the courts of the land. have no right to appoint a select mittee that might be regarded as a kind of court of appeal from the courts of the land. But if the facts are as I under Mr Dean's assumption. stand them to be, I shall certainly vote for the appointment of the proposed select committee. I understand that a repreby the Commissioner?"" sentative of a government department, Mr . Cook, acting on behalf of the Commissioner for War Service Homes, entered into negotiations with Messrs. Dean and Sons; that he agreed with them upon the terms of a contract to be entered into, and that the next step in the proceedings was to reduce the contract to proper form , so that it could be formally executed. But - and the whole case turns on this-pend ing the preparation of the document for execution, the department, by its attitude and action, gave Messrs. Dean and Sous to understand that the contract would be executed in due course.",24
62,Mr ATKINSON,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,The Commissioner objected to the price.,24
63,Mr MAXWELL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"I am relating the An facts as I understand thera. The Commissioner, through his representative, Mr . Cook, induced the company to incur an expenditure respecting the contract that it was expected would be executed. Owing to a change of policy on the part of the Commissioner, the contract was eventually not entered into, and Messrs. Dean and Sons brought an action, The courts have held that no contract existed, and that, therefore, there was no cause of action. If that is so, then Messrs. Dean and Sons are entitled to have the facts inquired intoj and if they incurred expenditure owing to the attitude or report to action of the Commissioner, they are entitled to some compensation. A select committee inquiring into these facts would not in any sense question the decision of the courts. The courts may have been perfectly right in deciding on the facts before them that.no contract existed, and that as far as legal claim was concerned, - I Messrs. Dean and Sons had absolutely no case. But the fact remains that very be often a man having no legal claim has a strong moral claim. What harm can be done in appointing a, select committee which, after all, inquires into the facts to and makes a recommendation to the We Mr HILL - Mr Dean assumed that he comhad obtained the contract.",24
64,Mr MAXWELL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"It is no question of The question is: "" Did Mr Dean make the assumption on the strength of representations made",24
65,Mr HILL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,I believe not.,24
66,Mr MAXWELL,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"As far as I know it was not, as the honourable member for Kooyong suggests, that Messrs. Deau and Sons incurred expense simply on the strength of their owu belief that the contract, would be entered into. If that were so, they would have no claim at all, and I should vote against the appointment of a selectcommittee. My vote will depend on whether the fact can be established that Messrs. Dean and Sons were induced to incur expenditure hy the representations of the department. I understand that at that time, as the honourable member for South Sydney pointed out, the department was exceedingly anxious to get ahead with certain work, and in all probability told Messrs. Dean and Sons that they could proceed with the work. the meantime the Commissioner changed his mind, and Messrs. Dean and Sons were left, lamenting. Mr Dean admitted, in one of the letters read by the Minister, that he quite recognized that there was no contract, but on the strength of the representations of the Minister, he had incurred expense, and, if that was so, although he had no legal claim to compensation, he had a very strong moral claim.",24
67,Mr SCTJLLIN,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,Yarra) [3.51] - I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Newcastle for the appointment of a select committee. I do so without a knowledge of the facts other than what I have heard here today. I think it is sufficient for an honourable member to make out a prima facie case to warrant him in asking for the appointment of a select committee on a matter affecting the Government. The argument put forward by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) is that a man has no right to come here once his case has been defeated in the courts of the country.,25
68,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,That is a sound general principle.,25
69,Mr SCTJLLIN,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"If the honourable member thinks so, then he should have been found voting in quite a different direction from that in which he has voted in this chamber, especially when the Government came down to this House with validating measures to upset the decisions of the courts of this country.",25
70,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,I have voted against those measures.,25
71,Mr SCTJLLIN,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,Not on all occasions.,25
72,Mr LATHAM,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,I have voted against all retrospective legislation.,25
73,Mr SCTJLLIN,WAR SERVIC E HOMES,"I have a strong recollection of the wool agreements that were entered into between the Commonwealth Government and a number of fellmongering companies. When the court declared that none of those agreements were legal, a validating measure was introduced into this chamber legalizing agreements as far back as 1917. Last year this House dealt with In a measure to validate an act of the Government, which, though morally right, . was held by the courts to be illegal. I supported the measure, and would do so again. I do not suggest that anybody who has failed as a litigant may apply t.o this Parliament for the appointment of a select committee to re-open his case, but if a-man who has a moral claim against the Government fails to establish it in the courts because of a technicality, what chance of redress has he other than that afforded by an inquiry by a parliamentary committee? In our pri' vate capacities, if any person has a moral, but not a legal, claim against us, and we are just men we agree to A negotiate with him sp that equity may be done. Surely the Government should adopt the same attitude. I do not say that the moral claim of Henry Dean and Sons is strong, although' upon the facts related to the House this afternoon it seems so - This House is merely asked to appoint a select committee to investigate the claim. The committee, if appointed, would inquire into all the circumstances connected with the transaction in question, and the claim of the contractors would be proved to be either just or unjust. When the coanmittee reported its findings, the House would still have the right to determine whab action should be taken. Any man whoi has entered into a verbal or written agreement, or any other arrangement with the Government under which he has ""suffered through the actions of Commonwealth officers, and is unable to get redress at law, is entitled to have his case heard by a seiecfc committee representing all parties in this House.

I have reason to remember a ruling to that effect given on a previous occasion in this House. Honourable members will recollect that a bill came before us which it was desired to amend, but Mr Speaker ruled that honourable members had missed their opportunity to object to it in that they had allowed the order of leave to go through without opposition. I do not intend to let this occasion pass without entering my protest against the lack of information. Certain portions of this order of leave are set out in definite language. We have the words, "" refunds of income tax . "" There is no doubt as to the meaning of those words, but there is considerable doubt as to the meaning of the words, "" and for other purposes."" What are those other purposes? The Government has already refunded the taxation.",28

94,Mr FENTON,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"I should not go so far as that. I do not suppose that opportunity would be taken under this bill to amend the electoral law, but I anticipate that definite proposals other than the refunding of income tax will be brought before us under this bill ; otherwise there would be no necessity for the words "" and for other purposes."" We should allow the Treasurer a very wide range indeed if we permit this order of leave to pass without opposition. Unless he can give a satisfactory explanation of what he intends to do, I feel disposed to move that the words "" and for other purposes "" be. struck out. If the bill were confined to the validation of certain refunds of income tax, we should know where we stood, although, probably, we should object to the refunds being made and vote against the bill. As the motion contains the words "" and for other purposes "" it might be construed as authorizing the introduction of a bill validating any financial act. Members on this side are not opposing the motion merely for the sake of doing so. Mr Speaker understands the situation, he having had extensive experience both in the Commonwealth Parliament and the Victorian Parliament. He at least realizes what a wide range of financial proposals could be introduced under this motion. I move That the words "" and for other purposes"" lie left out.  [ 4 . 2 1 ] - I hope that the amendment will be carried. I know quite well that honourable members opposite are prepared to do whatever the Government tells them to do. One could not expect the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) to take an independent stand and vote according to his .conscience Qn such a question as this. This kind of procedure has become, by repetition, almost second nature to the Government. The House is asked to validate something that has already been done. Honourable members do not know even the nature of the action to be validated, and much less do they know what the "" other purposes"" are. This is not the first time that honourable members have been trapped into giving a too ready consent to the introduction of a bill. It is only right that honourable members should be told, when they are asked to vote on a motion like this, what they are committing themselves to. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Mahony) should be congratulated on in tervening, i u the interests of fairness, at this stage. Although it asks honourable members to agree to the motion, the Government is not honest enough to tell us what the bill will do. We ought not to be asked to go further than to agree to a bill being introdu.ced to validate something that the Government has done; but we are asked to agree to something about which we will not know anything until after we have voted. On a former occasion the Prime Minister was very prominent i u contending that we could not take certain action because of an order of leave, and I have no doubt that if he gets his way this time lie w i i l prevent honourable members ' from discussing the question properly. Seeing that the Speaker has ruled that an objection cannot be raised at a later stage, the right time to object is now. The Minister in charge of the bill ought to tell the House what the "" other purposes "" are.",28
95,Mr WEST,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"East Sydney) [ 4 . 2 6 ] the House gives the Treasurer leave to bring in the bill, alterations of it w i l be permitted. Their experience during the last few years should induce honourable members to take more interest in the financial affairs of this country. If the House is to be treated in this way, honourable members might as well give the Government unfettered control of finance. I am strongly opposed to doing that, and shall seize every opportunity to prevent it being done. We do not know whether the refunds have been made necessary by errors of administration, by High Court decisions, or by those things which the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr . Latham) is so anxious, because he and hia legal friends have done, so well out of them, not to interfere with . When administrative mistakes have been made, the House should be given an opportunity to warn those responsible that, the errors must not be repeated. I surmise that some of the refunds are necessary in the Customs Department, which taxed electrical machinery wrongly, contrary t.n the intention of the Parliament. T 1 machinery was for use by a public utility, and was not obtainable in Australia.' No doubt the department has come to the conclusion that it must refund some of the duty collected. If I were the Treasurer, having a nature that prompts me to handle business in an honest way, I should be only .too ready to place all the facts before the House. The Government ought to give way on this matter. Surely it is uot afraid to publish all the details! Surely our administration has not become so degraded that the Government needs to be secretive! If so, it should be turned out of office at once, and we should not wait u n t i l the end of the year for an election. But it has suflicient numbers in this House to cut the throats of t.he members of the Opposition if the standing orders would permit it . Members of the Opposition are demonstrating their desire to have the affairs of this country administered honestly, instead of by the "" backdoor"" method now so often employed.",29
96,Dr EARLE PAGE,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"Cowper-Trea surer) [4.31] - In order to satisfy members of the Opposition, who have taken an extraordinary action in objecting to this motion, I shall explain what the usual procedure at this stage is, why it is fol- If lowed, and what would be the effect of the amendment. Ordinarily the motion for l not' leave to bring down a bill , and the first reading of it , are treated as formal, with the object of enabling honourable members to see the bill in print before discussing it. On the second reading the Minister in charge of it explains its provisions, so that honourable members can discuss it in the light of that explanation, and with a full knowledge of its contents. That procedure is being followed in this instance. It would be quite unfair for me to enter into a long explanation of the bill at this stage, before honourable members have had an opportunity of reading it. The title of the bill has been deliberately chosen by the law officers of the Crown, who say that it is a title that defines the objects of the bill. When leave is-asked to introduce a bill for certain objects, "" and for other purposes,"" it is taken for granted that t.he "" other purposes "" are cognate to those objects, and in accordance with the principles of t.he n;easure. If the amendment of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Fenton i were agreed to, the machinery vf necessary, to carry out the objects of t.he bill could not be provided.

Debate resumed from 1st July (vide page 601),'on motion by Mr BRUCEThat this bill be now read a second time, on which Mr Charlton had way of amendment That after the word "" now "" the following words be inserted : - "" withdrawn and redrafted to provide more adequate provisions regarding alien immigration, and for the reconsideration of the drastic proposals to deport Australian citizens.""",30
99,Mr COLEMAN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"Reid) [4.351-After the bewildering outburst last night of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Foster), who pronounced a series of curses upon the party with which I am associated, the time has arrived to apply a little reasoned argument tc the bill - The first part of the bill proposes to vest in the executive the right to fix the quota of immigrants to be allowed into Australia from southern European and foreign countries. The case against that part of it has already been ably stated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), who pointed out that the control of immigration by the present Government has been most unsatisfactory. A secret agreement was entered into with the Maltese Government, behind the back of this Parliament, under which the quota of Maltese who could be admitted into Australia was increased. it seems to .be the definite policy of this Government to ignore Parliament in these matters. I , for one, am not prepared to vest a discretionary power in the Ministry to determine how many Southern Jiuropean migrants, or migrants trom any otner country, shall be admitted into Australia, for experience shows that in this regard the Government cannot be trusted. The system adopted i u the United States of America of prescribing by statute the quota of migrants to. be purpose admitted is a proper one. If the Government does not deal with this acute problem in a thorough and satisfactory way, in the near future, disastrous effects to the economic well-being of our people will follow. Because of ite great gravity, Parliament is the only authority which should determine this matter. The only reason, that the Prime Minister gave for not incorporating in the bill a quota system on the lines of American legislation was that if we were to fix a quota by legislation it would cause considerable resentment amongst European nations at the present time. Is that sufficient justification for the Government to claim the exclusive right moved by to say who shall and who shall not be admitted to Australia ? That the methods adopted by the Government are unbusiness-like and totally unsatisfactory is shown by the manner in which shiploads of undesirable migrants have been brought to this country, simply to be disappointed and returned to their own land. Will not a continuance of that policy be calculated to cause more resentment, in the countries from which these unfortunate people come? We have a perfect right, under international law, to determine who shall be admitted as citizens of this country. The most practical way of dealing with the problem, aud the one calculated to cause the least other amount of f r i c t i o n with European nations, is for us to fix. definite immigration quotas. The Prime Minister also objected to the quota system on the ground that its adoption would involve the maintenance of an extensive consular service throughout Europe. I fail to see why that should be necessary. We already have a passport system in operation, and that could be extended aud adapted for the purpose of limiting the inflow of migrants from particular countries. The adoption of the quota system is undoubtedly the most honest and practical course to take to restrict migration. We should say to people in other lands, "" We reserve to ourselves the right to maintain our racial purity, and we are prepared to allow only so many of your nationals admittance into our country annually."" The attitude of the Labour party towards immigration has been subjected to a certain amount of criticism by honourable members opposite, and, as usual, it has been misrepresented. It might be us well, therefore, for me to repeat definitely, here and now, that the Labour party is opposed to immigration while present economic conditions prevail. One of the factors that has determined the attitude of the Labour party on immigration is the unemployment position. 1 understand Mr Sutcliffe, of the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics, to have recently said that over 150,000 people are out of work in Australia at this moment. About 10 per cent, of our wage and salary earners, or 159,080 persons, were unemployed according to the 1921 census on the 4th April, 1921, there being at the same date 1,661,973 wage or salary earners all told. If such facts as these do not constitute an adequate reason for the adoption of our policy on migration, what in the name of reason would be considered to be practical grounds for objection? Apart altogether from the unemployment stand-point, the Labour party believes that natural development of this country and the growth of our secondary industries will ^continue in such a way as to induce a class of migrant to come here which will be infinitely more acceptable and much more easily assimilated than the class that is coming in consequence of the artificial means that this Government has taken to stimulate immigration. During this debate much has been said about the reasons which induced the Government of the United States of America to restrict immigration to that country. It can hardly be doubted, on the evidence available, that the American attitude was adopted in consequence of the alarming way in which people from foreign countries were flocking into that country. The United States of America, at this moment, includes about 14,000,000 foreigners in her population, and their presence constitutes a very grave problem. No one who has been to the United States of America and has seen, as I have, the huge colonies of Germans, French, Italians, and even negroes, in her great cities, each of which supports a newspaper printed in its own language, which maintains a vigorous propaganda in favour of the particular racial prejudices of its nationals, c-an Af r. Coleman. fail to 'recognize that America's foreign population constitutes a grave and serious problem to the government. In view of America's experience, we should certainly do our utmost to preserve our 98 per cent, of British origin, which is our most sacred possession. Another' matter which perturbed the Government of the United States of America, and led to the adoption of the quotasystem, was the great army of unemployed which grew up in that country in consequence of the unrestricted immigration that was permitted. In the twelfth annual report of the United States Secretary for Labour (Mr J. J. Davis), which covered the fiscal year that ended on the 30th June, 1924, are some most interesting statements. Publico tious such as this, may I say in passing, are not procurable in our Library. Honourable members who desire to have them must obtain them from private sources. I secured this copy direct from America. I find, that the Library had a copy of the report for the previous year, but I experienced the utmost difficulty in getting hold of it . We ought surely to have available publications the which will inform us of the experience of America, and of the remedies that she has adopted to deal with the enormous influx of foreign people into her coimtry, particularly in view of the present subject of discussion. The report to which I have referred contains the following:Since the close of the war the subject of immigration has been receiving more and more attention by the American people. It will bo recalled that wben this administration came into office in 1921 there were nearly 6,000,000 bread-winners out of employment in the United States of America, and immigration was beginning to assume its pre-war proportions, f h e 66tii Congress realized that the rising tide of unemployment and labour unrest in certain quarters called for some definite action in the way of an immigration policy. A bill placing a numerical limit upon immigration to the United States of America was passed by the Congress, but did not receive the signature of President Wilson. While this bill died with the close of that Congress, it was passed in substantially the same form at the special session called by the late President Harding, and became a law on 19th May, 1921. The law was amended und extended by the resolution of 11th May, 1922, but expired by limitation on 30th June, 1924. Economic conditions in America have changed since the first limit was placed upon the number of immigrants that were to be given the privilege of taking up residence here. The millions of unemployed have been more or less absorbed into normal conditions of employment. The great pool of surplus labour which existed in 1921 has been drained nearly dry, and the advocates of cheap labour a year ago, in anticipation of a shortage, began a vigorous national campaign for open immigration, ou the theory that Europe was a reservoir of labour, and all that was necessary to secure it was an open main. The economic dangers that faced the United State3 of Americai n consequence of the magnitude which her foreign immigration assumed, and also the unavoidable unemployment, which was a natural corollary, was undoubtedly the principal reason which induced her to restrict immigration by adopting the quota system of immigration. Another which might be mentioned was the effect which the enormous increase of foreign people was having on her own citizens. The third factor w h i c h ' I shall mention was eugenic. I am not one to cast aspersions on fellow human beings of any country, but we cannot get away from the. results of scientific investigation. following is from the report which I previously quoted, and it deals specifically with the results of the migration of southern European nationals United States of AmericaA scientist who made a thorough study of American mental standard, testifying before the House of Representatives Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, estimated that if the mental tests applied to the American army during the world war had been enforced against the foreign-born now in the United States, and all showing a mental level below a standard fixed between low average and inferior intelligence had been excluded, 45.6 per cent, of the nearly 14,000,000 foreign-born in the United States would have been barred. There is the undoubted justification for the attitude that has been adopted by the United States of America. In order that Australia may profit from the American experience, the Labour party demands that a most stringent limitation shall be placed on the influx of other than Britishborn people into this country. We wish to maintain our own racial purity. Parliament is the authority to determine the quotas of foreign people that shall be admitted to Australia. It should not be left to the caprice of a particular Minister or to the policy of a particular government. The inatter is far too serious. The increase in population by immigration reached its peak period in the United States of America in 1907- I am speaking now from memory-whe n the number admitted was 1,285,000 people. 1914, out of a total immigration of 1,218,480 persons, 915,002 were from , eastern and southern Europe. In 1921, the year in which the first quota system operated, 222,260 out of a total migration to America of 805,228 were Italians. In spite of the stringent regulations which America now enforces, 6,409 migrants were refused admittance there last year for various causes, included in which were insanity, epileissy, and imbecility. If the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) proposes to participate in this debate, I should like him to in for m honourable members whether the report of Sir Neville Howse on the examination of migrants has been considered, and whether the Government 1 has given effect to, or pro-poses to give effect to, his recommendations. In any case the reports of our medical advisers are all based upon physical standards of perfection. The American Tho Secretary of Labour has said that that was the serious blunder in the policy of. the United States of America, and that the Government should have paid as to the much, if not more, attention to the memtal development of the migrant. This is a matter to which our Government should give very serious consideration. The remarks which have been contributed to this debate, based on the report of Mr Ferry, the royal commisisoner who inquired into migration to Queensland, have been such, as to show that the problems that have afflicted America are problems with which, we are already confronted. People have already come into the Commonwealth who cannot be assimilated into our social system, nor can they adapt themselves to our economic standards. We have admitted, people whose habits, ideas, training, and former environment have been such as to make them a very serious problem indeed for this country. There is no need to dilate upon the desirability of preserving the purity of our race. It has already, been referred to by other speakers. It is dealt with in Mr Ferry's report, and in the United States of America it is accepted as the guiding feature of the modern migration policy of that country. In regard to immigration, the United States, of America has reached the limit of absorption.' Indeed, in the opinion of independent critics, she passed that limit many years ago. We cannot' hope to maintain our high standard of civilizaIn tion and physical perfection if we do not' give the matter of immigration very serious .attention. It is universally recognized, and we are entitled to say it ourselves, that in this country we have a very high standard of mental perfection and physical efficiency. These are qualities which have stood us in good stead in bringing the Australian Commonwealth to its present stage of development. me say here that the stage velopment which has been reached in Australia in the short, space of a little over 100 years is remarkable. Experience has told us that the migrants whotook the risk of adventuring abroad to come to this country, settle here, and become its citizens,, have been the persons who have readily adapted themselves to OUT conditions. The people who have been brought here from overseas under schemes;, and various schemes mainly intended to relieve Great Britain of unemployed and in some instances of physical' 1 misfits - though that has recently checked to some extent-have readily assimilated. In America it was never found necessary toresort to artificial means: of stimulating that country. I mention this because last evening the Postmaster-General son) took honourable members on this side to task because they did not exhibit a readiness and anxiety to take of that doubtful. Grecian gift, the migration agreement. That agreement was designed to relieve Great Britain of its unemployed problem, but its acceptance would commit this country to very widespread obligations. It provided that we should absorb a huge number of migrants for whom preference"" should be given in employment and in land settlement. grave consideration of the inatter is required before this or any other lian Parliament can safely decide whether the agreement is designed in the best interests of"" the Commonwealth. United States of America crease in population has been very largely to the American of developing secondary Let it be said that in concurrent of development the increase of population in America has. been proportionately much smaller than the increase in Australia - The report from which I have quoted contains a number of very interesting statistics, and I should like to have them included in Hansard Mr Coleman. reading them, bnt I understand that is not permissible.",30
100,Mr SPEAKER,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"No . ; Mr COLEMAN - During the past fifteen years the population of the United States of America increased by Let 10,000,000. The total increase of populaof. de- tion by immigration since-1820 amounted to 35,000,000. If we take the last 40 years, the period of great industrial exundoubtedly pansion in America, we shall find that the . population increased by between 25,000,000 and 26,000,000, speaking again from memory, as the result of the admission of migrants. The balance of the inmost crease in population during the period was due to natural increase. I understand .that the Commonwealth Statistician settlement has told us that the present rate of increase in our population through ordinary channels of migration reaches the limit of our power of absorption.. In view of the been; number of our unemployed, it is 'evident not been so that the statement of the Commonwealth - Statistician is based upon actual facts-. I have gone - into this lengthy explanation migration to dealing with migrationto j u s t if y the attitude of the party with which I am asso(Mr Gib- ciated. ""We believe that there are ways and means of stimulating the prosperity of the country and of absorbing unemadvantage ployed. Schemes might be adopted for the construction of public works, amongst others the building of cruisers here, and similar proposals, which would create prosperity and open up avenues of employment, and we could look for additions to our population due to the natural attraction of our prosperity. Very 1. turn now briefly to the deportation clause of the bill . I wish to put it on Austra- record, for the information of the, perro'le who sent me here to represent them. Proposed section 8AA of this bill vests in In the the Minister the power to deport, from the in- Australia any person who is concerned due "" in acts directed towards the hindering policy or obstructing to the. prejudice of the pubindustries. lic the transport of' goods or conveyance periods of passengers."" It also gives the M in ister power to proclaim that a serious in very dustrial disturbance exists. In the first place, I condemn this legislation because of its "" panicky "" character. It typifies the incompetence of the Governmant to face and solve industrial problems without in a practical way. We all know, and there need be no hiding the fact, that this legislation is designed for a specific purpose, and to deal with an individual problem. It s introduction cannot be .""justified by the widest stretch of the imagination. It is contrary to the spirit of British constitutionalism, and to the spirit of Magna Charta. I propose to quote from Magna Charta, of which all Britishers have boasted for centuries past. It has been our proudest boast that the fundamental features of the British Constitution-tria l by j u r y and the liberty of the subject-ar e based upon that famous and historic document.",33
101,Mr FENTON,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"A very important meeting at Runnymede was held recently in connection with it . Mr COLEMAN"" - Yes ; only the other day people went to Runnymede to celebrate the downfall of K in g John and the anniversary of British freedom. Article 39 of Magna Charta readsNo freeman shall be arrested or detained in prison or deprived of his freehold or outlawed or banished or in any way molested: and we will not set forth against him nor send against him unless by a lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land. That has all been disregarded by the Government, and it has also disregarded tha spirit of the Habeas Corpus Act and the Bill of Rights. These three constitutional documents have been the boast of every person with British blood in his veins as typical of B r i tish institutions. Under this bill an arbitrary power is to be vested in a Minister of the Crown to determine what is right on political considerations, charged, no doubt, with bias. We are being asked to substitute for the spirit of the British constitutional system the spirit which characterizes the French or Continental system where the state is supreme and the liberty of the individual does not count-the system, rightly condemned by British constitutionalists, known as droit adminisiratif or "" administrative right."" I do not challenge the sovereignty of this Parliament or the supreme power of the Government to do as it pleases under the Commonwealth Constitution or to carry out Executive acts, but I say that we are warranted in protesting against this legislation which is absolutely out of harmony with the spirit which has hitherto characterized the constitutionalism of the Commonwealth. The honourable memher for Kooyong (Mr Latham), who is a lawyer, in effect damned this bill with faint praise. He suggested by inference that the arbitrary power which under the measure is to be vested in the Minister may be dangerously used. We have every reason to believe that it will be dangerously used. During the regime of this Government Parliament has been shut, up for eight or nine months at a stretch,, and matters of far-reaching consequence to the welfare of the Commonwealth have been dealt with by Executive acts. Parliament has not been given the opportunity to express an unhampered opinion upon those acts. The caucus system dominates the Nationalist andt Country parties opposite, although they are always attacking us because we are bound by a similar system. The caucus system on this and other questions binds honourable members opposite into such a mass that it is impossible to get an independent expression of opinion from them. The honourable member for Kooyong has a legal conscience, and he is able to plead in any way it suits him . Only the other day in the law courts he defended a certain man named Thomas Walsh against his beingfined £10, and in doing so pointed out the inherent weakness of the Commonwealth arbitration system. He pleaded along lines that were totally in contradistinction to the argument he submitted in support of this bill. There is no justification for this legislation at the present time, whatever may have been the justification for similar legislation during the war years, when we had in force the War Precautions Act. Personally, I saw no sufficient justification for that legislation; but, assuming that there was justification because of national emergency, no such reason exists today to warrant the in troduction of legislation such as this bill . The fact that the Government has resorted to this legislation is a proof of its inherent weakness and mental inability to understand the psychology of the people of the Commonwealth. We have always demanded the fullest degree of freedom of speech and action, and by this legislation the Government is attempting to deprive us of something that is a part of our very life . The Government proposes to create boards to deal with the deportation of individuals. The personnel of the boards will be determined by the Government. It will probably appoint persons favourable to its political view. The whole thing is morally wrong. Even if we were to admit the right of the Government deport British subjects, the proper authority to determine the question is a j u r y of the accused man's country.men presided over by a judge who would be above party strife and bitterness, a man whose position of judicial eminence and independence would be such that he could be confidently trusted to determine any matter brought before him in the light of the constitutional principles which should guide the policy of this country. Here, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, we have a Government that classes citizens of the British Empire as aliens. Englishmen, I r men, Scotchmen, Welshmen, natives of New Zealand, South Africans, and every other part of the Empire niay be regarded as aliens. In other words, the unity of the Empire is swept away by l his decision of the Government.",34
102,Mr MCNEILL,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,It is a sult.,35
103,Mr COLEMAN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"It is not only an insult, but whilst we have Imperial unity it is a line of policy to which Great B r it a in has every reason to object. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility ihat the time will come before long when Great Bri t a in will object to our treating British subjects as though they were foreigners. In a few month's we shall have a change of Government, and the Labour party will then have an opportunity of rectifying the maladministration of this Government. designed to deal only with an emergency industrial"" situation, and of course the Government, in framing its polioy, is guided by its class view-point, by its attitude toward social problems, by its general environment and by its association with market-riggers, land monopolists, profiteers, and others. There is no suggestion in the bill to deport persons who by inflating prices, causing lock-outs, rigging markets, and various other nefarious methods cripple the prosperity of Australia, create unemployment, and arouse social bitterness. These persons are friends and supporters of the Government, and they obtain knighthoods and other distinctions as rewards for their masterly exposition of capitalist philosophy. The Government will , no doubt, pass this measure, because honourable members behind the Ministry will support it , no matter how far-reaching to its effect may be. There will be no in dependent vote from Government supporters, except perhaps from one or two honourable members, such as the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes), who during this session has been a caustic critic of the Government which he formerly led. As I have said, the clause providing for deportation is repugnant to B ritis h institutions. The Boards created under this legislation will be creatures of the Government, and their decisions will be made during moments of passion and public prejudice which the circumi s h - stances of the time have excited. Furthermore, ""the proposal to create boards and to give the Minister authority to deport British subjects from Australia will not achieve the purpose desired by the Government. The Prime Minister, in his w i ld and hysterical statements about the present industrial situation in Australia, national instated that strikes occur as the result of the efforts of one or two individuals. This statement shows that the Prime M in ister undoubtedly knows nothing of the industrial psychology of the masses, the control and management of trade unions, and their many problems. These are things from which he has held himself aloof. H is outlook is not Australian, but English, and his whole training has served to keep him out of touch with the economic condition of trade unionism. It is absurd to suggest that one or two in dividuals are controlling and directing the The b i ll is industrial polioy of the great unions of this country. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes) knows this full well, because only a few days ago in a debate in this Houso he called it a fallacious doctrine, and years ago he himself was a successful strike leader, who never hesitated to take any measures necessary to bring strikes to a successful issue. I hope that before the debate closes we. shall at least hear something from him regarding the - effect of this proposed legislation. Honourable members supporting the Government are' always ready to talk about national honour, and the need to fight in the in terests of the national welfare. They do not seem to recognize that in industrial matters the question of honour is very often involved. Most strikes are the natural outcome of the employers' tactics, and are very often the only means of bringing about a satisfactory settlement. The proposal to deport strike leaders, who, after all, are the duly elected representatives of their unions, is striking a blow at the right of collective bargaining, which implies the right of domestic control by members over the management and administration of their unions. Contrast this policy with that of Britain, where the right to strike has been, recognized since 1S75 by British Parliaments. To say that the whole course of industrial policy in the Commonwealth is controlled by one or two individuals is also a reflection upon the intelligence of the mass of the workers. It is an evidence of the abyssmal depths of ignorance into which the Prime Minister has sunk while misleading his Government and his colleagues. Only a few months ago there was in our Australian waters a coffin-ship known as the Port Lyltlcton. It was proved definitely that this vessel was unseaworthy and a menace to human lives. The organized unions refused to man the ship, and said that the vessel would not be allowed to put to sea. The Fuller Government of New South Wales, which has since been relegated to the oblivion which it rightly deserved, immediately flung the union secretaries into jail and refused them bail. Had this legislation been in operation at that time, these men would have heen deported. It is such actions as these that cause the workers to take extreme measures to secure the recognition of their activities. Legislation of this character must have a far-reaching effect, and I submit that if the Government use the authority outlined in the bill, abolish trial by jury, and deport men at the instance of a biased Minister, it will not mitigate, but rather foment, industrial disturbances. The great body of public opinion will at all times resist unfair legislation, and will destroy those who administer it. Like the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) and other honourable members on this side, I have had considerable experience of unionism in this country. For eight years I was connected with the Seamen's Union, and I profess to understand the psychology of its members. In 1906 I , as a boy, went to sea. The hours were about 60 a week, and the seamen worked two watches of six hours. The coal consumption was not limited, as it was subsequently under the Navigation Act. the outcome of years of agitation by the Seamen's Union. The wages and conditions of the seamen were barbarous, and their manner of living was not fit for dogs. The men had no satisfactory menu, their food being practically thrown at them. They had no protection at all. It was only as a result of the efforts of their industrial organization that the seamen were able to throw off this iniquitous and arduous form of economic servitude. All 'along the line the seamen, in their fight to secure better conditions, were met with the bitterest opposition of the shipowning interests. Similar conditions existed in other industries; for instance, in 1916 I took over the organization of the clerks in New South Wales. The living wage at that time was £2 15s. 6d. a week; I found that clerks were receiving 30s. a week after twenty years' faithful service with reputable city mercantile houses. Amongst the principal offenders were the soft goods warehouses of York-street, Sydney, and Flinders-lane, Melbourne. Only after a strenuous struggle and resort to cajolery and diplomacy were we able to bring about an amelioration of working conditions. Because we were not strongly organized, the employers regarded us with contempt; but by a slow and painful effort, coupled with the liberalization of the state arbitration laws, clerks and others have secured a fair measure of redress. Therefore, to attribute to organized workers the blame for all industrial holdups, as this bill contemplates, is to ignore historical facts. For many years in New South Wales the interests associated with the party which now occupies the Ministerial bench in this chamber restricted the right of access to the Arbitration Court because of employers' opposition. Following the same class policy, the Government is attempting, by this bill, to place upon the workers and their leaders the full responsibility for every industrial trouble, whether it be a strike or a lock-out. The industrial history of this Commonwealth proves that that attitude is not warranted. At the present, time serious industrial trouble, affecting the whole Commonwealth, is threatened: and this Government fails to realise that .methods of conciliation and will be more effective than repression and coercion. The latter policy has never succeeded in Australia. It did not work with our soldiers on the other side of the world. They rose in revolt against it; their love of liberty was such that, while they could not be driven, they were willing to be led. The same thing applies in industrial circles in Australia today. Th.3 Government fails to accept those principles which should guide any Government in its oonduct of a nation's affairs. Do honourable members on the side remember the fable of the wjind and the sun ? According to this fable, , the wind and the sun strove for mastery over a man who was wearing a heavy cloak. The wind thought that it would cause him to discard his cloak by blowing with all its force; but the man only folded the garment more tightly around him. But. the sun shone genially upon him, and, under its warming influence, he soon discarded (he cloak. In that fable lies a great moral. Every effort to force people only creates resentment. A conciliatory attitude will always accomplish more than force. The right honourable member North Sydney (Mr W. M. Hughes), who now sits in lonely isolation in the Government corner, knows well the truth of my statements, for when he led the Government in this House he expressed views to those that I am now setting before honourable members. He stated, as we have stated, that the Commonwealth Arbitration Act was both complex and technical, that it contained too many irritating provisions, which caused delays in the settlement of What did the right honourable man do when he was faced with a serious position in the ooal iudustry ? He realized not only that it was a key industry, and that any stoppage of work in t.he coal mines would have a paralyzing effect on industry but also that the conditions under which the miners were employed were such that they required special treatment. therefore created a special tribunal to deal with mining disputes. I admit that that tribunal has certain inherent and because of that fact the Labour party thought it advisable to oppose the Industrial Ppaoe Act when it was introduced; but the conciliatory spirit it displayed averted a serious strike, with Ur. Coleman. disastrous consequences. The right honpersuasion orable gentleman understood the temper of the miners, and their close organization, and realized that it was cheaper in the long run to create machinery suitable to their needs than to say, "" It is a fight to a finish."" It requires no powers of diplomacy, no spirit of sweet reasonableness, no qualities that one would expect froan the leader of a governing party, to say, as the right honourable gentleman now leading this Government has said, "" It is a fight to a finish."" If one is regardless of 1 Government the consequences of one's utterances, it is easy to speak in that strain. Honourable members should learn the lesson taught by the great strike of 1890, when the whole trade of this country was paralyzed, and banking institutions closed their doors, and they should take such steps as are designed to prevent a further upheaval of that description. I appeal to the Government not to ignore ihe lessons of history, but bo make every effort possible to achieve a settlement in this important key industry and to prevent the paralyzing effects of a strike. Unless' the Gofor vernment does this, the result will be disastrous to the economic fabric of the Commonwealth, and owing to the obstinacy, stupidity, and short-sightedness of the Government, thousands of men will similar be thrown out of work. The Government is carrying a tremendous responsibility in this matter, and I agree with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) that the Government should "" pull off their dogs of war "" and approach this problem in the right disputes. spirit. If we want to remove the causes gentleof strikes, let us get right to the kernel of the matter-amen d the arbitration laws, and remove the existing hindrances to co-operation. Shakespeare makes one of his characters say, "" Let's k ill all the lawyers."" The lawyers have been generally, responsible for many of the troubles. I say that with due apologies to the honourable member for Batman, He whom I except from the indictment. I repeat, however, that one of the main causes of trouble has been the presence defects, of lawyers, with all their technical points. I do not desire to go into the merits or demerits of the present industrial trouble affecting Australia, but I say that it is possible to bring about a satisfactory all its settlement. For that reason, strenuous efforts should be everything possible done, to bring about that result. The Government lays itself open to the grave charge of being in collusion - with the private shipowners in causing this industrial trouble. seamen have definitely declared, through , their mediators from the Melbourne Trades H all and other industrial bodies, that they are prepared to accept a conference, and to abide by the results.of . aproperly constituted conciliatory t r i bunal. An attempt should be made to arrive at a basis of agreement, so as to prevent a disastrous and paralyzing industrial war. I am not here to apologize for or to criticize, condemn, or uphold the action of any one union, as that does not affect the issue under discussion, but I .am here to declare that it is the function of the Government to keep the wheels of industry going, by allaying the causes of unrest, and preventing everything which is calculated to create a disturbance, arouse resentment, or provoke a spirit that will disturb the economic security of the Commonwealth. A government which is guided by the principles of conciliation will find favour in the sight of the people. this Government thinks that it will hypnotize the people of Australia by speaking of the pernicious doctrines of certain sections of the community it exhibits a lamentable lack of judgment. In five of the states of the Commonwealth Labour Governments are in office, and in the remaining state-Victoria the Labour party is morally in power. It is only prevented fromtaking its r i g h t f u l place by alliance between the heterogeneous elements that oppose it in that state. The people of Australia look to the Commonwealth Government, even though it be now on its deathbed, to do something to avert economic disaster. "" sion, I appeal to the Government to withdraw tliese deportation clauses from the bill, because they are in conflict with the spirit of British liberty, out of harmony with the idea of Imperial unity, and likely to lead to a storm of protest from the people. The Government should adopt an attitude of sweet reasonableness in regard to this matter.",35
104,Mr MARRS,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"Wentworth) [5.30] It is not my intention to fil l many pages of Hansard on this occasion. I never do so, because I remember well the advice made, and which was tendered to me by the late Honourable Jack Want, and Charlie Pilcher, K . C , when 1 was admitted to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. On that occasion they advised me that if The I had anything to say, to get up and say it in few words, with the best language, and the best manner possible, and then sit down. I have always endeavoured to follow that advice, and today will be no exception. I desire to place before the House some impressions I gained during my recent world tour. One is led to ask concerning this bill-Is it necessary; is there any use for it? I have no hesitation in saying that at no time in the history of Australia was legislation of this description more necessary or urgent than at the present time. A f t e r I returned to Australia. I proceeded to Hobart with my family last Christmas, and found myself the victim of a serious hold-up of the shipping services between"" Tasmania and the mainland. I regret to have to admit that I was forced to the conclusion that the Government which I supported played a weak hand in regard to maintaining the communication between the mainland and Tasmania. I was in Tasmania with If over 1,000 people stranded like myself, and went through the whble experience, even to going on board the Hobso-n's Bay when she arrived off the Tamar Heads, and seeing the appalling conditions which existed on that vessel. A different spirit now moves the Government, as is evident by its introduction of this bill. At last the people of Australia have their answer to the question which they have asked me everywhere I have gone, "" When is an unholy Bruce going to make'a start ?"" The riglit honourable gentleman made a start when he introduced this bill. This measure might well be entitled. "" Save Australia Bill "" or ""Protect"" the Unionists Bill . "" If there is one body of men which will In conclu- benefit by this legislation, it is that section comprising the unionists of Australia. Hundreds of men in the Seamen's Union, and also in the transport unions of the Commonwealth, are waiting for the Government, or some one else, to take action to protect then' in doing an honest day's work The first portion of the b i ll deals with persons coming to Australia. In this connection a great. deal has been said regarding the Italians. During anextensive tour of the United States I found that the whole of the transport workers on the railways, east, west, north, and south, were Italians. Even in Canada the great majority of the employees on the railways and in the factories are Italians. The explanation is that the Italian is a very hard worker. Do not think that I am advocating the filling of Australia with Italians, but the time has come for us r,o decide how we shall populate our empty spaces. The right honourable' member for No r t h Sydney (Mr W. M . Hughes) said recently that in regard to migration we are approaching the cross roads. He is wrong. ""We are at the cross roads. We have seen how Japan raised the m i gration question in connection with the Protocol of the League of Nations, aud the problem df international trade when dealt with by the League must directly involve the consideration of the rights of the Japanese to occupy certain parts of Australia. We cannot evade the fact that we have no moral right to keep practically empty nearly 3,000,000 square miles of territory while other countries are overcrowded. Japan, with a population of 63,000,000, has hundreds of people to the square mile, the annual birth-rate is The policy for Australia to adopt is the introduction of migrants from the Motherland, but we should not bring them out in great numbers u n t i l the unemployed already here are absorbed. If the finances permit, the Government should at once allocate at least £1,000,000 per annum for the construction of great arterial roads in the various states, thus finding work in the country for the unemployed, opening up rural areas, and giving to the man on the land greater comfort and some of the amenities of civilization. How can we ask any man to settle in the hack-blocks where he may have no neighbour within 50 or 100 miles? Let the people in the country have concrete roads and cheap motor cars, and community settlements will develop, with schools of arts, jazz halls, picture shows, and billiard rooms. Thus the settlers outback will get some of the recreations and pleasures that are enjoyed by the pople in the cities. The first essential is to open up the country by good roads, and when the unemployed have been absorbed, other people from the Motherland can be introduced. There is no need for me to discuss further the earlier clauses Mr Maries. i of the bill, which have been already ably debated, especially by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham). 1 desire to address myself more particularly to the well-worn theme of communism. No doubt, other honourable members have experienced, as I have, when endeavouring in halls or on street corners to warn the people of the dangers of communism, , manifestations of impatience on the part of the audience, and cries of "" Come off it . Give us something fresh."" Very few people in Australia realise the seriousness of this menace. One must go to the other side of the world to learn what is happening. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), after his return from Geneva, made a speech at Newcastle with which I thoroughly agree. No doubt, while he was abroad people whispered in his ear warnings against this new political peril. About Christmas time Mr Lang, who is now Premier of New South Wales, made a strong and able speech against communism, and when I read it in the press in Hobart I wrote to him a letter of congratulation, and and offered to go on the same platform with 770,000. him and others who desire to eradicate this deadly canker. Communism affects more closely honourable members opposite than it does honourable members on this side of the House, and there are few members of the Opposition who would not like to help us to enact legislation which would r i d Australia of the direct emissaries of Moscow. If honourable members opposite had met some of the people I have met, and heard what I have heard from men who have studied this problem in Russia and Germany for the last 30 years, they would not laugh. The year 1920 marked the commencement of what I ' might term the great offensive of communism. In that year Zinovieff presided at what was called the PanAsiatic Soviet Congress at Baku. Nearly 2,000 delegates attended, and passed m a series of resolutions which were the foundation of much of the unrest of which we read today. As a result of that congress Egypt, and India, and other parts of Asia, were flooded with pamphlets printed .in many languages, and containing directions for the establishment of the Soviet for m of government in those countries. In June of last year the "" T h i r d Internationale"" met at Moscow, and was attended by Mr "" Jock "" Garden as the representative of Australia. It is interesting to note that the machinations originated at that congress ultimately brought about the political downfall of a very fine man, Mr Ramsay MACDonald, and his Ministry. The conference decided, amongst other things, to establish a communist organization throughout Europe, and to encourage intensive propaganda in the British dominions.",38
105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT, Can the honourable member connect his remarks with the bill?,40
106,Mr MARRS,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"Yes , Mr Deputy Speaker. Some clauses of the bill relate to the deportation of certain undesirables, and I am indicating some undesirables who are finding their way into Australia, and the principles they are advocating. At the time of that, congress I was about to go from Berlin to Moscow, bitt I was advised that it would not be wise to undertake the journey. However, cer' tain leading men were introduced to me - I cannot disclose their names-and at one meeting with them. I was told of the principal features of the famous Zinovieff letter, which some weeks later was used during the general election in Great Britain, and led to the defeat of the Labour Ministry. I was also informed that the Communist party was very active in Australia, I asked whether the emissaries were foreigners with long black hair and beards, and I sought to discover their method of operation. I was told that the Soviet agents are discontented Britishers who desire to establish a new order of society, and who undergo an intensive course in the tenets of communism. When they were qualified, they are sent to Australia on passenger ships, with passports, forged if necessary- I saw some such-and upon arrival they join industrial unions. They :1Q not immediately proceed to foment trouble, but wait until some grievance, real or imaginary, arises, ancl then they sedulously aggravate the sore. Their method may be likened to the pricking of a pimple with a rusty nail. The information given to me is that men in close touch with the Soviet Government of .Russia are at Walsh Island, Cockatoo Island Dock, and in the Seamen's Union and the transport unions. Messrs. Walsh and Garden, I am told, are also in direct touch with Moscow. And those state-' nients are corroborated by what has been taking place in Australia during recent months. While I was abroad I heard more of the inner history of the tram strike and - police trouble in Melbourne than I could learn here. There was also a big strike in Western Australia, and when the State Arbitration Court ordered the men back to work they merely doubled their pickets, and continued to defy the court. There was the shipping hold-up at Christmas, and since then the industry has been subjected to the repeated pinpricks of job control. More recently there have been the disputes leading up to the deregistration of the Seamen's Union and the present shipping trouble, and I shall be very interested to hear the result of the inquiry into the origin of the fire on the Canberra. Mr Garden, after his interview with the Prime Minister last week said, in effect, that if the lights of the cities and towns were extinguished the responsibility would lie with the Prime Minister and not with the seamen. What did he mean? Are the workers employed in connection with the lighting systems ready to throw the cities into darkness at the behest of Mr Garden and Mr Walsh ? A general survey of the industrial situation makes one realise that we are faced with a serious problem. Shipping is the main artery of commerce, and without that channel for the transport of our goods the community will be helpless. I sincerely hope, therefore, that the seamen will, not listen . to the counsels of Messrs. Walsh and Garden, and that all parties will combine to avert what is undoubtedly a very grave menace. What is happening in Australia is occurring in other parts of the world, and this universal ferment synchronizes almost to the moment with the programme issued from Moscow. We have wat.ched the course of recent events in India, and have seen how the intensive percolation of the doctrines of communism through the population of Egypt culminated in the murder of the Sirdar. The communist rising in Italy, the date of which was foretold to me almost to a moment, was stamped out only by the prompt and firm action of 'Mussolini and the fascisti. There was the Zinovieff. plot in Great Britain. The present upheaval in China is admitted to have been engineered by communists. We read of. many disturbances in Germany, at the instigation of these people, which led to the shooting of many men. There have been, quite recently, outrages at-Sofia and Belgrade, including the explosion of bombs in a cathedral during Divine service. That crime caused the death of many people and the wounding of many more. Tha troubles in Australia dovetail with the disturbances abroad. I have many friends amongst the men working on the waterfront, and, as a result of conversations I have had with them, I am convinced that the bulk of the workers desire to be allowed to follow their avocations in peace. But how can they do so when they are threatened with victimization and black-listing? Dnder the present system of control they are obliged to abide by the decision of the unions, which are led by a few extremists. The only way out of this difficulty is the adoption by the unions of the secret ballot, so. that the men engaged in industries may express their will without intimidation. But continuous peace, prosperity, and happiness will never prevail amongst the workers until they are paid, not only a basic wage, but also a share of the profits made by the undertakings in connection. with which they are engaged. In ' other words, we must have cooperative effort. Again I congratulate the Prime Minister and his Government on bringing down this bill, which, from what one can gather in conversation outside this Blouse, is applauded by 90 per ceut. or more of the people of this country, who regard it as a means of doing the only thing possible at a time of stress and strain.",40
107,Mr MANNING,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"Macquarie) [5.53]. - - I am pleased to be here to support bill. All honourable members must realise that the state of affairs existing in this country cannot be allowed to continue. Industrially we are handicapped by conditions of which we have every reason to be proud. With our eyes open we have set up a standard of living higher than that in any other part of the world, and we have fixed by law a basic wage that provides the lowest-paid workman with the necessaries of life and a margin for luxuries. But this basic wage is being taken from the workers by indirect means. Honourable members opposite have stated that the bill is aimed at trade unionism. I say unhesitatingly that if I thought so I would not support it. Every thinking man must admit that the trade union movement has benefited the people of the Empire. Honor able members opposite arrogate to themselves the right to speak for the workers of this country, but honourable members on this side have more genuine sympathy than they with the man who earns his bread by the labour of his hands. Those who represented the good old-fashioned labour spelt it 1-a-b-o-u-r , but honourable members opposite, who claim to represent it now, spell it Ir-a-b-o-r , with a capital "" L , "" and with the "" u "" left out of it. I describe them as parasites, which is the word they apply to honourable members on this side. We should protect the workers of this country against those who consider themselves the aristocrats of the Labour movement. I have been more closely in touch with the workers of this country than have most of the honourable members opposite, and no man has more genuine sympathy, with them than I . Our high standard of living places us at a disadvantage when we have to compete commercially with other parts of the world, where similar conditions do not exist. We must therefore protect our workers from any direct or indirect attempt to deprive them of part of the benefit they enjoy. The men who are leading the industrial trouble in Australia today live and fatten on strikes. They have nothing to gain from the prosperity and contentedness of the community, which every one should seek to promote. When the day arrives when all are happy they will lose their jobs. Many of those who are disturbing the industrial peace of this this country should not have been allowed to come here. They have abused the privileges conferred upon them by citizenship of this country. By organizing strikes, and thus reducing the time that the members of trade unions can work, they are reducing the standard of living in this country. If a unionist is on strike for 25 per cent, of his time, his standard of living is obviously reduced. We have heard the bolshevik maxim - that ""an empty stomach makes a weakened brain,"" and it would appear that :these men are acting upon it. I shall not deal with the legal aspect of the bill, for the honourable * member for Kooyong (Mr. Latham) did that last night. He pointed out che absurdity of imagining that this bill, although it confers great powers on the Government, will be administered in a way that will be unjust r<; the trade unioii movement. Honourable members opposite have said that it is a two-edged sword, which, when they get into office, may be used in a different way from that now intended. But we must assume that every government will administer the laws of this country with ordinary sanity. I have no hesitation in saying that neither the members of this Government, nor those of a Labour government, if one should be returned at the next or a subsequent election-that , I admit, is an unlikely supposition-woul d administer the act in anything but a sound, common-sense way.",41
108,Mr MAHONS,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,We should at leastdeport a few of the honourable members opposit-e.,42
109,Mr MANNING,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"The honourable member might wish to do so, but I am sure that when he is supporting a government - h e can never hope to do more than that - h e will find that it will restrain his ardour, and that the act will be administered sanely. The honourable member for Kooyong pointed out that the existing law is capable of being, but had not been, - administered unjustly. It has been contended that we should not encourage immigration while there is unemployment in this country. The speeches of honourable members opposite cannot camouflage their belief that no immigration should be allowed. It is unfortunate that we should have so much unemployment in Australia, but it is equally unfortunate that in many places in the country development is blocked because cf the impossibility of securing labour. honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook), in moving the adoption of the Addressin-Reply, said that in the shires with which he was connected employment in *road making could be found for 500 men. T have a farm in northern Riverina, where we cannot find men to do the developmental work that is necessary to increase the productiveness of the locality. It is not a matter of rates of wages. I could employ ten additional men on my farm for the next three months, and pay them well, but I cannot get tliem. I have lost a considerable amount on - oven my small block, because I have not been able, in the last eighteen months, to get a couple of men to construct 2 miles of fencing. The attitude adopted by the honourable member for Indi (Mr. Cook) is quite sound. This problem should receive the serious consideration of the Government. It is remarkable that while, on the one hand, there is much unemployment in the cities of Australia, on the other hand, we cannot get men to go into the country to do the work that ought to be done. While men are receiving unemployment doles in the cities, producers in the country are crying out for workers. Practically half the money granted by the Commonwealth Government for road work in Now South Wales in the last financial year was unexpended for the reason that many of the shires were unable to get men to work on the roads. Such a condition of affairsindicates that something is wrong somewhere. I trust that the Government will maintain its intention to keep*out of this country aU undesirable aliens who attempt to enter it. I hope this bill will pass, and that it will be administered firmly. Foreign agitators who enter Australia for the express purpose of stirring up strife should be sent back whence they come, and we should take every care that our own Australian people are protected. Only those who are prepared to develop our country according to our wishes should be permitted to come here, to help us to work out our destiny.",42
110,Mr MAKIN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"Hindmarsh) [6.7],- I deprecate strongly the making of speeches which bear any semblance of irresponsibility or desperation. For that reason I regret the manner in which the Government has introduced this bill. As to The the subject of immigration generally, I am confident that, if the mind of our people could be ascertained, it would be found that they are * completely opposed to a continuation of the. policy which has permitted an indiscriminate influx of aliens into Australia during tlw last two years. Our people disapprove of and resent the failure of the Government to prevent from entering Australia many foreigners who are quite unsuited, because of their former environment and general outlook on life, ever to become worthy citizens of it. These people, in my opinion, will never he able to help us to develop Australia in the highest and best way. It is a peculiar circumstance that while southern Europeans seem to come here without any trouble at all, in many instances, our own kindred from the United K in g dom find that they must special permits to immigrate here. Some honourable members have been requested by their constituents to make representations to the authorities to secure special permits for their friends in Great B r it a in . Why should southern European aliens be treated better than our own kinsfolk? I desire honourable members to understand that I do not blame these people for their inability to adapt themselves to our Australian conditions and standards of living. They are unable to do so because of the totally different conditions under which they have lived in their own country. illustrate that they are unable to conform, to our standards of livin g I refer honourable members to the circumstances in which some of these peojJe are living in a town in the district represented by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey). A number of Greeks there are working three shifts, and the beds they occupy never get cold. As soon as one man leaves his bed, it is occupied by another of his fellows, and it is practically always in use. How can we expect such people to adjust themselves to our standards of living? The Government has been very properly requested to take steps to prevent their entry into the country. It could have done so had it courageously administered the legislation already on the statute-books. When the Prime Minister has been requested to use these powers, he has invariably said that the situation was very delicate, that interference would be likely to cause international complications, or that we must be very careful not to offend the susceptibilities of these people. In other words, he has not mastered the situation, but has permitted the Governments of other countries to dictate to him . The honourable member for (Mr Latham) pointed out last that since 1901 the dictation test was practically the only one that persons had to undergo to decide whether or not they were suitable immigrants. If that is so, I should like to know under authority the Prime Minister, when he Mr Makin. was abroad in 1923, entered into agreements with the governments of certain European countries for the adoption of the quota system of immigration? It is extremely regrettable that he took this obtain action without consulting Parliament, which certainly should have had an opportunity to express its mind on the matter. That the various governments with which he negotiated realized that he had the power to act as he did was shown by their readiness to negotiate with him. They knew that the International Court of Justice has determined that this is a matter of domestic concern. The Prime Minister has been remiss in his duty in that he has not restricted the influx of these aliens who are totally out of touch with, and unable to appreciate, our standards of living. The Labour party desires to imTo prove Australia's economic conditions. Honourable members opposite have indulged in a considerable amount of cheap talk about our attitude towards immigrat i o n ; but, notwithstanding their remarks, we are interested in populating our vast spaces and increasing the security of our people. In order that there, shall be no misunderstanding as to where we stand, I direct the attention of honourable members to the policy that was adopted by the Australian conference of the Labour party held in Melbourne on 27th October, 1924. In the report of its proceedings, under the heading of "" I m m i g r at i o n , "" the following appears: (1) We believe that the present immigration policy of the capitalistic governments is directed to flooding the Australian labour market, reducing Australian working-class standards, and the providing of cheap labour to sweating employers; we are emphatic that public money should not be expended for these purposes. (2) We declare that, Australia is capublc, under good government, of supporting in happiness a"" mucb larger population; hut to protect our fellow workers from being deluded by false statements into leaving home and kindred merely to become tools of sweaters. We insist that land, housing accommodation, and employment be provided for overseas immigrants before they are invited to come to Kooyong Australia. evening Conditions(o) That existing land monopoly should be broken up and provision made for Australian land-seekers. (6) Work should be made available for what Australian unemployed or unemployed allowance provided. (c) Adequate housing accommodation. (d) Land should be ready and employment available, under Australian conditions, for oversea settlers or workers invited to come to Australia. (e) Effective medical examination of intending migrants to Australia.",42
111,Mr MAHONY,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,A very fine policy.,44
112,Mr MAKIN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"It is a very fine policy. It would promote and maintain the welfare of the people, and ensure to the Commonwealth the admission of immigrants who could comply with the high physical standard we have in Australia and would bo fitted to join us in the future development of this couutry. This is a policy that will stand the scrutiny of the keenest critic and meet the approval of every true Australian. The class of immigration we favour does not suit our friends opposite. They desire that immigrants shall be brought here in such numbers ihat they may break down the industrial and economic conditions of the Commonwealth. Many of the people who have arrived in Australia within recent months, through their ignorance of Australian conditions, and their inability to speak English, have afforded an opportunity to unscrupulous individuals in Australia to exploit them by inducing them to accept conditions of labour and rates of wages below the standards which have been established by arbitration courts, wages boards, and other constitutional authorities set up to control such matters in Australia. If there is in this country anybody endeavouring to destroy the constitutionally-appointed tribunals in the Commonwealth' to remedy industrial wrongs, it is the present Government. The present immigration policy is lowering our standard of racial purity and altering the conditions of our community life. We have already beeu reminded in this debate that in some of the .northern districts of t.he Commonwealth certain alien immigrants are set tling in national groups. In some of these the motto has been adopted that "" no Australian need apply "" for ordinary employment or to engage in business. It is a very great mistake to permit anything of this kind. If there is one thing which more than another has added to the difficulties of. the United Slates of America, it is the growth of separate communities of nationals. We should leant the lesson afforded by the experience of the United States of America in this connection before it is too late. If the Government is sincere in its jirofessed intention to stem the stream of migrants coming to this country from certain parts of Europe it can have no objection to the amendment submitted, by the Leader of the Opposition. We know that is not the purpose of this bill. Its first six clauses are intended to create a smoke screen to camouflage the more drastic and far-reaching provisions of the bill contained in clauses 7 and 8. As the debate has progressed we have noted that honourable members on the Government side have devoted themselves almost entirely to clauses 7 and 8. They realise that with these clauses they may be able to create an impression throughout the Commonwealth that serious and dangerous conditions exist which call for action by a strong administration, and for powers which the Government at the present time does not possess. The Government is endeavouring t.o create a psychology in the Commonwealth as a result of which, through the minds of the people being concentrated upon another matter, its sins of omission and commissiou may be forgotten, and it may look for a further tenure of office in which to continue, as it has done in the past, to give special privileges and advantages to the people who are today exploiting the citizens of Australia.",44
113,Unknown,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,44
114,Mr MAKIN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"-Las t evening the honourable memher for Wakefield (Mr . Foster) stated that this legislation had been introduced in desperation by the Government because of the iiidustrial situation. I do not dispute the honourable member's view, but rather agree with him, that the Government acted in desperation. The Governor General's Speech received severe public condemnation, because it was poverty-stricken, and devoid of any definite proposal for the benefit of the community. The Government, anxious to draw public attention to itself, in view of the proximity of the general elections, saw in this bill a most excellent opportunity for an appealto t.he people. The newspapers of this country, through their leading articles, have i m different pressed upon the public mind the great necessity for the introduction of this measure. The stage has been set, and the scenery painted by the press. Further to justify the introduction of this bill, we find that Government instrumentalities have been purposely used to bring about a disturbance in the industrial life of this country. But the Government is not quite so clever as it thinks it is. The general public are too well informed ever to be deluded by the treacherous action of this Government. Honourable members behind the Government profess to sympathize with the workers of this country, yet every political act of theirs has been carried out with the idea of keeping the great working mass in subjection, under conditions that certainly are not in accord'with the present industrial life of Australia. Even the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) says that he is a genuine friend of the worker. A review of the industrial history of the honourable member would be a very interesting document, and would show that the part played by him as an employer of labour in this country is no better than it ought to be.",44
115,Mr MANNING,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,The honourable member makes that statement well knowing it to be untrue.,45
116,Mr SPEAKER,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"The honourable member for Macquarie must not use such words in Parliament, and I ask him to withdraw them immediately.",45
117,Mr MANNING,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"At your bidding, Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the assertion that I made, but I ask that the honourable member for Hindmarsh be asked to withdraw his statement, which was absolutely incorrect, and one he had no right to make. He has no knowledge of my conduct as an employer, though ray life is an open book, and he has no right to cast aspersions upon my ""character.",45
118,Mr SPEAKER,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"If the honourable member for Hindmarsh has aspersed the character of the honourable member, of course he must withdraw his aspersion, but should the honourable member for Macquarie think that because a statement is incorrect it must be withdrawn when objection is taken to it, I would inform him that, from my long experience, I know that very many such statements are not withdrawn, and the Speaker cannot compel their withdrawal as unparliamentary. I leave the matter with the honourable member for Hindmarsh. -- Mr MAKIN - I withdraw the statement that the honourable member's attitude in industrial matters has been no better than it ought to be.""",45
119,Mr MANNING,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"I take exception to the way in which the honourable member for Hindmarsh has withdrawn his statement. The remarks he was making were a reflection on me. He said that my character as an employer was no better than it ought to be, and he cast a direct aspersion on my character as an employer of labour in this country. "" I object to thoseremarks, and I ask that they be withdrawn.",45
120,Mr SPEAKER,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"If the honourable member for Macquarie will inform rae what were the words of the honourable member for Hindmarsh that he considers unparliamentary, I shall, if. I share his opinion, enforce the rule of Parliament; but I am not able to pick from the statement of the honourable member for Hindmarsh the phrases to which the honourable member objects. He must assist me.",45
121,Mr MANNING,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"I can refer you, sir, only to what the honourable member for Hindmarsh said. He stated that my career as an employer would not stand looking into, and was no better than it should be. In doing that he deliberately suggested that I had acted as an employer in an arbitrary way, and had dealt unfairly with my employees. No other inference is possible. I have been au employer of labour ever since I was eighteen years of age. I have never had the slightest dispute with an employee, and have always been on the best of terms with them. The statement made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh was derogatory to my character, and I ask that it be withdrawn without reservation.",45
122,Mr SPEAKER,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"The situation is not by any means clear. An honourable member cannot compel the withdrawal of remarks that are offensive or objectionable to himself unless, in addition, they are unparliamentary.",45
123,Mr MANNING,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,And untrue.,45
124,Mr SPEAKER,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"The Chair does not concern itself with the truth of the statements made in Parliament, hut with the observance of forms and the limitation of words and phrases. I , myself have been called ""cruel,"" a ""sweater,"" and other uncomplimentary epithets have beeu applied to me; but, although the statements were objectionable to me and untrue, I was unable to have them withdrawn at the direction of the Chair. If the honourable memher can show that an expression has been used that was unparliamentary, either by implication or by inference, I shall insist on its withdrawal. So far I have not heard such an expression.",45
125,Mr MANNING,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,I shall not press the matter any further.,46
126,Mr MAZIN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"It has been stated by honourable members supporting the Government that the Labour party lives ou the strife that is fostered in the affairs of our community. But the position is reversed. In an effort to secure another three years of power, the Government is fomenting industrial strife throughout the length and breadth of this country. Tliere has been a systematic endeavour on the part of commercial and mining magnates to promote industrial strife by enforcing working conditions and wages contrary to those set up by the Arbitration Court. The Primo Minister informed me the other day that every adult employee in the Commonwealth Service, temporary or permanent, was receiving at least the Commonwealth basic wage, and child endowment, if entitled to it. That statement is absolutely incorrect. During the past six months a certain Commonwealth agency has been used for chartering labour from abroad to evade paying Australian wages and conditions. In this way the Government is endeavouring to foster and foment industrial strife and disputes. This bill is the most reactionary measure that has ever been introduced into this Parliament. The Government is reviving the methods that were in vogue in the early days of the nineteenth century, when, because of some slight misdemeanours, certain persons interested in trade union matters were transported. The following passage from A History of thp, English Agricultural Labourer, by Dr W. Hasbach, will be interesting to honourable members:At the beginning of the thirties, the trade union movement in the towns manifested a strength very disquieting to the propertied clasHea-. Touched by it, six overworked Dorsetshire labourers, paid at starvation wages, trusting to the freedom of organization granted in 1824, attempted to form a union in 1832. But they were arrested, and the judge, Baron Williams-n o representative oftineold aristocratic self-government, but a "" learned "" judge-con demned them, on the 17th March, 1834, to.transportation for seven years, on the ground that illegal oaths had been administered. Only under the strong and continued pressure of all kinds of agitation, parliamentary and extra-parliamentary, was a pardon obtained for the condemned men three years later. Those men were transported because they had endeavoured to secure the protection of trade unionism against the injustice of long hours of labour and low wages. They were not infamous criminals. The history of Australia shows that men of that type and their descendants became very prominent citizens of this country. One of the founders of the city of Melbourne was the son of an ex-deportee. A man who subsequently became a member of the Legislative Council in New South Wales was a deportee, and one of the greatest Australian patriots, a man who was in the forefront of the advocacy of self-government for what were then Crown colonie?, was the son of a deportee. Probably this Government, through the instrumentality of legislation based upon political and industrial prejudices, will possibly deprive this country of the services of men-hones t trade union supporters and trusted officials-wh o are worthy citizens today, and whose descendants would become honoured members of our community. Honourable members on this side will not agree to legislation which will make such injustices possible. Are the people who will be liable to deportation under this measure to be tried by a jury of their peers, in accordance with the first principles of British justice? No; they are to be haled before a board.",46
127,Mr BRENNAN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,Onl y some of them ,46
128,Mr MAKIN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"I thank the honourable member for the reminder that some persons to whom the bill will apply may not even have a trial by a board. But even in the most favourable circumstances the only tribunal to determine whether or not a man shall be transported will be a board comprising one member of the judiciary and two other gentlemen who, in all probability, will owe their appointments to the fact that their political ideas agree with those of the Government. Doubtless political patronage will extend to those appointments, as it has done to all other appointment made by the present Government. I fear that before a person comes before that tribunal he will have beeu judged and found guilty; and from the decision of the board there will be no appeal. In certain other circumstances set forth in the bill a man may be deported, merely on the order of a Minister, for some action he has taken in connection with trade unionism, or for some endeavour to improve the conditions of the men and women employed in industry. I personally have experienced cruel and tyrannical victimization by men belonging to the class represented by honourable members opposite, and because of that my family have suffered grave anxiety. There sire leaders, of the trade union movement who arc doing their utmost to maintain industrial peace, but they are thwarted by a continual agitation on the part of the employing class for the purpose of creating We know that the capitalists employ emissaries for the purpose of bringing about a condition of affairs to which no self-respecting worker can submit. I regret that such a reactionary measure as this bill should have heen introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament. boast of our liberties, but honourable members opposite are prepared to scatter to the four winds of heaven the great charter upon which our freedom is founded. What do they care for Magna Charta or the declaration of rights? They have no desire to live in amity with their fellows or to preserve peace in industry. suits better the class they represent to foment industrial disturbances, and in that endeavour they are ably abetted by the editors of some of the great metropolitan newspapers. There is in the city of Melbourne a man who is supposed to express the opinion of the community-I refer to the editor of the Age - who, if he were true to the country of his origin, would be writing his leading articles with a fountain pen made in Germany, but who is unscrupulously misusing his Australian citizenship and his journalistic power in order to instil into the minds of the people of Victoria the idea that the leaders of the workers are responsible for the industrial strife in this country. If the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W. M. Hughes) has not forgotten his experiences as an industrial leader he will admit that the captains of industry, by every means in Mr Makin. their power, endeavour to defeat the efforts of the workers to improve their position. Remember that the seamen did not seek de-registration; the action which deprived them of the protection of the conciliation and arbitration law was taken by the employers. I hope that honourable members will bear in mind that on more than one occasion the captains of industry have expressed their opposition to arbitration as a means of avoiding strife. A very instructive address was delivered recently by Sir Henry Braddon, who argued in favour of the abolition of the Arbitration Court and the substitution of other means of determining wages and working conditions. If there is one party that stands by industrial arbitration, and desires to promote peace and the true progress of trouble. the country, it is that which sits in opposition in this House today. We have at all times endeavoured to improve hy constitutional means the working conditions and standards of living of our people, and we have repudiated extreme action in any form. But the party now We in power is endeavouring by this bill to do something contrary to the principles of the Constitution. The Government wishes to deprive Australian citizens of the right of trial by a jury of their peers. Even a man charged under the criminal code with having committed a capital offence is It tried by a jury, and whether found innocent or guilty he remains a citizen of the Commonwealth. A man with an honourable career, who has done his best to make the world better than he found it, may, under the tyrannical measure introduced by the Prime Minister, be deported if he speaks against the captains of industry, or desires an improvement in the conditions of his fellow men. It is nothing to the Government that for many years he has been a valued citizen, or that, because of the uncertainty regarding the future, his family is distressed. Mr W. M. HUGHES (North Sydney) [8.31] - This bill deals with two widely different matters-the immigration of persons other than those of British origin, and the deportation of undesirables. I shall deal with it under those two heads. As far as the bill provides for the restriction of the immigration of persons other than those of British origin, I heartily support it, although I should have thought that no new power was necessary for that purpose. I imagined that we already had sufficient power to deal with such persons. But if the Government asks for more power, I am prepared to grant it. It is not quite clear what the Government proposes to do with this power when it is granted, or what is the basis upon which the quotas are to rest. Soon after the Prime Minister assumed office, I asked whether the principles guiding the department controlling migration remained the same as during my term of office, and I understood the right honourable gentleman to reply that they did. I might indicate here what I conceive to be the proper basis for determining the quotas-upo n which I acted myself-of immigrants other than those of British origin. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman), in the course of an excellent speech, reminded us of the troubles that confront the United States of America today as a result of having opened wide its doors to the whole world. The people of other countries have entered the United States of America in millions; I understood him to say that its immigrants numbered something like 25,000,000. The United States of America have heen called the melting pot of the nations; it is a melting pot that does not melt. Any one who has made a first-hand acquaintance with the conditions of the United States of America knows that there are millions of people there to whom the English language is. unknown. Their ideals and their outlook on life, their historical background, are entirely alien from ours. Whatever was the position in that country some years ago, today there is barely 50 per cent, of the population of the Anglo-Saxon race in the ITnited States of America, whereas in Australia very nearly 98 per cent, of the population is of British origin. *We are laying the foundations of this young country, and we have before us, in the example afforded by the United States of America the effects of promiscuous intercourse with the world. We see that the people of the United States of .America now recognize this, and they have slammed their door, but too late. They have now within their portals vast bodies of men who will not, and cannot, assimilate their ideals of civilization. This bill aims at preventing the influx of such people into this country. We should so fix our quotas that the present percentage of foreigners to the total population of Australia shall remain until the end of time the extreme limit of foreign immigration into this country. Whatever the condition of society in this country, the number of people of other than British nationality allowed to' live here should not exceed their present ratio to the total population. Their numbers would, of course, increase as the population as a whole increased. I am satisfied that, if a plebiscite of the people of this country were taken on the subject, a large majority would vote for this. I hope that the Government will give effect to this principle, and when the clause dealing with this matter comes before us in Committee we shall be able to discuss ib in detail. I shall pass from this part of the bill with one further observation: I have noted that a learned man in our community has spoken of race as if it were nothing. I say that race is the one thing that stands out in the world today. It is the determining factor in the progress of man. We are where we are, and what we are, by virtue of race. The United States of America but had developed to almost its present condition before these millions from the south of Europe entered the country. They. are ^living as guests in a mansion which they did nothing to build. I am in favour of maintaining the quality and characteristics of the Australian people. Without saying anything disrespectful or critical of other nations, I say that we have our own ideals, and by these we must be guided. The ideals of other nations may be superior to ours, but they are not ours. There is no way by which their ideals can marry with ours, without both becoming degenerate. But I am at a loss to understand the attitude of the Opposition towards this part of the measure. I listened very carefully to the splendid speech of the honourable member for Reid, but still cannot understand why the Opposition opposes a measure which restricts immigration. This bill restricts immigration. It is a net with a closer mesh than we now have, and permits fewer people to enter this country.",46
129,Mr CHARLTON,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"We oppose it because it does not restrict. Mr W . M . HUGHES - I believe in selected immigration, and would keep out undesirable Britishers as I would keep out undesirables of any other nation. We attempt u> do that .now. I am at a loss t.o understand tor what reason it is said that the measure affects employment or unemployment. If it keeps out undesirables, no matter whence they come, to that extent it should conform to the policy of honourable members opposite. I leave that phase of the question, and come to the other part of the bill , that which provides for the deportation of undesirables. Its discussion has engendered a good deal of heat. I am not inclined to be censorious of the temper displayed, for considerations of first importance are involved. Liberty and the rights of free speech are involved. In these days the great outstanding question is some form or other pf class war, and it seems to me that the bill is in danger of being regarded'as a partisan measure. Let us consider what it proposes to do. An amendment of the present law is proposed to give to the Minister power to deport two classes of persons: Oneany person declared by the Minister to be, in his opinion, from information received from the Government of the United Kingdom or of any other part of the British Dominions, or from any foreign government, through official or diplomatic channels, undesirable as an inhabitant of, or visitor to, the Commonwealth. The Minister may bar the entrance of such a person to Australia, and may deport him if he has gained admission. To that I say nothing, although I should have thought that the powers contained in the principal act were ample. I turn now to the second section which has been the cause of much controversy in this chamber, the amendment of section 8A by the addition of a proposed new section AA If at any time the Governor General is of opinion that there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth, lie may make a proclamation to that effect, which proclamation shall be and remain in force for the purposes of this section until it is revoked by the Governor General. When the proclamation is in force the Minister may summon .the person to appear before a board to show cause why he should not be deported from the Commonwealth, and, if the board so recommends, he may be forthwith deported. If honourable members refer to . the principal act they will see that the power to deport has been on our statute-book for a considerable time. This power of deportation can be operated if a .personadvocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any state . . . or of all forms of law, or advocates the abolition of organized government . . . or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member of, or affiliated with, any organization which teaches any of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph. Under that section, which has been the law of the land for years past, Walsh', Johannsen, Garden or any man of their type could be deported before midnight to-night, because they are all members of an organization of the kind described; their objective is the overthrow of organized government; all are avowed communists. Honourable members who have familiarized themselves with the communist creed will know that its adherents fall within the provision of section 8A of l;he principal act. There is provision in that section under which the Minister may deport persons who are guilty of any of those offences. Everybody knows that these men hold these opinions. But they have not been deported. They have been allowed to preach them in season and out - of season, and the law, so far as I know- I was out of the country for six months,- and goodness knows what happened then-ha s never been employed against them, no one has been deported under it . These offences are political in their nature. As to whether it was right or wrong to put the law on the statute-book, I say nothing. That it is there, and that it can be used now, no one can deny. In the circumstances. I wish to ask the right honourable gentleman what necessity is there for further legislation ? I turn now to the new offence created by the bill. An y one concerned in promoting or starting a serious industrial disturbance can be deported. This is a new penalty for a very old offence. I have had a very long experience of industrial matters. Some honourable members have been good enough to remind me of this during the debate. Industrial disputes are inevitable in society where progress is the order of the day. ' Y o u cannot have progress without friction. Unionism from my earliest recollection of it-and my recollection goes back a long while-ha s had fight very hard for everything it has obtained. I shall tell honourable members a little of what it has gained during the last quarter of a century or so, and how it has gained it . When unionism was broken by the great strike in 1890, it naturally turned to the political arena, and eventually secured a majority representation in Parliament. From that day until a little while ago it never looked back. I cannot recall an hour when it had not to fight for every step of ground gained, and whether the cause was good or bad, action was always condemned by those entrenched in the citadel of privilege during the time that it buil t up its organization. fore, I am not to be frightened by a declaration that men going to strike. I must know what a strike is about before expressing an opinion whether it is good or bad. A strike in itself is neither good nor bad; everything depends on its object. honourable member in thih chamber would vote to bring back the condition of things existing in this country 30 years ago. The great majority of us at least recognize that this is a very much better country to live, in now than it was then; better not only for some, but better for all. But I remember quite distinctly being told that every step we took in the direction of reform was a step towards destruction. Let us look at the position as it is today. That part the measure that, deals with deportation, of undesirables is clearly aimed at those who are fomenting a shipping strike. As to the facts, there can be no dispute - These men are deliberately resorting to direct action, and defying the law in a country which hn.« created legal machinery for settling industrial disputes. Twenty-five or 30 years a£0 the seamen of this country were industrially in a very bad way, thousrh not in quite such a bad wav as the seamen of other countries. Littl e by little they have won the best conditions in the world. If they look back through the years that have gone, and reiflect how they gained their present conditions, they will see how little they obtained by striking, and how much by law. If they do this, they will surely hesitate about turning their backs on methods so f r u it f u l of good to them and to the whole to community and taking up the desperate and hazardous weapon of the strike. Who is responsible for the present attitude of the Seamen's Union? It is said that the leaders are not responsible. The honourable member for Reid (Mr . Coleman) said that it was an insult to the intelligence of unionism to say that the leaders were leading the men, for, as a matter of fact, they were being pushed ou by the great mass of the unionists. That is not so. I have had considerable .experience with the whole of the waterside group, and I have seen the way in which things happen. I have been at a union meeting with 50 men, in which 26 would be a majority, 'and that meeting has There- declared for a strike. The next morning 5,000 men who belonged to the branch, are coming to work, saw the uotice to that effect posted up. That is an extreme case, but many times I have seen the business of a union carried on by 200 out of 5,000 members. Every man who is i u a union No knows these to be facts. The extremist is always bold, and always on deck; the moderate rarely attends the meetings, and is alwaystimid - The extremists shout down the moderates, and there is, too, the mechanism, created in E art by the leaders and in part y those who, as it were, enjoy the choicest tit-bits that fall from the union table. This is so strong that it is almost impossible to break it . I have not the slightest doubt that, if a man ran counter to the wishes of this clique of the Seaof men's Union, he would look in vain for the a good ship. I speak, of course, as one who has no .personal knowledge of the present dispute. I have not had the privilege of hearing at first hand what, the other unions think about the matter; 'but I know, as every man of any information knows, that of all times in the year this is the worse for a maritime strike. As a practical man, if I were going to fight, I would have more sense than to fight now. If any one were to go round the waterfront of Australia, he would not get ten men in 100 to vote for Walsh and his methods. I do not know how many would vote for him in the Seamen's U n i o n ; I speak only of the waterside workers. But they are slipping down this declivity, and, before they or anybody knows where they are, they will be at the bottom of th© pit, and nothing on earth will pull them out, because the discipline of the union must be maintained. not advocate that men should go against their unions, but I urge that the unions as a whole should act, and by their authority endeavour to stop this lamentable struggle. The bill proposes to deport the leaders. Will that bring peace? It may; but only for a little while. The right honourable man has been accused, of endeavouring to fan this yet flame into a fierce conflagration. believe for a moment that such an infamous idea ever entered Whether his is the right or wrong way to go about thiugs, I have nodoubt that he believes it is necessary for the Government to take action. I 'am not going to discuss the question at length, but I do not believe that the threat of deportation will prevent this trouble, or that the removal of either Mr Walsh or Mr. Johannsen, or both of these men, would prevent it. I do not know what is their authority in the union, but the union is entitled to its own opinion. If its members allow themselves to be led away by either Mr Walsh or Mr Johannsen, the responsibility, but when the Government says, "" If this notice that has been given, to take effect on the 14th, does take effect, we shall deport Mr Walsh and Mr Johansen,"" I ask myself-whether it is likely to be effective. I do not believe that it is. As things are how, the great mass of unionists is not behind men. But' if the Government martyrs of them, it will rouse the passions of the rank and file by an act which will appear to them to be partisan', and in the interests of the other side. By such action the Government will convert men who are now seeking an opportunity vent this trouble into champions of those in whom they do not now Let us look at the principle which underlies this measure. It is proposed to deport certain persons who take action in connection with industrial disputes. think it was the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) who said that the time might come when certain employers would foment a dispute. not know whether I ought to tell tales out of school, but I must say that the greatest conflagration that I was ever in was, I firmly believe, fomented by employers in collusion with the leaders of Mr Hughes. the union. Their action nearly wrecked this Commonwealth. If a Labour GoI do vernment were in power at a time when a dispute occurred, and it considered that employers were fomenting that dispute, should it deport the employers? Is most ostracism to become a weapon to be used first by one party and then by the other ? In my opinion, it is preferable to follow the well-beaten path that has served in gentle- the past. Let these men be tried by a in effect, court of law, and, if found guilty, imlittle prisoned. That surely would act as a I do not deterrent, and be at least as effective as deportation. This bill is aimed at persons his head. not born in Australia. I do not know upon what ground it is assumed that native-born Australians will not engage in acts of the kind contemplated by this measure. They are certainly encouraged to do so, insofar as it is not proposed to deport them. While I admit freely that imported men do promote unrest more frequently than Australian-born leaders, still, if we believe it to be right to deport other than Australian-born men who are disobeying the laws of the country by engaging in labour disputes, we should be consistent, and deport-o r at least punish-Australian s for theirs is the same reason. It should make no difference where a man was born, whether in Melbourne, in San Francisco, or anywhere else. The position, after all, is that a union which, by legalized methods, has won more for its members than men engaged in the same industry in other parts of the. world have won by either these legalized or other methods. Certain men makes in that union are now deliberately setting about the business of wrecking unionism and the country. And they do this, not to improve wages and conditions, but to destroy society. Under the section of the principal act to which I have already reto pre- ferred there is power to deportbelieve. a person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth, or of any state, or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law, or who advocates the abolition I of organized government, or who advocates the assassination of public ofh'ciuls, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization which teaches any of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph. I do It is impossible to shut one's eyes to the opinions that these men hold. Their real object is not to make labour satisfied, but to make it dissatisfied. What I cannot understand is that honourable members on the other side of the House do not boldly declare that they wash their hands of them. There can be no doubt of their opinions. They want to pull down society. They are our White Australia policy. Walsh has boasted that he is an internationalist, and he has opened the door of his union to all sorts and conditions of men. Men of all the colours in the rainbow are to be found there. The only sort of man for whom he has no use is a white man who dares to stand up for his own opinions. He and men like him do not believe in democracy, or rule by the majority. They do not believe in law; they do not respect agreements. It has been that some other form of arbitration might be provided for them. honourable member for Eeid (Mr Coleman) said this afternoon that during the war I granted to the coal miners another for m of arbitration tribunal. so. But the coal miners did not deliberately invite the Arbitration Court to strike them off the register. they wanted another tribunal they asked for it . They wanted one for m of tribunal in preference to another. Theirs was a perfectly proper request, and they got another tribunal. But the seamerhave deliberately drawn the sword, and finding themselves to be in a bad position, they are now moving heaven and earth to get some safe ground on which to stand. Supposing that they get another arbitration tribunal. Mr Walsh has stated over and over again that nothing will bind him, and that he will bow to the authority of no body except those who hold the same opinions as himself. What can you do with a man like that? Mr Holloway asked the other day for another for m of arbitration, but he know? very well that Mr Walsh has repeatedly said-and that Mr Garden holds similar views-that they will not be bound t y any agreement made with those whom they call capitalists. Of what use is it , then, to endeavour to deal with these men ? They have drawn the sword, and they have said that they will take society by the throatand make it yield to their every demand. That is a very wrong attitude, and I would certainly do everything in my power to put such men where they could do no harm. But for all that, I am not in favour of deporting then, because they hold these opinions on in dustrial matters. If we should say to the people of this country, ""Unless you hold the same opinions as we do you against must leave,"" what would it amount to? Mr Deportation will provide no final settlement of the trouble.. We are more likely to secure a peaceful settlement of this dispute by other means. I take it for granted that this measure is before us now because of the seamen's dispute. If that is not so then there is certainly no urgency for it . I suggest that we are more likely to reach a peacef u l settlement of the dispute by abstaining from pushing this provision for deportation. I propose to vote for the second suggested reading of the bill, but when it reaches the committee stage I shall endeavour to The amend the deportation clause. I should prefer to see it deleted altogether, but if it is not deleted I hope that it will be amended, so that any action that That is may be taken in accordance with its provisions shall be taken in our law courts in the usual way. I suggest to the When Prime Minister that he would be taking a wiser course by not pressing the provisions for deportation; but whether that provision is retained or not it would ho far better - that any disputes that arise under it between sections of society or between individuals should be settled by courts of law. I think everybody in this community would wish that men like Mr . Walsh should be tried like others in a court of law, where they would have the opportunity to be heard in their defence, leaving it for the court to say whether they are innocent or guilty. That would appeal to the good sense of the community. I shall endeavour to amend the bill in that direction.",49
130,Mr ANSTEY,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"Bourke) [9.12] - The right honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat stated that this bill was designed to deal with the conduct of Mr . Thomas Walsh, but that the law as it stood provides ample power for that purpose. I venture to say that whatever object the Government had in introducing the bill, it goes far beyond Mr Walsh or anybody else. It would catch Mr Walsh and many others in its net. There is a gentleman in this city who was mentioned by the right honourable member for North Sydney- a man respected, even by his opponents-wh o only a few months ago was called upon to act for certain stevedores. Had this measure been in operation at that time he could have beeu dealt with under its provisions. The right honourable member for North Sydney also called attention to the' great advances that the working men of this country had made in the last 25 or 30 years. He said that they had advanced from misery and degradation to comparative comfort. complained, however, that the affairs of the organizations which had been the means of achieving this result were conducted by comparatively few men. part that is true, and in part it is not true. There is no organization of men of which it could not be said that its affairs are conducted by a few of its most earnest and sincere members. That is true of trade unions, friendly societies, and practically every other organization of a similar nature. Their affairs are conducted by the relatively few men in them who are energetic, earnest, and sincere. the wise leadership of a comparative few the seamen of Australia have won better conditions than any other seamen in the world enjoy, it is to the credit of the few who accomplished the great task. had experience of trade unionism from the waterside workers. I have been an officer of the seamen's organizations for many years. I have had, ih some instances, experiences quite' the reverse of those described by the previous I have seen in this city hundreds of members of the Seamen's Union against a few officers who desired to put an end to a strike which they had no hope of carrying to a successful issue. I refer to the great maritime strike of 1893, which was caused by the ship-owners endeavouring to force the seamen to accept a reduction of £1 per month in their rate of pay. At that time the officers of the union did everything they could to conclude the strike. It is well known, also, that at the time the shearers in North Queensland and at Broken Hill were involved in an industrial trouble which their offioers were doing their best to terminate. But the men resisted all their efforts. this very city, within the last few years, I fought for many months against a body of men who were determined to go out on strike in opposition to the wishes of their officers. Eventually the strike occurred. Honourable members will see, that while it is sometimes true that relatively few men conduct the affairs of trade unions, it is also sometimes that the men take the very opposite course Ur. Anstey. - to that which their ofacers advise. This bill deals with many things. It ' deals with the importation of immigrants, and I do not intend to discuss the methods proposed to deal with them. It deals also with the deportation of certain people, and that is what I do propose He to deal with. First of all, permit me to say that I have no objection to deportation on principle. I have protested against it in the past because 1 mis-' In understood the principle. I h doing so, I thought I was acting upon a principle which should be supported. But deportation may be a very much lighter for m of punishment than incarceration in a j a i l . I have a certain sentimental regard for deportation. It has for me a certain charm and attraction because of its fine possibilities. It is the embodiment of the If by lex talionis, the law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for . a tooth. What may happen to me today may be another's fate tomorrow. On this ground I have no great objection to the proposal. One I have reason why I should like to sec it given apart effect is that honourable members opposite may register their endorsement of a policy of this character. We shall then have no doubt as to where they stand, and we shall know that they will be responsible speaker. for furnishing a precedent for action which is capable of a glorious expansion. fighting I propose to deal as briefly as possible with the limitations of the application ,of this measure, and the methods of its application. This policy of deportation is said to embrace three periods in our. history, and we are now about to enter upon a fourth. I take the first period as that prior to the war. For 100 years before the war there was practically no restriction upon the admission of people to this country, and no provision for deportation. For a period of 100 years men of various races came freely to this country. The right honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat has In said that they were mainly of the Anglo Saxon race. But they were men of all creeds and all shades of social opinion. They included nihilists, anarchists, chartists, socialists, and redrepublicans like the gentleman who now occupies the therefore, position of Australian High Commissioner in England. These men were regarded as rebels in their own country, trua and they were rebels here. There were amongst tliem men who were distinguished by the punishments inflicted upon them by the Government of the country from which they came. were in many cases recognized as rebels here also, but we know that many of them set their impress upon the legislation of this country. The shades of some of them flit through the chamber in which 'we are now assembled. Men who suffered imprisonment here or abroad have occupied the place which you, Mr Speaker, occupy today. They have sat in the Speaker's chair; they have sat where the Prime Minister sits this evening. who were advocates of violence, and who spoke of broken heads and flaming houses, afterwards occupied the Treasury bench here, and were responsible for conducting the country's affairs. Looking back over that period of 100 years when there was no restriction upon freedom of opinion or speech, men dared to do these things despite the social and political despotism - of the time, because they were judged not by the opinions they held or what they said, but by their conduct. It was only when by his conduct a man came within the range of the law as it existed at the time that the authorities stepped in and assailed him. The second period was that of the war. During the war we set up a process of deportation. 1 fought the deportation system then even against a Labour Goverument. The emergencies of the state were put forward as a justification for it at that time. I said then that the only class against whom the law would be directed were the workers. I say now that they are the only people to whom the bill now under consideration will be applied by the present Government. Government may be trusted to shelter and protect its own. Class distinctions and limitations are well defined, and, as I have before pointed out in this chamber, the members of the Government are the special protectors of the monetary interests they represent. They fight the battles of those interests in this chamber. Under the original provision for deportation, I have seen men prosecuted hy the Government of the day. It had a man arrested, brought before a court, tried by a judge, and after the judge had acquitted him and set him free, having pronounced him hot. guilty, it had him seized ih the dead of night and transported to an island in the South Seas. The third period is that since 1920. There They was then for the first time an important departure made. Whatever distinction there may have been drawn between men there had never been any distinction drawn between one Australian citizen and another born within the Empire and under the flag. Englishmen, Irishmen, Scotchmen, and Welshmen coming here were regarded as of our own race, subject to our laws, and having the right to participate equally with those who were Men born here in all the. benefits derivable from our social and political conditions. In 1920, for the first time, on the ground of public necessity, there was a distinction made, and for three years men who came to this country from the Old Land were aliens within our borders. We drew a distinction between one class of British citizens and another. The. right honourable member for North Sydney has said that 98 per cent, of our people are of the Anglo-Saxon race. An Australian is a British subject. If an Australian walked into the city of London tomorrow, few as might be the social privileges he would enjoy, and in significant as would be his political power, he would be on an equal footing before the law with people born in Great Britain. If he walked into Canada he would have similar rights. We are only a section of the British Empire, and yet we have drawn a distinction which makes an Englishman an alien within our borders. That was done in 1920. I now come to the particular proposition at present before the House, that within our boundaries an Englishman shall be an alien all the days of his l if e , The and shall not stand on an equal footing with those who' are born in this country. It would be interesting to consider what is an Australian. Only the other day in China the Chinese drove a man named Butterfield, who was born in China, into the Shanghai River. They chased into that river in the person of Butterfield three generations of despotism. It is important to remember that a man born in India is not necessarily an Indian. He may be an Anglo-Indian, just as Butterfield was an Anglo-Chow. There are men born in this country who are not necessarily Australians. They are AustralianBritish. I direct attention to men who came into this country like the right honourable member for North Sydney and others, who, for half a century, have striven to prevent the working men of this country from falling into the condition of the workers in the land from which they came. They have tried to build up an Australia which should not be shapen after the image of the land out of which they were driven, but should be based upon the noblest ideals of the human race. Through their children they have sunk their roots deep into the soil from which they have drawn their substance. They have lived laborious lives to improve the conditions of the working men of this country. The conditions which the workers now enjoy in Australia are largely due to the efforts of men who came from other lands. The right honourable gentleman who now occupies the position of Prime Minister of the Commonwealth talks of social ideals; but let any one look back to the conditions which existed in the past. Let any one read the reports of British royal commissions of the black slave trade, and the sweated conditions of the great cities of England. The Prime Minister and those behind him assert that they would not think of having such conditions here. See how they have been humanized by the very force of Labour. I direct the attention of honourable members to what is occurring in Fiji, where the .Colonial Sugar Refining Company, from which the party opposite draws monetary assistance to fight its political battles against Labour, is operating at the present time. Even the local native labour was not cheap enough for that company. It brought to Fiji, Hindoos who have to work for twelve hours a day, little children who are working under the conditions to which children were subjected in Great Britain 100 years ago, and women who have to work half a day to secure for themselves half a pound of rice. The Rev. ""Weir Burton has told us that they save money only by self-cultivated starvation. The party opposite fights us in the political field with funds drawn from the blood-soaked fields of Fiji. I compare Britishers who came from the Old Land 40 or 50 years ago with men of an entirely different type. There are in this country men who were Mr Anstey. born upon its soil, it is true, whose manner, talk, and even dress is not Australian, but ""Englieh, you know."" Their regiments are ""English, you know."" Their firms are registered in England. Their banking operations are conducted through English-controlled banks, because they are ""English, you know."" This is the country in which they were bora, and from which they' draw their wealth, but their true home is 12,000 miles away. I know how people were treated by this type of man 30 or 40 years ago. Glorious are the dead, and noble are those who have passed away! In this state and in this city I have known men to be prosecuted under an act 100 years old. When a conviction could not be secured against a man in one court he was dragged before another. I have known men to be drawn from Broken Hill to other parts of New South Wales, and from this city into the squatter-ridden sections around Deniliquin in order that convictions might be secured. against them. Judge Darley described men 30 years ago as organized criminals. Who does not remember an incident of the early nineties during the shearers' strike, - when a man was declared to be before a court, although he was 100 miles away ? The judge instructed the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty, which it did, and the man was given two years' imprisonment. I come now to the bill under discussion. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that, occupying the Government benches, is an Englishman by name Herbert Edward Pratten. Does any one think that he can be deported under this bill ? No. This honourable member may abuse his office, may misconduct himself, may cause ruin and disorder to thousands bf people in this country, but he cannot be deported. He may commit robbery and manslaughter; his victim may be found at his feet; he may confess his crime, and yet he cannot be deported. Before Herbert Edward Pratten, the Englishman, the capitalist, a Cabinet Minister, can be deported a warrant must be issued for his arrest, and an indictment filed against him. He must be taken to court and given the opportunity of engaging the best counsel to defend him. He must be heard in open court. The jury must bring in a verdict of guilty and the judge pass sentence before the Government may lay hands upon him and deport him. controlled ' by I do not deny his right to be defended, nor his right to an opinion, although opinion is not mine. I would not deny him justice. If he had a co-partner i renown I would not deny to both a revernment ward ; if he had a co-partner in crime obey the arbitration award ? a pemalty sliould he imposed upon both. There should be no discrimination. rates, But what is granted to Herbert Edward Pratten as a right should be given every workman in this country. possible to deport Herbert Edward ten ? Yes, it io. But before he can be deported, without open trial, without dictment, without sentence passed on by a judge, he must first become a workrates. man. Secondly, he must belong - to trade organization. There is then no necessity for him to commit manslaughter, rape, or any other odious offence. All that ir. is necessary for him to do is express an opinion or give a direction, and although he may be the voice of thousands of men, yet because he gives a direction which, in the opinion of the Government, interferes with and obstructs trade and commerce, he becomes liable to deportation without a judge, without a Powers intervened. jury, and without a verdict of guilty. "" Nonsense,"" says the Government. "" is a board."" Is it an open court? warrant issued, or an indictment filed? Is there a jury aud a judge? No. The board is the creature of the Government. To-day the Government has resurrected the star chamber after centuries of death work ? and odium. The Government says, "" B u the board will be composed of honest upright men."" What fools the members the Government would be to seize a man in the night and bring him before the board if they were not sure of the verdict that would be brought in - Is that self-evident? If the Government were not. sure of the decision board offenders would be sent to the open court. Honourable members porting the Government say, "" The vernment in power is fair ; it has against any man in particular, and the measures it passes affect employers and employees equally."" I shall give honorcountry able members one instance to the contrary. ning the Line have been months. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M . .Hughes) referred to the Seamen's Union, and I shall refer to the maritime workers. The employed on the Boorara, a vessel the Commonwealth Government Line, - were entitled to his award rates. The Commonwealth Government Line refused to pay the money due n to them. What aro men to do-if this Gowill uot compel its servants to Some say, "" Go on strike."" "" No,"" say the mode"" don't go on strike; if the award is violated, go to the court and sue the to Commonwealth Government Line for the Is it money due to y o u . "" One of the cooks Pratwent to the court and won his case. Naturally, one would expect that the Comi n - monwealth Government Line, anxious to him secure peace, would then pay the award It said to Jones,""You have won your a case, but you others, Brown, Thompson, and Staiith, will not get a penny until you individually fight your cases in the courts of the country."" The Commonwealth Government Line would not pay award to rates to the cooks on the Jervis Bay. The seamen thereupon refused to board the vessel, and warrants were issued for their arrest. The news was published from one end of this country to the other, but not one word of the true facts was mentioned. A general strike was imminent, so Judge A f t e r hearing the facts, he said that it was a scandalous there thing that the Commonwealth GovernIs a ment Line would not pay award rates unless each individual case was fought out in the court. The Line still refused to pay the rate. In the name of God, what, other alternative had the men but to stop Now this Government tells us t that the board will be composed of fairand minded and decent men, who will actof fairly between employer and employee. The Government, under this bill, would prosecute and deport the person who advised the cooks to refuse to work until not their legal payments and requirements were met. But what is done to those in of the control of the Commonwealth GovernmentLine who simply refuse to obey the law ? supDoes the Government dismiss them ? No. GoWho are the men for the most part nothing dominating tha Commonwealth Government Line? Tom Wa.lsh, in spite of all his errors, has been more years in this than some of the mongrels runThey deliberately man the Commonwealth vessels with oversea men, and in many cases incite them to provoke disturbances. As cooks a matter of fact, any man connected with the maritime calling knows full well who is behind the Government's action. cape is behind it. Tn 1918 Larkin told me in Australia House, London, Inchcape had endeavoured to buy him out. It is as fair to say that the bulk of the officers administering the Commonwealth Government Line are agents or Lord Inchcape and the Peninsula Oriental Company as that our men are instruments of foreign governments. .organizations are trying to do a decent thing. The Moreton Bay is another case in point. Lord Inchcape's boats bring out passengers who are mentally some of them being lunatics. sons are ordered back. Is it not fair that they should return in the ships brought them here? But what is done? Lunatic asylums are made of the vessels of the Commonwealth Government and these lunatics are taken back to the country whence they came. In the Moreton Bay, one of the stewards had to wait upon the lunatics. They attacked him and he would not stay. Another steward was sent, and he would not stay. These men were dismissed, and there was a strike. The newspapers did not print one word of the true facts in this case, or in the case3 of t.he Boorara and the Jervis Bay. The only news that appears in the press is the inspired paragraphs furnished by the Government. Noel Lyons, who is now in New Zealand and likely to be deported, was described in one of the newspapers here as an American Industrial of the World. This man is a. native, of Melbourne, and. his mother lives almost within a stone's throw of this House. She signed a declaration that her son was a native-born Australian, but the newspapers gave not one word of publicity to it. The Government, by introducing legislation for deportation, will do no good in any shape or form, - but rather provoke greater evils. The bill is not justified. Any man who disobeys the laws of a country should pay the penalty. sent, a person can be deported after the adoption of legal methods. If a person is tried and found guilty and ordered by a judge to be deported, well and good. The honourable member for (Mr M arks) this. afternoon : repetition of the familiar, talk about communism. How has public opinion developed in this country if not by the advocacy of what people regarded at one time as extreme views? Chartism was formerly condemned as extreme, Mr Anstey. Inch- my friend, the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr W . M . that Hughes) was once considered a most extreme and dangerous character. Indeed, if these proposed deportation laws had been in existence he would never have been permitted to enter the Commonand wealth, or, if he had entered it , would have been pushed out very quickly. I Our have a lively recollection of a journal called The New Order, which he edited, and in the pages of which could be found as good a description of the evils of the deficient, existing order of society as could be found These per- anywhere. One could see the revolutionaries marching on the fron t page, with that the light of the New Jerusalem in the distance. The instrumentalities by which we were to accomplish the reform of the Line, world were set out, and all the monsters of exploitation were to disappear. But time has brought changes and transformations, and in the progress of a great world-wide movement individuals and sects, and the doctrines they preach, are dropped by the wayside. Public opinion cannot be stifled, and it is far better to allow it to be expressed openly. Ministers tell us that communism is a menace, allpowerful and all-pervading. It is like the hidden hand. Do not honourable members recollect the scare in regard to the anarchists, who were said to be working to undermine all eystems of government? At one time all Labour members were ""Worker denounced as atheists and anarchists, who had no belief in a God, and desired to destroy the state. There has not been a day in the history of the Labour movement when hobgoblins have not been raised in order to frighten the people in regard to it . But bogy after bogy has disappeared. Birds are at first terrified by a scarecrow, but, having seen the sun rise upon it and* set upon it day after day, they in time get enough confidence to sit upon it themselves. Similarly, the comAt pre- munity has lost its fear of every one of the bogies that have been raised by opponents of the Labour movement. I was in England in 1918.. At that time Britain's back was to the wall, the GerWentworth mans seemed to be about, to gain, posgave us a session of the Channel ports, and the Allied generals appeared to be incapable of handling the problem. So I hurried to Europe to see what could be done. There were at that time in England a number of men who were known as "" The Hidden and Hand."" Most of them were criminals; some had been in jail, and others were imprisoned later. The Vigilante, a notorious ' paper, exploited "" The Hidden Hand "" in order to create an international scare. There was another paper, called John Bull, edited by Horatio Bottonilev. Associated with him was one Grant Morton, who had worked a dope swindle, as a result of which he raked off £1,000,000. He had with him a German Jew called Rosenfeldt, who rechristened himself Robson. Whilst those papers had nothing to say against Princess Lowenstein, who was in correspondence with the enemy, or Sir Jonas Jones, who also was in correspondence with the enemy, and was fined £2,000, or that well-know.r. German f a m i l y which changed its name from Wettin to Windsor, they had a great deal to say about a poor English woman who had married a German. Her husband having been interned, she resumed her maiden name in order to earn a living. She was exposed by "" the hidden hand."" 'and was sentenced to three months' imprisonment. At that time Bottomley was flying about the country in a motor car and flapping the flag. That was preliminary to the perpetration of the swindle for which he was put into gaol.",52
131,Mr SPEAKER,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,Rt. Hon. W . A. W at t ) . - I presume the honourable member in tends to show a connection between this story and the bill.,58
132,Mr ANSTEY,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"I am dealing with the hidden band. Mr Tom Walsh is said to be a communist, and for that reason the House is advised to pass this atrocious piece of legislation. I am endeavcAiring to show that the policy adopted by the Governmenb is similar to the odious methods employed by Bottomley and those identified with him, for, unquestionably, the British Government of the day was paying money to him in order that he might carry on his stunts. Bottomley would arrive in a car at the place of meeting and say, "" Ladies and gentlemen, 1 told you last week to watch the Prime Minister. This week I direct your attention to one of the great mysteries of the war- ' the hidden hand.' I can explain it to you. I know its machinations, and I advise you to read the last page of the next issue of John Bull. You may ask me what I would do if I were Prime Minister. I tell you to watch Winston Churchill and Lloyd George, and if you believe that the hidden hand is a real menace to the safety of Great Britain, as I believe it to be, look in the next issue of John B u l l for a startling article. That is all I can' tell you today."" The Government is adopting much the same attitude as Bottomley did. i±ll it does is to talk of men who are relatively few in number and count for nothing in the community or its industrial organizations. It is in the measure to which they can influence the opinions of other men that justify the ideas which they advance? No country suffers merely because some individual in the community thinks he sees the light of day. I can conceive of nothing more absurd than what the Government is doing. It claims to be a Government with great Imperial sympathies. It says it loves the Old Country and desires to save it from a great menace. It claims to represent the business ability, culture, and talent of the Commonwealth. Yet it confesses its incapacity to solve the problems that confront it . If any man in the community abuses the laws and the privileges of citizenship he should be dealt with by the community in the in terests of the country at large. But this Government willnot itself tackle the problem. It speaks of the dear old Mother Land that shelters us with its arms, and without the strength of which the Australian nation could not endure for a day, and instead of stamping out the firebrands in our mid9t it proposes to cast them into the dear old mother's l a p ! That is the' Government's service to the Mother Land, which has 1,500,000 people unemployed and many actually starving. All that this Government proposes to do to help Great Britain in its distress is to deport firebrands 12,000 miles overseas in order to multiply her difficulties. This bill can achieve no good. It does not attempt to cope with the problem other than by throwing the responsibility upon people on the other side of the world. It will only arouse animosity and ferocity, and assuredly what t.he Government does to others by means of this legislation will in turn be done to Ministers or their supporters. There are plenty of instances in which troubles have been fomented, not by a few obscure men, but by the employing interests. There is undoubted proof of industrial strife having been deliberately caused by t.he coal-nv'ne owners in New South Wales in order that coal should jump in price, and trade become profitable to them. The Government, which is now supreme in this House, declares that this measure must go through. If it does, all I can say is that the evils that will flow from it will be greater than those which it is designed to remedy.",58
133,Mr R GREEN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"Richmond) [9.56] I rise to support the bill, the purpose of which is to deal effectively with aliens who may be regarded as undesirable citizens from the point of view of Australian national sentiment. ""We should be grateful to the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakejey) for the figures which he furnished to the House last evening concerning the situation in Queensland, due to the influx of southern Europeans. He told us that foreign labour is being employed in north Queensland at below award rates. Since there has been a Labour Government in that state for many years, I should like to know why it has not taken steps to put down the very glaring evils mentioned by the honourable member. I doubt, how- ever, if the Labour Government of Queensland has been altogether sincere. As the ex-Premier, Mr Theodore, is himself, so I understand, a native of central Europe- I believe he comes from one of the Balkan States-it is natural to suppose that he would have a certain amount of good feeling for immigrants from that portion of Europe.",59
134,Mr FORDE,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,Mr Theodore is an tralian native.,59
135,Mr R GREEN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"I have no desire do the ex-Premier of Queensland an i justice. I really understood that he was born in central Europe, and was brought to Australia at an early age. The report of the Queensland Royal Commissioner, Mr Ferry, with regard the influx of foreigners into north Queensland discloses an extraordinary state of affairs. We are told that foreigners, themselves unemployed, have been communicating with their compathas riots in It a l y and elsewhere, and have actually been signing nomination of orms guaranteeing them employment. By this means, immigrants from Europe have been able to get their passtected ports vised, and have been admitted to Australia. Evidently there has been an extraordinary laxity in administrahave tion somewhere, and I hope that the Gobefore the House. vernment will tighten up the regulations. I am not in favour of flooding Australia with immigrants from either southern or central Europe. Many years ago, when I travelled two or three times to the United States of America from England, the Cunard Company had a contract with the American Government to supply a certain number of central and southern - European immigrants. Vessels controlled by the company visited various Mediterranean ports picking up emigrants, who were taken to a big camp in Liverpool, and then transported across the Atlantic to the United States of America in larger vessels like the Ivernia and the Saxonia; No attempt whatever was made to cater for the comfort of the immigrants, who could only be regarded as a cargo of human beings. At that time it was believed that these immigrants could be assimilated in the population of the United States, and that they would make decent American citizens*-w e know now with what little success. The Government of the United States of America was forced to take drastic restrictive action, and as the tide of immigration appears to be flowing towards Australia, the Commonwealth Government, recognizing the danger to this country, has introduced this measure with the object of exercising control over immigrants who may prove to be unassimilable. I am surprised that Aushonorable members opposite should oppose the measure. The right honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr W . M . to Hughes), who spoke this afternoon, has n - obviously not given the bill that consideration which its importance demands. He stated that under paragraph gd of section 3 of the principal act there is already authority for the Government to to deport any persons who may advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any state. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) pointed out, however, that this power to deport must be exercised with in three years from the date of arrival. Therefore, if a foreigner gained entry into southern Australia, and remained here undef o r three years, there is no power in the principal act to deport. To get over this difficulty certain provisions been included in the measure now The deportation clauses of the bill have raised the ire of honourable gentlemen opposite. To-night we listened to a dissertation by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey). At times the honourable member was lucid, at other times his remarks were quite irrelevant to the matter at issue, and I am glad that you, sir, intervened with a request that he should confine his observations to the bill - Mr R GREEN We have in our midst people who are enemies of this country. Many of them are self-proclaimed enemies. The Government's duty is to protect the people against individuals of this kind, and it should take whatever action is necessary to curb their activities. Many of them should be deported. Before proceeding to give instances of individuals who come within this category, I desire to say that tliere is a section of the community whose members freely advocate communistic views. The Labour party, after having dilly-dallied with them for a long time, has at last excluded the communists from its ranks. If a political party considers it, expedient to keep these persons out of their ranks, surely the rest of the community should have the right to say whether they should be allowed to remain in the country. If they are not fit to belong to the Labour party, one wonders whether they are fit to remain in the country.",59
136,Mr BRENNAN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,Ver y sound reasoning !,60
137,Mr R GREEN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"Whil e I . do not want to give these particular individuals any more advertisement, than is necessary, it may be of advantage if I relate a few facts concerning them, aud then ask the House whether it stands for conduct of that character. Let me-read a cablegram which appeared in the chief metropolitan"" newspapers of London on Wednesdav, the 29th August. 1923The Hclsingfors correspondent of the Morning Pout states that the Praoda publishes a horrifying account of the trial of a group of bolshevik officials at l'avlograd who wore convicted of a long series of abominable crimes against the population, their charge including murders, trial less executions, and robberies. In one case, Nikitenko, the president of the Soviet executive committee at Shivianka. and three militiamen, abducted a schoolmistress and carried her to Steppe, where they violated lior.",60
138,Mr SPEAKER,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,Order ! I think that the honourable member will find it hard to connect that incident with this bill .,60
139,Mr R GREEN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"I was pointing out that this is the type of individual who will be dealt with under the bill , and whose presence in Australia is undesirable. The cablegram continuedThey then carried her through the village, naked, after having her tarred.",60
140,Mr SPEAKER,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,Order ! I think that the honourable member had better not proceed further with the reading of the extract. - I have read sufficient to show the type of jjers'on that we could well do without.,60
141,Dr MALONEY,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,The law would deal with them in Australia : and the honourable member knows it .,60
142,Mr R GREEN,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"I agree with the honourable member that if those actions were performed in Australia the law would step in . I have here a report written by Mr George Waite, the assistant secretary of the New South Wales United Labourers U n i o nA clean-up at the Trades Hall is overdue, for the malign influence of the Soviet emissaries has prevented hundreds of studious, decent unionists from attending meetings, and the poor attendance behind the banners of the eight hour demonstrations in Sydney, Lithgow, and Bathurst were public protests against Labour being manipulated by misleaders expounding foreign dogmas subversive of Australian democratic sentiment and our social evolution in accord with natural law. The Sydney Labour Council is affiliated with the Bed Trades Union Internationale, and the returned delegates from Moscow congresses openly boast of being in constant secret communication with the rulers of Kussia, who regard England as their traditional foe, thwarting their expansionist designs in Asia and Europe today, as during the Czarist regime of the past. How do the communists stand in regard to industrial troubles? In 1921 they published a secret "" bible,"" some copies of which have reached Australia - From this "" bible "" I shall read one excerpt in relation to industrial troubles in Australia, to show honourable members that if the present trouble o-n the water front extends itmay not be difficult to determine who are its fomenters' In the present circumstances the unemployed represent a.revolutionary factor of gigantic significance. The communists must take upon themselves the leadership of this army. By bringing the pressure of the unemployed to bear upon the trade unions, the communists must seek to effect the rejuvenation of the latter, and, above all, their liberation from their treacherous leaders. By uniting the unemployed with the proletarian vanguards in the struggle for the revolution, the communists' party will restrain ths most rebellious and impatient elements among the unemployed from individual and desperate acts and enable them to actively support . .. . the - struggle of - the proletariat, thus developing beyond the limits of the present conflict, and making the - starting point of the decisive - offensive. In a word, the unemployed must be transformed from u mere reserve army of industry into an active army of revolution. The Leader of the Op-position stated that this bill would apply only to the workers of this couutry. The individuals I have mentioned ai'e workers in the sense that they are d i r t y workers; they are not workers - as we understand th* term i u Australia. orable gentleman stressed ithe point that a man who had resided in Australia for 30 or 40 years, .but was not .born in iMa country,, would, - under the bill, be liable to deportation. I point .out, how€irer , that to deal with those persons who. - after their arrival, remain quiet for a period ©f thi'ee years, and then commence to preach doctrines inimical to the best interests - of Australia, it is neces sary that we go back beyond a period of itliree years. I have tried to ascertain the attitude of members of the Opposition towards the present waterside trouble, and particularly their views of the Seamen's Union, but they have on each ©cession, .evaded the issue. I should like to know whether the Seamen's Union has the supportof the Labour party in its present struggle. If not, wliy do not honourable members opposite say straight out that they stand ior arbitration, amd not for direct action 1 I have not heard a word to that effect from any of them. If the Labour party supports the Seamen's Union, it stands behind a body that has deliberately flouted the Arbitration Court. According to the Melbourne Argus this morning, Mr R. V . Keane, general secretary of the Australian Railways ""Union, statesEailway men are behind the seamen in their claims that rates of wages and conditions Sbould toe inserted in tlieir articles of .engagement, and have every sympathy with the rank and file who, because of deregistration 'by the FedecaJ Court, have now uo tribunal other than that of - direct aetion. The secretaries of other unions lieve it aiecessary that they act unitedly; in fact, I that there is a union Union in Sydney. It is to those who have watched the trend of ©vents, aaid., possibly, have taken some part in tbem, that the - union officials Mr li. Green. every year appear ifco be taking more power into their own hands, and arrogating to themselves the right to speak for their unions, preventing the unionists themselves fro m having a voice in the management of their own affairs. That criticism may be fairly applied to many Labour organizations, and particularly to - the Seamen's Union. The majority of its members are seafaring men who are unable to attend the union meetings regularly. Some of them were shipmates of my own when I was at. sea, and a fine lot The hon- of fellows they are. The longshore section of the union is composed largely of ''' crooks,"" "" hoodlums,"" and '"" spongers,"" and it is a hard matter, I am told, for a genuine sailor to ""become a member of the union, although it is .a comparatively easy matter for a "" crook,''""' who has just been discharged from j a i l , to obtain admittance, so long as he is prepared to support the union. ""When a vessel arrives in port, the genuine seamen are told by the oflicials what they must do, and much as they desire to get r i d of their autocratic -"" bosses,"" they find it very difficult to do it . Intimidation, particularly in Sydney, is rife . A bill such as the present measure will - go a long way in the direction of liberating the seamen from the octopus that has fastened its tentacles upon their union. In A p r i l , 1921, the president of the luiion-a n individual whose only claim - to manhood is that he wears masculine attiue-stated The seamen will not have arbitration. They only accept such compromise as tfrey - are driven to, holding to such agreements as long as they are suitable, and determined to break tliem as soon as' the circumstances of .the moment demand iJrat they should. . . . If the revolutionary exigencies of the occasion should demand it, even the existing constitution of the Seamen's Union would be scrapped. Mr SPEAKER <Rt. Hon. W . A. W at t ) . - I feel justified in saying that the honourable member will not be in order in discussing the practice of trade unions unless his remarks bear on the present bill, and I warn him that it is not wise be- fo steer too wide of its subject-matter. should So long as the honourable memher ean understand establish the relevancy of his remarks, Secretaries' well and good; but, hitherto., I have not noticeable observed it . Mr R. GEEEN - I submit t h a i I have .shown that some of the union offieials advocate direct action in order to foment industrial strife, which l i e bill seeks to minimize as much as possible. Some of my remarks, I contend, bear on - the clause relating to tke preservation of A e peace and good government of the - Commonwealth. Mr Justice Powers, President of the Federal Arbitration Court, has stated in open courtMr Walsh, also declined to submit to the court any application for a variation of the - clause. He went further, and said in open court that the Wyam&ra would not be supplied with a crew until the claims made iby the union were paid. The statement was not made offensively, but 'with an air of authority as if Mr Walsh had toeen appointed as a final - court of appeal to settle claims in Australia, and as ft dictator appointed liy Parliament - authorized to make and enforce the navigation Haws of Australia. Until lately the people of ArasfcraHa assumed that the federal Government had been entrusted with that power. I have heard a© - condemnation from honourable members opposite concerning this person. A r e they a f r a i d to declare where they stand? Are they frightened of the votes of some of the communists, OT arc they pandering to them? Mr . Deputy President Webb Ibas also made some reinaris' about this union. judges are not a f r a i d to speak'their mind, but honourable members opposite appear to tie frightened to say a word. Mr . Deputy President Webb saidA careful consideration of the facts which have been .submitted to me has forced upon may mind AH inevitable conclusion that this imiBon has entered npon a policy - of defiance - of .the IIJIW, aud tfaalt it is determined uot to depart jfroui it. Walsh's attitude in court fully confirms this. 3?he policy which this union has adopted 'has involved all - classes - of people in serious loss and inconvenience. There is no .doubt m my mind that a great deal of the unemployment and disputes which - exist amongst the workers today is due directly to the dislocation of industry which has been caused Iby the unlawful actions' of this union. Mr Deputy President Webb, therefore, definitely locates iihe responsibility for much of the distress that is prevalent today in Australia. Why is it that honourable members opposite have no word to say in. condemnation of the policy of die Seamen's Union;? I do not think they 'are even brave enough to condemn it by interjection. Mr A . GBEEBT - Was the member a member of the Seamen's Onion when he was at sea? Mr R. GREEM"" - Yes ; I belonged to the Seamen's Federation. Mr A . GREEN - Then why "" scab "" on tliem like this ? Mr R. GREEST - I understand that Walsh is a married man. I would send his female out of the Gommonwealth with him. Mr. YATJ2,6. - Oh , do not say that ! Mr R GREEN"" - The honourable member for Adelaide ought not to object to my remarks, for, in the Sydney Domain, this woman referred to' him, in common w i & other soldiers, as 6s -;a-day mur11 derers.""",60
143,Mr YATES,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"J would say im a cose like that, "" Forgive them, for they know net what' they do."" Mr E GREEN"" - I have here some extracts from speeches made at the conference of the Australian Labour party held inMelbourne in June, 1321. On that occasion Mr Macpherson, a New South Wales delegate, is reported to have inad<e the following remarks: He had come to the eoiiekision that the resolution was not going to be peaceful. The sacrifice of » few individuals - could not he allowed to count. Another gentleman, who, until recently, The was the president of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labour party, and is now Vice-president of the ""Upper House o-f the New South Wales Parliament- I refer to Mr A . C. Willis-gav e utterance to the following sentiments at that same conference: - If you cannot get political power without resorting to violence, it is no use asking the people to vote. Instead, we should be here cbsenssing th« fomation of the Bed Army. : Either you .must organize on the lines indicated ,an<l get complete control in that way, or you must train a big organization on the basis of a deliberate overthrow by foree. Th© honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin),- Who-' was also present on thab occasion, said a few words which I should' like to recall to his mind. He was reported as follows: The parliamentary machine 1ms been used to give sanction to the schemes of the capitalistic system. We - wan* the parliamentary - regime to give sanction to our proposal, and the scheme we have prepared. From those industries nationalized ehall he chosen the general central council, wbicb will really take the place of our Parliament today. First we have tihe statement that the revolution will not be peaceful, and that honourable the sacrifice of a few individuals cannot be allowed to count; then Mr Will is comes along with his proposal for the formation of a "" Red A r m y , "" and Mr . Soullin follows this with his suggestion that our Parliaments shall be superseded. Mr Holland, M.P., a representative of the New Zealand Labour party, also contributed to the discussion. He saidThe programme laid down here is revolutionary and socialistic, and justified by MaTX. . . . Labour is going to pass through the most critical period in the history of the world. The war period will be no circumstance in comparison. In spite of these extraordinary statements the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in this chamber (Mr Anstey) made a speech to-night which contained absolutely nothing at all . Honourable members opposite say in effect, "" We will keep these communists out of our own movement, but if you attempt to deport them we shall resist you in every way."" The communists are "" white-anting "" the Labour movement, but I must confess that until now I have not realized to what an extent they have succeeded in so doing. It is not often that. I quote the. Age newspaper, for, as a rule, I do not agree with its sentiments, but I refer honourable members to its remarks on the speech made on this measure by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton).. It eaid that he had never appeared in such a horrible light in his life, and that, it was a bad day for the Labour party when he spoke on this support the bill in its and I trust that it will be the in strument by which the Government will be able to deal once and for all with Walsh, Johannsen, and men like them. The measure under discussion provides the Australian Seamen's Union with a means of ridding itself of an incubus, of placing its control in proper hands, and of the authorities deporting such men as Walsh and Johannsen. I support the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr O ' KEEFE ) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. DRIED FRUITS DISTRIBUTION. Motion (by Mr BRUOE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",62
144,Mr CHARLTON,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"Hunter ) [10.36] I have received a communication from the manager of the New South Wales Cooperative Wholesale Society Limited , whioh readsWe experience great difficulty in securing recognition from the Australian Dried Fruits Association. We have been referred by them to the Victorian Dried Fruits Board, who in turn argue that they have not taken any action in the direction of appointing distributing agents anywhere. We note in the press that Senator Wilson, Minister for Markets, states that the demand on the board for finance to assist in the export of fruit is very limited. Recognizing that the industry is in a very difficult position, although the outlook was much improved, the Government has already announced its intention not to' press for a repayment of the advances made to growers last year. Parliament will be asked to consent to these advances being repaid, half out of the proceeds of the 1020 crop, and the balance out of the proceeds of the 192,7 crop. Seeing that the Government is assisting in the financing of the growers, we think it only right that any boycotting of consumers' associations should be restrained. We have made repeated applications for consideration to tliese associations, and have been referred to a group of merchants in New South Wales, who turn our application down because we are a co-operative society. This is not the first instance in which such action has been taken, as I brought a similarcomplaint from the New South Wales Co-operative Society Limited before the House last session. Notwithstanding the. fact that we are complaining of difficulty in finding markets for our dried fruits, and that the growers are experiencing considerable hardship, a wholesale co-operative society, which has bill. I a membership of approximately 40,000 entirety, consumers of dried fruits, is unable to obtain supplies. The board appointed by this Parliament to deal with the marketing of dried fruits grown in this country is not acting in the manner we anticipated. I have complained on different occasions concerning the personnel of the board. Mr W . C. Thomas, a flour miller, is the chairman, and the Government representative, and two other members of the board, which consists of seven members, are also connected with commercial pursuits. It is easy to realise that co-operative societies will never receive a fair deal from any board on which there is such a strong representation of commercial, men, who are opposed to co-operative effort. Although we are continually urging the necessity of bringing the producer and consumer closer together, boards are appointed which have not the slightest desire to give effect to the intention of Parliament.",63
145,Mr WATSON,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,Is any reason given?,63
146,Mr CHAELTON,ALIENS REGISTRATION ACT,"No . The society was referred to the Victoria n board, and the Victoria n board referred it to the merchants in Sydney. It will , therefore, be seen tbnt dried f r u it will not be supplied direct, but must go through certain distributing channels. This is a startling condition of affairs, more particularly as (lie industry is being subsidized, and an effort is being made to satisfactorily settle the returned soldiers in fruit-growing areas. The Government should endeavour ro prevent a recurrence of instances such ns 1I have quoted, and also refrain from appointing gentlemen to such boards of control whose interests arc in conflict with those of the growers und the consumers.",63
