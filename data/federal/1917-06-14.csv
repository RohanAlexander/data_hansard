I brought him one witness, and asked  who then represented Indi , and the honorvoted able member for Henty had to say on the subject.

12,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I thank honourable very sincerely for the compliment they have paid me, and the confidence they have reposed in me, in again selecting me as .Chairman and Deputy in k Speaker. I very much regret some things that have been said, but I shall not enter for into any controversy about them. When I took the chair previously I knew I knew only the rules of the House, and called upon all members, no matter on which side they sat or what their political opinions or convictions might be, to assist the Chair. Mistakes have been made, no doubt, and mistakes will be made, but the action to which reference I did has been made was not mine individually. I was only the indicator to the House of certain things, and the House took certain action. So far as I was concerned, the 38 Supply. whole matter ended there, and I decline now to enter into any controversy regarding it . I assure honourable members that when I occupy the position of Chairman of Committees, or if at any time. I am called upon to relieve you, sir, for a short period, I shall endeavour to uphold the dignity of this Chamber, and ask all members to assist me to do so. I shall give every member the fullest privilege that the rules allow; but I shall allow no member to get behindthose rules in order to do something that the House would not permit him to do. That is a perfectly fair stand to take. To those two honourable members who have paid me the compliment of indicating some of my past actions, I wish to say that I shall treat them individually just the same as I will treat every other member of the House. I shall give them all the privileges to which they are entitled. When I have done that I shall have satisfied my own conscience that I have performed my duty and upheld the traditions of Parliament. I hope that in upholding those traditions I shall be assisted by all members, including those two honourable members who do notwish me so well tp-day. yourself, sir, I shall at all times act most loyally, and should you at any time require help or relief, I shall be only too Teady to give it . As you and I have been contestants for the position you hold, I hope we shall set an example to all other members to forget the past, to begin anew, and to show that we collectively are a Parliament that understands its duties. CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS - PRIVATEMEET ING OF MEMBERS - FINANCIAL STATEMENT. Motion (by Sir JOHN EORREST) agreed toThat the House do now resolve itself into Committee to consider the Supply to be granted to His Majesty. In Committee of Supply: Sir JOHNEORREST (Swan-Trea surer) [ 4 . 2 6 ] - I move That there be granted to His MajestyFor the service of the year ending the 30th dav of June, 1917, a sum not exceeding £181. For the service of the year ending the 30th day of June, 1918, a sum not exceeding £750,000. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Supply. It has become the custom in this House, although it is not a custom that If o l lowed before I entered this Parliament, to make an explanation of the Finance Bill at this stage. I do not know that there is any great inconvenience about it , and, therefore, I am following the practice which has been generally followed by Treasurers here. I desire first to congratulate you, Mr Chairman, on occupying the chair again. You \, have had a long experience; we know you very well, and every one will be glad 'to see you .presiding over the Committee once more. The motion is preliminary to the introduction of a Supply Bill for the current year which is nearly ended, and to cover a short period of the next financial year. Exceptional circumstances exist which have never previously occurred. Foi various reasons the Estimates for the current financial year have not yet been laid 1 upon the table. The expenditure for almost' the whole vear has been made on Supply Bills. I am glad to say that the Estimates are ready, and will be placed before honourable members today. It will , however, noti be possible* to de-al with them in detail before the financial year closes. It is therefore necessary to Towards ask Parliament! to pass the Supply Bill now before the House. The total of Supply previously granted"" by Parliament for the ordinary services of the Government for the current financial year is £14,981,159. The total of the Estimates is £14,981,340, leavingonly £ 1 8 1 which has not already beengran.ted in Supply. This position has been brought about SUPPL Y. by considerable reductions having been made in ithe Estimates as originally - framed, and. on which the amounts in cluded in previous Supply Bills have been based. The result has been that under certain subdivisions provision has already been made in excess of the amount how included in the Estimates. Shortly stated, Supply is insufficient, for twelve months on many subdivisions,. and is over-provided on some other subdivisions. To correct the position, a Bill is submitted showing, under each subdivision, the total amount provided in the Estimates for the year. The total of previous Supply Bills is deducted from the* schedule, leaving only £ 1 8 1 which Parliament is asked to grantl to the Treasurer for expenditure during June. Afc the same time, an amendment is made of all the previous Supply Bills, so that the amounts provided in these Bills shall be available for the purposes as set out i r j the second schedule to ithis Bill , which strictly accords with the Estimates. Although the total of the Estimates is to vote £ 1 8 1 today. £14,981,340, it is not expected that whole of this amount will be expended. The departmental omcers estimate that £634,590 w i ll not be expended in 1916and Buildings in the Bills before us. 1917. This information was not received in time to permit a reduction being made in the Estimates, and it has not, therevarious Departments in the past. fore, been possible to make the reduction in the Bill now submitted. Moreover, - does not seem convenient to ask, as Suptunity ply for the twelve months, for an amount tions. which is less than tha* granted for eleven months. noticed that incorporated in tihis B i l an amount of £750,000 under Treasurer's advance for the year 1917-18. not intended to ask Parliament to vote - Supply in detail for .the month of July until the House meets again next month, - when it will be necessary to obtain ply for the payment of Public Service be done. - salaries and other urgent payments during, that month. It is necessary vide some funds to cover .the interregnum between the 1st July and the date - on which the House will meet. our works are being carried out by day labour, and wages will f all due before Parliament has an opportunity next with month of voting Supply. In addition respect. a W a r Pension pay-day falls on the 5th J u l y , and it is necessary to obtain parliamentary approval to covelr these payments. The expenditure will be to absolute necessities. Mr TUDOR, (Yarra) [4.32] - It would be preferable, I think , for me to make the few remarks I intend to make on the Bil l itself, but it really does not matter whether I speak on this motion or the Bill. The Standing Orders have been suspended in order that .these financial proposals may be passed almost immedibehalf. ately, and I intend to place no obstacle - the way. But, apparently, Supply is necessary today for tihe ordinary vices, but for the Treasurer's advance f the next financial year, and the Works and Buildings Bill . As the Treasurer has pointed out, a sum of £5,271,000 has already been spent on works and buildto rise again. in<-s in the eleven months, and £244,000 will permit of the works being carried on for the balance of the term. I admit that the Treasurer requires the £750,000 for the Treasurer's advance u n t i l further Supply is granted in July, but I cannot see why, if the Treasury officials expect to save £600,000, there is any necessity Under the the circumstances, as I say, it would have been just as well Jbo simply provide for the Treasurer's advance and the Works I have no intention .of entering into any criticism as to the administration of the I understand that we are to meet on the it 11th July, when we shall have an opporto discuss the conduct of the elecThat, is a matter I do not intend already to deal with today, but I certainly do obIt. will be ject-and I see that the Minister who was l is in charge of the elections is present-t b members of a party, who call themselves It is the "" Win-the-War "" party, advertising in German in the German newspapers.",23
13,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That is not so; neither Supmy agent nor myself, authorized that to",25
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Then why did the honto proorable gentleman not take some action against those who did so advertise? Many of Mr Glynn - What could I do ?,25

17,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"As I say, at the proper time. I intend to. deal with the elections, and call attention to the extraordinary expenditure on behalf of honourable members opposite. Practically every section of the Electoral Act was broken, and, in my opinion, no honourable member opposite could sign an electoral return declaring that only £ 1 0 0 had been expended on his I shall say no more in regard to in that matter now; but I am concerned not about the meeting for tomorrow. The serGovernment and their supporters have o r ' come back boasting that they have swept the party on this side off the board; in deed, the Minister for the Navy said that the sun of the Labour party had set never",25
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who said that ?,25
19,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"That was so reported the day after the election-it was said that we were "" smashed.""",26
20,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I did not say anything like that. It is a gross exaggeration !,26

Throughout country, and also overseas, they circulated a paper containing gross misstatements about the Labour party. In that paper, a copy of which I have, ib was said that we, on this side, were not concerned about winning the war; but I ask, what are the Government going to do to win the war? They have been in powerfor nearly six weeks, and,, so far as I can see, gramme for winning the war is as far off as ever.  the day before yesterday.",26
22,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Government have noying been in existence all the time, and the day after the elections they well knew what the result would be. We are now asked to grant Supply without any obstruction, and I can say that there is no intention on this, side to oborable struct. No doubt, other honourable members have received copies of the to which I have referred, and which, speaks of the desire of the Labour party to preing vent recruiting. That paper was disso tributed by the military authorities, in it is the assertion that the Labour party has no consideration at all for the men the front , and are - not concerned winning the war.

40,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas - Minister for Home and Territories) [4.43] - I desire to make a personal explanation with regard to the suggestion made by the honourable member for Yarra. Doubtless, without knowing the facts, he stated that during the recent election I had had an advertisement inserted in a German paper. As a matter of fact, I never saw the German paper referred to, or the advertisement either, but a Labour paper made the assertion with flaring headlines. My secretary, whose name was at the bottom of the advertisement, tried to find out' who put it in, but was unsuccessful. Mr TTOOB, - L b did appear in a German paper, though?",27
41,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am informed it did, but I am so careless about these matters that I did not try to verify that statement. A lot, I understand, has been said about this matter in the other States, but neither I nor my secretary had any circulars .or advertisements inserted in a German paper. Even if my secretary had done so, it would have been a perfectly legitimate thing to do, because the advertisement merely asked electors to "" vote for your old, trusted representative,"" and was a copy of an advertisement to the electors published in ordinary newspapers. It is untrue to say that I had circulars or advertisements or addressed meetings in German. If those who made the statement had said that I addressed meetings in French it would have been more accurate.",27
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Western Australia^-Treasurer ) [4.45] - I desire now to present to honourable members a statement with regard to a summary of the Commonwealth finances in June of this year.

The revenue, however, subsequently began to fall, and is expected to be about £1,823,000 less than in the year 1915-16. The revenue still continues to fall. The lower revenue is due chiefly to the decrease in the number of ships arriving from oversea ports, and to the over-stocking which previously occurred in some classes of goods. Another factor is the restriction of exportation of goods from the United Kingdom. In a few classes of goods, of which there is a small imported supply, orders have been placed for supplies of Australian manufacture. The Government have recently appointed a Luxuries Board, whose duty it is to inquire into and make recommendations in relation to goods which, during the war, should not be imported, as being articles of luxury or articles which are not essential to the general comfort, health, or welfare of the community. The recommendations of the Luxuries Board, if given effect to, will cause a further falling off of imports, and at present it cannot therefore be said that the outlook of the Customs revenue is satisfactory -.'...! 191718 during the following year. Sir John Forrest. Direct Taxation. Until the year 1910-11 the Commonwealth had no direct taxation. In that year a graduated land tax was introduced, and produced a sum The of £1,370,345. The number of direct Comtaxes was not added to until 1914-15,. when £39,646 was collected from probate £ and succession duties. The total direct taxation of the Commonwealth now amounts to:- Actual Estimate 1915-16. 1916-17. £ £ Land Tax 2,040,436 1,976,000Income Tax (first collected in 1915-16) . . 3,932,775 4,900,000Succession Duties (first collected in 1914-15) 626,215 1.024.00O Entertainments (first collected in 1916-17) -- 100,000 Total Direct Taxation . . 6,599,426 48,000,000- The entertainments tax has been disappointing in 'its results, and it would now appear that, in the half-year ending on the thirtieth of this month, only £100,000 will be received from that source. c When the "" General View of Commonwealth Finances"" was presented to the House in March last, there was a possibility that the war-time profits»tax would soon be in operation, and there was included in the estimated revenue of 1916-17 an amount of £800,000, representing the estimated tax for the years 191516 and 1916-17. The Bill is now prepared and will be immediately introduced. It seems likely that the revenue (£800,000) estimated for the year 191617, but not received, will be collected during next year, and the tax for It is interesting here to note that war expenditure which has been paid out of 'the Consolidated Revenue Fund is: Actual Actual 1914-15. 1915-16. £540,217 ... £3,778,378 ... £8,031,929 Direct and Indirect Taxation. From direct and indirect taxation, the Comconditions monwealth in the year 1916-17, which about to close, will receive the estimated revenue of £23,110,300. This - ompares with £23,533,529 actually received in 1915-16. Revenue of 'Postmaster-General's partment. In Post Office revenue also there have been large increases, as will seen in the following table: 1901-02 £2,372,861 1906-07 ... 3,128,574 1911-12 ... 3,916,254 1912-13 ... 4,226,313 1913-14 ... 4,511,307 1914-15 4,594,542 1915-16 ... 5,053,596 1916-17 (Estimate) Though increases have occurred, it must nob be supposed that the Post Office has assisted the Treasury, and this aspect of the case will be dealt with when reference 13 made to the expenditure of the Department. Silver and Bronze Coinage. In considering the financial outlook, sight must not be lost of the fact that the Commonwealth, since the war broke out, has been earning a large revenue from the issue of silver and bronze coin. In 1011-12 the Revenue from Coinage „ 1912-13 „ „ „ „ 1913-14 „ „ „ „ 1914-15 „ „ „ „ 1915-16 „ „ „ „ 1916-17 the Estimate is „ the This revenue represents the difference between the face value of the coins and the cost of the bullion. The whole amount is not profit, because there is some expense Estimate (£16,584 in 1915-16, and an estimate of £26,510 in 1916-17) in making and dis1916-17. tributing blie coins. This expense is included in the expenditure of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. It is thought that much of the revenue in 1915-16 and 1916-17 has been caused by the abnormal brought about by the war, and is that the revenue may be greatly diminished after the end of the war. Miscellaneous Revenue. From miscellaneous sources, in 1916-17, ib is exDepected that the Commonwealth will receive a revenue of £3,587,300, in combe parison with £1,815,371 actually received in the previous year. This is an increase of £1,771,929, made up as follows : Actual Estimate. Increase. 1915-115. 1916-17.

The total expenditure during the three years of war is £129,11'4',206. During this period of three years £1,371,631 has been provided from revenue towards a Sinking Fund for the redemption of war loans. The expenditure is so great that the most careful business management is required as well as the most careful scrutiny. The Treasury has made an attempt in this statement, and also in the Estimates, fo show a clear cut division between war (expenditure and ordinary expenditure. Honourable members will have no difficulty in'seeing at once how much we have spent this year on the war from loan and revenue and how much in ordinary expenditure.

Except in the years 1905-6 and 1906-7, when there were balances of £40,249.and £163,434 in favour of the Post Office, the Treasury has expended for the Post Office not only all the revenue earned by that Department, but has proSir John Forrest. the last eight years, as will be seen war exfrom the following figures: NAVAL.

It is useful, therefore, to compare the revenue of the Department with the expenditure provided for on ordinary estimates of the Department. These ordinary estimates include approximately what is required for the maintenance of the Department. in the last five years areTotal Total Jtevenuo Expenditure Excess ot and Credits (not including Expenditure. for Pensions.

Expenditure on New Works, Etc. Under the heading of New Works, & c , - the Treasury usually includes new buildings, new works, plant, ships, and purchase of land. Reference to the first paragraph of this paper will show that the expenditure on New Works, & c , in 1916-17 is estimated at £4,914,307, while the expenditure of the previous year was £2,940,835. It is important to note, however, that the latter figure represents only the amount expended out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. there was expended, in 1915-16, an amount of £2,458,418 out of loan. The - total expenditure on new works, & c , in 191516 was therefore £5,399,253, and the estimated expenditure on new works in 1916-17 is really £484,946 less than the amount expended in 1915-16. Early in the present financial year it was decided that the circulation of Australian notes had reached such dimensions that further increase for the purpose of""works was undesirable. For some years it had been the practice to pay, out of moneys borrowed from the Notes Fund, for all the Commonwealth works which were payable from Loan Funds. Owing, however, to the financing of the States from the Notes Fund to the extent of £20,634,000, this legitimate source, from which the Commonwealth works chargeable to loan were paid, is not now available. monwealth has crippled itself in its desire to help the States. The whole expenditure on Commonwealth new works in 191617, namely, £4,914,307, has, therefore, been met out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Expenditure on Federal Capital. The expenditure in connection with Federal Capital began in 1901-2, and up The figures to the year 1910-11 £23,914 was expended in choosing the site. The actual expenditure in establishing the Capital at Canberra, including the acquisition of private lands, is as follows : £ £ £ 522,625 621,985 Out of 608,680 Loan (for 267,211 Out of land) from Total.

The Commonwealth makes good the loss on working, and provides, in addition, for extraordinary maintenance. The revenue received by the Commonwealth, £12,741, is made up of wharfages and shunting charges on the railway in connection with the wharf at Port Angusta. In 1914-15 an unusual receipt of £4,500 for sale of storage tank is included.

The expenditure in 1915-16 was £470,921 , and the estimate for 1916-17 is £589,602. Although these works have been in hand for only six years the expenditure totals £1,440,399, and the yearly rate is increasing. The expenditure up to the 30th June,. 1917, is as follows: Plinders Base ... ... £519,899* Henderson Base (Cockburn Sound) 455,474 Port Stevens Base 54,741 Extraordinary Albany Base (Surveys) 4,048 mainten- New loss on Total.

The time has come when we are compelled to pay for the whole of the war services out of Loan Funds, except those services which, from their nature, should be charged against the revenue. The following table shows the burden upon revenue in respect of war: - Actual Interest and Sinking Fund on War Loans 115,145 War Pensions Detained Enemy Vessels (this is set off by earnings paid into Eevonue) 153,973 Other War Services 271,009 Total War Expenditure out of Consolidated Eevenue Fund 540,217 Unfortunately, the amount to be provided for in next financial year for interest, sinking f u n d , and war pensions will be several millions more than the amount paid this year. Moreover, the amount of revenue now being collected is less than the expenditure, the deficit in 1916-17 being £2,873,114. It is clear that the task of making ends meet in 1917-18 will not be easy. War Expenditure Out of Loan. expenditure on war has been:- 1914-15.

Owing to delay in obtaining statement of sums due to the British Government, and owing to the Sir, John Forrest. difficulties of exchange, payments to the British Government did not begin until 1st May, 1917, when arrangements were made to pay £8,500,000 at the rate, of £500,000 per week. It is intended :o arrange further payments to the British Government as soon as possible. Tke postponement of payments to the British Government has considerably reduced the estimated expenditure during this financial year on .the war, but the expenditure Actual Estimate 1916-17. has been incurred and the payments are 1914-16. 1915-16. merely postponed. £ £ £ The British Government have been most 2,059,491 6,090,599 129,273 1,200,000 generous in the matter.

Therefore, 1,271,329 41,330 the payment of £8,500,000 has been a spontaneous act on our part, and we may pay more just as it suits us. The British 3,778,378 .8,031,929 Government do not harass us for payment) of the liability. Total Expenditure, not including Payments to States and not including War Expenditure. For a considerable number of years the outstanding feature of Commonwealth finance has been the continual increase in the annual expenditure. Until a recent date, however, there has not been any great difficulty in finding money to meet the expenditure. The immense and increasing burdens of the war, and the inflated expenditure on The ordinary i&ervices, have brought us to the time when the financial position has become very difficult. No longer can proposals involving large expenditure be Estimate lightly adopted as heretofore, and a re1915-10. 1916-17. turn of easy financial conditions seems far off. £ £ £ 59,239,363 < An analysis of the "" Interim Financial Statement'' presented to Parliament on 8,031,929 27th September, 1916, shows that (omitting payments to the States and omitting war expenditure) the estimated expendi51,207,434 ture for 1916-17 was £23,785,798. Between that date and 6th March, 1917, when the "" General View of the Commonwealth Finances"" was presented to the House, the Estimates had been re-' £32,000,000, duced, at the urgent request of the Treamaintenance sury, to £22,341,955. Further reductions since, of £1,222,970, have resulted in the estimated expenditure for 1916-17 being £21,118,985. Notwithstanding the immense reduction of £2,666,813 in the Estimates since 27th. September, 1916, the Treasury omcers expect that when the accounts of the year have been closed, a further reduction will be found to haye taken place. The total expenditure of the Commonwealth, omitting - payments to the States and omitting war expenditure, but including loan expenditure on works, & c , has been:1909-10 . £8,155,666 1910-11 .. 11,321,354 1911-12 1912-13 .. 16,352,650 1913-14 .. 18,897,368 1914-15 .. 18,879,515 1915-16 .. 20,095,261 1916-17 (Estimate) . .. 21,118,985 As to the estimated increase of £1,023,724 in the expenditure of 1916-17, compared with that of the year before, it may be pointed out that the increase in old-age and invalid pensions alone is £800,234. The increase apaTt from such pensions is £223,490. This comparison of totals is, to some extent, misleading, because, as already stated, there was decrease in New Works, & c , of £484,946. Omitting the following, namely, New Works, & c , Invalid and Old-age pensions, and interest paid for States, as well as ibhe payments to States and War ExpenCommonwealth diture previously omitted, the estimated the Notes FundExpenditure of 1916-17 exceeds the actual Expenditure of 1915-16 by £603,436. The successive and accumulative in creases of expenditure are alarming, and require the most careful consideration. It is not possible, nor would it be opportune for me, here to indicate what must be done in order to provide for the financial arrangements of the year 1917-18, but the situation will have to be faced and dealt with when the Budget proposals of the ensuing year are placed before Parrepay liament. The matter is receiving earnest attention, and I shall be appointed if the immense increase of excember, 1918. penditure necessitated by the war is not accompanied by considerable reductions in current Departmental Expenditure.

The agreement includes the following: (a) Commonwealth to be the borrower overseas; (6) Commonwealth to borrow for State requirements £8,940,000 to 31st December, 1916, and afterwards £7,450,000 annum t ill one year after the end of the war; (c) States to have the right to borrow in Australia, under certain conditions, £3,610,000 for 1916, and £4,332,000 for 1917. The foregoing arrangements do not apply to renewals by the States of their existing loans. The moneys referred to the agreement are for the ordinary public works, & c , of the States, and are not for the settlement of returned soldiers on the land or for other repatriation purposes. Atl the Premiers' Conference in January, 1917,. the agreement of 6th November, 1915, was modified as follows: The Commonwealth to borrow for the States £5,400,000 instead of £7,450,000 for 1917 . . £5,400,000 The States were at liberty to raise in Australia under certain conditions ..

The price of issue was 98, and the rate of interest 5£ per cent, per annum. loan is redeemable in 1922-27. The I m perial Government has agreed that the Commonwealth may make advances to the States, totalling £3,000,000, out of war funds supplied by the British Government, in anticipation of the issue of a further loan for the States, out of which - the advances will be repaid t'o the War Punds. Some of the States have already Sir John Forrest. been paid their proportions of this £3,000,000, and it is expected that the' whole amount will be advanced to the sole States before the 30th June, 1917. The amount of £3,000,000 is being paid to the States as follows:Balance of £8,940,000 agreed to be raised for 1916 . . .. £1,440,000 per Towards, £5,400,000 due for 1917 1,560,000 £3,000,00 0 0 The summary of amounts lent by or through the Commonwealth to the States is: Lent out of Notes Fund, to be repaid at various dates between. 1919 and 1926 ., . . £2,634,000 in Lent out of Notes Fund, to be repaid in 1917 and 1918 . . 18,000,000 The Commonwealth has raised for the States, in LondonTo be repaid in 1920-22 4,000,000 To be repaid in 1922-27 .. 3,500,000 The Commonwealth will have advanced to the States before 30th June, 1917, out of moneys lent to the Commonwealth by the British Government, for war . . .. 3,000,000 Total loans to States by or through the Commonwealth £31,134,000 4,332,000 £9,732,000 The position now is that, on the one hand, the Commonwealth has undertaken to raise money for the States, and, on the other hand, there ""will shortly be large sums due by the States to the Commonwealth.

The financial and other features of the scheme are receiving close attention, ° will be placed before Parliament at early date. Invalid and Old-age Pensions. During last financial year, Parliament inereased the payments to invalid and old age pensioners by half-a-crown a week in the case of each pension. It is estimated that this increase involves the CommonBalance wealth in an annual extra cost of £800,000. In the present financial year the payments to invalid and old-age penPost sioners are estimated at £3,660,000, being Land an increase of £800,234 on the expendiProbate and Succession Duties . . ture of ie previous year. There will be Defence+1 a considerable increase again next year, because the increase of. half-a-crown week began on 1st October, 1916. and the Patents full effect of the annual increase will not Trade be shown in the expenditure until the 30th Lighthouses September next.

In concluding the ""General ""View of Commonwealth Finances,"" 474,453 540,950 presented to Parliament on the 6th 810,477 964,071 March last, I stated my belief that 4,966,537 the requirements of the year ending 2,932,797 30th June, 1917, were provided for. That forecast has been verified, and the current : 1,981,510 year 1916-17 will , it is estimated, end 27,416,485 with a credit balance of £126,886. It is not possible, nor is it expedient, to deal with the estimated revenue and 6,090,599 129,273 1,200.000 expenditure of the coming year, or to in 318,285 700,000 dicatethe measures that will be impera41,330 tively necessary in order, to provide the immense sum required for the energetic 8,031,929 prosecution of the war, and to assist in 35,448,414 every way possible the Mother-land and her brave Allies in"" securing victory and 3,000,000 peace. 126,886 The Budget of next year will have to 30,762,210 35,575,300 be framed so as to meet these dimcult circumstances, and it is clear that a very large additional revenue will be required, limited, I hope, by a considerable decrease in Departmental Expenditure. The season throughout the whole Commonwealth has been good, and the production and prices obtained have been very satisfactory. WAR LOAN FUND . I thank honourable members for the patience which they have exhibited in listening to this long statement, but I Actual Estimate 1915-16. 1916-17. thought that at the end of a year during which there have been many changes, and during which the Estimates have £ £ been dealt with by two or three Treasurers, it would be well to make a clear 20,233,115 statement of the position of the finances from the Treasury stand-point, aided by 5,256,683 38,845,000 some remarks of my own, which honor530,000 able members might accept as their finan11,000,000 cial bible up to 30th June of this year.

Again I thank them for the courtesy which extended to me in listening so attentively to my remarks.",32
47,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [5.41] - I desire to preface my remarks with just one observation, sir, in regard to election to the office of Chairman mittees. I wish to say that the incident which I related earlier in the afternoon I now regard as closed, and to assure of my support in the discharge of duties of your high office. It was not intention fo speak on this occasion for a statement made by the Prime Minisshould ter. The Financial Statement of the Treasurer, though a very interesting one, I do not propose to criticise at present time. But I do feel duty to make a few observations concerning the suggestion of the Prime Minister that we should meet him in secret session held. tomorrow. What is the reason for this secret session ? Is the press of this try to be excluded from the deliberations of this Parliament? We have recently heard a good deal about secret juntas. Of what is the National party afraid, it desires to meet in secret? I appeal to the press of this country-althoug we have not received a very fair deal from it-to take notice of the action of called National party in attempting at early a date to conduct their business i secret. Of what are its members afraid?",40
48,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,Unknown,Was not honourable member a Minister when the previous secret session was held ?,40
49,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I did not attend secret session, and I shall take into serifalse ous consideration the question of whether I ought to attencl any secret session. Honourable members opposite have their mandate from the country. We have been smashed at the polls",40
50,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,Unknown,Does honourable member recognise that it may be desirable to place honourable in possession of certain 'facts in relation to the war which the public ought not to be told 1,40
51,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I draw the attention the righ t honourable member to a stateHe ment made recently by Mr Lloyd George, were peoplethe Prime Minister of Great Britain , who, in speaking of the submarine menace, or said, ' ' I publish the figures to the world, because I want the public to know that sectional the Government is keeping nothing from them."" He added that the best never got out of the Old Country until its they have people knew the worse.",40
52,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"He also had a secret sitting. Mr HIGGS : - If the Prime Minister of Great Britain sees ho reason why anyyour thing should be kept from the British of Compublic, I see no reason why anything should be withheld from the public of Australia. The people have been kept you too much in the dark. What is the reathe son for this censorship? Why was the my press at Rockhampton instructed that no but reference by Higgs to Japanese trade be permitted? Why was that action taken by the censors, no doubt under instructions from the Prime Minister? I the see no reason for the suppression of facts it my bounden relating to the war ber might after a secret meeting had been",40
53,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We have been told by counthe Prime Minister that we are to be called in to advise the Win-the-war party how to win the war. We, who have been slandered and defamed from one end of that Australia to the other, are to be asked ' to do this. Only the day before polling, h the Minister for the Navy, who, I regret to say, is not in his place, told the people this soto "" beware of their homes and their so pockets."" Y e t we, who were charged with n being I . W . W . men, who were accused of being disloyalists and pro-Germans, are the to be asked to meet the National party in secret, and to tell them how to w in th© war. If they do not know how to win it , the they have obtained their mandate under pretences. It is amazing impudence on the part of the Prime Minister and his followers to ask us to tell them how to win the war. I have here a letter which the Prime Minister sent out to the relatives of soldiers at the front . It bears ' not the the Commonwealth coat of arms, and is dated the 25th A p r i l . It reached the members Rockhampton district on the 3rd Mayjust two days before polling. It reads: Dear Mrs Kirk, I am writing to you personally, because I of know you have a direct interest in this war. went on to say that the Labour party who care nothing for the war, for Australia, for the Empire. They have made no sacrifices; they have in many cases taken the war as an opportunity to further their own selfish' ends. To them duty, honour, patriotism, are empty words. To them the sacrifices was at Gallipoli, Pozieres, and Bapaume meam nothing. And now, when the opposing armies girding up their loins for the final struggle, when every effort is needed, when the Austrarailway lians at the front can emerge successfully if the nation is behind them, this band of disloyalists has forced the country into an electhe tion. He went on to sayYou are directly interested in this election because you are directly interested Strike a blow for those who represent you at the front by voting against that disloyal ment who would desert them in their hour of gether. need. We members of the Labour Party, who have thus been described as disloyalists, and as men who would desert our soldiers in the hour of need, are now asked to meet the Government and their suplate porters in secret session and to tell what they should do to i w in the w war. The Government and their supGovernment porters know very well that they can no more than we were able to do when tion. in office. They have no new proposals make. The honourable member Flinders holds certain views which he would like the Government to adopt. The only action which honourable members opposite could take that we did not take when in office is that of bringing i scription, and to introduce - conscription this country would be to bring about great deal more harm than good. The to DaMy Telegraph was quite righ t when, the return of the Prime. Minister from Old Country, it asked in a leading article, "" Is it worthwhile, for the sake of few extra men that would be obtained now, for our forces as the result of conscripprotest tion, to introduce the social and political unrest that would follow the adoption conscription in Australia ?'' When Government went to the country they said they were going to "" W in the w a r , "" and, in making that statement, they dewhich ceived the people, as the electors w i l eventually discover. What can Nationalist party do to win the war that we did not do when in office? Did not equip the troops? Did we not raise the necessary funds? Did we not work to the very best of our ability and work longer hours than other Ministers have ever done? Mr Bruce SMITH:-The people think so on 5th May.",40
54,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"That was because honourable members opposite, having the compublishing statements that mand of a great deal of money, were able to to p r in t and to circulate in every statements such as those to which' are just been referring. Having the command of ample funds, they even exhibited on stations huge iron sheets on which only were painted the words "" If you vote for Nationalist party you will vote for the soldiers at the front. If you vote for the Labour party you will vote for the - I . W . W . , sabotage, the destruction of proin this war. perty,"" and so forth .",41
55,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,Unknown,You ought to diselesociate yourselves from those fellows alto,41
56,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I b is absurd to say that we associate with them. The Nationalist party used the forces of government, and the immense sums of money that interested parties placed at their disposal, to circuthe vilest slanders concerning our them party. Those who provided the funds ill , no doubt, get their reward from the in being allowed to raise the do prices of commodities, and escape taxaI f honourable members opposite* to want to know how to w in the war let for me tell them they can do so by taxing the people who ought to bear the taxation of this country. I shall be interested to learn what the Treasurer proposes in the way of war-time profits taxation. We n conreceived such a smashing blow at the in polls, and honourable members opposite a were returned with such a huge majority win the war, that I feel it is our duty on to stand aside and to let them show what the they can do to win the war. We should occupy the time of this House as little as the possible, intervening only, as I am doing to make a protest when a should be entered. I protest against the secret session which it is of proposed to hold tomorrow. We have the nothing of which to be afraid. Since the honourable member for Flinders has spoken of certain secret information, let me say that some of the information is given at thesesecret meetings is l of a bluffing character. It is pure bluff the on the part of the Prime Minister to tell us that so much depends upon Japan; it we is pure bluff to influence the public of Australia to adopt conscription by alarming them in this way. Who believes for also one moment that Australia should be placed under the heel of Japan in such a way that the National Parliament dare did not not deal with the Tariff ? Why was the press prevented from I made the people of Queensland that home, no Japanese statesman would object I have to our attitude in regard ito the Tariff if lie once investigated our factories, saw our wages sheets, learned of the hours of labour and the way our workers lived here? No Japanese statesman with such knowledge in his possession would ask us to grant a preferential rate to Japanese goods which had been made by children receiving 4Jd. and 5d. for twelve hours work per day. That was all that I said on that subject to the people in my electorate, yet such remarks were censored. Why does the Prime Minister suggest in secret session that there is anything to fear from the Japanese nation ? It is for this reason, amongst others, that I object to .the secret session being held. The Treasurer interjects that the Prime Minister was my colleague when .the last secret session was held. The right honourable gentleman knows very well, however, that without a certain measure of harmony no Cabinet can exist. He knows, too, that a Prime Minister, as the head of a Government, has necessarily a certain amount of power which he is entitled to exercise, although his colleagues may not always agree with him. I imagine that the Treasurer will noti agree with all his colleagues in the present Ministry.",41
57,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,Perhaps not.,42
58,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,- I should like the Treasurer to state whether it was the deliberate decision of the Government that a secret session should be held tomorrow ?,42

"" The Treasurer, I suppose, will decline to take the responsibility for such a session if the people show any opposition to it ; but if they do not, the position will be different. I wish to know whether it is the proposal of the Government, as such, that they should endeavour to ascertain from members of the Parliament what to do to w in the war. If it is,, then the Government have obtained their majority under false pretences. As one who is still smarting under the defamation and libel and slander of the Nationalist party in the literature they sent out to the country, I object to it , and doubt whether I will attend it . I did not attend the last secret session, because I like to be free to tell my constituents all that takes place in Parliament, and if I attend the secret session tomorrow, I suppose I shall place myself under such a bond that I cannot tell my constituents what takes place there.",42

66,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The Treasurer vouched for the truth of every item in the statement he submitted.,42
67,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The figures in the Treasurer's statement are correct as they stand, but the position is that the Oodnadatta railway just about pays its ordinary working expenses. In this statement, however, the extraordinary working expenses are also included, because such things as' relaying and resleepering are paid for by the Federal Government. Roughly, there is a loss of about £100,000 a year on the running of the railway, which is about 500 miles. I would remind some of my honourable friends, who thought that this was almost unique, that there is not a Government in Australia today which hag not some section of its railways losing as much as is lost on this particular section of the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway.

Matters which they do obtain, or are obtainable, from the usual sources, they are perfectly at liberty to use after the secret session, just as they were before. Surely there need be no diffithe culty about the matter. Any gentleman - who finds he has conscientious objections, or apprehends any danger from the course proposed, can save himself by staying away from the meeting.  honourable member for Flinders has paved a way by saying that those whose con-; science might be strained by attending the secret conference may stay away. But I hold that every man who is elected, whether on this or the other side of House, has as much right as another know what is going on in public affairs. Many of us who attended one of those conferences know, to our sorrow in some Lloyd instances, that Ministers of the Crown when they got on the hustings twitted members of the Labour party with not doing anything during the last three years with regard to the Tariff. I was so accused myself, but honourable memtroversy bers know very well why the Tariff was - not proceeded with. I held my peace, though I was taxed on the matter in own electorate, because every man who tended that secret gathering was bound hold his tongue as to what took place. Personally, I told the electors on the platform that my tongue was sealed in regard to the Tariff, and'that I would not say a word one way or the other. think, however, that the position I and others held was pretty rough, considermeeting ing that it was well known why nothing had been done during the last three years in reference to the Tariff.

90,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"We are asked to be silent, although if we go into the library we find in the magazines there articles contributed by some of the best brains in world, including the brains of Japan, dealing with the very subject which we are not allowed to discuss. These matters are dealt with elsewhere in the most open manner, and without any apology; and, altogether, I think that there is too strict e a censorship in Australia. Take up any British journal, whether it be the Times, a Labour paper, a Socialist paper, or a magazine, and we find that almost unlimited latitude is allowed in the discussion of questions in relation to the war. the Public addresses by public men in Great to Britain, no matter to what party they belong, have the freest possible circulation. I agree with the honourable member for Capricornia, who quoted Mr. George as saying . that Great Britain-and I presume this includes the overseas Dominions-is most prepared to do its best when the worse is known. In reference to Japan, particularly amongst writers and editors, a triangular conhas been going on ever since the war began in respect, to trade and treaty alquestions, and this controversy has been my contributed to by Japanese, British, at and American writers. If these questo tions are discussed in the journals to be found on the table of the Library, and in every library in the world, why should secrecy be observed here ? In my opinion, this hush-up business makes the public I suspicious that there are being kept from them things they ought to know.

I distinguished meeting from a secret session, applying that term to the kind of meeting tive of both Houses which in th© last Parliament, and to which i reference has already been made. A that former secret session or meeting honourable members were taken into the bias. confidence of the Government, and matters were discussed which, upon a fair in terpretation, it was generally agreed could not be openly spoken of in this place anywhere else. I do not agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong that licence or liberty, if you like to put is given to journalists or the public genesire rally in Japan, Great Britain , or elsedesire where, to speak of matters which are culated to endanger the safety of their own country.

If I am wrong, I enter my protest at once, and object to a noble ally beng insulted, not so much by actual statements as by innuendoes. My lips were not sealed by what was said at any previous meeting, because I was quoting the words of the Commander-inChief, as well as the words of one of the great statesmen Premiers of Japan. It is impossible .to compare this Parliament with an industrial union. Members of Parliament are paid by the people, and they are in a very different position from that occupied by the members of a union, who are struggling against evils which have come down to them from primeval days, and thus have to conduct itheir meetings more or less in secret. The people of Australia should know the worse, so that they may face it . If it is that Japan is a danger to Australia, let the people know it . I do not think she is, and I protest against any insult being offered to her. If I thought that this would be done, I would not attend any private meeting. other hand, it is to be a meeting at which members will be free to make suggestions, as is the case at, say, a meeting of directors, I can understand the reason for the gathering. We might well follow the example of Japan, which at the present moment has the most up-to-date Tariff in the world. That is the only nation which has beaten the American Tobacco Combine. I do not wish it to be said, after tomorrow's meeting, that I have betrayed any confidences. No man, living or dead, can truth full y say that of me. The Tariff can be properly dealt with if the Government will only take a manly course; but we have one fool censor here who permits statements to be published, while another fool censor in New South Wales will not pass them. We do not know which is right. Some censors will even censor statements which have appeared in England, which is much nearer to the danger zone than we are. In this matter of censorship, the newspapers have been badly treated. I am not saying this to curry favour with the press; but I repeat: they have been treated scandalously, and that it is. not right to tell the people- "" Oh, if you only knew what was said at the private Conference, you would act differently."" This is all "" to m m y - r o t ."" Let us be straightforward. If there is danger to be faced, let the people know it , and I am sure that more men will join the ranks than are coming forward at the present time. I accuse the Defence Department, by mismanagement, of doing more to prevent enlisting in Australia than any other Department in the Commonwealth, and it is no wonder that one of the brainiest members in the legal profession in New South Wales spoke of it as the Department of "" muddledom.""

112,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield), [9.14] - I desire to say a few words to the development of the NorthS e rn Territory, which is a matter of very grave importance to the people of the t Commonwealth. For some years past we have had an administration in the TeTri"" tory which has been marked particularly expenditure of an excessive and very I wasteful character. I do not propose to occupy many moments debating this question, though it is one, as I say, of great magnitude. It is understood that the appointment of an Administrator is shortly to be made; but, seeing that the Governhave deferred an appointment for weeks, I ask the Prime Minister not to make one until the House meets again. In the interest of the Northern Territory I urge that, before such an appointment is made, there should be a full and complete statement by the Minister 1 controlling that part of Australia. It is a matter of general opinion that the Territory can only be properly developed on practical lines in two directions-pas toral development first, and almost entirely, and then mineral development. FORCES :",47
113,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"How shall we get population there if people can only select holdings not exceeding 20,000 acres? - I Mr RICHARD FOSTER - I suggest that the question of populating the Territory should be thoroughly discussed by this Parliament before another appointment to the office of Administrator is made, and if the development of the Territory is to be principally upon pastoral t is lines, I wish to urge upon the Govern the advisability of appointing an who is a practical man, new with a practical knowledge of pastoral I contend that such a man can found. The Northern Territory is to be developed only by pastoralists who have plenty of capital at their disposal, and if pastoralists are to be attracted to the Northern Territory they require symmornpathetic administration by a man who knows something about pastoral development. The administration of the Terriin future ought to be very different from the past administration, and if the Administrator whose term of office exa few weeks ago is responsible generally for the policy in the past, he is not a fit man for re-appointment. If he is not responsible, it is about time this in House knew who is. If the Ministerial party is true to its declared intentions to follow the path of economy, it must be prepared to apply commercial principles to the development of this vast Territory, into which we have been pouring money as if into a sink, having nothing ito show for the expenditure. This Parliament has never had sumcient information submitted to it on many matters, and that complaint is particularly true in respect of the Northern Territory. For the last t h i r t y years I have been brought into close contact with men who have spent ten, twenty, and even t h i r t y years there. Being resident in the northern part of South Australia, I had opportunities of constantly meeting men who were going to and coming from the Territory - not only those who were interested in pastoral pursuits, but also men who had spent a life-time travell i ng to and f r o as drovers. Those drovers, as many honourable members know, have, by reason of continually passing up and down the country year after year, a thoroughly practical grip of existing conditions, and all the opinions I have heard them express-are to the effect that, whatever the Government do to amend the blunders of the past, they should certainly Secure a thoroughly practical pastoralist to take charge of the Northern Territory. I ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether that is not the impression of South Australian pastoralists?",47

Pastoralists will never be induced to expend capital in the Territory under an administration such as has obtained there for the last seven years.,48
118,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,South Australia had charge of the Territory for f if t y or years.,48
119,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Yes ; and for every shilling South Australia wasted, this Parliament has wasted for t y shillings. In spite of all the expenditure that has been incurred in the Territory by the Commonwealth, I challenge any honourable member to say that development is any further advanced than it was when South Australia handed over its responsibility.",48
120,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,South Australia built up a good old debt.,48
121,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"South Australia did nothing of the kind. Relatively speaking, this Parliament has built up the debt of the Territory at ten times as great a rate as South' Australia did . Honourable members know well that the South Australian accumulated debt on the Northern Territory was largely due to the White Australia policy, and South Australia ought to have ithe sympathy of the House rather than its condemnation for having stood true to that principle. In the name of the pastoral and producing interests of Australia, I ask the Government to defer the appointment of an A d ministrator unSil they receive representations on the subject. Those representations will be sSon forthcoming, because I know that the people interested in pastoral pursuits throughout Australia would never dream that after the experience of the last seven years a Government would think of the re-appointment of an A d ministrator whose term of office from beginning to end has been a signal failure.",48

123,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,I do not care,48
124,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"So far as my common sense guides me, I .take the brunt of his statement to be that the only man responsible , for the failures he has mento tioned is the present Administrator.",48
125,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,I do not say that; but this House ought to know who,48
126,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Then , if the present Administrator is not responsible, past A d ministrations are. The honourable member's request is that the Government should defer the appointment of an A d ministrator in order to allow a full in sixty vestigation of the position of the Territory. That suggestion practically means that this House is to sit as a commission of inquiry into suggestions that the present Administrator has been mainly responsible during the last five or six years for what has occurred in the Territory. I do not care to speak at length on this question so late at night; but if the honourable member desires to know what is the position of the Territory, I am prepared to submit at once a memorandum on the affairs of the Territory, dealing with pastoral'pursuits, mining, finance, and everything else relating t'o its development. I assure him that I do not intend to sleep on the question of the development of the Northern Territory.",48
127,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Will you listen to pastoralists who are practical men?,49
128,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Who has repudiated the influence of the pastoralists? I will show the honourable member voluminous evidence I have taken with my own hands in regard to the development of the Northern Territory. I have t-aken statements from pastoralists on both sides of this matter.,49
129,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,A good many have protested againsti the past policy.,49
130,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I know that there is an immense difference of opinionamongst them in regard to the development of the Northern Territory. I have investigated the pastoral question, and development during the last six years has been mainly along pastoral lines. The so-called agricultural experiments were not begun since Dr Gilruth went to the Territory.",49
131,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,He is not practical man.,49
132,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I had not been in office as Minister for External Affairs for six months before I turned, down the expenditure which was fostering what the honourable member for Wakefield regards as futile experiments in agricultural development. I proceeded also to draw up a new Bill, which has not been laid before the House yet, covering on new lines the whole of the agricultural and pastoral development of the Territory. As a matter of fact, there have been no cash advances made since I turned down the proposals in connection with agricultural development. There, are only ten agricultural settlers left, and if the honourable member for Wakefield asks me why, I will say that it is mainly due, not to the failure of agricultural development, but to the fact that the wages at Darwin are so high that men are attracted from the land to that - place. Twice this week I have been before a Judge in connection with serious wages . disputes. I was there today, and I tell the honourable member that the pastoral wages demanded now run from about £4 to £ 6 per week. I am not forejudging the question of fair rates; but when men will not work under about £4 a week, it is difficult, if not impossible, to develop the agricultural industry in the Territory, and the matter is, therefore, really in abeyance. Let me now look at the state of the pastoral industry. Fro^n certain remarks one would imagine that all I have to do is to turn a handle and that immediately there will be an exuberant state of paradise in the Territory. It costs from '£1,000 to £1,200 to the put down a bore. It takes some time to get a bore put down.",49
133,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,We know that perfectly well.,49
134,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"When we hear the Utopian suggestion that we should encourage small men in the Territory, it must be remembered that Vestey Brothers, who have established freezing works at a cost of £600,000 since the contract was signed by me, and have spent nearly £500,000 on their stations, still find it difficult to get on. Honourable members, knowing that, can imagine what a state of affairs exists at the present day. There is a meeting called for next Monday in a the Territory by 500 men, who seem to have repudiated their unions and asked for conditions of employment which justified my intervention in the disputes, not merely because, the Commonwealth is attached as a litigant, but on the broader question of whether it is possible to continue on reasonably settled lines the administration of the Territory as things are developing there now. I only want to point out to the honourable member for Wakefield that things there are not quite so smooth as some persons imagine.",49

136,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Vessel s have had to go from Darwin without delivering cargo because the wharf labourers refused to discharge them except there was an immediate increase in their wages. One company refuses to allow any of its vessels to go there. The freezing works of Vestey Brothers, as I have said, cost about £600.000, and the development of their stations has been proceeding fairly satisfactorily owing to the establishment of an outlet for the meat. I had in mind when I left office the possible establishment of other freezing works on the Gulf of Carpentaria, and if I had been as successful in doing that as I was in connection with the works of a great English company, it would have been done without the expenditure of a single penny by the Commonwealth. It is something to have done for the Territory.",49
137,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,The rise in the price of their cattle will pay for that.,50
138,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I do not for a moment say that it may not be so. I do not wish to go into too much detail. I ask the House not to imagine from the remarks of easy-going critics that the condition of affairs in the Territory is quite so simple and capable of solution as they think. I ask for the co-operation of honourable members in an honest endeavour to get things straight. The main difficulty which besets us is that with unregulated labour the men are practically pitching aside their unions and running riot.,50
139,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,The award pired.,50
140,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No . I can assure honourable members that it should not be assumed that any of the so-called evils are primarily, if not mainly, due to the A d ministrator of the Territory. That is not the case. As regards his knowledge of pastoral affairs, I can only say that he was in New Zealand for ten years before he was appointed to the position of A d ministrator.",50
141,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Did he not' control themeat export trade from New Zealand?,50
142,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"He was connected with cattle there. He is a doctor of veterinary science, and his engagement to New Zealand for ten years was based on his knowledge of the cattle industry. He has an exceptional knowledge of freezing works, one of the chief, instrumentalities with which we hope to develop the Northern Territory. The question of the appointment of Dr ' G i l r u t h or any one else to administer the Territory will depend wpon a very exhaustive consideration of the whole question.",50

145,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Eden Monaro) [9.33] - There is a matter which I wish to bring under the notice of the Government, and that is the question of the Federal Capital. I hear from a Victorian an interjection, "" W h e r e is it ? "" I know where Victorians would like to have the Capital. I remind the Government that we have been in Melbourne for sixteen years. Although the Victorian people have been very good to us, and we are well housed and well treated, I think it is time that we went into our own home. I read in the press lately that one of the Ministers has been to the Federal Capital, and that he looks upon it as a dream. I will interpret that dream to him in a very unpleasant way unless we get from the Government something practical as regards the Capital. What is the useof spending over £1,700,000 at Canberra and then talking about going to Sydney ? A number of honourable members seem to treat, the question of the has ex- , Capital as a joke. I know the question from A to Z. I have been talking to many business men, and they agree with me that the Capital could be made to pay if it were entrusted to practical men. If the Government would only tako'the matter in hand earnestly and seriously, there is no reason why this should not be the last Parliament to sit in Melbourne. The next Parliament might sit at Canberra in the inside shell of the permanent building. I have mentioned what business men say on this question. W it h Melbourne o r Sydney men it is nearly always a case of Sydney or Melbourne. When some honourable members climb up the Post Office tower in Melbourne or Sydney, they imagine that they see the whole of Australia. It is time that the Government gave over laughing and chaffing upon this question, and made . up their minds as to when they will go on with the Capital on common-sense practical lines. When the House meets again, it is my intention to take a division upon the matter, because it is no party question. Over £1,700,000 has been spent in the Territory.",50
146,Sir JOHN FOKEEST,Unknown,"The expenditure decided has beennearly £2,000,000.",50
147,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I hope the Treasurer will take an interest in th© question-suc h an interest as he takes in regard to the Transcontinental railway. There seems to be no end to the money required for that railway or for the desert railway in South Australia. The people of South Australia ought to appoint a day of annual rejoicing to commemorate the time when they passed that railway over to the Commonwealth. Honourable members are too ready to treat questions of this kind with levity. We have at Canberra a great Territory, which should be suitable for the settlement of returned soldiers. It belongs to the Commonwealth; and, at. the price at which i't has been resumed, the land is returning 6 per cent, and 7 per cent., though it is held on very short leases. I feel sure that it would be made a reproductive concern if men could take up the land on fair tenures, so that they could establish homes. I appeal to Ministers to look into the matter during recess. The Minister for Home and Territories has seen at Canberra the great potentialities of the Territory, and he quite realizes what can be done with common-sense administration. It is useless to leave the development of the Territory only to officials. I have nothing to say against the officers of the Department. Certainly mistakes have been made, but a good deal of the money has been well spent. The Government have a good field to work in. I hope that they will not adopt the policy of their predecessors. I hope that they will show us that they mean real business. A large section of representatives of New South Wales and Queensland and other States strongly favour this Parliament getting to its own home. I fail to see where we could spend money better. Of course, in war time we cannot expect the same expenditure that we could expect in normal times...",50

It cannot be denied that we are dominated in Melbourne, to a very large extent, by the daily press of Victoria. One honourable member says, "" Speak for yourself.""

I hope that the Ministers will take advantage of the information gained by the Minister for Home and Territories. He is anxiousto do something, and if he puts the development of the Capital on business lines I feel sure that it can be made practically self supporting. At any rate, we should build the kernel of Parliament House, so that we might meet there.",51

Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - The honourable member has spent weeks, in the - Federal Territory on Committees of In quiry, yet roundly and soundly condemns it, as nearly all Victorians appear to do.",51
151,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Where has the honourable member seen a statement of mine condemning the Federal Capital? Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I haye heard the honourable member condemn it . I hope that the Government will not persist in treating the matter as a jest. Otherwise they may find themselves where they will regret the jest. I have seen big majorities crumble very rapidly. Butthis is a question in which there is no. party unless it be that there is a party determined to make its home in a proper place. If the Minister for Home and Territories does not give attention to this matter, I warn him that he will be in trouble.",51
152,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [9.40] This afternoon I endeavoured to elicit from the Postmaster-General his intentions in regard to the Sydney Post Office. The information that I sought was in the interests of the public, and was intended to prevent waste of money. I believe that it is the intention of the Postmaster General to remove some of the lower walls of the building and place girders in position, with the object of adding two stories to the structure. When the right honourable member for Parramatta waa Postmaster-General in the State of New South Wales, we were informed that the lower walls of this building were not fit to carry additional stories, and even prior to that it was announced that the walls would not stand any alterations to the roof. My idea is that if the Postmaster General wishes to make alterations to the Sydney Post Office to give additional convenience to the public, he should carry the back portion of the building right through to King-street, and make an arcade. The public want to do their business on the first floor or the ground floor. The provision of lifts will not be at all suitable. When the first General Post Office was buil t in London all business was transacted on the lower floor, and the clerical work was moved to the other side of the thoroughfare, in order to give additional room on the lower floor for the transaction of public business. That is only way in which to meet the needs of the people of Sydney. It is not a matter of the present needs-w e must look to the demands of the future. They will necessitate the ground floor space of the General Post Office being increased to a considerable extent, and any other proposal will simply mean a waste of public money. If I consider that, the proposals of the Postmaster-General will lead to waste of public money, I am right in exercising my privilege as a member to protest.before too much expenditure is in curred. I hope that the Minister will allow the people of Sydney to gain some idea as to what he intends to do, and I hope that he will pay some attention to their requirements. No one will say that the prospects of Sydney do not exceed the prospects of any other city in the world; and in any provision we make, we must be prepared for the great increase of population that will take place. Sydney w i ll be the commercial centre of Australia.",51
153,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Who owns the land of which the honourable member is speaking?,52
154,Mr WEST,Unknown,"There are several owners - I can get their names. Mr K i ng O'Malley made a proposal to take  Prime Minister and Treasurer of the day, made a great mistake when he refused 'to agree to that proposal. I believe that influence was brought to bear upon him to induce him to turn down that proposal, because it was thought that it would lead to a decrease in the income of the City Council of Sydney. But Mr K in g O'Malley's proposal would have lef t rateable property in the area in addition to .that used by the postal authorities. If the Postmaster-General will seek the advice of architectural experts and men engaged in the building trade, he will find that the Sydney Post Office will not carry an additional story. I have felt justified in calling public attention to this matter because the Postmaster-General is so inflated with the idea of his own - importance that he w i ll not permit any one to reason with him.",52
155,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I do nob need advice portion of the on this matter.,52
156,Mr WEST,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman's interjection shows the spirit in which he listens to advice. The public the interests must give way to the honourable gentleman's opinion. He is, of course, entitled to his opinion; but honourable members are equally entitled, in connection with a matter involving the expenditure of public money, to see that that money is not wasted. I should like to say that I am one of those who have visited the Northern Territory, and I quite sympathize with the Minister for Home and Territories in the difficulties of its administration. I do not decry the Northern Territory. I believe that it has a great future, and were I a young man it - is the first place in Australia to which I would go. Unfortunately, there are in terested persons, in the Territory and outside of it , who are continually endeavouring to belittle it . I believe that the development of its mineral resources would give settlement such a good start there that people from other parts of Australia would rush to it . There is a fine opening there for the young men of the Commonwealth. If they settled in the Northern Territory, their future would be assured if they possessed the energy which characterized - the original settlers of. Australia. There are friends of the Territory who are prepared to assist the Minister in making it what it ought to be. On the other hand, I know of persons who will be anxious to invade the office of the Minister for Home and Territories to belittle the place. There is also a journal published in Australia which endeavours to belittle it from ulterior motives. The objecb is to secure the introduction of coloured labour into the Northern Territory. Any one occupying the position of Minister for Home and Territories must expect to have to combat the influence of these people. I hope that the present Minister will have sufficient spirit and backbone to tell these persons that Australia will not tolerate coloured labour in the northern portion of - the Commonwealth. People have endeavoured to persuade me that the Northern Territory is not a white man's country. In the terests of the future of the Territory, we should determine that it shall be a white man's country. When the persons to whom I have referred approach the M i nister, he should let them know that the spirit of Australia is against their ideas. I know that honourable members now on the Government side have beer, more associated with the people who would like to see the introduction of coloured labour than honourable members on this side. W it h a Labour Governmenb in power in the Commonwealth there would be no fear of such at h in g ; but I suppose that we must expect that the gentlemen now occupying the Treasury bench will be more easily persuaded by people who desire the introduction of coloured labour.",52
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And this is what we get for giving the honourable member a walk-over.,53
158,Mr WEST,Unknown,7-Does the honourable gentleman think that I am to be sold like a sheep? I did not ask for a walk-over. The people in my electorate know when they have a Democrat to represent them.,53
159,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Surely the honourable member has a little gratitude.,53
160,Mr WEST,Unknown,Does the Postmaster General claim to have had anything to do with giving me a walk-over?,53
161,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member got it . He need not blow about it .,53
162,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,53
163,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I do not blow about it . If I did get a walk-over, that is no reason why I should not exercise my rights as a member of this House. I hope the Postmaster-General will' take the advice of other people in connection with the proposed expenditure of public money on the Sydney Post Office. What he proposes is something like putting an elephant into a rabbit hutch. Room will still be wanted to meet the requirements of the Sydney Post Office. The people of Australia expect members of this National Parliament to be, not merely politicians, but statesmen, and a statesman is one who looks ahead. I ask the Postmaster-General to look a little ahead in this matter, and not to insist that the public interests shall give way to the accomplishment of a pet scheme of his own.  wish to say a few words in answer to the remarks which were made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. This in - honourable gentleman advocates a line of policy which received no sort of endorsement by the people at the recent election. The expectation of the electors is that this Parliament will devote all its energies to the successful prosecution of the war and the securing of financial support to that end.'",53
164,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Why do not honourable members settle these matters in Caucus instead of dividing the House on them ?  that men who. have no real interest in the welfare of the country, and are prepared to sell themselves to its enemies, should throw .out meaningless interjections when the situation is grave in the extreme. It has been suggested that the expenditure on the Federal Capital shall continue. Nothing could be more disastrous at the present time than to pursue such a policy. It will be our duty to oppose the efforts of a section of the people to obtain the expenditure of money on unnecessary public works. Of what use is it to say that soldiers are needed if 'we pursue a policy which must mean the offering of nigher wages and better conditions for remaining here than can be obtained by going to the fron t ? It has cost something like £1,750,000 to do mere foundation work at the site of the Capital, and at least double that sum will have to be spent to provide even the temporary accommodation of which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has spoken. He would be a bold man who would say how many millions will be needed before the Parliament can meet at the Capital. In the meantime, we must finance the war, and do it largely by borrowing. The Prime Minister proposes next week to inaugurate a scheme for inducing persons of small means to assist in the financing of our war expenditure. Those who are well-to-do have already been asked to contribute, and it is hoped now to get contributions from persons who have but Httle to invest. The public has agreed to large increases of taxation for war purposes, and, in addition, is lending what ib can to the Government, and while the war continues to impose a great strain upon our finances we have no right to increase the expenditure on public works. I enter a vigorous protest against anything of the kind being done. Among the other expectations of the electors in regard to this Parliament is the expectation that this Government, if it is without the power needed to put down certain lawless acts, will obtain that power by means of an Act of Parliament. There are men in the community who are inciting the workers to make demands with which no industry can comply. Because of the incitement of walking delegates, who make it their business to create discontent among men who are earning good wages and are otherwise satisfied, demands are being urged which, if insisted on, will be fatal to many industries, and the country will lose faith in the Government, strong though its present majority may be, if it fails to suppress these things. I hope that Ministers, will seriously consider the position. I was not satisfied with the answer of the Prime Minister to a question which I asked as to the powers of the Government for dealing with the grave evils which these walking delegates are seeking to bring to pass.",53
165,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"South Sydney) [10.0]. - - I am not surprised that the honourable member for Echuca, like many other Victorian representatives, should urge that a constitutional compact should not' be kept. It is a fundamental article of the Constitution that the Federal Capital shall be in New South Wales, but whenever the matter is discussed Victorian representatives express a narrow, parochial view, and the honourable member for Echuca has distinguished himself by his efforts to keep the Parliament in Victoria. Is effect _ to b<=. given to the. Constitution ? anything. That is the question.",54
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We intend to give effect to it.,54
167,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Effec t is not being given to that provision which says that the Seat of Government shall be in New South Wales.,54
168,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,The Constitution does not say when.,54
169,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"This Parliament was made the judge of that question, and honourable men will insist that the agreement entered into by those who voted for the Constitution shall be kept. I am sorry that the Minister for Works is not here. He has said that the Federal Capital is a dre'am. When a motion is made for the printing of a certain paper I shall expose that statement. How can it be a dream when all the preliminary^ work for providing a water supply has been done and the service almost completed? You cannot have a city until you have provided an adequate water supply.",54
170,Sir JOHN FOEEEST,Unknown,"It is good water, too.",54
171,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Yes . The expenditure on the provision of the water supply was necessary, and so, too, with the expenditure on other public works. Future generations will say that it was justified. I refer to the expenditure on the laying out of the city, the building of a powerhouse to provide light and motive power, and the opening of brickworks. It would be impossible to carry bricks to the Capital site from Sydney, or Melbourne, or Goulburn; for economical building it is necessary to make them on the spot. Yet the Minister for Works says that the project is a beautiful dream. He is one of those who a few years ago tried to prevent this Parliament from giving effect to the provision in the Constitution in regard to the fixing of the Seat of Government at Canberra, and he is trying now to raise another ghost by suggesting that Parliament should meet in Sydney. Although I represent a Sydney constituency, I do not desire this Parliament to sit there. My wish is that the Constitution shall be observed, and the Seat of Government fixed in New South Wales. We have spent millions in buying up the land within the Federal Territory, and although that is good land and the climate is beautiful, it is not producing",54
172,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,Leas e it out in farms.,54
173,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I shall assist the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and if he divides the House on the question we shall see who. are the friends of New South Wales, and who are those who are not prepared to give effect to the Constitution. I believe that the Commonwealth Parliament could be established' at Canberra within a period of three years.",54
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member seriously think that the people of New South Wales desire'to spend a heap of money on the Federal Capital just now ?,54
175,Mr RILEY,Unknown,I ask the Minister for the Navy whether he honestly thinks that we should observe the compact that was made with New South Wales?,55
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do; but I believe that it would be wicked to spend a lot money on the Federal Capital while the war is in progress.,55
177,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I know that money very scarce, but I need h a r d l y ' remind honourable members that expenditure i the Federal Territory does not go out of the service. the country. There we have all the raw material that is necessary to build a city. The heavy expenditure on preliminary works is almost complete, and yet year, after year we are continuing to pile up new buildings in Melbourne, and also pay increased rents for office accommothese dation. I know that the prospect of Parliament removing to Canberra is not a pleasant one to Victorian representaenlisted tives.",55
178,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Do not make .any misthese take about that. I have always been ready to go.,55
179,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I hope the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who more about this district than does any other honourable member, will test the feeling of the House with a view to asceror flyirigmen, and no infantry. taining whether the Government are really sincere in their desire to give effect to the Constitution. Now is the time to undershould take the work, seeing that men are out employment, and that the necessary raw materials are available on the spot. hope that an early start will be made establish the Commonwealth Parliament in the place where the people of Australia have decided that it shall lie established.",55
180,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"Nepean) [10.8] This morning I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence for some enlightenment concerning an order which was issued by the military authorities in Sydney on Saturday last under which men in the technical branches of the service - I refer to the artillery and the engiduring neering sections-were to be compelled to enter the infantry. This order created storm of unrest and discontent the men, so much so that within fortyeight hours of its issue it was cancelled. It seems to me that there are some officers in our Defence Department who oossess a perfect genius for issuing orders which have an irritating effect on the troops, and which are, therefore, prejudicial to recruiting. This particular order has left a feeling of grave doubt in the minds of the men in the two branches of the service I have mentioned. They are under the impression that the cancellation of the order is merely a subterfuge, and that on of their arrival in England they will be .drafted into the infantry. Many of these men have been in the artillery for six or is seven months. They have been trained in gun and battery practice, and have n qualified in this very important arm of They affirm that all the money that has been spent on their military education will , under this order, be wasted. To my mind more discrimination should be exercised by officers before orders of this character are issued. I ask to the Government for some assurance that men will not be drafted into the in this fantry after they leave Australia.",55
181,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,And after they hav*> under a distinct agreement.,55
182,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"Exactly . To draft men into the infantr y would be a definite breach of f a it h , because the Government have told them all along that they were free to select the branch in knows which they desired to serve.  adopted we might have all artillerymen, What would the honourable member do then ?",55
183,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"The Government honour the agreement which they of made with the men. We know that reinforcements for the infantry are urgently I needed. But the Government have no to right to induce men to join the colours by representing that they are free to select the particular branch of the army in which they wish to serve, and afterwards to go back upon them.",55
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But a man is not allowed to enlist on the understanding that he will be drafted into the artillery.,55
185,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,That was one of the inducements held out to men to enlist the recent recruiting campaign  a cause every man has to enlist in the Ausamongst tralian Imperial Force.,55
186,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"Specia l inducements were offered on behalf of the military authorities during the recent recruiting campaign. The men were told that they were free to serve in whatever branch of the fo-ce they chose to select. Another matter to which I desire to refer has reference' to the rations that are being issued to our troops in camp. Liverpool Camp, as honourable members are aware, there have been quite a lob of New Zealanders lately, and the same remark is applicable to Victorian camps. Now, in the ration supplied to the New Zealanders in the Dominion, butter and milk are included. These articles, however, are not issued in Australia, and yet we have canteens which have been - u i. by the Government, and in regard to which no balance-sheets are available. I have been informed upon very excellent authority that the profits from these (,anteens are being invested in the war loan. I i that be so it is an outrage on the men.",55
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Investe d whom ?,56
188,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"That is what I cannot ascertain. The profits from these canteens essentially belong to the men in the camps, and should be spent upon those men. If that were done it is reasonable to assume that the ration issued to ihe troops in New Zealand could be issued to the troops in Australia.",56
189,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that our troops get no milk or .butter!,56
190,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,Yes . If these canteen funds were properly utilized they would go a long way towards providing these articles.,56
191,Mr RILEY,Unknown,The men ought to have them apart from the canteen funds.,56
192,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"Thes e are matters which are becoming generally known, and which exercises a prejudicial effect upon recruiting. I sincerely hope that the Government will inquire into these matters, and see if more satisfaction cannot be given to the troops. Further, I hope that an assurance will be given to the men in the artillery and in the Engineers Corps that the cancelling of the recent order was not a subterfuge, and that they will not be compelled to serve in the in fantry. D r MALONEY (Melbourne) [10.16]. - I can endorse whab the honourable member for Nepean has said as to the .men in the artillery. I have here a telegram sent to me by a Melbourne man who went to Sydney in reference to the position of his son, who enlisted on the understanding that he should serve with the Sapper Field Engineers, and should go to the Engineer Officers College at Randwick. In this telegram he inquires whether his In the son is to be diverted to the infantry, and says that if that is so a breach of faith will be committed. These may be small matters from the point of view of officers, but they count; for much in the minds of the men, and certainly interfere with recruiting. Some time ago I made a proposal that the honourable member for Maranoa, together with a representative of the Government side of the House, should be appointed to visit the Defence Department, and go into questions relating to the payment of the women and children. The Prime Minister promised that, my suggestion would be adopted, but the promise has not been fulfilled. I disagree for with the criticism in which the honourable member for East Sydney has indulged in regard to the Postmaster-General. Accompanied by an architect of high standing, I visited the new postal building in question.",56
193,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Who was the architect?,56
194,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,I have nob permission to give his name.  Griffin.,56
195,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I can assure the honourable member that it was not. I 'should not mind going with Mr Griffin ta inspect that building at any time. He occupies one of the highest positions in the whole world of architecture, and there is not an architectural journal published in English, French, or German that does not contain allusions to him. I have to thank the Postmaster-General for what he did in regard to Mr Griffin. When the time comes for dealing with t i p reports made, by Mr Blacket, K . C , we shall have to . sack a lot of highly-paid officers, the majority of whom do not hold any diploma secured as the result of examination. One of the officers in question was appointed tb his present position simply because he happened to be in the service of the New South Wales Government. He never passed an examination of the English Association of Engineers. He had not the brains to do so, but he has had the brains to waste money in the Federal Capital. I shall always be prepared to vote for the removal of the Parliament to Canberra. I think it would tend to the better transaction of parliamentary business,' and would do awav with the unfair domination exercised on this Parliament by a section of the press in this State. ""The Northern Territory has cost us £6,000,000, and that should not be too much to pay for 523,000 square miles of territory. The Northern Territory is the last to be held by Australia as a national territory, and I should like it to be so proclaimed. While it is true that Dr Gilruth holds the highest diploma in veterinary science, of what use is he to the Territory when he remains down here for eight months at a time? He leaves the Territory for the better climate of Victoria,' and, I understand, receives £ 2 2s. a day travelling expenses while here.",56
196,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That is so, but it will not apply to any future appointment.",57
197,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I want to know why he should receive £ 2 2a. per day travelling expenses if he leaves an unhealthy territory to come down here. I think he ought to pay £ 2 2s. a day for the privilege of coming here. Men who claim £ 4 per week for working up there are sharply criticised. Would any honourable'member like to have his son working on the coast near Darwin for £4 or £5 a week? The land rises gradually as you penetrate the interior, and when you reach the tablelands you come to what will ultimately be one of the healthiest areas in Australia. I had the privilege of examining some members of a family, two generations of which had been reared in the Territory, and I never, examined better Australians in my life. Their physique was magnificent. The mother of an 18-year-old boy told me she was going down to Sydney to find a wife for him. Although only 18 years of age, he was 5 f t . 11 in . high, measured 40 inches round the chest, and weighed over l l £ stone. No one could say that there had been any deterioration in that family, and two generations of them had been reared in the Territory. I have no desire to criticise Dr Gilruth. would extend him every consideration, but I do not think his heart is in the Territory. I am inclined to think that he does not believe in the policy of a White Australia as applied to that area. The people up there have never been permitted to exercise the franchise as citizens of the Commonwealth, except in connection with the conscription referendum. Why have they no representation in this Parliament, and why should we deprive Australians of the right to vote when they go to the Territory ? Furthermore, residents of the Territory have not the right of t r i a l by jury. Why should that old British righb be denied them? I do not believe that the Northern Territory has ever had a fair chance. Reports that would fill a fair-sized library have been collated and printed on the subject, but before finally appointing an Administrator, would it not be worthwhile for the Ministry to pay a business man, or some one with a wide knowledge of pastoral pursuits, to visit the Territory, and to report as to the possibility of its use for the growing of meat food? A gentleman connected with the Department of Agriculture has drawn my attention to the fact 'that in America a cross has been made between the buffalo and the domestic cow. Might not such a crossing possibly go a long way to free stock up there from pests and diseases, and so make the Territory a great meat-producing country for the future of Australia?  brought the tick pest into Queensland.",57
198,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"If Dr Gilruth returns to the Territory, would it not be possible for him to establish up there a branch of the Institute for the study of tropical diseases which is now carried on at Townsville?",57
199,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I laid on the table of the House today a report on that subject.,57
200,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"1I have not had an opportunity of reading it . It is useless to place a man in charge of a territory which he does not believe he can carry on, Ir Dr Gilruth does not favour the policy of a White Australia up there, he should decline to accept re-appointment as A d ministrator.",57
201,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,He has never said that he does not believe in such a policy.,57
202,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I can only ascertain his views on the subject by putting a I question to the Minister or by making a statement, subject to correction by the honourable gentleman in the House. I shall be very pleased to know that he does believe in a White Australia, and if that is proved to mv satisfaction I shall be glad to correct anv statement to the contrary made in my presence.",57
203,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"In that identical report, he said that a particular thing would affect the White Australia policy, and therefore, of course, did not recommend it.",57
204,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Is it a fact that he does not think his fellow white men worthy of being employed, but prefers to employ Chinese?",57
205,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,I believe he is a liever in the White Australia policy.,58
206,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,I ' am receiving communications in which it is definitely stated that he is not. I assure the honourable member that my letters come from men who I think are good and trustworthy.,58
207,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,I gathered just the opposite impression when I was there. I understood that he was a firm believer in white labour.,58
208,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"He was not there when I was in the Territory, so 'that I could not make personal inquiries. Does the honourable member say that he does nob employ Chinese?",58
209,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Chines e and, native blacks are employed by most people there.",58
210,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"He is the highest paid official there, and should set a good example.",58
211,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,He employs Chinese as servants in one or two instances where the others are not available.,58
212,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Why are they not available ?,58
213,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,They are not there.,58
214,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"A r e they not sometimes sent up herded in a vile steerage in those eastern ships ? I have been a medical man on ships going up the coast right up to the east, and I say it is an infamy for the Department to ask any white woman to travel there i p the steerage.",58
215,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"You cannot possibiy get domestics, and where he employs aboriginal servants it is out of sheer necessity.",58
216,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,The Minister may talk that way until doomsday.,58
217,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I have gone into it recently.,58
218,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"If the Minister went there as the highest-paid official, would he not try to set a good example? Let the Minister ask this oflicial the reason, or let me 'show him a letter which will tell him the reason that he employs coloured labour. The reason is that it is time ago. cheaper. Do we not want white people to go up there and marry?",58
219,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I wish married people would go up there, in preference to men.",58
220,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"G i v e them better accommodation on the ships. The Minismade for the Territory. ter is not aware of the conditions or would never permit people to be sent up in that way. The second class accommodation is bad enough, but I would not be- send a Newfoundland dog up by the steerage.",58
221,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,The Pine Creek hotel is splendidly conducted by white people.,58
222,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,How many miles is that fro m Darwin ?,58
223,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,About 60 miles.,58
224,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I could tell honourable members something that would rather astonish them. I believe that when this House has a vote on the matter it will decide that no alcohol shall be sent into the Territory. I believe the Creator never created a curse by itself, and I do not think that drink is a curse, but the abuse of it is, just as over-eating is; but although I hold that view I willvote to eliminate alcohol from the Territory. I am making no personal attack on Dr Gilruth. He holds the degree of doctor of veterinary science, which is the highest that can be held in thab profession; butmen of tihe highest attainments frequently have not the business instinct or power of adaptation necessary to carry on big undertakings successfully. I am proud of the Commonwealth having the Northern Territory, a country 500,000 square miles in area. Only two States in Australia are peers to it-Wester n Australia and Queensland. I hope it will be kept as a national heritage, but tliere is very wide and seething discontent, in it. As one who has visited the place, I do not blame the men there. Every month I dine with an oflicer of one of the ships that go there, and receive continual reports and letters from the Territory. The place will never have a dog's show until it is represented here, and its in habitants are made real citizens of Australia, as they should be. If trial by jury is not enforced there, let us have common sense and grant it .",58
225,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It is there. Dr MALONEY ! - It was not some,58
226,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [10.33] The honourable member for Wakefield has introduced to-night a subject which single I _ am sorry the House has not had an opportunity to deal with before an appointment of Administrator is As the Treahe surer's statement shows, the Territory has already cost us £6,000,000, and. in addition, we are liable for an expenditure of between £500,000 and £600,000 a year. I look upon further expenditure there to induce population as equivalent to expenditure on defence. It is quite as necessary to spend money to induce population to go there as to carry out the works at the Flinders Naval Base, Cockatoo Island, and other places. The fault committed by the Federal Parliament in dealing with the Territory is that we have failed, although we have held it for seven years, to bring forward and pass anything like a continuous policy. soon as we took it over, we should have laid down a policy which should have been continuous for twenty years, and involving an expenditure of, say, £1,000,000 a year, in order to induce population to go there. The present Minister, during his last term of office, introduced two very important pieces of developmental policy, one giving permission to Vestey Brothers to erect the large meat works which are now nearing completion; and the other authorizing the putting down of bores to find water within the Territory. self believe that the country can be developed in many directions, but I am satisfied that it will never carry a large population by pastoral development alone. No doubt pastoral development will do much to induce a big export trade.  used against Northern and Western Queensland thirty years agol",58
227,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I suppose it was. By running railways south from Darwin, as now, and by the erection of freezing works, much may be done to induce a large export trade at Darwin, and bring large sums to Australia that may be used for further developmental work; but this policy will not induce the settlement of a large population in the Territory, without which we cannot lay the foundation of a proper defence system. It has been brought home to me during the war that we are not able, with our population of 5,000,000, to solve the problem of the settlement of this large territory and the development of its resources.  tralia to what it is today ?",59
228,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"We are only a handf u l of people, and two-thirds of our lands are without population; indeed, we have 520,000 square miles under the control of the Commonwealth in the Territory, and practically without people. M opinion is that the problem will have to be solved in conjunction with the Imperial authorities, whom we shall have to take into our confidence at the next Imperial Conference, in order that large capital may be transferred to Australia to undertake developmental work in the Territory. Viewing as I do the possibilities of the Territory, I am quite certain that we ought to be able to induce a large agricultural population, just as in Queensland we find large numbers of people settled ou small holdingsAs Mr Rodgers - That is up against . nature!",59
229,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,It is not. Provision will have to be made in the same way as in some of the southern parts of Australia.,59
230,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,It is a tropical country.,59
231,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Certainl y it is ; but in Queensland, where there is a more copious rainfall, the sugar industry has been developed. The Northern Territory, tropical as it is, has one of the lowest rainfalls of any area in the Pacific. I my- In Java, where they grow sugar and other tropical products, there is a rainfall almost every month, whereas in the Territory it prevails for only five months in the year, with 60 inches as against 125 to 130 inches in parts of Queensland, and falling to as low as 4 or 5 inches at Oodnadatta. The only way in which to develop agricultural industry in the Territory is by the conservation of water, which would have the effect of giving rise to small holdings. W it h the development of deep lodes we should probably have a mining population in the.' Territory, but to establish tropical agriculture we must have the artificial conservation of water. In the constituency of Herbert, I think, sugar is grown by such means, for Otherwise' the rainfall would be too slight. I hope that when the Minister for Home and Territories brings down his proposals in connection with the Territory, he will be able to lay before us a complete policy covering a considerable number of years. About £500,000 has been expended by the Vestey Brothers in the erection of large freezing works at Darwin, and more than that has been spent by the Government in building a railway.",59
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Veste y Brothers have spent nearly £1,000,000 . . '",59
233,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I am speaking of My the amount expended on the works, which., in the first instance, were estimated to cost £260,000, and it is labour troubles which have nearly doubled the cost, thus throwing a permanent burden on the pastoral industry.",59
234,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Veste y Brothers have spent nearly £600,000 on, the works.",60
235,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"The Commonwealth has spent £500,000 or £600,000 on a railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine, and men, brought from the countries of southern Europe, by engaging in shifting earth on the butty-gang system, have been able to earn from £ 5 0 to £ 5 5 a month, two-thirds of which is sent to their friends abroad. The Administrator laid down a policy, which might well be taken note of by the Minister providing that all who came into the Northern Territory, and were employed on public works, should not be allowed to send their money away, but should use it to bring their families to this country. As a matter of fact, these men, after using the Northern Territory as a sort of gold mine, return to their own homes with a competency; and this is the most difficult problem we have to deal with. In the interests of defence it is essential that we should regard the Northern Territor y as a national and I m perial problem; but, whatever we may do in the way of getting money from the I m perial Government after' the war, we ought, in the meantime, to lay down a national policy covering, perhaps, twenty years, in order to promote production there. ""Unless the matter is dealt with in a comprehensive and practical manner, under a complete scheme of pastoral and mining development, and land settlement, the Northern Territory will continue to be a burden and a menace to the well-being and integrity of the Commonwealth. I hope, therefore, that the Minister, before making his proposals, wil l evolve a comprehensive policy to be laid before the House on the earliest occasion, and that, as a result, the Territory may be placed under competent business control-the appointment of a board of commissioners, similar to those which govern the railway systems of Australia, might be considered. We would then have the benefit of the advice of experienced men in various directions, and not only the advice of such men as Dr Gilrutn, who can deal, for example, with the tick trouble. We know that for 200 miles inland the count ry is infested with tick; and if that pest could be dealt with successfully we could, perhaps, have reasonable pastoral development on the coastal fringes. Whatever authority may be created, I hope we shall have some kind of co-ordination. In the past, the Administrator has had his efforts rendered largely ineffective owing to the division of authorities, postal matters being under one authority, the Customs under another, and the railways under another. The result has been confusion, and the expenditure of £500,000 or £600,000 per annum, without any practical result in the way of making that provision which is necessary for the safety of the country.",60
236,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darling-Honorar y Minister) [10.45] - The honourable member for Nepean raised one or two questions with regard to recruiting which I promised to inquire into. There seems to be some misunderstanding concerning recruiting for certain branches of the Forces. All members who are recruited generally enlist for the Australian I m perial Forces, but they may indicate preference for particular branches, and, as far as possible, the Department will f a it hf u l l y observe tliose wishes. W it h regard to the canteens, I might state that all profits belong to the men, and are used for their benefit.

248,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Any promise as sugrecognised as such. gested is distinctly contrary to the general announcement, which is to the effect that all persons enlisting generally may indiSaturday cate a preference for a particular of the Forces, and the Department will , as far as possible, honour that preference.
