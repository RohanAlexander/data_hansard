At the I think that the budget and, indeed, the budget way in which the coalition government and the I will quickly go to a snapshot of perhaps urer's speech and that of the Leader of the Opposition be able to see those differences. The coalition problems associated with Medicare and bulk-billing, for concession card holders would be funded, looked to reduce the funds to hospitals by bulk-billing have shown a failure on the part the funds needed for public hospitals. The fact is that there is no doubt that, as fewer doctors that bulk-bill.

I think one would immediately government, in looking to redress the critical have looked to ensure that bulk-billing but, having done that on one hand, they have the same amount. So even their efforts to fund of the government by stealing, effectively, from a result of the government's policies, there are family with an income over $32,000-those of the government effectively will mean that NA bulk-billing will end. Clearly, there is no families to have universal health care. If you contrast that sort of approach with you can clearly see the difference. Labor did also lift the Medicare rebate for all bulk-billed cent of the scheduled fee. That is a fundamental government with respect to bulk-billing. We would provide greater incentives, as outlined, made by the government. We would certainly suppose there is no surprise there. The one thing tionally held a very strong, unequivocal view the early seventies, and it has built upon it essentially, in the way in which Labor governments, have addressed this issue-and you can compare have addressed it. The fact is that if you look at access to election of the Hawke government-to 1996 ernments, you see a steady incline in access progress, spreading universal access to bulk-billing as possible. Conversely, if you look from 2 have to say that this is not as a result of purely that the government would like to call upon this is a systemic decline, and it is as a result health in this country.

In my own electorate, I have spoken to yond the outer metropolitan ring in Gisborne, culty finding doctors who will bulk-bill.

I the electorate knows is that Labor has tradion a universal health system. It has done since since that period. You can see a cause and effect, historically, since the early seventies, it to the way in which coalition governments bulk-billing under Medicare from 1983-from the and the end of 13 years of rule by Labor govto bulk-billing-not a fall, but an incremental to as many needy and deserving families May 1996 until now, you see a steady decline.

They are the most vulnerable government wants to increase patient copayments something we will not accept. Then we hear about in providing $4 a week-a couple of coins health or education, but a lousy $4 a week for Not only do we know that $4 is an insulting aware that it does not even cover the bracket ment that has no regard for families and has cut. It certainly does not compensate for the everyday lives.

I do not know whether I would not been for the policies introduced in the early and perhaps the Minister for Education, Science either.
