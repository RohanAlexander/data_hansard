1,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I wish to know, Mr Speaker, whether it is a fact that married man is employed by the Commonnotice-paper wealth in our Parliamentary Refreshment Room, at the magnificent wage of 35s. a week? If that is so, will you take into so, when? consideration the advisability of paying a decent wage? I should like the House to be informed what rates are paid to the other waiters.",14
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am not aware that will be resumed. the rate of wage mentioned is being paid to any one in the refreshment room. minimum rate was settled during the first Parliament. I shall make inquiries, and ascertain what the facts are. Later,",14
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have made inquiries, and find that there is employed in connection with the Parliamentary Refreshment Room a pantryman and assistant waiter, who receive a wage of 35s. a week, and works on the average forty-nine and a half hours per week. The wages paid outside for similar work are from 20s. to 25s. per week, and under the Factories Act the hours of labour are fifty-eight per week. Unlike all other places where such men are employed, there is no'Sunday work in connection with the Parliamentary Refreshment Room. This employee leaves the building on Saturday at noon, and is paid for the holidays on which the House does not sit.",14
4,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Is he paid during the recess ?,14
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"No ; he is a temporary employee. Whilst on duty he is provided with meals without, charge. I have obtained the greater part of this information from the association in Melbourne to which most of these men belong, as well as from the Victorian Chief Inspector of Factories. As to the waiters, I find that they are paid £ 2 ' 2s. per week, and work the statutory hours. Waiters employed at leading hotels are paid 30s. per week, but it must not be forgotten that in such establishments there are additional means of income which are not usual in the Parliamentary Refreshment Room. waiters, if they work overtime, are paid 2s. 6d. an hour for the first hour and is. 6d. for each additional hour. I may add that I have been waited on by one of the employees and assured by him that there - is no complaint either in regard to the hours of work or rates of pay. NA (FINANCE) BILL.",14

9,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the High Commissioner Bill was introduced, it was regarded as a non-party measure, members pf all shades of political opinion being in favour of the appointment of a High Commissioner. As the Bill now stands eighth among the Orders of the Day, I should like - to know, why its consideration has been deferred. We ought to deal with it as soon as possible.",15

11,Sir JOHN QUICK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have been asked certain questions regarding the supply delivery of 20,000 telephone instruments. It is the desire of the Department that instrument and battery boxes shall be made of Australian timber, but there is no dition requiring the supply of any particular State.' The rates of wages and working conditions paid and observed by the contractors' must be those recognised in the locality in which the work is being to do so. done, and must conform to the terms of the decisions of - the Wages Boards Arbitration Court of the State, or, there is no such authority, to those of that - of the neighbouring State.",15

If so, has he considered those presentations ? Have steps been taken remove the injustice complained of? understand that it is thought that, under the present arrangement, the members of one section of the service have, by reason of their training, a better chance of comCompeting successfully than those in other sections, and a request has been made that all at this exshall be treated alike.",15

14,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Some time ago I drew the attention of the Minister of External Affairs to the allegation that batches of foreigners-chiefl y Italians and' Austrians - were landing in.Western Australia, andproceeding direct 'from the steamers in which they came to employment in different parts of the State, under circumstances suggesting that they had been brought here under contract. I ask the Minister, who promised to look into the matter, whether an inquiry has been made, and if so, what information he has to give to the House on the subject?",15
15,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In accordance with my promise, an inquiry was made, and the report J have received is that the officers of the Department have no evidence that any of the men referred to came to Australia under contract. My predecessor directed the institution of an inquiry in, I think, March last,- with the result that a similar and report was returned. TEe instruction to the Departmental officers is to be vigilant the in seeing that the Act is not evaded.",15

17,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is entitled to see the papers . if he desires BALLOT-BOXES. or Mr FULLER - Yesterday the honorwhere able member for Bass asked me whether the tenders for ballot-boxes, which have recently beencalled for, require the supply Queensland hoop pine, and prevent the use of Huon pine. I received the same day a letter from the West Coast Timber Company, pointing out that in Tasmania there is a wood in every way as suitable for the per purpose as is hoop pine. The company deof clared that in the past an export duty on rethis timber has resulted in its not being to well known in Victoria. It stated that it I was sending a small sample of the wood, and was prepared to send a larger quantity if so desired. On Wednesday a representative of the Tasmanian industry waited on the Director-General of Works, and was told that tenders for the supply of Huon pine would be considered, butjthat as the climatic conditions under which the boxes would be used would be severe, only thoroughly seasoned timber would serve. In view of the representations which have been made to me, I have had the conditions ' of tender altered, so that any pine, grown in any part of Australia, may, if found suitable, be used.",15
18,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Are tenders to be called in every State, and in various parts of each State; and are the ballot-boxes to be made and delivered in one State alone? Those are very important matters, seeing that the supply asked for is so large.",16
19,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Tender s will be invited in Australia generally for the construction of ballot-boxes. The boxes are required for use in Queensland, as it is probable that those belonging to the State will not be available at the next election. TORRES STRAIT PILOT SERVICE.",16
20,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Has the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs been called to an article in the Newsletter of the 14th instant, in which it'is alleged that the Torres Strait Pilot Service is a close preserve, and that Newcastle, Sydney, and Melbourne pilots cannot serve in the waters on the northern coast. If this is so, does the Minister consider the restriction advantageous to the Commonwealth? Will he ascertain whether the complaints which have been made are justified?",16
21,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have seen the article referred to, and, no doubt, the matter will be dealt with when the control of lighthouses, & c , is transferred to the Commonwealth. At present, pilotage is a matter which is dealt with by the States, and I understand that the Torres Strait and the Port Phillip services are close preserves. Presumably, when the Commonwealth takes control this state of things will cease. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. OVERSEA MAIL CONTRACT : TIME-TABLECASE OF MR.

32,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) ' [10.45] - I move That the following proposed new section be inserted :"" 150. No oflicer, other than officers of the Cadets, shall be promoted, except probationally, to any rank higher than that of Captain until he has passed, as prescribed, a course of practical and theoretical instruction at the Military College lo perfect him in the practice of his own arm of the Forces, and to accustom him to the uses and possibilities of other arms."" The purpose of this proposed new section is to insure that our militia officers shall have an opportunity to ^become as possible. It is only by giving them some such means as this of securing efficiency that we can prevent the creation in tralia of a military caste of permanent cers. The whole point is that if we do make our militia officers as efficient as can be made we must have them leaning perhaps the permanent adjutant or instruca tor attached to each section."" I know of nothing that would lead to a greater want of efficiency, and which would perhapsbe more harmful in its effects than the princhat ciple of having a permanent adjutant-the very antithesis of fhis proposal-doin g all the work of a militia regiment. Such ah officer is leant upon by all the officers of the regiment, and they lose their initiative and keenness, and never acquire knowledge or experience.  the darling of the regiment.",17
33,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly . The man who . will have to command the regiment in time of war is not in peace the true trainer of the regiment. Under this proposal we shall make all militia field officers truly efficient. In peace they will be capable of directing the education and training of their regiments, just as they will be charged with' the responsibility of leading them when the crisis comes. This proposal will not involve any important financial consideration, because, on the present war organization, there are only 201 majors on the list, in addition to nineteen majors on the reserve list. It is obvious that the whole of these 201 officers would not have to come up at once. If we had only 200 on the establishment, we should not expect to have more than forty of fifty coming up every year and the difficulty of getting them into some central college should not be, as is suggested, insuperable. Officers of the Permanent or of the Militia Forces who do not wish to be put to the trouble of passing these examinations will immediately resist such a .proposition, but it ought not to be difficult to get a sufficient number ofmajors to come up for the course proposed. The alternative suggested in some quarters, that of having an instructor or two travelling round the country to instruct the majors, will not bring about that high state of efficiency that would be secured if all were brought together for instruction. If they come together there will be emulation and mutual competition.",17
34,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And , having a colas efficient lege, we ought to use it.",17
35,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so. If they come together there will also be an interchange Ausof views amongst the various arms, which offiwill show the weakness of their preconnot ceived methods, outside the actual terms they of training, practical and theoretical. More on important than all, if we can get them to central college, our training will be practical, as well as theoretical. If we have an instructor going into a country district and saying to a major- "" Come and have a with me after dinner,"" the instruction will consist largely of cigars, and whisky and soda. It will be purely theoretical. We owe it to the Militia Forces to see that they are efficiently officered. I have placed these proposals before the Committee purely to enable a sound system to be provided in the Bill, and to indicate to the permanent officers that we intend that our Militia shall be self-reliant and efficient. If a better means can be suggested of achieving my object, I shall jump at the chance to escape the responsibility of moving such an amendment as this. But we must give our militia officers the opportunity of training at such a college as is suggested. If we do not we must rely on the antiquated, harmful, and effete system of permanent adjutants,-or some other system of the kind, that will lessen their self-reliance and weaken their efficiency to such an extent that they will become absolutely incompetent for their command when the time for action arrives.",17
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,ParramattaMinister of Defence) [10.57] - I regret that I cannot accept this proposed new section. It will not effect the object which the honourable member has in view.,18
37,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What kind of college has the Minister in view?,18
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A college which, I hope, will be equipped to the fullest possible extent.",18
39,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What will be the of it in the absence of pupils?,18
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member might as well ask, "" Why should they have in England a college without pupils?"" Is the honourable member aware that only about 100 pass through the College at Home every year. Is he aware that the highest officers in the British today have not passed through the College? ",18
41,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They secure in other branches the sort of training we propose - shall be given in this college.,18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am proposing to give our officers the same opportunity, my only desire being to make the machinery as simple as possible. I am with the honStaff orable member for Wentworth so far the question of training is concerned; I differ from him only as to the facilities which should be given to officers to acquire training. In other words,, the honourable member wants to drag officers from all of Australia to one central college, whereas I wish to make the instruction as readily [177]- 2 available to them as possible. The honourable member simply caricatures the proposals that I have in contemplation when he says that the instruction, if taken to these officers, will consist largely of whisky and cigars.  say that staff officers are not bound to pass through the Staff College at Home?",18
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes . Perhaps the honourable member is not aware that the Chief of the General Staff at Home today has not been through the Staff College yet. Is he aware that the late Chief of Staff at Home did not go through a Staff College ? ,18
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The bulk of the officers at Home have never been through a Staff College. What is done there is, and can be, done here. Officers secure the services of coaches to put them through their examination; but tihe honourable member for Wentworth insists that officers shall get through their examinations only by going to the college. It is there that I differ from him. I ask for a little elasticity in connection with this proposed new section, but he desires to make it as rigid as possible.",18
45,Dr WILSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How would the honourable member so amend it as to make it work ?,18
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should make it rigid in its application to the permanent use staffs, and leave the rest to be prescribed as a matter of administration. That is what is done in every other country. The honourable member for Wentworth is proposing that we should jump ahead of anything that is done in any other part of Staff the Empire, or indeed in the world.",18
47,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , I am adapting the Armv system in England, as far as I understand Staff it, to our local conditions.",18
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And I tell the honourable gentleman that under the English system only about 100 officers pass through the Staff College every year.,18
49,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the Staff College provides for quite a different education from that which I propose shall be given in our Military College. The Minister wants a College, whereas I desire an educaas tional as well as a Staff College.",18
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I want both am educational and a Staff College, but I differ that from the honourable member in that I desire to make it easily available to those who parts are engaged today in earning their own livelihood, and are amongst the best officers in Australia. If , as the honourable member proposes, we say that all these officers shall be compelled to go to the one centre to receive instruction, a great many of them will not be able to do so.",18
51,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How many attend Professor Foster's lectures at the Sydney University ?,19
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A few. The honourable member said that 201 officers would be affected by this proposal; under the new scheme of training there, it would be nearly 700. The honourable member would drag every one of those officers from all parts of Australia-fro m North Queensland and from Western Australia-to one central college, but that would be impossible.",19
53,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member say that my estimate of the figures is wrong ?,19
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member's estimate as to the officers concerned is wrong. The number affected .mder the present scheme is 280, but under the new scheme of training it will be nearer 700.",19
55,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Seve n hundred majors ! I spoke of majors, not of officers generally. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I am speaking, not only of majors, but of all the officers concerned. I have had the figures checked this morning. My honourable friend will achieve his object, and help us to assist him to achieve it, if he does what I suggest. We shall not confine his proposition more than we can help; we shall bring all we can to the college, but some consideration must be given first of all to the convenience of the citizen officers, and, secondly, to the enormous cost involved. I ask the honourable member to aliow for a Iittie elasticity in the administration; I say nothing about the standards.",19
56,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What would be the cost of taking 200 officers to the college in one year?,19
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not had the figures taken out, but it would be enormous. We - should have to pay them an allowance while they were at the college, and also pay their travelling expenses. The honourable member is proposing to make the system so rigid that it will break down. I am sure the honourable member will not get as much efficiency by the method he prescribes as would be obtained by leaving the Department to put a. little elasticity into the proposal. That is all I am pleading for. The honourable member last night succeeded in carrying a proposal requiring Administrative and Instructional Staff officers to go to the Military College before they could either be appointed or receive promotion. Quite by oversight, I am sure, he left out all the Royal Australian Artillery and Royal Australian Engineer officers. If any officers ought to be instructed at the college, officers belonging to those arms of the service should.",19
58,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am quite willing to include' them now, if the honourable member will move in that direction.",19
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We cannot go back at this stage. I shall endeavour to have the provision amplified in another place to make it include those officers. I want to get as much under this scheme as I can, but I beg the honourable member, in the interests of his own proposal, not to make it too rigid.",19
60,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the Minister content lo make all the permanent men go to the college ?,19
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is my suggestion.,19
62,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then , unless this clause is carried, two castes of officers-the permanent and the militia-wil l be established.",19
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not at all. I am afraid the honourable member has not approached the question in the spirit in which it ought to be approached. He asks me if I will consent to something, and the moment I do so, he says that I am all wrong. My proposal would not confine the instruction to permanent officers. We should, in our own interests,. get every man possible to the college, but I would allow some little consideration to the men who need it most, in the interests of their own instruction, in remote parts of Australia. I therefore move That after the word "" No,"" line 1, the word ""permanent"" be inserted.",19
64,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Kalgoorlie) [11.4] - It is interesting to note the different attitude adopted by the Ministei towards proposals submitted from his own side of the House and amendments put forward from this side.,19
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I hope I have treated every amendment fairly./,19
66,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister cannot point to one amendment moved from this side that has been accepted.,19
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I accepted one yesterday on this very subject. . Mr Frazer - Yes , an amendment of a proposal submitted by a Ministerial supporter, but all amendments submitted from this side for the improvement of the Bill itself in its earlier stages were rejected. I am in agreement with the Minister in resisting the proposal that all officers should go through the Military College before they are promoted above a certain rank.",19
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Such an enactment would rule out four-fifths of the militia officers. . Mr Frazer - That is a most serious statement. I believe we can get competent officers to carry out the duties in various parts of Australia without their having seen the interior of this,college. Whilst it may be necessary to have a college in order to build up an instructional staff, and a staff of officers to send to various places, the advancement of many good men to positions which attention to duty and ability qualify them to fill would be seriously retarded by enacting that no person should reach a certain rank until he had actually been through the college.",20
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The number of officers in the regimental establishment of the British Army at present is 11,000, of whom only about 850 have passed through a Staff College.",20
70,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This is not a Staff College, as the Minister knows.",20
71,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The idea of the honourable member for Wentworth is to make it a general college.,20
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is our idea also. Mr Frazer,-If this college is to be established in one particular centre, and attendance is made compulsory, geographical difficulties alone will probably prevent many persons who are entitled to promotion from securing it. I do not feel very happy in having to defend the Government on this occasion, because I believe this Bill will be absolutely ineffective. With or without this provision, it will be unsatisfactory, but I believe that it will ,be more unsatisfactory if this clause is inserted in its present form.",20
73,Dr WILSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Corangamite) [11.9] The amendment proposed by the Minister would not improve the proposed new section. It would simply make this a Staff College.,20
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The instruction would not be confined to permanent officers.,20
75,Dr WILSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am afraid that it would, but another way out of the difficulty is open to us, if the Minister will agree to the amendment of the proposed new section to make it read in this wayNo officer, other thanofficers of the Cadets, shall be promoted, except probationally, to any rank higher than that of Capfain, until he has passed, as prescribed, a course of practical and theoretical instructionNot "" at "" the Military College, butby the members of the staff of the Military College, to perfect him That will make the training effective, and meet what the Minister desires.",20
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I shall be quite satisfied with that.,20
77,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am prepared to accept it. »,20
78,Dr WILSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Our only object ""is to make the .fcollege effective, and improve the efficiency of the forces. If the Minister will withdraw his amendment, I shall be prepared to move in the direction I have indicated. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Dr WILSON) proposed - That the word "" at "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" by the members of the staff of . """,20
79,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Cook) [11.12] - I sympathize with the desire of the honourable member for Wentworth to prevent the creation of a military caste in Australia. I understand that the amendment of the honourable member for Corangamite will not compel every officer to attend the college. There may be workers in different States who cannot afford to leave, or risk losing, their employment to attend the college, and it ought to be made clear that so long as they pass the necessary examinations their attendance at the college will not be compulsory. Is the Minister satisfied that that is provided for?",20
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no objection to the provision, as now proposed to be amended. It will simply provide that competent people shall prescribe the standard and require it to be reached, irrespective of place or time. Amendment agreed to. Proposed new section, as amended, agreed to.",20
81,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [11.14] - I beg to move That the following proposed new section be inserted :"" 151. No officer shall be promoted above the Tank of Major until he has passed as prescribed a course of instruction at the MilitaryCollege during which he shall have shown himself fitted to command in the field a force of all arms."" I suggest that a man who is passing an exanaination corresponding to that of ""Tactical fitness .to command"" in the - British Service might well have all the library and conveniences of a Military College at his disposal whilst he does it. We have not to-, day in the whole of the Commonwealth Forces a man who has led a force of all arms in the field, and the man .who becomes colonel of a militia regiment may be put in charge of a column. We have in Australia commandants who are supposed to have a knowledge of all arms, and it is no distortion of fact to say, jyithout casting aspersions on them, that none of them has commanded a force of all arms in the field.",20
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In every case where it is possible we are glad to give our officers that opportunity.,21
83,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If there is a raid at some point in Australia, and there is in command there some garrison commander or officer occupying an ornamental position of that kind-say , a gentleman wlio was rather influential in politics-h e might have to lead a force of all arms, although he had only commanded a battalion of Scotch rifles, or had commanded a Militia artillery brigade. I do not suppose it is possible to beat the Government's whip, but, at any rate, I submit the proposed new section. Amendment (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) proposed - That the word ""at,"" line 3, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" by agreed to. the members of the staff of.""",21
84,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [11.16] There would not be so much objection to this amendment if we could have some definite assurance from some Minister not yet born, or not yet in Parliament, that he would see that the officers brought up for this examination in tactics had had opportunities of leading forces of all arms. But suppose the college instructors were sent up to Wagga to examine the fitness of a major, who wanted to become a lieutenantcolonel. What opportunity could such a man have had, in such a place, to acquire fitness for commanding all arms?

If a Minister were to "" prescribe "" that the trainingshould consist of a little instruction during half-hours on Sundays, Parliament would know what was being done; but we might not know that the examination in tactical fitness was properly conducted. Some Minister in the future may prescribe that these officers shall be examined in their owntowns purely in theoretical matters.

86,Mr ARCHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Capricornia) [11.17] It appears to me that the language of this proposed new section does not make the meaning very clear. It speaks of an officer passing "" a course of instruction."" A man cannot pass a course; he can pass through a course. Does the provision mean that an officer is to pass an examination based upon some course of instruction given by officers of the Military College? If so, it'is not clear.",21
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,ParramattaMinister of Defence) [11.18] - I was talking to the Attorney-General about the point raised by the honourable member for Capricornia before the matter was mentioned. The Attorney-General tells me that the language of the proposed new section would cover such an examination as is contemplated. He can think of no better words to meet the purpose.,21

Does he mean that if an officer does not obtain the service certificate of fitness, he must step down from his rank?",21
90,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [11.20] - The . object of this proposal is to enable the Military College to arrive at some satisfactory, if more rough-and-ready, method of gauging the capacity of officers for their positions, than exists under the preceding clauses, which apply to new applications by officers for their majority in the higher ranks. I do ' not think it can be denied that the existing officers ought to become, within two' years at any rate, efficient for the ranks which they are now holding. What is contemplated is not an examination on paper.",21

94,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If it does not, I am sure the Minister will not object to it. The main objection to a proposal of this kind is the amount of trouble it will stir up amongst a number of majors and colonels, who do not want to prove themselves fit for the positions they occupy.",22

If war comes tomorrow we shall have to do the best we can; and we should not be in any better position for having this proposed new section in the Bill. I can conceive of nothing which would strike a heavier blow at that spirit which ought to pervade the forces than would be done if this provision were inserted as it stands. I have never known retrospective legislation of this kind.,22
105,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not retrospective.,22
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is worse than being retrospective. It means that officers must step down unless they get a certificate from the Staff College.,22

108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I quoted one instance last night, and they could be multiplied, of people being left in their positions without being subject to any tests.

Nearly all foreign officers who have seen British troops in the field have admitted that they are the best soldiers in the world, but they have been often sacrificed through incompetent generalship. Our Minister of Defence actually wants to keep incompetent men in positions for which they are not fit. Really, I am ashamed of the Minister ! It would be better for us to pay these men pensions, or retire them on half pay, than to keep them in positions for which they are incompetent.

I agree with the Minister that it is not desirable to dismiss competent officers because they can-' not now pass examinations. But I fear that this proposal will enable him to retain all the present officers. If one thing is more important than another, it is that our officers shall be efficient. An officer who is not efficient should be retired, no matter what his position may be. But officers who are thoroughly up to their work should be retained without being asked to pass examinaon theoretical subjects, such as it is one quite right to ask j'oung officers to pass. Apparently, the Minister intends to keep present officers, whether competent or not, since he fears lest even one officer may",23

That is precisely what happened. I reported to my superior officer that the men were unfit for further work, and, agreeing with me, he reported the matter to his superior. But the commandant, ordered that every man should turn out who did not declare himself unfit for duty. On returning I was made regimental serpel geant for twenty-four hours, and had to be city at my post at every bugle call during that period. One of the colonels having covered that a blunder had been .made, ordered the cooks to be sent back. Had this not been done, the men would have been without food.

Within the last five years it was proposed to test .pf the brigades by means of examinations, with the result that men whose service many vacancies. showed them to be fully ""capable were unto pass. A similar thing occurred in the Public Service in connection with the examination for linemen. Good practical men were unable to pass the tests prescribed, by the Public Service Commissioner, which were ridiculed and denounced in the press. They were consequently displaced by others - whose theoretical knowledge was greater, but who were not nearly so good. I agree as to the need for testing the knowledge of new officers, but it would be unjust to comthose whose service proves their capato submit to examination, and would disprobably result in trouble. The case referred to by the honourable member for Maranoa had no bearing on the argument. Under certain conditions it may be necesto sary fo change a commanding oflicer, no the matter what his qualifications or experience may be.

The Honourable, member thinks that it would be quite sufficient to allow' the status of present officers to be left to the judgment of those directing, the college, and I agree with him. The Minister evidently does not. As to what' the honourable member for Maribyrnong. has said, I do not think that this provision would mean that a statutory examination should be passed by those now in office. All that it proposes is that their qualifications shall be brought under review. If there is anything to be feared from that proposal it is that fJhe college authorities, because of persona] sympathy, may strain the qualities of mercy, and so sacrifice the efficiency of the forces. We must, however, take that risk. We cannot guard against every abuse, but we can adopt the mild expedient of bringing the qualifications of the present officers under the review of those directing the affairs of the college, and in doing so take some steps to guard against incompetence.",25
137,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Dalley) [11.50] - The Minister of Defence is putting up an excellent fight against what he considers to be a proposed injustice. If he could show that the proposed new section would have the effect he fears, I should certainly support him. But honourable members who consider that the injustice at the present time lies in a different direction from that which the honourable gentleman suggests must support this proposal. From the outset of our consideration of this Bill the cry has gone forth that it is a non-party measure; but as soon as we reach the Committee stagethe stage at which all measures are supposed to be dealt with in a non-party spirit tinctly party Bill . In moving the second reading the Minister of Defence cordially invited suggestions, but as soon as a sug-. gestion is made in Committee he warmly attacks it.",25
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If it is a non-party measure I shall expect the honourable member to vote occasionally with me.,25
139,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member will not lead me off the track in that way. It He is trying to enfilade' me. He is seeking in that way to do what he is not prepared to do by open fire.,25
140,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable gentleman is pretty good at sniping.,25
141,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is all.,25
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is a non-party measure when the honourable member votes with the other side. .,25
143,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"All that the honourable gentleman can think of is the fighting of political battles. Surely he can for at least ten minutes put aside party political warfare, and deal with this measure as it affects the people. We are now endeavouring .to secure an efficient defence forceWe have taken steps to secure the efficiency of the rank and file, and we say - now that to complete the scheme we must take care that the officers shall also be efficient. If the honourable member for Wentworth were proposing that certain officers should be removed from their posts, quite irrespective ot their competency, because they could not pass certain examinations, he would not deserve support; but he does not propose anything of the kind. No one would oppose more strongly than I should any proposition for mere theoretical examinations. In my younger days I had an opportunity to pass, and did pass, some, but the mere passing of such examinations or the holding of academic degrees does not count for much. Holders of academic degrees, as Carlyle put it, are often little men on long crutches. Some men have practically the whole alphabet at the end of their names, and that is all they have got. As to the qualificatioqs of military officers, it is Droposed only to consider their fitness tolead troops in the field. That is all the honourable member for Wentworth asks."" Under this proposed new section an officer will have to obtain within two years a certificate of fitness. If a man'cannot obtain a certificate of fitness for practical field work within two years, then the sooner he goes on the reserve list the better. The honourable member for Wentworth does not propose to deprive such men of their rank; he simply proposes that they shall be placed on the reserve list. Surely an army is not merely for show purposes, or to enable men to undergo physical drills. Surely there must be some immediate or contingent danger feared when we propose to create an army of 300,000 men ? And by whom shall we be attacked ? By men led by incompetent officers ? No.",25

145,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Grea t Britain, which, as a rule, is very conservative, has learned admirable lessons in militarism from Continental countries. Continental Europe has set the pace. We have in the history of the South African War an illustration of Ihe necessity for this provision. Many officers displayed great bravery and courage, .but they lacked the fitness to lead. In continental Europe military officers - have to show absolute fitness for their positions. We are told that the Empire will probably be in danger. In danger of what ? Danger of attack by forces of the very type to which I am now referring. To resist them successfully we must have - efficiency on the part of officers as well as of men.",26
146,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I agree with the lionorable member.,26
147,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then why not accept this proposal ?,26

149,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Unjus t to whom? No - capable militia officer has anything to fear from this provision.,26
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A number of most capable will object to it.,26
151,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Officer s will not be asked - to pass a theoretical examination, except as to their fitness.",26
152,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I would ask the honourable member to read the proposed new section.,26
153,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member - remarked satirically last night, "" We are a House of experts."" I ' appreciate satire, - but whilst we are not all experts, we are a - body of men who have had some experience of life, who have used their powers of observation, and are capable of drawing deductions from what they see and hear.. We propose to reform our defence system, and when the honourable member for North Sydney says, ""We are not experts,"" I have no hesitation in .replying that we ought to keep away from the man who poses as an expert. My fear, however, is that the Minister will become the toy of experts, who differ amongst themselves from year to year, and are constantly fighting. A few years ago Mr W. H . Smith, a London bookseller, but a shrewd business man, .who amassed a fortune, had charge of the British Admiralty, and carried out some of the most effective reforms that the Admiralty has ever known. That is my answer to the honourable member for North Sydney's remark as to honourable members not being experts. If we are to refrain from criticising'a Bill merely because we are not experts, why should we consider if in Committee? We might just as well take the Bill as ladled out' to us by the experts, and not trouble to discuss it. The honourable member for Maribyrnong was right in his references to theoretical examinations. He is an ex-field officer- I am not throwing cold water on his fire brigade experiences-and an ex-Postmaster General. No one has ridiculed more than I have done some of the examinations prescribed for candidates for admission to the General Division of the Public Service. Recently candidates for the position of linesmen in the Postmaster-General's Department were asked to pass a stiff test in dictation, and one of the words they had to spell was "" phantasmagoria."" Had I been asked to spell it, I would have said: "" I have put up all the other poles; what sort of a pole is ' phantasmagoria ' "" ? Many ' useless examinations are passed by men who are never heard of again. The gold medallist-the the senior wrangler of his year-is seldom heard of after he leaves the university. I am not very keen on theoretical examinations, but I am in favour of examinations being held to determine an officer's fitness for the post he occupies. I do not know what the Minister is fighting about. We have had some sad experiences of political officers. I have in mind one who, if examined in strategy, would get 90 per cent, of the possible marks, but if I were to mention his name, scarcely an honourable member would be prepared tb follow him even to a It can be said with truth regarding a large number of Australian omcers that if it were the fashion in Great Britain to wear monocles they would wear them here. They are pure imitators. The Minister in this Bill has undoubtedly set a model before the British world. Then why not perfect it?",26
154,Mr TILLEYBROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the proposed new section perfect it ? I think it will spoil it .,27
155,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Apparentl y certain honought orable members are so disciplined as poliprovement ticians that, in considering this Bill are averse to anything to which the Minister is averse. It is a healthy sign that we question. are quarrelling over this matter. The youth of a nation is shown by its love of warthrough, fare ; its old age by a love of merchandise and trade. All that the honourable ber for Wentworth asks for is fitness.",27
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Indeed , for a great deal more. He is proposing unjust and irritating restrictions without adding one iota to the effect of his proposals.",27
157,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the Minister can show any irritating or unjust conditions, no member of the Committee has a right to advocate their adoption, but until the Minister does that I am entitled as an ordinary member to defend this proposal to the best of my ability. 'Another argument put forward is that of cost; but was that consideration urged regarding the main provisions-of the Bill ? Is defence to be measured by cost ? I do not say that we should waste money, but if we are to spend ^1,750,000 on the rank and file, and bring the main body of the Army to a high state of efficiency, surelv we shall not refrain for the sake of a few thousand pounds from making the officers - efficient. I admit that Australia has a big bill to face, but surely this measure is not to be passed as a mere placard ? With-out saying it offensively, the Minister, to a. great extent, is only the - phonograph of his central administration.",27
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION, happen to be in the slightest degree correct.,27
159,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then if the Minister is not led by anybody, he has evolved the whole of this scheme out of his inner consciousness.",27
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Le t us get through with the business.,27
161,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the Minister call it business simply to get through something, good, bad, or otherwise, so long as it is luncheon. got through? The Minister, of course, has as much right to oppose as I have to advocate ah amendment, but he should give it fair consideration. He has been exceptionally well treated by the House on the present occasion. In connection with an intricate and complicated measure, affecting the lives of thousands of people, he has secured the second reading on the voices, and taken it through Committee in less than a week. His measure is leading the Britisb world on the question of defence, and he not to resist proposals for its imas if they represented organized , they obstruction on an ordinary party measureSurely defence is not to be made a party As an old friend, I honestly admire the way he has carried his measure and the skill he has shown, but I do not appreciate his attitude in twisting memround and trying to apply party discipline when amendments are put forward. he asks Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That is a most unjust statement.",27
162,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member should remember that on this measure, as on others, each member is responsible to> his constituents. No member can forget that in voting for the Bill he is really placing the whole of the adult male population of Australia under arms, and that that population has a vote. Every honourable member who votes for universal training has a bounden duty to see that efficient officers are provided to take the command of the Citizen Forces. I want no fancy or tricky examinations to be prescribed for officers, but I do want a test of fitness.",27
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wh v does the honaiable member assume that I have not that just as much at heart as he has?,27
164,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because the Minister is opposing this proposal. Without it , what has he to f all back upon ?",27
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,All that the proposed new section would do would be to inflict an injustice on capable and efficient officers already in the service.,27
166,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have heard objections That does not of that sort ever since I have been in this Chamber. If the Committee refuses to adopt this proposal, what machinery has the Minister at his command to test whether officers are efficient or otherwise? The only machinery existing today for that purpose is the Central A d ministration. The Minister, therefore, will have to take one of two courses. He must: either constitute himself the censor of existing officers, or take the advice of the Central Administration regarding them. The Central Administration will not go back upon what they have already done. incompetent. They have in the past recommended these individuals for their positions. We have had instances in Australia of men holding high commands simply as the result of it friendship with the political head, for the lime being, of the Defence Department. 1I have heard it said that an oflicer pointed in Victoria at a very recent date received field rank, not by passing an amination, but through the intervention a Minister. I am not referring to the sent Minister. If the Committee does not adopt the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth, or something similar we shall simply have at work the same machinery as brought that sort of thing about. Regarding the Central Administration as a concrete illustration of a piece of machisomehow nery, I assert, without referring to individuals, that they have been guilty, time liament. after time, of allowing men to obtain field rank who were not competent for the position. The weeding out of incompetents surely not an injustice. I intend to vote for this proposal, and, for my own protecis tion, I am giving just and powerful petent reasons for doing so. 1 do not expect the Minister to accept every amendment moved, but this one will make for an improvement of the forces by insuring competent offitions cers, in whom the rank and file will have confidence.",27
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And I am opposing it because I think it will do no good.,28
168,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Minister looks at i from one stand-point, and I from another j competent. but I am sure the honourable member for Wentworth has. not taken this step simply to load the Bill , or to have his name assoScouts. ciated with it. If any memberputs forward a proposal which can be sustained argument and reason, no matter on which side of the House he sits, let him get credit for improving the Bill . I suppose i had not been for the promptings of ambito tion none of us would have been in the vice? Chamber, and when a man does come here, is he worth a rap unless he tries to move? Minister did. I cannot stand these petty little jealousies. As I put it yesterday, if you excel others you get their enmity, while if you let others excel you you get their friendship. Human nature in that regard is as active in this Chamber as it is outside, and if we apply the same test to the officers we shall far wrong.

It will be a good thing for the Minister himself to be able to say- "" The Director of our Military College, the best qualified to judge in these matters, made a recommendation, and we must throw the responsibility upon him."" I the Minister of Defence in this matter imitate his own policy in New South Wales. Some years ago, when he served in the Administration led by the right orable member for East Sydney, it was sidered that the Public Service contained number of incompetent officers. The ister did not ask that these men should tinue to hold their positions until they or dropped out, nor did he give them years to qualify. What he did was to appoint a Board of Public Service Commishope sioners, who occupied a position analogous to that which will be occupied by the Director of the Military College. These Commissioners prescribed examinations all future appointments. In addition that, they set to work to ascertain the ness of old hands. They did not ask these officers to pass a theoretical examination. remember the time when they came down to. the Lands. Office and examined the officials there. They did not quire that the old hands should undergo the same tests as the younger But they did require that all officers should show that they were fit „ positions. Those who could not do so were fired out. The Commissioners did not hesitate to dismiss incompetents. that time we had no one getting up in Parliament as the Minister has done this morning and expatiating upon the injustice being done to old servants. It was ' sidered essential for the welfare of the try that officers in the Lands offices other offices should be retired if found be incompetent. How much more important is it that in a matter of life and death we should see to it that incompetent officers are retired? This is the only method - which we can secure that end. If the posal of the honourable member for Wenttion worth lie agreed to it will not be necessary for every officer to undergo an examinaDirector tion to show fitness for his position.",28

It would be for the Directo prescribe the standard of examinawhich existing officers would have to pass; and we may be sure that he would not adopt a standard inferior to that which is would be established at the Military College not itself. If the State Parliament some years f we ago, in legislating as to municipal surveyors, had laid down similar conditions to those now proposed, the result would have been that if the surveyors then in office had Minister. not been able to pass prescribed examinations they would have had to be retired; and similarly, if when a new regulation was inaugurated compelling inspectors of public schools to be degree men, it had been applied to existing officers, the result would have been that some of the most eminent and able of our public school inspectors would have been dismissed.

If injustice should be done, it will be the fault of the Minister in prescribing too severe an examination. The proposed new section does not require that the present officers shall be put to tests which must spell failure, or asked to pass examinations in theoretical subjects with which it would be impossible for the majority to deal satisfactorily.

202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would not be fair to ask a. field officer to submit to a simple elementary test, and if a test were simple, incompetent men could pass it.

204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A simple test might be passed by officers who were really incompetent.,31
205,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"To allow incompetent officers to hold positions to the exclusion better men is disheartening to those who possess ability. The Minister will be well so. advised if he accepts the proposal. Even though the Director of the Military College might be unfair or unjust, which is almost inconceivable, the certificate to be given must be prescribed by the Minister. Unvision doubtedly the Minister should welcome the too far. giving of power to remove manifestly inaminations competent officers. Let me mention an stance of what happens under system. A certain officer was raised to the rank of major, although it was known to officers the authorities that he was not fit for the position. Later, when the command of an infantry regiment became vacant, he apuseful plied for and obtained it, although there was eligible a. competent officer who had seen active service. The incompetent was made provisionally a lieutenant-colonel, and held command for two years, durhe. ing which ^period he seldom or never exercised his regiment, because he knew was incompetent to do so, and, although the Minister. directed on several occasions to present him- given self for examination to prove hisfitnessfor the rank which he held, he evaded doing so. The authorities knew that he was dodging the examination, and yet they alofficers. lowed him to retain nominal control of the regiment for two years. At the end of that time, as he could no longer put off the amination, he applied to be retired with the leon's marshals do so? rank of lieutenant-colonel, and his request was granted. Now he struts about, a table jackdaw, in peacock's feathers. fact that for two years he had charge regiment was not creditable to the authorities. We desire to prevent that sort of thing in the future. Let me give another recent occurrence. The senior an infantry regiment was unable to pass the examination for major, failing several times. Younger men passed it with credit, but the officer commanding refused to tion their promotion. After two years of struggling, one of them was side-tracked. This was done to keep the position open a favourite who could not qualify for it.",31

213,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hindmarsh) [12.48]. - The Minister ought to accept the proposed new section. Wlien speaking a few minutes ago I cited a case which, to my mind, showed the absolute necessity for inserting in the Bill such a provision as this. I propose now to give an even stronger illustration of its urgency. Some years ago we had in one of the States a commandant who suffered so severely from a certain complaint that it was impossible for him to cross a horse, and medical men said that he would never be able to ride again. That officer, however, was promoted to the position of State Commandant of Queensland, where he received a higher salary to perform duties which he could not possibly carry out. He died soon afterwards. I was certainly sorry for him. He had seen service in South Africa, and I was willing that he should obtain all the recompense that the Commonwealth could give him. A Labour Ministry was in power at the time, but the then Minister of Defence did not know the true position regarding this oflicer until I brought all the facts before him. This officer was physically incapable of pei forming any of his duties, yet he was promoted to one of the most important commands in the Commonwealth. Later fin he was superseded by an officer who was well able to do the work expected of him. He could readily have passed a very stringent theoretical examination, but was unfit to do practical work. I could cite twenty or thirty other cases in support of the position I take up, but think it unnecessary to do so. It is not my desire that any man who has done good service should be deprived of his rank, and no man would be under this provision because of his inability to prove his fitness. He would retain his rank, but would be placed on the retired list.",32
214,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [12.52] - I his think that the honourable member for Balaclava has completely misunderstood tion. He appeared to imagine that under this proposed new section-and , in view of the repeated interjections of the Minister, he had every justification for believing that it was capable of the interpretation that he placed upon it-officer s of high rank were going to be asked to pass an examination in theory as well as in practice, such as will: be passed in future by younger officers graduating for the position of field officers. No such proposal is made by me. This provision is most explicit. It simply declares that whosoever cannot prove, to the satisfaction of a man selected by the Minister himself, according to methods prescribed by the Minister, his fitness for the position he holds should not continue to hold it. The Minister says that my proposal will cause injustice. Injustice to whom? Injustice to a number of officers who, I presume, cannot prove their fitness.",32
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would not be unjust in their case.,32
216,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we are not going to do "" an injustice "" to them, then we must be proposing to do an injustice to the country that expects us to be true to our oaths and to see that the country's forces are efficient, and that what we pass shall be carried out.",32
217,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Unles s this is carried we shall do an injustice to competent officers.,32
218,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-Yes . Why should a competent man have his spirit, ambition, and enterprise stamped out of him by the fact that some gentleman who has influence and who, perhaps, can appeal to the pity of a Minister, is allowed to remain over him? Does not the Minister know that a gentleman occupying one of the highest positions in our military service was able to have corrected the decision of a Minister of Defence some four years ago, and to have that decision corrected, not on grounds submitted by his expert officers, but as the result of pressure brought to bear by leaders of parties' in this House? The Minister knows the case to which I refer. I am not at liberty to say more, but the incident shows that some such provision as this is necessary in the interests of the Minister of Defence himself. It shows that without some such provision as this the Minister will be in the same position as he is in today-at constant war with conscience on the one hand, and with the posihis humanity on the other.",32

One of the greatest disappointments I have exfew lines? perienced during the consideration of this measure has relation to the attitude up by members of the Ministerial party in considering these proposals.

Members of the Labour party cannot accuse me of being very closely allied with them on the subjects which ordinarily divide the House, and the Ministry cannot accuse me of wanting to be more closely assowrong. ciated with my friends opposite.

236,Mr REID,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"East Sydney) [2.15] - I of feel very strongly against any proposal which would compel officers in the service I remember a very eminent Chief Justice of New South Wales-Si r James Martinsaying once from' the Bench, after a very brilliant career, both at Bar and Bench, that if he were asked to undergo the pretheliminary examinations for admission to the Bar, he was sure he would be plucked. On the other hand I do feel that it should be to possible for the Minister to prescribe a kind of test which would not be a technical test that kind at all, but bear upon the ability of an officer to perform his practical duties in the field. I believe the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth is so framed as to enable the Minister to convert the examination into a practical one, to avoid the injustice of submitting officers to a technical test. Having that belief, I must ' support it . The the public are to be asked to make a very great sacrifice-the call upon them will amount to an enormous sum every year-and if there is a service that should be efficient it is the military service. If there are men who should be efficient they are the officers in command of that service. If we ever come to the practical test of warfare, the lives of the men will be at the mercy of the competency of the officers. I am sure we are all at one upon that point.",33
237,Mr MAUGER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But why make this provision retrospective? 0 - Mr Reid - In the supreme necessitv 'of having no officer in command, even in the humblest position, who is not thoroughly competent, this new departure will fail unless it is a new departure from the letter A. to the letter Z of our military system. We start this new force with a large number of officers of whom I wish to speak with the utmost respect, and who have shown patriotism in the most practical way by years of service, and it would be a cruel injustice to them to test them as to their efficiency as you would test a beginner. If I thought this proposal would inflict that injustice upon the officers in the service I should say that it ought to be scouted.",34
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And yet there is no other way of carrying out this proposal.,34
239,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the officers not die out gradually ?,34
240,Mr REID,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is that a proper way of regarding a matter of such urgent importance to the people? I have the greatest admiration for my honourable friend, who will never die out. I believe he is more, efficient now than he ever was in his life, and if these officers were only like him, an examination of any kind would be an insult. This is the first opportunity I have had of publicly congratulating my honourable friend the Minister of Defence upon the magnificent way in which he has introduced this Bill, and I again congratulate the Committee upon the way in which it has endeavoured to make the Bill even better than it was when introduced. If we can possibly finish it this afternoon, I think we should all endeavour to do so. Consequently, I shall say no more, except that it is possible for the Minister, under the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth, to make the test one which would not be unfair or unjust, but would redound to the advantage of competent officers. If there are left in the service a few who have ceased to be competent, the discredit of their inefficiencv is spread over the whole service, and therefore, in the interests of the service and of the officers themselves, this proposal should be agreed to. I am confident that if it is passed in any form which the Minister upon consideration will agree to, it will be possible to submit all our officers to a fair test which will redound to the advantage of those who are competent, while removing from this new system, in the case of those who are incompetent, what I regard as its most serious danger of failure.",34
241,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Gippsland) [2.20] - The objections to this proposal have been based on. a charge of injustice or unfairness to officers who are long past the stage for passing theoretical examinations.,34
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not oppose it on that ground at all.,34
243,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Othe r speakers have based their objections on the ground of unfair r ness and injustice to officers now in the service, in asking them to pass a theoretical examination.",34
244,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The objection was rather to the loss of the best officers.,34
245,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , on the ground that it would be unfair to ask them to undergo a theoretical examination. I agree with the right honourable member for East Sydney that in many walks of life there are exceedingly competent men at the 'top of the tree who could not pass such theoretical examinations as they passed when they first entered their professions, but the wording of this provision shows that the honourable member for Wentworth had no such idea in his mind. In proposed new sections 150 and 151 he requires certain officers to pass a course of practical and theoretical instruction; but all he provides in this amendment is that those provisions shall not apply to any existing officer, so long as he receives, as prescribed, a certificate of fitness for his rank. He says nothing here about passing a theoretical and practical examination, and, as the right honourable member for East Sydney says, there could be prescribed under this provision conditions which would do no injustice or unfairness to any officer now in the sendee.",34
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Will the honourable member sketchwhat he thinks would ""be a fair test?",34

250,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not wrong to provide that the officers in charge of the Australian Forces shall be competent to obtain a certificate offitnessin practical work. We are beginning practically a new Defence Force, and its weakness, if it has any, will lie in having incompetent officers. It is altogether wrong to keep in the force, and put in charge of new men, officers who could not obtain from the Director of any Military College a certificate of fitness in practical work in the field. Any Director could see at once from their method of handling troops in the field whether they were worthy of a certificate of fitness or not.

To pass such a proposal as this would be virtually to pass a motion of censure on them. Who is this new-fangled Director of the Military College to be? Does the honourable member for Wentworth aspire to the position ? If he took it I should have the utmost confidence in him, but we cannot tell who the Director is to be.

Why: should it be assumled that this new-fangled Director of the Military College will be better than all the Ministers that we have had in charge of the Department, or why should it be supposed that the officers under him, just because we are passing a new Act, will be more competent than the men who' have voluntarily borne the heat and burden of the day ? We should think very seriously before we take such a drastic step. I have always a great dislike to throwing mud at anybody, and to pass such a provision as this would be distinctly throwing mud at the officers who have produced what we must admit to be a fairly efficient force, when we consider the disadvantages under which they have laboured for years. We ought not to destroy discipline altogether by casting discredit, as this proposed new section would do, upon the very efficient officers whom wer now have in the service.",35
253,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wentworth) [2.30] - I . thoroughly concur in the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland. It makes the intention of the proposed new section all the clearer and takes away the last shred of excuse from those who are opposing it.,35
254,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not at all.,35
255,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not suppose that I could ever take the last shred of excuse from the honourable member, but the objections to the proposal seem to be based on the argument that it is not right to call upon officers who have served for a considerable time to pass an examination. T .have protested all through that that is not suggested. What is suggested is that they shall the granted a certificate of their fitness in practical work for their present positions. I trust that the suggestion of the honourable member for Gippsland will assist the Committee in arriving at a speedy conclusion.",35
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [2.32] - The right honourable member for East Sydney said that we ought to begin from A to Z in connection with the new forces, but my complaint about the proposal'of the honourable member for Wentworth is that he wants to begin at Z and go back to A. He wishes to begin with officers who have served their country well, who are and have been effiI do cient for many 5ears, against whom there r is not a tittle of complaint or a breath of cavil, and who are secure in their ranks.",35
257,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And who can therefore easily obtain a certificate of their fitness.,35
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not in favour of submitting such men to any test whatever. If I did I should expect to receive some of their resignations. I should not consent to humiliate efficient commanders who have proved their fitness for many years. My honourable friend talks about weeding out those who are unfit. There must be other means than this found to achieve that end.,35
259,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What means will the honourable member find? Political influence? That seems to be the only alternative.,36
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has made quite enough imputations during yesterday and today. He has told me that I am in the grip of my officers, and all that sort of thing. We must not ruck all our officers up, the fit and the unfit, and subject them all to the same test. There is no need for it. It must be remembered that we are dealing with a citizen force. It would be a degradation to ask citizens who have been performing patriotic services for nearly a lifetime to submit themselves to tests of efficiency.",36
261,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has not the country the right to know that they are efficient?,36
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The country has a right to require that we shall do the best we can for the Military Forces. I propose to do that. The Bill will give me the necessary power. As I have already stated, I propose to institute a Military College, which will enable a higher standard of education to be insisted on, but I ask the Committee not to make this legislation retrospective. Similar legislation, requiring the registration of colliery managers, midwives, and other persons, has not been made retro spective.",36
263,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was not the Public Service Act for which a Government of which the honourable member was a Minister was responsible retrospective ?,36
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was not ""a measure like this. It provided for the better administration of a service from whose members the State had a right to expect full value for money paid in pursuance of a purely financial agreement.",36
265,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The case is the same now.,36
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member suggest that we pay full value for the work done by our Citizen Forces?,36
267,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We do not get full value very often.,36
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am sorry to hear aspersions on men who Have proved their fitness and capacity, and who .give service worth many times what we pay for it. It is proposed to ask men who have risen to the various ranks to again submit themselves to tests of efficiency. A test, to be effective, will have to be substantial; it must be a test which will rule out the inefficient.",36
269,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I suggest a test in practical work.,36
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That means the re-examination of officers who have already qualified by passing an examination.,36
271,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There are a number who have not done so.,36
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not propose to submit all my officers to a test in order to get rid of one or two who may be unfit.,36
273,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister does not know much about his Department if he thinks that only one or two of his officers are unfit.,36
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should be convinced by what has been stated during the debate that I know nothing about the Department.,36
275,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have mentioned specific cases.,36
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member spoke of an officer who is dead. I .hope that the Committee will shortly divide on the proposal, because it has been under discussion for nearly two days, and nothing fresh can be said for or against it.",36
277,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister should tell us how he proposes to insure that his officers are fit.,36
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not know that I am obliged to tell the honourable member everything that I intend to do. I do not pretend to know what I am going to do in regard to every question of administration. The honourable member must not expect me to submit to be catechised in this way. I shall take what steps I can to secure the fullest efficiency.,36
279,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the Minister contends that he has a better method than that proposed, he is bound to tell us what it is.",36
280,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Franklin) [2.42]. - It seems to me that more has been read into this provision than it contains. The success or failure of our legislation will depend on our commissioned and non-commissioned officers. No one desires to speak harshly of them. For years they have got very little thanks and less pay for the enormous amount of work which they have done. But means must be provided for getting rid of the unfit, and I think that the. proposed new section provides a good way of doing so. Our service, like other services, is bound to contain a certain number of failures, and it is proposed to hand over the responsibility of determining what officers are unfit to a thoroughly competent authority. If there is one thing that we must avoid, it is political influence. This provision will remove the slightest suspicion of anything of the kind, and will prove a haven of refuge to future Ministers. We may have Defence Ministers who will not be capable of determining fairly what officers are unfit, and, indeed, nothing can be worse than to leave it to the Minister for the time being to determine on conflicting evidence the fitness or unfitness of an officer. The Director of the proposed Military College will be above reproach, and the officers could look to him for justice.",36
281,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He might propose a test which none of the present officers could pass.,37
282,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then he would not be fit for his position. The great majority of our officers will not thank those who suggest that they are afraid to submit themselves to tests. There are many who would gladly welcome an opportunity to do so. We are attempting to thoroughly reform our defence system, and should not shirk responsibility at the outset.",37
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no shirking of responsibility. But some honourable members wish to provide in the Bill for what should be a matter of administration.,37
284,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The determination of the fitness of officers should not be left to the Minister.,37
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not suggested that it should.,37
286,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Without a provision of this kind, the determination will have to be practically that of the Minister, on the advice of his officers, and that might create considerable ill-feeling, and disturb the harmony of the Department. The Minister regards the provision too seriously. I think that it will work beneficially, and remove from his shoulders a responsibility which I am sure he does not wish to bear, and which some Ministers would be unable to bear.",37
287,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bass) [2.471- - When certain Departments of the Public Service were transferred to the Commonwealth, those in the service were allowed to retain all the rights and privileges which they possessed under State administration. Are pur military officers to be differently treated ? There have been officers who have been unfit, and I have brought such cases under the notice of Ministers; but it would be an insult to many worthy men to ask them all to go up for examination again, as if they were so many school boys. Many of them, almost before the honourable member for Wentworth was born, were doing work which showed that they were fit for their positions.",37
288,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Mernda) [2.49] - The honourable member for Wentworth proposes to do a desirable thing in a wrong way. He proposes to make the Director pf the Military College the absolute authority as to the fitness of our officers. Who will this Director be, that he alone should say that certain officers, are capable, and certain are not capable ? . Mr KELLY - I assume that he will be the best specialist that Australia can get.",37
289,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Probably ; but I refuse to give such a power to any individual, without review or appeal. Those who are the proper persons to determine the capacity of the officers are the heads of the Defence Department, the military men who, under the new system, will have the responsibility of recommending that officers be retained in, or retired from-, the service. To require proof of fitness for practical work might tie the hands of the Minister too much. An officer must have other qualifications besides that.",37
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Director might not be the best judge.,37
291,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The suggestion of the honourable member for Gippsland complicates the position. We are beginning a new system, and if our legislation is not perfect, we can improve it later on, but we should start on fair lines. The honourable member for Wentworth has obtained recognition of the principle which he has asked the 1 Committee to adopt, and may be content to allow it to be developed, if necessary, by future Parliaments. He should not try, at this stage, to make us commit ourselves to a hard-and-fast rule. No doubt there are incompetent men in the service, and they should be removed. Mr KELLY. - How would the honourable member provide for that?",37
292,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is an unreasonable question to ask. There are undesirable men in every walk of life, and when the Bill is passed, those charged with its administrationwill do their duty by getting rid of them. But we should not impose an unfair obligation upon men who, in the past, have done good service, and against whom not a word of complaint has been heard.",38
293,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gippsland) [2.53] - I propose now to formally move the insertion of the words "" in practical work"" after the word "" fitness.""",38
294,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is already an amendment before the Chair, and, as it would block that of the honourable member, even if it were negatived, I suggest to the Minister that he should, in the first case, move only the omission of the word ""provided."" If that is carried, he can move the remainder of the amendment.",38
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [2.55] - I am opposed to the whole provision, but I do not wish 1 to prevent an honourable member from trying to perfect it. If the Committee votes against my amendment, I shall gladly accept that of - the honourable member for Gippsland.

That is now in the Bill, and, therefore, - we have provided that all the incompetents must be retained. The Bill now enacts that no incompetent officer can be dismissed. This proves that honourable members who supported the Minister in the last two divisions did not know what they were voting for. Whether an officer is incompetent or otherwise, no one will dare to interfere with the rank that he holds.",40
318,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That would not insure his retention in the forces.,40

320,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,40
321,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then so far as this Bill is concerned, the English language has no meaning. The Minister has announced that a new standard is to be set up equal to that of the Imperial Army, and that our organization is to be assimilated in every way to that of other parts of the Empire. If that is to be so, surely the chief officers of our forces ought to be those who have passed the latest and highest examinations. If we sent some of our present officers to take part in brigade operations with the Imperial Army, the Imperial officers would very soon reject them. While I have no objection to their staying in the forces in the ranks that they hold so long as they are competent, we ought to give seniority to more competent officers, if we have them, and this proposed new section provides that that shall be done. It is essentially fair that merit should bring a man to the top. I should like to have Lord Kitchener's view on this matter.",40
322,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"North Sydney) [3.36] - There is nothing in the provision which we have just inserted in the Bill-whic h I should have liked to see rejected-requirin g the retention of incompetent officers. Officers are to be retained* because they have proved their fitness by practical work. They are not to be required to pass examinations at the Military College. But, under this provision, officers who might not have shown their fitness by practical work, although they had passed examinations, would be given seniority. I do not think that that is desirable.",40

The effect of the provision might be that a very old and efficient officer who had shown his fitness by practical work might be superseded by a brilliant young student who had passed his technical examinations, but who did not possess the experience which the other had gained from long service.",41
324,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Franklin) [3.39]. - All that we wish to say is that when there is a vacancy the best-qualified officer ahall be promoted to it. The man who has passed an examination is to be preferred to the man who has not.,41
325,Mr REID,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The passing of an examination is to confer seniority, apart from any question of promotion.",41
326,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The man who is plucky enough to submit himself to examination, and able to pass the test, should be given seniority over those who do not do so. Imperial soldiers have expressed the opinion that we are not making sufficient provision for commissioned and non-commissioned officers. That is the weakness of the scheme. We should offer a premium to officers to study and make themselves efficient. That is done by saying that promotion shall go to those who pass examinations.",41
327,Mr REID,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Many men would not go to the Militarv College.,41
328,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If it were provided that only men W'ho had attended the Military College should be given seniority, I would not support the provision; but what we are asked to enact is that those who have passed the prescribed examinations in any part of Australia shall be given seniority over those who have not done so. Apparently, a set is likelv to be made against the proposed Military College; and, unless the Committee take care to preserve it, influences are at work which may do much to nullify our effort to create a suitable training school for commissioned and. non-commissioned officers. The proposal offers incentives to officers to studv and improve.",41
329,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Kalgoorlie) [3.44] - No doubt some honourable members are prepared to support the Government against this proposal without really considering it. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has correctly stated that we have guaranteed the positions of certain officers, whether they are competent or incompetent. It is expressly stipulated that they shall not be affected by the preceding provisions.",41
330,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is merely provided that they shall continue to hold their present rank.,41
331,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why should a man, who is only a Saturday-afternoon colonel, parading once or twice a year-and there are such officers, even about Melbournestand in the way of the promotion of the officer who, by diligent attention to his duties, and hard study, has qualified for promotion, and has shown his capacity to fill the position to the greater advantage of the State? The man who does nothing should not be preferred to the man who improves himself.  as the Lord Mayor of Melbourne did last vear.",41
332,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I believe that that is a case which is open to question. Such officers should not be allowed to stand in the way of the advancement of men of experience and ability, who have made themselves acquainted with the latest developments of military science.",41

Some of the measures now before the House-the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill, the Defence Bill, and the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, for instance-involv e very big questions; and honourable members who wish to acquaint themselves with the interests affected, and to intelligently represent their constituents, have to study very hard to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with all the details. Ministers are in a far better position, because they have their responsible officers to prepare statements for them, and all the information they require is at theirfingers'ends. It is trying, however, for a private member, who is endeavouring to faithfully discharge his duties, to have constant alterations of the business-paper, because this causes him to lose the thread of his study at times, and makes it much more difficult to retain a clear comprehension of the subjects' under discussion. I do not make a party question of this; but I hope that the Ministers Will see the justice of my complaint.",42
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [3.56] - In regard to the complaint of the honourable member for Cook, it seems to me that the Government have no evidence of the unpreparedness of the' Opposition. My experience is that members are too well prepared. However, .1 will consult with the Prime Minister on the subject. On Tuesday we will proceed with the Defence Bill.",42
344,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In reply to the question put by the honourable member for Herbert, I may be permitted to say that copies of statutorv rules are sent direct to honourable members from the Departments concerned, and that an effort will be made to insure that they shall be received by honourable members in ample time to enable objections to be made, if desired, within the time fixed by the law. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.58 p.m.",42
