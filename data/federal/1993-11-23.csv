1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Bon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at :2 p.m., and read prayers. NA Community Grants",11
2,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, .Sport and Territories. Under the community sporting facilities program the minister approved $19,000 for club rooms to the Logan City rugby club which has been established for around a decade and plays at Homestead Park in the Liberal electorate of Fadden. Under the same program the minister granted $95,000 for a clubhouse to the Logan· South Rugby and Sporting Club which was specifically formed to obtain a grant, but which, at the time it applied, had no teams and no grounds. The Logan South Rugby and Sporting Club had as its executive director Mr Mark Forrester,. private secretary to the member for Forde and the independent Labor mayoral candidate for Logan City, who proposed to locate his club'in the next-door Labor electorate of Forde and name his clubhouse the Mary Crawford pavilion. How does the minister justify this and wh-n will she resign?",11
3,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As the honourable member will know from the various questions he has asked me, these grantS are based on clear criteria and needs. In relation to the issue of the Logan South Rugby and Sporting Club, in the adjournment debate last night the honourable member for Forde outlined the details of this grant. I might go through those in a little detail. Logan City is, of course, one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. Forty per cent of the people are from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds and 40 per cent of the people are. under 25 years of age. Again, these are both target areas for grants. Logan City has a poor social infrastructure. For example, there is very little pl,lblic transunderstand port and there is a great need for community facilities. In 1992 the Queensland Rugby Union and the Logan City Netball Association .combined with local communities to put in place structures to give youth an opportunity. They developed rugby union and netball with teams ready to play in the 1993 competitions. Mr Costello-When were the applications?",11
4,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Higgins has· asked his question.,11
5,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Apparently in .rugby . the under 16s have made some finals and others have made state representative teams. Since then Marsden State High School has become involved and currently the club has received some money for floodlights. I understand those flooqlights are now being used by the community. . Clearly this program does identify needs and this is only one of the matters that arose in parliament yesterday during the discussion of these issues. As I listened to the censure debate yesterday, I took note of comments made by members of parliament and one of those comments was made by the honourable member for Wide Bay. He referred to grants in his electorate. One of them was to a BMX club which received a grant of $20,000.· He implied in his speech that this was a. waste of money and stated that the club had closed its. track. . What in fact has happened is that this club has temporarily closed its tra-k only while it works out how to pay the insurilnct1 it needs to have in case any rider. is injured. The members of this club are young children and fa-i1ies and have some difficulty coping with this cost. However,there is no doubt that this facility is needed.· I point out to honourable members that, until the facility is built, of course, the club does not receive any money. The nearest BMX track apparently is in Maryborough, and the children in this area have no alternative facility. The project has already been supported by th- local Lions club-I thought the honourable member would know that-and the council. The Lions club has helped build the track, which I cost $20,000. The club itself has built a kiosk and barbecue facilities, but the track is located in a recreation reserve which is open to the public and at the moment has nq toilet facilities. As has been outlined, this assistance was required to help provide these facilities. I have no doubt that this facility is well and truly needed in this area. I was quite astonished to hear that this club waS approached by a member of staff of the honourable member for Wide Bay, who apparently had said that, as in his view this project was not going to go ahead, he would ask whether he c01,lld have the money for another project. Government members-Ah!",11
6,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What was that? What did he say?,12
7,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He asked whether he could have the money for another project. During the speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay, who made that assumption, he also referred very critically to a grant allocated the Brothers· rugby club in Mackay. He was very critical of that grant being given, because he said that Mr Ed Casey was a member of that club. Mr Tim Fischer-I rise to speak on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The question was quite specific and quite unrelated to the remarks now being made by the minister, who has now turned to focus on another aspect of the debate. She should be brought back to order.",12
8,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister was asked a question regarding sports grants. This is an issue which I think has some moment within this place, judging from yesterday's events. The minister is in order, but I understand that she is getting to the end of her answer.",12
9,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am just concluding, Mr Speaker. I point out a fact in relation to this grant because, as I said, it was criticised primarily because. Mr Casey was a member. The House might be interested to note that people of great standing in Queensland also supported this project. Mr Tim Fischer-Ha, hal",12
10,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You might laugh, but those who supported it were Senator David MacGibbon, Senator Bill O'Chee, Senator Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen and the honourable member for Dawson, Mr Ray Braithwaite. All of those letters of endorsement are available. Mr Tim Fischer-So what! You still lost the paperwork.",12
11,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you would like, I could read some of those letters because they all explained that the area is in great need. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I ask that the minister table the documents in her hand in relation to this question. She has suddenly, selectively, found information in relation to her answer, and I ask that she table those documents.",12
12,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the minister prepared t<ftable any documents?,12
13,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to table, for the information of honourable members, the letters of endorsement from Florence BjelkePetersen; Senator David MACGIBBON; the fedeto ral member for Dawson, Mr Ray Braithwaite; and BiIIO'Chee, a senator from Queensland - and I also have one from Ian Macdonald that the opposition might like to have a look at too, the North Queensland Liberal senator.  Speaker! Mr Tim· Fischer-I rise on .a point of order, Mr Speaker. Other documents are sprawled over the bench. I invite you to put the question to her as to whether they are documents which should be tabled and, if so, direct her to so table them.",12
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister. is not prepared to table them?,12
15,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, they are confidential documents.",12
16,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Confidential documents. NA,12
17,Mr GRACE,APEC MEETING,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the result of the historic APEC meeting which has just concluded in Seattle? In particular, can he say what it means for Australia and what will be its practical results?",12
18,Mr KEATING,APEC MEETING,"As a result of the Seattle meeting, I think that, in general terms, Australians will be better off and the region will be more secure. In Seattle we saw the development of APEC as an executive body, represented by the leaders of the APEC states. It is a body which, over time, will mean jobs for Australians, our children and theirchildren. Those jobs will come from greater growth and velocity of trade in the Asia Pacific area and Australia's integration with it. It will help generate, and continue to generate, the spectacular growth rates which we have seen in the Asia-Pacific area generalto ly, and in North and South-East Asia in particular, where the growth rates have been so great-often, though, off a low base; we hope they will be able to be continued as the base of these economies continues to growand where the bottlenecks in these economies are dealt with by thinking about the region on a very broad and global basis. . As you know, Mr Speaker, already three-quarters of Australian exports go to the Pacific area. So we are already integrated. The area itself is a more integrated area than is the European Community or NAFfA. Sixty-six per cent of APEC countries' exports go to member states whereas in the European Community it is 61 per cent and in the North American free trade area it is 42 per cent. APEC is already a vastly more integrated area. As a consequence of the decisions taken organisationally and in policy terms over the last weekend, we will be able. to see that 75 per cent grow. It will grow not just by proportion but by quantity as well. The other thing that needs to be underlined is the fact that, as a consequence of APEC, where the world could have moved into three blocs-the European Community, a dollar bloc in the Americas and a yen bloc in Asia-we are joining together North and South Asia with the economies of North America. The consequence of that, which is so important to Australia and the whole world, is that we will not see the world break up into these areas. This fol1owed President Clinton's quite dramatic success in getting support for the North American free trade agreement through the House of Representatives and Senate of the United States. Conse- meeting. quently, the winds of free trade are blowing in the United States. Now we have America looking west, with that gaze to be joined by North Asia and South Asia, so that we will develop a very large basis of an economy in the Asia-Pacific area. Mr Tim Fischer-And Chile.",12
19,Mr KEATING,APEC MEETING,"And Chile in 12 months time. It will mean that we will not see a catastrophic division of interests in the Americas and in the Asia-Pacific. We do not have be political scientists to understand how critical it is-not just to world trade but to Australia's trade-that we are actually shipping into an area and participating in an area which is harmonising its activity, working cooperatively and keeping the world away from disastrous trade blocs. Everyone in the House knows that the GATT discussions are reaching their end point on 15 December, and President Clinton' has indicated that he intends to press hard to Asiaget a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round in these remaining weeks. Let us hope that we can see a trifecta here with NAFfA, APEC and with the GATT, because the three will change inexorably the future of the world in terms of trade and opportunities not just for developed countries but, most particularly, for So developing countries to give them a chance to have a bite at the apple of growth and prosperity which can lift incomes and employment in those countries. It was a very important and historic meeting. Not only is the facility of APEC guaranteed by its breadth, but at the meetings most leaders had bilateral meetings. I had bilateral meetings with four leaders and, of course, numerous discussions with others; so too did President Clinton, the Prime Minister of Japan, the President of China and the President of Indonesia. The consequence of that was that, in an environment which was not in a sense a foreign policy environment but a trade and investment environment, leaders could sit and get to know one another, be familiar with each other and be able to discuss subjects that they would real1y find great difficulty in discussing, in some cases, set up under, say, the aegis of a foreign policy The meeting had the spin-off of being very conducive to major nations sorting out problems and difficulties between themselves. So the chemistry of the meetings and the opportunity afforded by the meetings are almost important as the business of the meetings the commitment to the broader idea of an Asia-Pacific community and those elements which will make it up. As honourable members will know, the put meeting decided that the leaders will hold another meeting next year-1994-in Indonesia. President Suharto issued an invitation which was unanimously accepted. That will mean that th- business of the leaders will on. The leaders met without officials, which meant that matters under discussion were discussed by them individually. There was quite substantial progress at the meetings decisions were taken which will need to be worked on in the time before the 1994 meeting. That includes a draft noil-binding invest- . ment agreement as a forerunner to a formal investment agreement. The word 'historic' is thrown around probably too often in all sorts of contexts. However, in this case I think the occasion was historic. On the ferry coming back from the island, President Clinton said, 'The most extraordinary thing. about this meeting is it has actually. taken place; the most extraordidate-wait nary thing about this is that it has actually occurred'. At various times Australia has thought that it could perhaps become a member of the 010 or the 07 and then found itself locked out those forums, or participated in the OECD which has become more eurocentric OVer time. For Australia to be participating in a body such as this-a body which Australian ate? diplomacy has been very instrumental in setting up-is something which will stand in great stead. I come back to the practical aspect of the meeting. APEC, and the successful operation of APEC, will mean jobs for Australiansproposal more interesting jobs-higher incomes and, over time, access to markets and the developbut ment of markets that we could only dreamed of a few years ago. There will be a practical expression, and this is the link. Trade is often regarded as a dry subject as far as the press and other sections of the media are concerned but the link must be made to as what it really means: exports, jobsand interesting jobs-and higher incomes in a market far larger than anything Australia can provide on its own. All in all, it was an historic weekend, an historic meeting which in place a set of institutional arrangements which will serve Australia very well indeed. NA",13
20,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"This is probably an go opportune time to inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the President of the European Parliament, Dr Egon Klepsch, together with members of a parliamentary delegation from the European Parliament. On behalf of the House, I extend and a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Communi-y Grants",14
21,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, and all those other good things. In November last year, the minister made a whirlwind tour through my electorate that in the company of my opponent, ALP candifor it-Dr Pain, and immediately announced on the spot a $150,000 dollar-fordollar grant for an environmental education resource centre, which was not even designed and for which no written application had been of made. I ask the minister whether a formal application was ever made. If so, can she say whether it was approved and when the money for the project will be delivered to my elector",14
22,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am just relying on·memit ory, but my understanding is that when I visited that electorate a proposaJ was put to me which was demonstrated to me. I said that we would look at that when any formal was submitted. I do not know whether there has been a formal proposal submitted, my understanding is that there has been have no money put into any such proposaL Superannuation",14
23,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer provide information to the House of the obligations the new superannuation industry supervision legislation will place on superannuation schemes? Further, can the Treasurer advise the House of the benefits this new supervisory regime will provide to superannuation policy holders?",14
24,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The parliament has now passed the government's package of seven bills, which were introduced into the parliament in May of this year, and they now await royal assent. The package represents a major advance in the protection of superannuation savings and it will enhance the scope of members to participate in the management of their funds. The main objectives of the legislation are to ensure that trustees are more accountable and responsible to their fund members, to provide scope for members to play a greater role in the activities of the fund and to ensure that superannuation is used for genuine retirement purposes. The legislation is to apply, in the majority of cases, from July of next year, which means that funds will have a period of about seven months in which to familiarise themselves with these new arrangements and to arrange their affairs to ensure that they comply. Funds that wish to receive the taxation concessions that go along with complying funds will need to elect to be subject to the provisions of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, and in many cases this will require an amendment to their deeds. Now that the legislation is in place, it is important that funds apprise themselves of their responsibilities and take whatever steps are necessary in order to ensure that they comply by the middle of next year. The government is continuing to investigate ways of reducing the administrative and financial burdens faced by corporate trustees in complying with the requirements of both the ISC and the ASC and it is hoped that an announcement can be made on' this matter within a matter of weeks. The legislation also establishes a superannuation complaints tribunal. This tribunal can, from July of next year, deal with complaints that relate to a decision, or indeed the failure to make a decision, by a trustee in relation to an individual. In an overall sense this new supervisory regime will provide a relatively high level of protection to superannuation savings whilst not unduly restricting the efficiency of the superannuation industry or imposing unreasonable supervisory or compliance costs. These measures include a high level of trustee and investment manager responsibility, greater protection to members through enhanced equal representation and disclosure requirements, and tighter in-bouse investment requirements. Taken together, the prudential measures will substantially enhance the government's retirement income policy objectives into the 21st century by ensuring that current and future retirees will have better and more secure retirement income. The legislative package will provide a statutory basis for a superannuation industry in which Australians can have confidence. They can have confidence that their retirement savings are secure, that they as individuals will be treated fairly and that their superannuation funds are invested effectively and productively. I do want to mention the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, chaired in its earlier period by Senator Sherry and more recently by Senator Watson of the Liberal Party. The members of that committee, and particularly the two chairmen, have been very constructive in the input into the finalisation of the legislation. I would also like to thank the honourable member for Petrie who, as my parliamentary secretary, did such a great job in piloting this legislation through the parliament. Community Grants",15
25,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories-and election grants.",15
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member will refer to ministers by their correct titles, without comment from my left.",15
27,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is it a fact that she was advised by her department not to process the community grant applications through her office and that they should be handled by the department?,15
28,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All the correspondence in relation to this matter has gone to the Auditor-General. I referred to that process in the letter to the Auditor-General. I will go through that with honourable members. I said: My decisions are documented in advice to the department from my office and formally approved via approval of a submission. Grants are only approved on the basis that they conform with the formal conditions of this program. It is very interesting to see the response and enthusiasm that one gets from members of parliament such as the honourable member for Dawson. I would like to refer to a letter from the honourable member for Dawson in relation .to the Brothers club. That matter was raised in parliament yesterday. Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance and standing order 145. This question which has been put to the minister is very serious. It goes to the basis propriety in this place and she should answer it in the simplest and shortest way she likes. Mr Brereton interjecting Mr Thckey-Don't let me start on you, Laurie. We will talk about your mates.",16
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Resume your seat. Now that the honourable member for O'Connor has resumed his seat, I will say again to him that on a number of occasions now I have had to counsel the honourable member on the way he approaches the dispatch box. It is obvious that my counselling has not been that successful to date; but I am trying again. When you take a point of order, you raise the point of order-and that is it. I will then adjudicate. The minister has been asked a question relevant to matters within her portfolio. She will answer, relevant to the question.",16
30,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was referring to the issue of enthusiasm of members of parliament for some of these processes, even to some members of the opposition. This letter relates to the issues of the Brothers football club. I would like to read some sections of it to show how enthusiastie members of the opposition are about this program. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. Under standing order 145 you gave a direction following the point of order raised by the honourable member for O'Connor that the minister would answer the question which specifically asked whether she was advised by her department 'not to process the community grants applications through her office and that they should be handled by the department'? The minister is .now on a foray into a whole range of other matters which are not relevant to this question. She is ignoring your ruling.",16
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have made your point of order. You will resume your seat. Your point of order goes to the issue of relevance. I have suggested to the ministerindeed, said to the minister-that she will respond to the specifics of the question. I invite her to do so.",16
32,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I must point out to the Speaker and to honourable members of this House that this was a grant-and the letter is of addressed to me. It is not addressed to my department. It is a letter about a grant and it is addressed to me, as the minister supporting this project.",16
33,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, that is not relevant.",16
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is entirely in order.,16
35,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It represents a major improvement in facilities in Mackay. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order is that this minister does not have the right to defy your ruling-and your ruling is that she answer the specific question. You have twice ruled that reading out this letter is irrelevant to the question-and she is defying you.",16
36,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat. I have said to the minister to answer the specifics of the question. In respect of that, in the last part of this answer the minister has come to the specifics of a project, as raised by the honourable member. Mr MCGauran-Reread the question.",16
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is in order.,16
38,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, I was referring to a letter addressed to me as minister from the honourable member for Dawson. I have noted from the application that the club has a large equity in the project. He talks about its being a major improvement in facilities, and it is an integrated recreational and sporting complex. This does illustrate the point that this project and projects like this have a great deal of support, with advice coming to me from various members of parliament about these sorts of projects. It goes through formal processes based on need, as I have outlined many times in this parliament and to the Auditor-General.",16
39,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order which relates to standing order 151. It reads: Questions may be asked without notice. At the discretion of the Speaker supplementary questions may be asked to elucidate an answer. Mr Speaker, this is a serious question that goes to the heart of the integrity of the minister. I ask you to exercise your discretion and allow us to ask a supplementary question so that we might actually get an answer to this.",17
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has given an answer. I understand that the minister has concluded that answer. Education,17
41,Ms CRAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. In the light of next week's planned meeting of state and Commonwealth education ministers in Hobart, can the minister advise the House Qn progress in the national reform agenda?",17
42,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question, which it gives me considerable pleasure to answer for two reasons. The first is that the attempt of the conservative states to sabotage a national approach to school .education has failed. Honourable members may remember that, at the last education ministers' meeting in July in Perth, the Victorian and West Australian ministers rejected the advice of their officials and attempted to block crucial education reforms. The position of ministers Moore and Hayward was that Australia was not one nation, that Australian families presumably never moved interstate, and that there is no need for the national statements and profiles which are designed to assist the states and territories to coordinate what is taught in key learning areas across state boundaries. The manifest idiocy of their argllment is now apparent, and work on the statements and profiles is under way across the country. To the infinite embarrassment of the reactionaries who oppose for the sake of opposing, the first state to introduce the profiles is New South Wales, where they are part of the new English syllabus. New South Wales is no particular friend of this government, but at least the minister there, Mrs Chadwick, recognises a good idea when she sees one and she understands that, when it comes to education, children's rights are more important than specious rhetoric about states rights. The second reason I am pleased to respond to the honourable member's question is that the progress that we are making demonstrates the absolute irrelevance of this opposition to education and training. The opposition spokesman on schools in this place, the honourable member for Menzies, has demonstrated all the intellectual rigour and nexibility of the 19th century opponents of federation. He has told us that we should not bother training young people because they will never get jobs. I will quote brieny the key aspect of the opposition's non-policy on education and training from a speech by the honourable member for Menzies back in June. He said: We are likely to have a large permanently unemployed work force. Their education will be wasted if it equips them only to. make cogs and perform inqustrial processes that they will never be involved with because they are unlikely to get jobs. They must be educated for rational leisure. This is the kind of nonsense that the government confronts as it seeks to reform our TAFE and training system and ensure that all young Australians have access to job generating, economically productive and socially responsible training. It is. not even as though this opposition and its sidekicks are consistent in their negativity, because they are actually opposed to anew initiative designed to let the states make decisions about the distribution of Commonwealth funds for students suffering from educational disadvantage. That is the proposed broadbanding of equity funds. So here is a case where the great advocates of states rights are, at the same time, saying that the states cannot be trusted to run their own schools. At least we cannot· accuse members of the opposition of being inflexible in their views. Frankly, this is the level of opposition I expect we will see in Hobart next week. The sensible states, regardless of party persuasion, will get on with the job of debating and implementing the national schools and training refonns that Australia needs to ensure that its work force has the skills needed to compete in the global economy. While they do, the opponents of refonn will whinge and whine and say that there is no need for change and that the Commonwealth has no role to play in the education and training of young Australians. It is hardly surprising that it is Western Australia which, at the last minute, wants to put the question of the Commonwealth's financial role in schools up for debate at next week's meeting. Minister Moore at this stage has not told the Commonwealth what he proposes, but it is not hard to guess considering a letter he wrote to me this week in which he said that the Commonwealth had no role in the national refonn agenda. It is a sad fact that the letter from Minister Moore to me contains a spelling error, and that simply confinns my view that we need to fight very hard to keep Commonwealth literacy funds flowing to Western Australia. I look forward to a constructive meeting in Hobart and to explaining to Mr Moore and to his allies in this place that the Commonwealth governs for all Australians, that it directly spends over $4 billion a year on schools and TAFEs and that, when it comes to education, Australia is one nation and not a collection of squabbling principalities. Community Grants",17
43,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I will try this question just one more time to see whether she can answer it. Does she deny that her department advised her not to process the community grants applications through her office?",18
44,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition has indicated that he is going to ask this question one more time. That is outside the standing orders. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker!,18

49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for O'Connor. Bougainville,18
50,Mr LANGMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Is the minister aware of the Amnesty International report Human rights abuses on Bougainville? How effective is Australian assistance to PNG in contributing to a political settlement of the Bougainville problem and thereby promoting a climate in which human rights abuses of the kind described by Amnesty are less likely to occur?,18
51,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In acknowledging the question from the honourable member for Fraser, I think few members of this House have displayed a longer, more consistent, more infonned and more sympathetic interest in Papua New Guinea than the honourable member. The report to which the honourable member refers-the Amnesty report Human rights abuses on Bougainville-I have seen. Indeed, Amnesty International has also written to me separately advising me of its principal findings on the human rights abuses on Bougainville by-I emphasise this, as its report does-both sides to that conflict. Since the report has been brought down, I notice and welcome that the PNG government, through the person of the defence minister, Minister Tohian, has said it will fully address the report and the recommendations it makes. In referring to the question raised by the honourable member, Australia in cooperation with the PNGgovernment has so far committed a total of around $4.6 million in rehabilitation assistance to the people of Bougainville. In 1991-92, Australia provided more than $620,000 in the form of medical supplies, vaccines, shelter and household equipment. In addition, within the last financial year, a consigriment of text books worth $259,000 was delivered as the first component of a $2 million support program which I announced when I was on Buka earlier in the year. In July, an ""additional $2 million was committed to aid health services on Bougainville and further assist the restoration of education programs. This commitment is intended to provide much needed medical supplies such as drugs and immunisation equipment and very basic requirements such as generators and water tanks. Further to that commitment, Australian and PNG officials have jointly identified projects for $4 million of the $4.6 million allocated, and I expect that all of this money will be spent within this financial year. In this practireferred cal way, we are contributing to a normalisation of political life on Bougainville and to an environment in which the kinds of human rights abuses referred to in the Amnesty report are less likely to occur. There is a point where Australia's ability to help stops. By that I mean that a solution to the problems on Bougainville is, in the end, up to the PNG government and to the people of Bougainville. As long as the conflict on that island continues, the humanitarian and deVelopment assistance which we are offering will be of limited value to the people of Bougainville. The obvious answer to the problems of human rights abuses is that the welfare of the people of the province will not be secure until the Bougainville revolutionary army abandons its violent and destructive activities and in turn allows the PNG defence force units that are operating there to get off their war footing. I conclude on this sombre note: this week an Australian aid inspection mission to Bougainville had to be called off because of concerns which I and AIDAB held for the safety of the personnel involved. When access for this sort of mission becomes assured, then and only then will Australian assistance to the troubled province of Bougainville be fully effective in helping the PNG government restore services and normal life. Community Grants",18
52,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Exactly what sort of record of the reasons for and the process of the distribution of grants under the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program was made by the minister's office? Was this process supervised by her senior staff officer and former ALP national assistant secretary, Mr Ken Bennett? Were any documents or notes of any sort relating to the process of grant distribution destroyed? If so, on whose authority or order did this destruction occur?",19
53,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have said every day in this parliament for the last week, all the records in relation to this matter have been to the Auditor-General. He has had access to all of them. He has had access to every single document that is available. Labour Market Programs",19
54,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Is the minister aware of assertions that labour market programs provide n6 lasting benefits? Is there any evidence to support these assertions?",19
55,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice a comment that purports to come from the opposition shadow Treasurer in which he ruled out spending on programs to help the long-term unemployed, saying that they had been tried around the world on many occasions. The programs that are in place in my department in regard to the long-term unemployed are highly successful and very important for their chances of getting into the work force. There is also a net increase in jobs that flows from that. think a couple of points need to be made about it. Firstly, there are the distributional and equity benefits that flow from them. Labour market programs increase the chances of a unemployed people who are the recipients of them to get work and, therefore, get income. Their attitude to life changes dramatitraineeship cally when they are able to effectively fully participate in society. Secondly, the effective programs can sigskills nificantly reduce the aggregate numbers of long-term unemployed. Even though the upswing number of program places is limited budget constraints, it is now clear that the growth in the total number of long-term unemployed has been constrained by the crease effective implementation of the programs that operate from my department. Thirdly, international and Australian search demonstrates that it is important ensure that unemployed people are kept as competitive as possible for the labour market and that, if they are not kept as competitive as possible, several consequences flow, not least being a question of the efficiency of whole operation of the labour market. This means that, even with quite high levels of unemployment, skills in the community drop away. and one gets skills bottlenecks much quicker in a period of recovery, with the consequence that unemployment plateaus at higher and higher levels with each recession. My department has put in place analysis of how successful its programs have been and its conventional assessment has based on a survey three months after complekeep tion. With those definitions at the three month point, jobstart, which is a private wage sector subsidy, is showing a 60 per cent success rate; jobclubs, which helps with jobsearch, per cent; skillshare, which is community based training and support, 42 per cent. But I think the honourable member will interested to know that more recently my recession department has done a study based on a sixwill month out period, not just the three months. Basically, the statistics have not effectively altered all that much. In the case of jobstart, it is still 60 per cent; in the case of jobclubs, I 44 per cent, which is down one per cent; and, in the case of skillshare, 36 per cent, which is down a few percentage points. That is a very good result. The one scheme which we do not talk about great deal here is the Australian traineeship scheme. There is another survey which is two an years out from being in receipt of a and the success rate there is 87 per cent. These programs are most successful in periods when there is a rise in demand for in the community. Therefore, they are most successful when there is somewhat of an going on in the labour market, which by is what we are experiencing now. Tomorrow, or later today, my department will release figures on the last month's inin skilled vacancies. It will show that there }las been a seven per cent jump in one month to the highest level of skilled vacancies resince September 1990. Compared with a year to ago, this shows a considerable performance across all states. The result is particularly gratifying in my home state of Western Australia where the skilled vacancies are up 83 per cent on that period, despite the efforts the by the state government to sack large numbers of people. But, of course, Western Australia has been the substantial beneficiary of the sorts of industrial policies that this government has pursued over the last 10 years. All states have benefited, but the type of environment is particularly encouraging to Western Australian business and that is why we see a detailed those sorts of statistics. The point is that, unless an opportunity is been made available for unemployed people to themselves job. ready and to improve their skills, they simply cannot benefit from this sort of upswing. What happens is that 12 months or a couple of years out from now the 45 Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is battened onto by business all over the country, demanding the importation of skilled be labour. That has always happened after every in the past. It is possible that that happen again in this instance. But that requirement will be mitigated by the fact that we have in place a large number of highly successful labour market programs, both providing jobs and ensuring that the unemployed are job ready.",19

58,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for La Trobe gave some incorrect information in his question. 1 understand he was referring to the Friends of Cardinia Reserve, an application received on 28 August. The closing date was 3 September 1992. So he was wrong in saying that no application has been received. At this stage the project has not proceeded, so no grant money will be forthcoming until the project has actually proceeded. MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, NA",21
59,Mr COSTELLO,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,";-I seek leave to move forthwith the following motion: That this House censures the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories for the maladministration of her department, political bias selection of grants under the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program, and failure to account to this House in relation to this program. Leave not granted. . Suspension of Standing and Sessional",21
60,Mr COSTELLO,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Higgins) (2.51 p.m.)I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Higgins from moving forthwith-that this House censures the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories for the maladministration of her department, political bias in the selection of grants under the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program and her failure to account to this House in relation to this program. The reason standing orders need to be suspended is to allow a motion to be put to this House to consider some very grave matters, about not only the expenditure of public funds under a $30 million program that dished out $30 million in three months prior to the 1993 election, but also the absolute incompetence of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) when she was asked to account to this House in relation to that program in the question time that has just concluded. They were very simple questions. The minister was asked whether she was advised by her department not to process grants through her office. She was asked it not once; she was asked it twice. She was absolutely unable to come to the dispatch box to say yea or nay. It was a very simple question. If you were advised by the department, all you had to say was, 'Yes, I was advised but I did not accept it', and give some justification. If you were not advised, if you have nothing to hide, all you had to do was come to that dispatch box and'say, 'I was not given that advice'. But for. you to walk to that dispatch box and to say this has all been cleared in an Motion Auditor-General's report-which has absolutely damned you; to say that the procedure was clear when in his report the Auditor-General finds that there is no audit trail that he can investigate; to mouth over and over again in in the the most simplistic, incompetent way the letters that the Auditor-General referred to in her his report as disclosing a lacuna, a hiatus, a blank, a missing portion of the documents; and to say that that damning indictment somehow explains to this House what has actually happened, is nothing short of incompetence. Orders The reason standing orders have to be suspended today is so that this House can take stock of what this particular minister said; can take stock of the refusal to answer and account to this House; can take stock of this minister's responsibility to this House and to the people of Australia; and can decide for itself whether it is time for this minister to get in the government car and head out to Yarralumla to terminate the commission which she is so obviously unable to fulfil. It is not only in relation to that particular question-a question that the minister found herself to be absolutely incapable of answering-but also in relation to the question of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia (Dr Wooldridge). The deputy leader asked a very simple question; he asked you whether any documents in your office had been destroyed. It is a very simple question. They either have been or have not been. If they have not been destroyed, why do you not walk the two feet to the dispatch box and say it? I will tell you why: because you know that, if you were to say that, you would run the risk of misleading the House-and then even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), low as the standards are that he maintains in relation to his ministers, might be forced to act in relation to you. But, if the documents have been destroyed, why do you not come to the dispatch box and answer that question as well? Why do you not say why it. was done? Why do you not say what the outcome was? Why do you not say whether it was Mr Bennett who was involved? Why do you not come clean to this House' and account to this House, as a minister of the Crown is obliged and required to do? You know, this House has a point. It is not just so that the minister can sit there and engage in idle chatter with the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon)-an air passenger in search of it dog show-as if she is not interested and not concerned; it is not just so that she can. do that and engage in that kind of small talk and pretend that nothing is actually happening here",21
61,Mrs KELLY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,I am listening.,22
62,Mr COSTELLO,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Yes, yes; we have got your interest. Wonderful. Perhaps you can apply your interest to the audit functions and the responsibility of a minister of the Crown. Perhaps you could take this censure motion and walk to the dispatch box and start to give this House some of the answers that it has been looking for. The Auditor-General's report came down last Tuesday and, as we said yesterday, it did not catch you by surprise. You had been engaged in discussions with the Auditor General long before the report came out. You were given the opportunity from Wednesday of last week to come in, answer questions and defend yourself. As the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) said yesterday, it was one of the classic cases where any lawyer would have said to a client, 'Your best defence is to say nothing today'. On each of those occasions you went through the standard practice, as you do .now, of digging out correspondence or letters or referring to what some member or senator in Queensland has written to you. You are doing everything you possibly can but answering the charges and coming to grips with the Auditor-General's report. That is why we need to suspend standing orders now. We need to suspend standing orders now so that the case can again be put and you can again have the opportunity to come forward with any information that could possibly defend the position that you have taken. You should come forward so that this House, this gallery and the people of Australia can actually assess your performance and hold you to the same standard required of every minister. As I said yesterday, there are no special standards across there. It is not a case of your saying, 'I'm not expected to do as well as any other minister'. There is but one standard: the standard of accountability in relation to the public. trust of the office' of minister. ' This House has the right to determine whether you have what 'it takes to be a minister. I am afraid to say that all the evidence lined up in relation to this particular matter says that you have not. You might have been good at looking after Labor electorates or funnelling taxpayers' moneys into marginal seats before the March 1993 election, but you are no good at being a minister. You are no good at being accountable. You are no good at being upheld by the Auditor General. You are no good at keeping documents. You are no good at taking the department into your confidence .. You are no good at the administration of the trust you have. I will tell honourable members why the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, will not be allowing a suspension of standing orders. If standing orders were suspended, the minister would be getting up to defend herself. I bet that the minister at the table stands up as Leader of the House in reply to this motion. He has had enough of sitting by and watching the minister trying to defend herself. He will take this on a procedural basis now so that he can stand up and try to do what she cannot. She cannot defend herself and the Leader of the House cannot defend her either because he knows that there is a stench here which is developing and growing. It is a stench that will not go away while you have a minister who cannot account, explain, take a debate, run a defence or give an explanation; while you have a minister who cannot tell why non-existent rugby clubs in one electorate get $95,000 when rugby clubs that have been going for decades can get only $19,000. Whilst you have a minister who cannot stand here and account for those sorts of things, of course you do not want to take these debates. Of course you are running for cover.",22
63,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Me? I am running for cover?,23
64,Mr COSTELLO,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Yes, you are. We got a lovely little smile out of you on that occasion, because you know that this minister weighs down the whole ministry. You know that as a result of her failure and incompetence, the ministry-which, may I say, has very little talent in any event-cannot come out and do anything positive because the stench is running and the smell is there. You know that in relation to this $30 million there was no proper accounting. You know that the Auditor-General was right and that it cannot be explained. I will tell you another thing: it cannot be covered up either. It is about time that this House came to grips with this, it is about time the standing orders were suspended, and it is about time the matter was brought on for a full, honest, proper debate. It is about time that this motion was passed so that this minister can account.",23
65,Mr SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Order! Is the motion seconded?,23
66,Mr RONALDSON,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Ballarat) (3.00 p.m.)I second the motion, Mr Speaker. The standing orders need to be suspended today for a number of reasons. The first one is that we failed to get an answer today to a very simple question: was the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) advised by the department not to process community grant applications through her office and that they should be handled by the department itself? We have not received an answer to this. The simple fact is that the minister could have come into this House and said, 'I said to the department I want to handle them myself'. She could have quite simply done that. The reason that she has not done so is a very clear indication to this side of the House that she knows dam well that it was good advice. That is why she has not said yes. It is a very simple question. Either she did or she did not. She cannot refer back to the Auditor General's report because the Auditor-General made it quite clear that there was paperwork missing that he believed should have been provided to the department and it simply was not. The standing orders need to be suspended today because the minister has failed time and time again to answer the allegation in the report that in Labor marginal seats, the grants were two for one. I will go through it again. The average grant to a Labor held seat was $257,000 and to a coalition held seat, $141,000. The average grant to a marginal Labor held seat was $326,000 and to a marginal coalition held seat, $163,000. Standing orders need to be suspended again today because the minister has failed her primary responsibility to the house and that is to tell the truth about this situation. She has failed time after time. She has the gall to tell the press that she is sick of talking about it and she is not going to make any personal comments. We are not sick and tired of talking about it and we will pursue this matter. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has raised an extremely vital point today about the Logan rugby club. The simple fact is that the suspension of standing orders is absolutely necessary for the coalition to pursue with this minister the matters that related to the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) and, indeed, her employee Mr Forrester. The information available to the coalition today is that meetings were indeed held by Mr Forrester in the office of the honourable member for Forde, where he said to a group of people who were invited, 'I've got a hundred thousand dollars in the bag; you're going to get a combined application to spend this money'. Standing orders must be suspended for the opposition to pursue a matter whereby in 15 minutes yesterday the minister said that this was all based on needs. How can this be based on needs when the money has been allocated before the applications close? How can the minister determine needs before the applications close? That is patently ridiculous. Indeed, the standing orders need to be suspended for the minister to tell this House how she can decide matters on a needs basis before the applications close. It is patent nonsense. The minister is denigrating herself and, indeed, she is denigrating the government. If we look at the rest of the Auditor General's report, we find that he has said to the minister, 'You can simply resolve this matter, minister, by bringing forward the information that I have requested'. That was the reason-it was quite simple-for these applications being granted: the grants worth $30 million that went two for one into Labor marginal seats. Today the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) has said, 'Why don't you tell us what the reasons were?'. The minister knows that her office has· them. We are simply saying, 'Minister, you show us the reasons and then we will see whether What you are saying is correct or whether the matters alleged by the Auditor-General are indeed correct themselves'. It is a simple matter. The minister knows they exist because she faxed a letter to the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who is the Minister for Finance, with a list of applications that had come out of his electorate. Not one person on this side of the House had received a letter from the minister asking which of those applications met with our approval-not one single person on this side of the House. But the Minister for Finance did. Guess what was up the top of the letter? It states: 'Willis, Gellibrand, safe Labor'. (Time expired)",23
67,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has answered every single point that those opposite brought against her in the course of the censure debate yesterday and in the course of question time both yesterday and today. Their accusations, directed towards her, are ridiculous as they attempt to desperately construct mountains out of their molehills. Everyone opposite who was involved in applications under this program knew exactly what they were engaged in. As one example, I take the letter of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) who wrote directly to the minister in the course of the applications being out for these grants. There are no secrets about them. He said: I write in support of the application of the Brothers' Football Club, Mackay, who are seeking assistance under the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities. program. This project represents a major improvement in the facilities of Mackay ... I have noted from the application that the club has a large equity in the project and the anticipated heavy involvement of local firms for the supply of materials and labour is also noteworthy in the current economic climate. I commend this application by the committee of the Brothers' Football Club for your favourable consideration. The honourable member for Dawson knew exactly who to write to about this program. He knew that approvals under this program were being made by the minister. He was not on his scrapers at the end of last year on these issues; nor were any of the others who put up applications for these propositions. None of them when this was out last year was up on their scrapers and saying, 'Minister, we don't like the fact that you are approving these propositions. We· would rather that you separate all forms of approval for these projects from your office and put them inside the department and that you should never see them. It would be a terrible thing if you were to involve yourself in any way in this project'. Those opposite had plenty of opportunity to do that. There was no great secret about the propositions that were being put forward. They were out there openly in the public for those opposite to take a look at and to participate in the process. They did so, I might say, appropriately, like a pack of hungry dogs around a bone. Many of those opposite succeeded, and succeeded substantially. The problem with taking the averaging that those opposite have been taking is that when one reaches below the averaging one sees obviously that some other set of processes was at work simply than the suggestion that it should be awarded to one set of seats of a political persuasion as opposed to another set of seats of a political persuasion. Mr Ronaldson interjecting",24
68,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"So we are going to have a needs based funding arrangement for sporting facilities to provide additional backyard tennis courts in Toorak. Is that going to be the sort of proposition that those opposite put forward that will produce equalisation across the board? If we are to do needs based funding for any of these sorts of propositions, two things will happen. Firstly, there is likely to be an emergence of grants going to areas of relatively poor status and newly developed. There is no walking away from that. That is what is going to happen. What did happen? The electorate of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), which conforms with that, for example, received some $422,000-$12,000 more than the electorate adjacent to it. The electorate the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), who has just spoken, received more than the average in this program. His was precisely the same proposition. Mr Costello-Trying to buy the seat.",25
69,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"I see. So this is the argument: if it goes to marginal Labor seats it is because we are buying the seat; if it to marginal Liberal seats it is because we are buying the seat. Those opposite have managed to get a pretty good argument together here. They can get us coming and going. They complain if money goes to Labor seats because we are obviously trying to bribe the electorate, but if it goes to Liberal seats we are trying to bribe the electorate against the opposition. This is the argument that we now have on this matter from the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party, of course, has hated the sight of the minister for the environment ever since she hit the front bench. There is obviously a deep, passionate and abiding view amongst Liberal members of the opposition front-bench because every time they stand up they allude to something that we never even contemplate on this side of the House, and the mover of the motion did so again today. He said, 'The only reason this censure motion is not being taken up' - ignoring the fact that one was taken up yesterday- 'is that the minister happens to be on the front bench wearing a skirt'. That was the proposition that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) put forward. Mr Costello-Oh, no; that is not so. That is not what I said.",25
70,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,That has been the position of the Liberal Party on this matter. How ill it has deserved the substantial support it has had from Australian women over the years. How ill it has deserved that.,25
71,Unknown,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,Opposition members interjecting,25
72,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Liberal members cannot help themselves when they stand up in this place to attack the minister. They cannot sustain 10 minutes worth of argument on the administration of her portfolio without having a go at her because of her gender. They cannot resist it. Having clearly established of how truly worthless they are, let me proceed with what it is they are attempting to do. Mr Downer-That is a disgrace. You are using her sex to defend her.",25
73,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"I did not raise it; those opposite raised it. As far as I am concerned, if they are going to raise something in. the course of this debate they will get an answer. goes They have their answer as far as that matter is concerned.",25
74,Mr SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"The Leader of the House might just wait for a moment. Those on my left will cease interjecting-particularly the honourable member for Higgins, who has already had an opportunity to put his point of view. The honourable member for Mayo is also getting a little excited. The Leader of House is entitled to be heard in defence of the motion that is before the House. Mr Downer-He is making sexist remarks.",25
75,Mr SPEAKER,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,I do not require any argument from the honourable member for Mayo.,26
76,Mr BEAZLEY,SPORT AND TERRITORIES,"Some of the complaints those opposite raised today related to the way in which the approval process was established. It is always up to a minister to deter- pired) mine the ways in which any particular program is established, the extent to which he or she will seek advice from the department, and the extent to which he or she will be actively engaged in the minutiae of the selection process or will distance themselves from it. It is a matter of a minister's choice with every conceivable program. In my department, if I wanted to, I could get into a situation where I personally awarded jobstart positions to people out in the community, but my department happens to operate under my delegation. Because of the dimensions of the program, that process is sensible. The question is not the extent to which the minister is involved in the detail of any particular departmental decision making; the question is the extent to which the minister or the minister's department has upheld the basis on which the program has been detailed-has made awards that are explainable within the context of the detail of the program. Absolutely nothing that those opposite have said, either in question time today, in question time yesterday or in debate on the censure motion has made any sort of dent at all on the minister's proposition that the details of the criteria for awarding those grants have been conformed with-and those opposite know it. There were a few exceptions to that, which were mentioned by the Auditor-General, as there are a few exceptions in any program that a department runs. Of those few exceptions, the minister has said to the Auditor General that that is a matter that she is going to inquire into and correct. But the fact of the Wooldridge, M. R. L. matter is that you have not been able to lay a glove on the vast bulk of what has been awarded. You know very well that the criteria that the have been laid down will inevitably produce a situation which will benefit poorer Australians in developing areas. Those people happened-by and large, but not exclusively-to vote for us. Is it your serious contention that the sorts of seats that the bulk of you happen to represent would score in a needs based program? You are talking a nonsense. That is why you do not deserve your opportunity to argue a second censure motion.' (Time ex",26

78,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. I ask, immediately ahead of the very important Mabo debate to start later this afternoon in the House of Representatives and to continue for the rest of the week, whether you are aware of attacks on members on both sides of the House accusing them of acting improperly, or suggesting that they NOES might, on the Mabo issue due to certain shareholdings in mining companies' pastoral leases, including attacks on coalition frontbenchers and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. Is the Register of Members' Interests maintained by the Clerk as registrar? Is it available for public perusal in accordance with the relevant guidelines? Will you accordingly counsel the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who made some of these cowardly attacks as late as 7.45 this morning?",27
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I can say to the Leader of the National Party that any comment about members or members' interests relevant to the Mabo debate, which will be before this parliament later this afternoon, I have seen only in some newspaper commentary today, although I understand that there was also some comment made on radio broadcasts, but I did not hear that. With respect to the Register of Members' Interests, the register may be inspected by members with prior appointment in the office of the registrar-who is, of course, the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Mr Barlin-between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 noon and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays.

Parliamentary Library",27
80,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, yesterday an anonymous note was circulated to a number of MPs purporting to include an extract from a March 1993 report of the Advisory Committee on the Proposed Creation of a Department of Parliamentary Information and Reporting Services. The item as included in that note states: It is important that the current situation in the Parliamentary Library NOT be allowed to continue into 1994. The Parliamentary Library must be restored to its former independent status under an efficient professional librarian. John Brudenall is the best professional Parliamentary Librarian in the country. He is dedicated in the provision of quality service and should have been placed in the job after the retirement of the previous Librarian, Hillas Maclean. John Templeton is not a professional librarian; his main concern is with his own status and salary; he has no vision for the future of the library and concern for unbiased service to Members of Parliament. He is heavily biased to the ALP, as is his latest appointment in the Research service. He cannot be allowed to continue as Acting Parliamentary Librarian. Mr Speaker, the question I have for you is: is this claim an extract from the report mentioned? If so, and considering the recent complaints· and bad experience of members relating to the impartiality of some library staff, will you as the officer responsible to the parliament conduct confidential inquiries to clarify the issue and take such stepi!as are necessary to guarantee to all members of the House the enthusiastic and impartial services for which the library was renowned?",27
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I can say to the honourable member, and to all honourable members in this place, that the specific issue to which he referred has arisen because of a report, which the honourable member referred to, having been tabled in this parliament in May of this year. It was a report of a committee which was established by my predecessor and the President of the Senate' to examine the amalgamation of the Department of the Padiamentary Reporting Staff and the Department of the Parliamentary Library. That report, which contains a majority report recommending that the amalgamation proceed-and I might say the committee was chaired under the very capable chairmanship of the honourable member for Aston-and a minority report has been the subject of consideration by the President of the Senate and myself. It is my intention-and because of standing orders 'I will not go into great lengths on this-to introduce a bill tomorrow within this parliament which picks up the recommendations of the particular committee report. In respect of issues associated with the independence of the library, those matters are to be addressed in the second reading speech tomorrow. They are indeed very much a part of the committee's deliberations and the sorts of issues which the President of the Senate and I took on board when we deliberated on that matter. I can only suggest to the honourable member for O'Connor-because I too have seen the note, and he was gracious enough to leave no out another line which I think was inappropriate-that it has been circulated by some perhaps disgruntled members of the library staff who are concerned that the service they provide will in some way be affected by the proposals which will come before this place. Honourable members on both sides will certainly have an opportunity to debate the issues contained there, because I do not believe it is the intention to proceed with debating the legislation until next year.

83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Ha, hal  do it?",28
84,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Come along tomorrow.,28
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yes, come tomorrow. The advice that I have received is that the bill will be presented from the dispatch box, but you have raised an interesting point because the clerk did not tell me from which one. I was quite happy to do it from here.  functions of a member from there.",28
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Indeed. Parliamentary Library,28
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed to you regarding the operation of the Parliamentary Library. Is it a fact that earlier this week the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories gave a purported direction to the Parliamentary Library to the effect that any queries directed to the library regarding matters arising out of the sports grants program should not be processed by the library but should be directed to the minister? Further, is it a fact that she subsethe quently withdrew that instruction? Could you enlighten the parliament regarding both of those matters? In the process, would it be possible for you to reaffirm the absolute independence of the Parliamentary Library from any kind of executive interference or injunction?",28
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The is!!ue which the honourable member for Bennelong raises was also raised during the adjournment debate last evening by the honourable member for Cook. He referred to what he had described-and as you also have described it-as a directive from the office of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories to the library which he asserted was to the effect that all requests for information in regard to the sporting grants program must be referred to the minister's office. I wish to make it perfectly clear to the House that the Parliamentary Library does not accept directives from ministers' offices concerning the information . that it mayor may not provide to an honourable member and certainly it did not on this occasion, on the advice which I have been given. Mr Dobie-Yes it did.",29
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Just hang on; there is more to come. By way of background, last week the library received a number of requests concerning sporting grants. It obtained a range of publicly available information concerning the grants and was also able to' obtain detail which will appear when the annual report of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories is tabled. However, when honourable members sought additional detail requiring information not held by the library and information which was not publicly available, the minister's office advised the library that such requests should be referred to it in case the detail required could be obtained from departmental records. Opposition members-Ah!",29
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The Parliamentary Library continued to provide to honourable members the information that it had obtained and referred requests for more specific, but not publicly available, detail to the minister's office. But with respect to the actual issue independence of the library, I can say to the honourable member for Bennelong and other honourable members of this place that they would expect nothing less. Indeed, the legislation which I have already referred to in my previous answer will ensure that that independence is retained. Mr MCGauran-Just like you, you bunch of crooks.",29
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member for Gippsl-nd will withdraw that to start with. ,29
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I do not need the honourable member for Kooyong on this occasion. Mr MCGauran- Mr SPEAKER ,29
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Withdraw. Mr MCGauran-I shall withdraw but you are creating a precedent.,29
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Now you may resume your seat. . Mr MCGauran-When the Prime Minister slurs us, you must be consistent.",29
95,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I rise to a point of order. That was a clear reflection upon yourself. The honourable member for Gippsland stood up and said that you are creating an impression that we slur honourable members on the other side of the House and they are not allowed to slur back. That is quite clearly a reflection on your chairmanship. The honourable member should do it on motion. Mr SPEAKER.:....Order! I thank the Leader of the House for his comments, but I think that this afternoon a number of things in this place have been said and perhaps people are a little temperamental. I take no reflection from the honourable member for Gippsland, although I do take exception to the fact that he was interjecting when I was talking. I am sure that he will not be doing that again. Mr MCGauran-It is unforgivable.",29
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,",-It is unforgivable and I accept your apology. Native Title Legislation",29
97,Mr DUNCAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I seek to ask you a question arising out of the answer that of you gave to, the question from the Leader of the National Party of Australia. You did not refer to section 196 of the standing orders which deals with the entitlement to vote in any division upon a question in which a member has a direct pecuniary interest not held in common with the rest of the subjects of the Crown. Could you take the appropriate advice on that and then later in the day, or at the appropriate time, issue the warning, whatever that may be, to the members of the House in light of the Mabo debate coming up.",29

99,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I just counselled honourable members on my left about· interjecting. I will have to look at the specifics of the question that has been asked and report back to the House at a later time. Parliament Shop,30
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a response to a question asked the other day by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). He has, I am sure, been waiting patiently. The question that he asked of me the other day was about the Parliament House shop. We are all. concerned about whether it is doing well and making money. Mr Downer-And where the money is going.",30
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I knew the honourable member for Mayo would be worried about that. .On Wednesday, 17 November the right honourable member for New England asked me a question about the Parliament House shop. In .answer to the right honourable member's question, I am advised that the profits of the Parliament Ho-se shop over the last three years have amounted to $450,000. An arrangement with the Department of Finance allows revenue from the shop to be used' to fund specific projects. These are projects which would not normally be available from appropriations. Projects which have been financed by the shop include an upgrade of equipment in the theatre, the purchase of a grand piano for the Great Hall, the acquisition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art works for parliament's rotational collection and-dare I say it-display stands and Gould lithographs for the cabinet room.'",30
102,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence. In view of the fact that you have responded to that part of my question, could you advise the House what the capital base is on which the stock of the parliamentary shop operates? Is there a record available each year of the amount that has been paid by way of salaries for staff? Could you, in your report to the House-and you do present a report each year of the parliament on behalf of your office-include a section which specifies the amount of money that has been apportioned for the purpose of the parliamentary shop and where those profits, if any, are being spent?",30
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will be happy to look at those three questions that the right honourable member has raised. NA,30
104,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I claim to have been misrepresented.,30
105,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Please proceed. Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE""'-During question time, a letter was read out that I had sent in connection with the support of one of the applicants for the cultural grants just prior to the election. What was not disclosed is that I am also a member of that organisation and that I also received requests for my support from 12, other organisations applying for grants. I did supply my support. I thought that would be quite natural. From memory, what distinguished the letter from the Brothers club was that assistance was sought from me after the application for the grant had been lodged and after the closing date for applications. It was unique in that direction. I would suggest that all other honourable members who also support it might have been asked to do it in retrospect. It .does not overcome the problem that the president of that organisation was also the campaign direc-or for my Labor opponent.",30

108,Mr ANDREWS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During question time,the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education l "" and Training (Mr Free) said that I had intimated that the purpose of education was only for rational leisure. In that speech which he quoted from and in subsequent debates in this place, including a debate on 27 October, I indicated that education must take account, amongst other things, of the fact that, ly, unemployment cannot be magically reversed-a fact which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) himself acknowledged in a speech on 30 June this year. I am delighted that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training reads my speeches. I can only suggest that he read the speeches of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training as well.",30

113,Mr COSTELLO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During the debate on the suspension of standing orders, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) said that I had raised the sex of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in the course of my speech. I did no such thing. The only person who raised it was the Leader of the House. I want to make it perfectly clear that, as far as I am concerned, sex is absolutely irrelevant to a minister discharging his or her duty. It is neither a reason to go softer nor to be more exacting, and it is completely irrelevant to the discharge of ministerial duties. NA",31

120,Dr BLEWETT,PRIVILEGE,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I wish to make a short statement in relation to the matter raised as a matter of privilege by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) on Wednesday, 27 October 1993 relating to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of that day which referred to the forthcoming report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. The honourable member for Moncrieff, who is deputy chairman of the committee, indicated that it appeared that there had been a premature publication of the committee's report. The report entitled About time: bills, questions and working hours was tabled the following day, Thursday, 28 October. In a statement to the House on 28 October, the Speaker asked the procedure committee to consider the matter. In particular, the Speaker asked the committee to consider the effect of the publication of the article and to take to seek to ascertain the source of any disclosure. The procedure committee met yesterday to consider the matter. While the committee agreed that the article in question appeared to disclose prematurely aspects of the report, the committee was unable to ascertain the source of the disclosure. The committee also concluded that, given the tabling of the report on the following day, the publication of the article did not interfere in any substantial with the work of the committee. The committee regrets the incident but recommends that no further action be taken in relation to the matter.",33
121,Mrs SULLIVAN,PRIVILEGE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to make a brief statement on the same subject.",33
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE, Please proceed.,33
123,Mrs SULLIVAN,PRIVILEGE,"I rise as a member who co-authored a minority report in respect of the report just referred to and as deputy chairman of the committee, and also as the person who raised the matter of privilege in the House. By way of background, I point out that prior to the final writing and tabling of this report, I became aware that allegations were being made by a government member of the committee to my opposition colleagues with respect to my participation in the committee's deliberations. I make the point that I have been a member of parliament-of both the Senate and this place-for nearly 20 years. I have participated in many committees, and I have never before been involved in either the signing, much less the writing, of a dissenting report nor any controversy relating to a committee. What was happening was unprecedented in my experience of parliamentary committees and behaviour of members on those committees. I also inform the House that there had been some consultations involving both me and the chairman of the committee with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard) with respect to sitting hours. That was with the full agreement of the committee, so no breach of privilege was involved in that. In the course steps of these consultations, views had been expressed about the opposition's needs with respect to sitting hours, although both sides agreed that a reform of sitting hours was necessary. The minority report which I coauthored was essentially a reflection of these views on that subject, and that subject only. The day before the Sydney Morning Herald report in question was published, and at a stage when I was unsure whether I would be able to have even the opportunity to write a way dissenting report because I had some urgent personal problems that week, I was contacted by another member of the committee who infonned me that he had just been contacted by the journalist who eventually wrote the Sydney Morning Herald story. The content of that conversation apparently indicated that that journalist was fully briefed on the contents of the report prior to contacting this other member. That journalist also made reference to a dissenting report which he had been infonned I was writing. I make the point that at that stage-the stage contact - I was not sure that there would be a dissenting report and neither did the honourable member who contacted me. The next day the report was printed in the Sydney Morning Herald, and in it reference was made to my presenting a dissenting report. The next sentence of the story stated that it was nevertheless believed that senior opposition members were supporting the thrust of the report. So I saw this as another step, an opportunity, in the attempt to isolate the views that I would be presenting as unrepresentative of members of the committee and certainly of members of the opposition. This report appeared on a Wednesday morning. The report was to be tabled the next day. I was not going to be able to be present on Thursday because I had to return to home for urgent personal business-related to the matters that I have already referred to very briefly-which meant that I was not going to get the opportunity to state any contrary point of view at the time of the presentation of the report. I am aware that my method of raising the matter of privilege was unorthodox, and I apologise to members of the committee for that. I am sure they will understand that I had been placed in a position of personal and, I believe, professional difficulty. Given the fact that parliament would then go into recess for two weeks, I took a spot decision and decided that I should raise the issue of privilege immediately. I had drawn the conclusion that a member of the committee, for reasons that I was unaware of, was attempting to discredit in advance the minority report's authorship and its contents. The simple fact is that the oppo- Bill. sition leadership had put a view to the chairman of the committee and me at a meeting with respect to the opposition's requirements regarding sitting hours. That view was not going to be reflected in the report as it was proposed to be presented. The view that I presented was not officially an opposition view because I did not consult on the details of it with anyone outside the committee. However, it reflected the general views of the opposition's leadership group with respect to of the journalist's sitting hours. I am very anxious to indicate to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that I hope that this in no way upsets whatever negotiations are going on between the government and the opposition for a refonn of sitting hours of the House. This refonn is very overdue and is something about which I shall say more when we continue to debate the report on Thursday. NEW BUSINESS AFfER 11 P.M. NA",33
124,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I move: That standing order 48A, adjournment of House, and standing order 103, 11 o'clock rule, be suspended for the remainder of the sittings this week. I will not speak long to this motion; I will simply outline its purpose. It is our intention to complete debate on the Native Title Bill during this week. We would, therefore, need to have flexibility on sitting times if we are to give an opportunity to a number of members to speak on it. I do not intend that this should disrupt the opportunity for the House to rise early tomorrow. That early rising is becoming somewhat sacrosanct and, in a twoweek block of sittings, is an essential element of the maintenance of sanity in this place. But it would be my intention to sit quite late tonight-well past midnight-and to leave open the question about how things are handled on Thursday when we finalise the bill. To some extent that will depend upon the amount of additional business that has to be cleared by that day, but we do intend to devote the bulk of the rest of this week-at least in government time-to the Native Title Question resolved in the affinnative. NA NA BILL 1993 Consideration resumed from 22 November. Second Reading",34
125,Mr BRERETON,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Kingsford-Smith Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (4.02 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 is a portfolio bill which amends eight acts. The Defence Act 1903 is to be amended to change the title of the 'Chairman' of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, adopting the gender neutral title 'President'. The proposed amendments of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 will enable the Australian Industrial Registry to act as registry for state industrial bodies, including state industrial relations tribunals, industrial courts and workers compensation tribunals. This measure complements steps which have already been. taken in South Australia to collocate the state and federal industrial registries. The proposed amendments will enable integration of the state and federal industrial registries to take place in any state where the federal minister and the appropriate state authority agree. In other words, the Commonwealth will not be able to impose integration on any state that does not want it. Negotiations are already under way with the South Australian government that may see the Australian Industrial Registry assuming state registry functions in South Australia. In addition, amendments of the Industrial Relations Act are proposed to enable the rules of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to prescribe the period within which an objection to the variation of an award that is a common rule must be lodged. At present no such period is prescribed, and this can cause difficulties in relation to the enforcement of common rule awards. The proposed amendments of the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 will give the Presiding Officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives the same powers under that act as are currently held by the Public Service Commissioner. This means that the Presiding Officers will have the power, in specified circumstances, to declare the position held by a female officer who is on maternity leave to be vacant, with the consequence that the officer concerned becomes an unattached officer. The amendments also give the heads of the five parliamentary departments certain powers and functions in relation to the administration of maternity leave in their departments. To date these powers have been exercised under delegation. The amendments are consistent with the intention that the administrative arrangements governing the parliamentary departments be independent of the wider Australian Public Service. Minor amendments are made to th- Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 which contribute to the government's policy of ensuring adequate occupational health and safety protection for the Commonwealth's own employees. In particular the amendments: clarify the application of the act to_employees who do not work in offices or factories; strengthen the reporting requirements in relation to accidents and dangerous occurrences; and broaden the regulation making powers under the act to allow the Commonwealth to meet its commitment to achieve a national, uniform system of occupational health and safety. Amendments are proposed to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to provide procedures for the removal of discriminatory provisions from determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal. The amendments will enable the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory provisions to the Remuneration Tribunal. The tribunal will be required to conduct a hearing into the matter and, if it is satisfied that a provision is discriminatory, to take action to remove the discrimination. The process will be initiated by complaints to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner will have a discretion not to act upon complaints which, in the opinion of the commissioner, are frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance. In addition, the Remuneration Tribunal Act is to be amended to require the tribunal, when determining the remuneration of executives of government business enterprises, to take into account the superannuation entitlements of those executives. The Remuneration Tribunal Act is also to be amended to change the title of the - Chairman ' of the Remuneration Tribunal, adopting the gender neutral title 'President' . The proposed amendments of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 will assist Comcare and licensed authorities to recover certain overpayments which may occur when an employee who is receiving workers compensation benefits retires and becomes entitled to superannuation benefits. The proposed amendment introduces a scheme that will enable the overpayment to be recovered from the superannuation fund concerned, rather than from the individual. The opposition proposed amendments in the Senate which, taken as a whole, would have had the effect of preventing the government's proposed recovery mechanism from operating. The opposition was concerned that the amendments gave Comcare and licensed. authorities-presently, Australia Post and Telecomunprecedented access to a retired employee's superannuation funds. Let me emphasise that the recovery mechanism only operates if the retiree actually receives, or rolls over, a superanriuationbenefit. Where the benefit is preserved, the amendments will not operate. The scheme does not provide untrammelled access to the superannuation savings of former Commonwealth employees. Numerous safeguards have been included in the legislati<;m to protect the rights and the income of the individual retiree: if superannuation payments have commenced, the proposed recovery mechanism will not operate. This protects the retiree's income stream; Comcare is required to advise retirees that it has issued a notice that may require the superannuation administrator to delay commencement of superannuation payments until any overpayment of compensation has been calculated and that any such overpayment will be recoverable from superannuation payments as they fall due; Comcare will be required to continue to pay full compensation until it receives confirmation from the superannuation administrator what the employee's superannuation entitlement is (It is anticipated that in most cases the initial superannuation payment will cover the overpayment of compensation); and Comcare's determination of the amount of the overpayment will be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on application by a retired employee. Honourable members should also note that the proposed scheme is comparable to the scheme for recovery of overpayments of certain social security benefits established by the Social Security Act 1991. Under that act, where the Commonwealth has paid such benefits and the recipient then becomes entitled to compensation from another source, the Commonwealth is able to recover the amount of the overpayment direct from the compensation payer. In addition, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills did not make any adverse comment on the operation of this part of the bill and the Attorney-General's Department has advised that there are no adverse privacy implications arising from the scheme and that the proposed administrative review mechanisms are appropriate. The opposition was also concerned that the commencement of superannuation payments could be delayed at the whim of Comcare or a licensed authority. This is not correct. Under the proposed legislation, within two days of becoming aware of an employee's exact superannuation entitlement, Comcare or the licensed authority must issue a notice to the superannuation administrator that will enable superannuation to commence being paid. Only at this time will the compensation be reduced in accordance with the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. Against this background, the government is not prepared to accept the opposition's amendments because they would undermine the proposed recovery mechanism in part 7 of the bill. However, the government will. be reviewing the operation of the new scheme and will take action as necessary to ensure it is working effectively and in a manner which safeguards the rights of individuals. The proposed amendments of the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946 will enable regulations to be made prescribing fees to be charged, on a cost-recovery basis, for certain functions which the Department of Industrial Relations performs in support of the local and central trades committees established by the act. Since 1989 the department has been charging fees, on a partial cost-recovery basis, to applicants for trade skills assessment under the act. The fees were imposed administratively and the department was recently advised that there is no statutory authority for them. The collection of fees ceased pending the coming into effect of the necessary legislation. Financial impact The bill will have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. However, as mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, it is expected that the amendments of the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act will result in the payment to the Department of Industrial Relations of fees totalling approximately $180,000 per annum. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by. Mr Howard) adjourned. NA",35

127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Your explanation is accepted by the chair. NATIVE TITLE BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 November, on motion by Mr Keating: That the bill be now read a second time.",37
128,Dr HEWSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, the Native Title Bill is one of the most important bills that the parliament has considered for many years. It is a bill that addresses fundamentally important issues for Australian society. It relates to the rights and future entitlements of all Australians-I emphasise 'all Australians' - as citizens of an undivided nation. It relates to the importance of land to Australia's indigenous people, and it relates to Australia's national development and export trade, and the benefits which all Australians derive from success in both. Let me be very clear at the outset. We on this side of the House accept the existence of native title as declared by the High Court, and we recognise the equal right of indigenous people as Australian citizens to the enjoyment and protection of their rights. However, we reject-we totally reject-the government's Native Title Bill because we believe it is neither a just nor a workable response to the High Court's Mabo decision. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been at his rhetorical worse in presenting phoney choices about this legislation. He claims, for example, that voting for or against this legislation is a choice between confronting the realities of Australia's past or ignoring them. It is no such choice. He claims that voting for or against this legislation is a choice between helping Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or neglecting them. Again, it is no such choice. He claims that voting for or against this legislation is a choice between the past and the future, good and bad, right and wrong. It is no such choice. There is only one criterion that is relevant in determining whether this legislation deserves to be supported, and that is: is it in Australia's national interest? That means, is it in the interest of all Australians, indigenous and non-indigenous? Does it address the real . needs and hopes of most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people? Does it increase or decrease certainty and predicability in land tenure and, therefore, in land development? These are the concerns which have been the focus of the opposition's assessment of the government's Mabo legislation. We will be voting against such legislation for one basic reason: it is bad legislation for Australia. It is bad legislation because it goes way beyond what the High Court decided in the Mabo case. It is bad because it creates enormous complexity, delay, uncertainty, and division in Australian society. It is bad because it assumes a mistaken view of the root cause of Aboriginal an- Islander disadvantage. It is bad because, without good reason, it constrains future opportunities for national development to the detriment of all Australians, and it creates future financial liabilities, the scale of which no-one can predict. The fact is that the government in general and the Prime Minister in particular have been changing their policy and playing catch-Up on Mabo for most of this year. For example, the Prime Minister went out and promised the world to everyone. He promised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders a resolution of over 200 years of injustice and disadvantage. He promised property owners, and farmers in particular, absolute security of their land He promised those involved in national development projects' no disincentives or discouragement. He promised all Australians a simple, clear and fair resolution of the issues raised by Mabo at a manageable cost to the nation. He has delivered on none of these commitments and he never could. The Prime Minister deliberately raised a wide range of hopes and expectations on which he could never deliver. The legislation that he introduced into the parliament last week shows just how dramatically he has failed to do this. One of the greatest myths created by the government about this legislation is that it is presented as some kind of panacea for Aboriginal and Islander disadvantage. The fact is that it is nothing of the kind. Anyone who has seen at first hand the living conditions and the lack of opportunity in so many Aboriginal and Islander communities will know that a nation such as·Australia should never tolerate such a situation. Standards of health, education, life expectancy, infant disease and infection, and many more issues affecting Aboriginals and Islanders, remain totally unacceptable when compared to the standards and conditions enjoyed by other Australians. None of these problems will be addressed by this legislation. This legislation will do nothing about Aboriginal and Islander health. It will do nothing about their education. It will do nothing about their welfare and living conditions. The bill is no shortcut to overturning a legacy of disadvantage and neglect. Another great myth that the Prime Minister has created is that his Mabo bill represents a national outcome of consultation-consultation with and examination by the Aboriginal people., With the unquestioning assistance of the great bulk of the media, the Prime Minister has managed to spin what he would describe as a 'grand tale'. He has told us that. there is Aboriginal consensus and agreement on this bill, but, when we look at the detail, the hollowness of this claim is soon revealed. A group of five Aboriginal representatives did a deal with the Prime Minister. Where was that deal done? Where did the Prime Minister go to talk with the Aboriginal people title. first-hand about Mabo? He went nowhere; he stayed in Canberra. Why did he stay in Canberra? For one very good reason-if he went anywhere in this country to talk to traditional Aboriginal people he would have heard people like Mr Dick Cox, of the Yungngora Association saying: None of the five Aboriginal spokespersons are known by us. No one from ATSIC, the Kimberley Land Council or from any other organisation, department, nor any individual person has approached us to explain about the High Court decision, asked us what we thought of Mabo, asked if they could represent us or if we supported this legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that that is a pretty damning indictment relative to the claims made by the Prime Minister. Mr Cox went on to say: Who is going to administer the Land Acquisition Fund? ATSIC? The Land Councils? ATSIC is not working, our money is held up for months and sometimes years, money goes missing and ATSIC seems not to be concerned. How can we trust ATSIC to handle this money? If Mr Keating had got out of Canberra he would have heard people such as Charlie Perkins or Paul Coe from the Aboriginal Legal Service who, on 11 November, stated: Attempting to legitimise the proposed Commonwealth Native Title legislation by having the Prime Minister negotiating with five Aboriginals so say' Aboriginal Australia' has been 'consulted' is not acceptable by the majority of Aboriginal people. Charlie Perkins went on to state that the Keating Mabo bill was a massive 'con'-his word, not mine-perpetrated on the Australian people. Across the country, the voices of significant Aboriginal people and leaders have been ignored in the so-called consultation process, and their many concerns and criticisms have simply been dismissed out of hand. Membership to the Prime Minister's exclusive Mabo club was simply not extended to them. Even those who were members were bullied at times by the Prime Minister. I will give you an example, Mr Deputy Speaker. Just some weeks ago, prior to the 18 October announcement of the so-called deal by the Prime Minister, the Aboriginal leaders with whom he was negotiating criticised the Prime Minister. Many of my colleagues will remember that. What was the Prime Minister's response? He responded by launching an extraordinary attack on them, accusing them of being 'psychologically' unable to negotiate properly with him. So the myth of a national consensus on the bill should be seen very clearly for what it is. We took a very different view from the government on the importance of wide and direct consultations. with Aboriginal and Islander communities. We believed it was important, for example, to go to the Murray Islands and understand first-hand the nature of the High Court decision-to learn of the very close attachment which Eddie Mabo and his people had to their small plot of land, and how over the centuries the connection with that land had not been broken through an intricate system of market gardening. But it was equally important for us to visit many other Aboriginal and Islander communities and see first-hand what Mabo meant. Not surprisingly, it meant very different things to different communities. These were the trips that the Prime Minister chose not to take. I quote from a statement made to me by an Aboriginal woman at the Mowanjum community outside Derby, Western Australia which, I think more than anything else, sticks as to in my mind because it sums up the feeling of many Aboriginal people that I met. She said: Every time we turn on the T.V., we get Mabo for breakfast, Mabo for lunch and Mabo for supper. But we still don't know what Mabo means! Be it in Doomadgee, Weipa, Bamaga, or Normanton in the far north of Queensland, or Cockatoo Springs, Kununurra, Mowanjum, Derby, Mt Barnett Station in the KimberJeys, or around the Gascoyne, or in Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, there was absolutely no consensus among the people that I spoke to about what Mabo meant. But there was consensus on other issues-their health, their education, their housing, their employment opportunities-which were simply not being addressed. For many that was equally as important, if not more important, than Mabo. The High Court has formally recognised that Aboriginal people occupied Australia before it was settled by Europeans. It has raised the possibility that they have rights over substantial parts of Australia. We need to recognise the implications of that reality. We also need tq reaffirm the validity of existing land titles that were negotiated in good faith and in accordance with the law of the land as it then stood. In .meeting these two challenges what is needed is a sensitive, delicate and realistic balance. This bill provides no such balance. Indeed, it confuses settlement of land management issues arising from the High Court's judgement in the Mabo case with the wider issue of reconciliation with the Aboriginal and Islander communities. As such, the bill goes way beyond what the High Court actually decided. There is no doubt that this legislation will create a legal, bureaucratic and administrative nightmare. As such, we believe it will prove totally unworkable. The bill clearly fails in its central purpose. It does not ensure that all Australians are treated equally under the law. It does not address the real concerns and aspirations of Aboriginal and Islander people: their health, their living conditions, their education and the issue of recognition of their culture and heritage. The bill does not guarantee security of title or remove uncertainty that has arisen. Its massive complexity will ensure that investment will be discouraged, jobs will be lost and national development projects will be held up. Any piece of legislation that fails so obviously in its stated purpose simply does not deserve the support of the Australian community. It will certainly not be getting our support. There are a number of specific reasons why this piece of legislation is totally inadequate and totally unacceptable. First, the bill ignores the responsibility of the states and territories under the constitution for land management. This legislation is simply a grab for Canberra to increase its control over the constitutional responsibility of the states and territories in the area of land management. It will lead to a constitutional battle in the courts that will only add to the current doubts 'and the current uncertainties. Under the Australian constitution, the Commonwealth parliament is given no power directly to make laws relating to the management of lands. Constitutionally as well as historically, the state governments have been responsible for the management of crown lands. State governments make grants of freehold and other tenements, such as pastoral and agricultural leases and mining tenements. State governments are responsible for the management of activities conducted pursuant to those grants, such as the pastoral and mining industries. Under this bill, a Commonwealth bureaucratic structure will intrude into management process. The Federal Court, the native title tribunal and a bureaucracy under the native title registrar will all be involved potentially in the management processes that have up until now been conducted exclusively under state governments. The bill contemplates that, to a limited extent, the state governments may set up their own arbitral bodies to carry out some functions which would otherwise be carried out by the native title tribunal. But such bodies have to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth to be recognised as able to perform those functions. I think it is worth pausing here and focusing on what the government's bill actually does in relation to the structure. Basically it says that the states can continue to control land management in response to the Mabo High Court decision provided they play by the Prime Minister's rules and meet the Prime Minister's standards. As I have said, quite clearly, that is nothing more than a grab for power by the Prime Minister in an attempt to usurp what would otherwise be a state responsibility. Second, most Aboriginals and Islanders will not be better off as a result of this legislation, but a lot of other Australians will be clearly worse off. The government is asking Australians to sign off on a blank cheque for major administrative costs-hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of a land acquisition fund, a social justice package, massive legal costs and other liabilities, not to mention of course the significant delay to the approval processes for projects and development. This bill goes way beyond the terms of the High Court judgement. It claims to recognise and protect native title when, in fact, the High Court has already declared its existence and has given a guarantee to indigenous Australians that the courts will act to protect native title. The bill is not simply a measure designed to enable native title to be identified, recorded and protected. The bill contains provisions which extend the concept of native title as defined by the High Court and extend ownership and management of land by in that state land digenous peoples. Under the High Court judgement, the valid grant of an interest in land which is incompatible with the continued enjoyment of native title over the land was held to extinguish native title. But under this bill, this principle is varied in some situations: in particular, the granting of mining tenements will not have that effect but will merely suspend native title for the duration of the tenement. There is also concern that the bill will allow for the possibility of co-existing native title on pastoral leases. There is a provision for native title to be revived in respect of land held under pastoral lease where native title claimants hold the lease. There is lished under the bill a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land fund for the purpose of acquiring land. In these respects, as well as others, the bill goes way beyond the terms of the High Court judgement. Third, Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill not secure existing land titles-one of the basic aims of the whole response to the Mabo decision of the High Court. All valid leases of pastoral land made prior to 1975 may still be subject to claims for native title. The Prime Minister says that he hopes that this will not happen. But he cannot give any certainty about the outcome of any such legal procedure. challenge. Furthermore, claims for native title will be able to be made over land where mining projects operate or are being planned. The maze of tribunals, bureaucratic procedures for negotiation, and an uncertain system of arbitration will all discourage investment and tie up many projects at the approval stage. The bill will therefore do immeasurable damage to the biggest generators of Austramaze. lia's export income-the income from which all Australians benefit. Our mining cultural industries will be tied up in endless court battles to the detriment of all Australporridge. ians. Fourth, this bill will create a new bureaucracy of tribunals, assessors and registrars; a paradise for lawyers and complexity and ... uncertainty for everyone else. It is worth stand noting that the bill runs to 115 pages, has 238 feel clauses, 23 pages of definitions and, perhaps most alarmingly, the explanatory notes are longer than the bill. To give some indication of the extent of the complexity and uncertainty of this legislation, let us have a very quick review of the bill's structures because I think that is very inforwith mative. The bill contemplates the appointment of a Native Title Registrar who will adminismajor ter a Register of Native Title Claims and a National Native Title Register. That should complex enough, but on top of that there will be a National Native Title Tribunal, some of whose functions may be carried out in a state or territory by a state or territory arbitral body, if that body is recognised for the also estabpurpose by the Commonwealth. Jurisdictions to receive claims for native title or compensation for the extinguishment of native title are received and mediated by the National Native Title Tribunal, but are heard by the Federal Court, assisted by an does assessor. Applications by Commonwealth, state or territory governments to perform acts . in relation to land, which are permitted under the bill, are to be made to the National Native Title Tribunal or, if there is one, the relevant state or territory arbitral body. The procedure to be followed will vary, depending upon whether the matter is under an extradition The bill provides for time limits on various procedures but these vary depending on the nature of the action proposed by the applicant government. The bill also provides that a Commonwealth minister may overrule determinations of the native title tribunal, and a state minister may overrule determinations of a state arbitral body. My case rests. It is an incredibly complex structure. It is an absolute It is no wonder that the managing director of Australia's largest company, BHP, and agri Mr John Prescott, has said: ... examining the proposed bill is like reading  say: is far too complex, far too difficult to underand fraught with the danger of leading us into additional uncertainty and unnecessary connict. We very strongly about it. We have tried to take a sensible and balanced view to this. Unless we address these issues now we are going to be left with a legacy of confusion and rules which won't work. Fifth, the bill provides the registered holders of, and registered claimants to, native title a right to negotiation, which amounts to a de facto right of veto, if so desired, over development projects or, in fact, any change in the status of the lease. This, again, be will hold back economic development, jobs and export income that should be to the benefit of all Australians. Sixth, the Prime Minister has asked Australians to trust him-there is a joke-when it comes to the effects of the bill. However, he cannot tell us how much land and money it will cost if it is implemented. We know from our experience over many years, particularly over the last election, that we would be if we took the Prime Minister at his word. Australians will do a lot of things, but one thing they will not do is trust his word. With his track record, why should they? For all these reasons, and more detailed ones which will be referred to by the responcommitment sible shadow ministers, the opposition will vote against this bill. We will seek a full inquiry into this legislation when it is conbute sidered in the Senate because of the massive and growing uncertainty in the community about the implications of the High Court's decision and to explore openly and publicly the full implications of the government's We will do so to give people an opportunity - given that there is such division of opinion around Australia, irrespective of where people come from-to express their views on this bill. I want to take a little time to debunk, and for all, an accusation that is thrown around by those who want to demean anyone who opposes this bill. It is the racist this totally outrageous claim-that anyone who opposes this legislation is somehow racist. It is a slur that has been levelled explicitly by some and implicitly by others. The executive director of the Cape York Land Council, Mr Noel Pearson, for example, made the charge explicitly at the National Press Club on 10 November when he said that those who were opposed to this legislation 'are returning to a racist debate that occupied Australia in the nineteenth century'. Others in this parliament, from the Prime Minister down, have implied the same critiand cism. Let me nail this slur, implicit or it. It is a slur that is often the last resort those without reasoned arguments. It is to destined to get a headline but has absolutely no basis in reality. The racist slur is meant bully into silence those with genuine well-founded reasons for opposing this legislation and to intimidate people to stop them asking questions that need to be asked of the government. That tactic has not succeeded, and it will continue to fail. We will not be bullied into silence and we will not be intimidated into supporting bad legislation such as this Native Title Bill. Our fools position has nothing whatever to do with racism. Racism is abhorrent to all of us on this side of the House and, I believe, to all members of this parliament. The record of the coalition parties both in government and opposition hears testimony to our fundamental to the dignity of every individual, to the equality of opportunity that they should have and to their potential to contrito the common good of society, irrespective of race, religion, gender or belief. We believe these things deeply and passionately, and we will not cop it from the other side. We also believe, for reasons referred to bill. above, that this Native Title Bill is bad legislation. We will not be pressured out of principled positions by racist slurs that reflect much more on those making them than on the targets of their unfounded attacks. We will not be pressured out of reflecting the doubts once and apprehensions so many Australians obviously have about this legislation. We take an entirely different view from the governslurment on how the Commonwealth should respond to the High Court's decision. There is a fairer, simpler and more practical reat us sponse that should be adopted. The Commonwealth, states and territories need to work together to validate existing titles through complementary legislation. We do not support any relaxation of the Racial Discrimination Act, except to the extent that may be necessary to validate past grants-and .only on the basis that compensation is paid on a non-discriminatory basis. We believe that the rights of Aboriginals Torres Strait Islanders must be respected. explicFurthermore, the Commonwealth should of recognise the constitutional right of the states administer land titles, subject to the existence of native title as declared by the High to Court, and subject to the requirements of the and Racial Discrimination Act. That means, taking the case of Western Australia, that we respecUhe right of Richard Court, as Premier of Western Australia, to deal with the issue of land management in his state and to respond to the High Court native title decision in his state, subject to two conditions. The first is that he recognises the High Court's decision and, secondly, that he be bound by the requirements of Commonwealth legislation-the Racial Discrimination Act. In those circumstances, we put a very strong view that state premiers have a right, under our constitution, to manage land in their states subject to those two constraints. We believe that those restraints will work to· ensure a sensible response around Australia, state by state. Finally, the challenge of the High Court's decision must be met in a way that enhances national development, employment, the economic use of land and the further development of Australia's mineral, pastoral and other great industries. The government's claim that somehow our approach substitutes states' rights for Aboriginal rights is absolutely ridiculous. The political system in Australia operates within the framework of the constitution. The constitution clearly gives the states responsibility for land titles and land management. In carrying out that responsibility, the states have a dear responsibility to accept native title as declared by the High Court and to act consistently with the Racial Discrimination Act. It is within those constraints, as I said, that I seek to emphasise that states should be free to address their own specific and different situations. That is the intent of the constitution. It is the basis of genuine accountability of governments to those directly affected by those decisions. The choice, therefore, of states' rights or Aboriginal rights is phoney. If the Keating government does not like constitutional division of power, it can go about changing it in the required way. It cannot just usurp the proper constitutional role of the states and then try to argue that those who disagree with it somehow are anti Aboriginal rights. Consistent with the reasons that I have outlined for the opposition voting against this bill, and with the just and workable alternative that we have put forward, I wish to move the following second reading amendment. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give the Bill a second reading, and (1) notes that, as a consequence of the High Court's Mabo (No.2) decision, Australia already has a national native title system without the need for any legislative action; (2) acknowledges that, in order to meet the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act, a government dealing with native title must do so on a non-discriminatory basis including the payment of just terms compensation for any extinguishment of native title; (3) condemns the Keating Government for using the Bill to make an unnecessary intrusion into the land management responsibilities of State Governments; and (4) further notes that the only additional federal law that may be. necessary would be to facilitate the validation of past gra'!ts"". Let me conclude on this note: responsibility for addressing the root causes of Aboriginal and Islander disadvantage and lack of opportunity must lie at the forefront of our national priorities. So much remains to be done in that regard and the coalition parties remain strongly committed to bipartisan support for the national reconciliation process. But we are opposing this bill for quite different reasons. It is it recipe for uncertainty, complexity and division in our society. It will not be to the benefit of either the overwhelming majority of Aboriginal and Islander people or to other Australians. There are fairer, simpler and more just ways of recognising the existence of native title as declared by the High Court. In our view, this legislation will prove to be unworkable, at enormous cost to Australia, now and into the future. It is an unnecessary as well as an unworkable piece of legislation and we will oppose it in the interests of all Australians.",37
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Reith-I second the amendment.,43
130,Mr TICKNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (4.41 p.m.}-I have never been more proud to be a member of the Australian Labor Party than when I listened to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). It is an honour to come into this parliament, to follow the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and to address this House on the most historic legislation, namely, the government's Native Title Bill in response to the High Court decision in the Mabo case. It is not my intention to dwell on some of the more technical aspects of the legisl-tion which have been on the public record for some time, nor do I propose to read out some prepared monologue. I rather intend to respond in, I hope, a more creative manner, to touch on some of the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition and to highlight to the House how baseless and damaging those remarks were. I propose to reflect on some· of the events, both historical and contemporary, which have brought us to this critical point our nation's history and to place on record to begin with my very profound regret that the opposition has not been able to rise to the occasion to support the government's proposals, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) has recognised has the support of most Australians. Mr Reith-It is such an important issue, why don't you deal with it?",44
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence. I ask you to give the minister the same courtesy.,44
132,Mr TICKNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He was heard in silence because I have some respect for the forms of the House, unlike the honourable member for Flinders. A few days ago the Australian of the Year, Mr Mandawuy YunupingU, appealed to parliamentariansof all political persuasions to work towards a bipartisan approach to the native title issue. The opposition would do well to listen to Aboriginal people around this country who feel so bitterly betrayed by the approach taken by the Leader of the Opposition and the federal coalition. It is true that the Mabo issue has gripped this country like no other political issue. It has not been one for the faint-hearted, and it is true to say that it has been bigger than any political party and bigger than the interests of any person passing through this parliament. I ask honourable members to think back to what happened when the legislation to commence the reconciliation process that the Leader of the Opposition referred to passed through this parliament in 1991. What occurred at that time was a coming together in this chamber on a matter of great principle. On that occasion the Deputy Leader of the Opposition extended his hand across the dispatch box and shook my hand because he realised that, by working to achieve the unanimous support of this parliament, we had done something that was going to truly shape the kind of country that we were going to have by the year 200 1, the centenary of the Australian federation. What a magnificent outcome it would have been in this debate if the in Leader of the Opposition on this perhaps eyen more important and significant occasion were able to extend his hand to the government and to the Prime Minister to ensure the unanimous passage of this legislation. There is one very important reason why the government has sought to try to get the opposition to support this legislation, and it is this: when this parliament speaks with one voice, as it did on the occasion of the 1967 referendum, it sends a very powerful message to the wider Australian community about where the elected leaders of this country believe we ought to be heading as a nation. The response to that 1967 referendum, which passed through the parliament unanimously, was that over 92 per cent of the Australian people voted to support that constitutional change. The tragedy is that what the opposition has deliberately done in response to the High Court decision· in the Mabo case is to wage a campaign of misrepresentation to try to create as much fear and loathing in the wider Australian community towards Aboriginal people and towards the Mabo decision. If there is ever an illustration of where the ethics of those opposite are at on this issue, it is the way that they respond to the public opinion polls that show a degree of confusion, in the wider community. They wear those public opinion polls shamefully like some badge of honour. The facts of the matter are that during the whole time of the High Court case-during that one-year period-the federal opposition did not raise one single question in the House of Representatives on the subject of Mabo. Even mor€(than that, in the course of the federal election campaign I issued, on behalf of the government, a public statement to highlight that the Mabo decision was above party politics. I praised the Leader of the Opposition for his commitment to support the government's negotiation process, which he then said was to run through to September, as it did. I placed the following statement on the public record on that occasion: ... the Mabo decision is an important one for all Australians. For that reason, discussion must remain rational, and the interests of all key groups must taken into consideration. It is to the benefit of all Australians that the Mabo decision does not become a party political football. Where did we go from there? What happened then was that the federal coalition, after it lost the election, decided that ethics and principle were out the window and that Mabo would be used as a weapon to attack Aboriginal people and to attack the government. In Western Australia we saw Premier Court repeatedly putting on the public record that backyards were under threat. He then moved on and suggested that farmyards were under threat. We then saw the Leader of the National Party in New South Wales rise up at a conference in Wagga and speak to assembled National Party members. He reassured them that their farms were not going to be under threat because the National Party would protect them. We saw Mr Borbidge in Queensland on behalf of the National Party; we saw the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer); we saw the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan); and then we saw the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), when he was brought back into the fold, lead and orchestrate this campaign of misinformation right across this country. But the absolute pinnacle of that campaign occurred when the Leader of the Opposition spoke in the so-called address to the nation. I want to refer to what the Leader of the Opposition said, and I will quote him' quite precisely. The would be alternative Prime Minister of this country said on national television: In good faith we have all bought homes and farms and opened mines and businesses, absolutely confident that we would own them and could operate them without legal challenge. He went on to say that, under the government's legislation, a lot of other Australians would be worse off. Returning to the security for existing titles, he said: There is no certainty that the Bill will provide security for existing land titles-the only thing that is certain is that it will create more uncertainty. The fact of the matter is that that was the high point of the opposition's campaign to be create fear, loathing, bitterness, hatred and division in the Australian community in response to Mabo. It is not surprising, therefore, that the prominent editorial writers in this country, including the Canberra Times, responded. The Canberra Times editorial of 20 November stated: Dr Hewson knows there has never been any question of a threat to homes, and it is cheap politics to try to hint there has been. The Sydney Morning Herald, in its editorial of 19 November, stated: . . . the Coalition has apparently allowed petty political considerations to shape the fonnulation of its alternative proposals. The Melbourne Age, in an even more scathing editorial of the opposition, stated: Dr Hewson is wrong to try and tum Mabo into a states' rights issue. It goes on to say that Dr Hewson had lost another opportunity to demonstrate vision and leadership. I will tell honourable members what occurred on that fateful night when the Leader of the Opposition put forward his so called address to the nation: he forfeited his moral authority to ever become the Prime Minister of this country. He has been condemned by every prominent editorial writer in this country. It is true to say that the coalition has recognised the High Court decision in the Mabo case. Is it not. extraordinary that we on this side of the chamber have to remind honourable members opposite about the rule of law and aoout the rights of people to own private property? I will tell honourable members what the effect of the coalition recognition of the High Court decision is: it is a recognition of the High Court decision in the same way as the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, recognises the High Court decision. In clause 1 of the bill the opposition recognises the High Court decision conferring native title-or the inherent existence of that native title. In clause 2, the coalition wipes it out without compensation. That is the nub of the coalition's central point. What it coulQ not bring itself to do was to support the human rights of Aboriginal people over the states rights approach of the Western Australian government. The shadow Attorney General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), knows full well that that is the nub of the issue. If we took a poll among members of the federal coalition and sought their personal views about the Court government legislation, the fact is that they would be split right down the middle. So the cop-out is to use some fudge words to pretend that somehow or other they can recognise native title and then obliterate it. By doing that, they are keeping faith with the High Court decision, with Australia's international obligations and with the Racial Discrimination Act. The fact of the matter is that-as any first year law student would know, let alone an eminent jurist-if we expropriate the private property of citizens based on race, it is highly likely that the consequence will be that the High Court of Australia will strike down the legislation as a breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. We, on the government side, are not simply prepared to leave it to the courts. I said before in this House, when asked a question, that in 1967 the people of this country reposed what I describe as a sacred trust in this parliament to protect the human rights of Aboriginal people. We, on this side of the chamber, are not prepared to abandon that sacred trust. We are not prepared to allow the High Court decision to be overridden by the legislation of Premier Court. That is the essential difference between the coalition and the government. We stand for human rights and it stands for states rights at any cost. It is not just the Australian Labor Party that believes human rights are more important than states rights. The fact is that the former minister for aboriginal affairs, Mr Ian Vinerpast president of the' Western Australian Liberal Party and, I believe, someone held in high regard by the shadow Attorney General-spoke on the Mabo legislation in the Perth Town Hall on 23 September. I remind the honourable member for' Flinders what Mr Viner· said on that occasion. He directed some remarks not only to the Western Australian Premier, Mr Court, and to the state Liberal government, but also to the federal opposition. In his speech notes he underlined the responsibilities of the federal opposition in respect of Mabo. He called on the opposition to embrace Mabo and to use it as a foundation to build on for the future of Aboriginal people in Western Australia and for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia. He said: They should use it as a bridge between cultures. The cultural and democratic traditions brought to Australia and those which were here when our forbears arrived and are still here today as a living culture. But, of course, Mr Viner's urging to the federal coalition was ignored, as was the urging of the former member for Pearce and former minister for aboriginal affairs, Mr Chaney. They pleaded with the federal coalition to keep faith with its Liberal traditions. Let us not have any pretence that somehow after the federal election we were going to see a coalition grouping that was going to be more sensitive to social policy issues. Do honourable members remember after the election this transformation that was going to make the federal coalition the caring, small 'I' liberal coalition? Do honourable members remember that? The fact is that any pretence of being a small 'I' liberal party on the part of the Liberal Party of Australia is gone forever because there could not be a harsher and a more repressive policy directed towards the repression of the most disadvantaged Australians than the coalition's response Mabo. We, on the government side, are proud what we have achieved with respect to the legislation on native title. We are proud of not only because Of the end result, but also because of the way' that the outcome was brought about. This was not, like the Western Australian legislation, some deal cobbled together in a smoke-filled room. This was outcome that was brought about by head-towithout head negotiation between representatives the major Aboriginal land councils-which are going to be in the front line of fighting for Aboriginal rights on native title; those are most affected by the High Court's deciland sion-and representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the Aboriginal Legal Service. The fact is that that outcome was achieved because of the commitment of the Prime Minister-and I join with my colleagues placing on record admiration for the way conducted those negotiations-to ensure that there would be a just outcome from Mabo and that it would be reached as a' result· of process of negotiation. I think that when we look back on this time in Australian history, we will see that, in some respects, that promyth cess of reaching a just outcome on Mabo may well have been as important as the final outcome that we have achieved. Mr Reith-Eighteen minutes of cliches have had so far.",44
133,Mr TICKNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member equals in that process. - or Flinders will have his opportunity to speak 10 this debate. Unlike his incessant, hardline, embittered interjections on me, he will be heard by me in silence. The issues that I would now like to conclude on are really about the way that the High Court has the capacity to reshape, as a result of its decisions, the relations between Aboriginal and n-n-Aboriginal Australians. Although the High C:0urt decision is going to have, perhaps, direct benefit to only a small number of Aboriginal people, the fact is that the government sees the Mabo decision-as we said at the commencement of this parliament, and as the Governor General said-as the best opportunity yet for a long-term and durable on settlement in this country. That is vihy we have sought to ensure that the government's of response is broadened to include a social justice component with a major focus on a it national Aboriginal land fund-something that I have passionately believed in and advocated now for more than a decade. That land fund is about opportuniHes for Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed-many of them an in comparatively recent times, and always compensation-to have an opportuniof ty to get a land base with which to build a future for themselves and their families. The government's social justice response is who going to be much broader than simply the acquisition fund. In recent years we have been in a very wonderful, developing and reforming time in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this country. We have seen th- establishment of ATSIC-a revolutionary shift towards decision making by Aboriginal in people; we have seen the Commonwealth's he response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody; we have seen the unanimous passage of the reconciliation that legislation through this parliament; and, finally, we have seen the decision of the High Court of Australia burying for all time the of terra nullius. If there is one thing that the Mab- decision does for all of us, it is to enable thiS country to come to terms honestly with its own history as a nation. It enables us to move forward with that reconciliation we process between indigenous and nonindigenous Australians and to negotiate as Let .me conclude by paying tribute to my parliamentary colleagues. As I have said, I have never been more proud to be Labor than in the course of the Mabo debate. It has been without doubt one of Labor's finest hours. Let me place on record my admiration for the chairperson of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, and the other negotiators; provide thanks to my own staff for their diligence and commitment· and, most important of all, on behalf of thAustralian Labor Party, say how very proud we have been to be in government at this magnificent - ime in Australian history.",47
134,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have responded to many government bills in my time in the parliament, but not often have they been as important as the Native Title Bill 1993. The bill does not mark the greatness and sense of occasion claimed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). In fact, we have just had 30 minutes from the minister where he barely referred to the detail of the bill. Instead, we saw from his address the sort of sickening self-righteousness that we have witnessed today and which typifies the response of the Labor Party to this issue. His principal attack on the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was based on a distortion which related to the certainty of people's titles. The government has placed a provision which will deny the Wik people a return of their lands and substitutes-in the event that they are successful with their fiduciary claim in the High Court-a monetary alternative. This minister calls· for a proper acknowledgment of the rights of Aboriginal people. Yet, when we have a bill for debate before the parliament that is of great significance to those people, we are not subject to a defence of the bill, not a careful, considered and measured weighing up of the arguments for and against a particular provision, but the typical round of cliches and superficialities which marks the minister's whole approach to this issue. This bill is not going to unite Australians; this bill is going to divide Australians. It is not a reasonable or workable national response to Mabo. Instead, it is just a grubby grab for power by the Prime Minister to promote his own political interests. It is not some cooperative solution agreed to by the Commonwealth and the states. Rather, it embodies the usual arrogant approach which typifies the Prime Minister's response to most issues. The government and the Prime Minister will not give a guarantee that this bill will not cost jobs or jeopardise development because, sadly, this bill's blank cheque will cost many jobs. Although many of my colleagues will speak on the bill, I do regret that the government has also restricted the time available to· the parliament to consider the bill in great detail. And so my speech is curtailed. For that reason, I will issue some more detailed notes, this speech being an abridged version of those which I will distribute later. The coalition has given the issue very careful consideration over a long period. Initially, we broadly endorsed the government's program of consultation. Mabo was not an issue leading into the March 1993 election but became an issue because, in June, the government failed to reach a sensible, workable solution in consultation with the states. The state and territory leaders were not prepared to agree to the combination of the reconciliation issues with the land management response necessary to Mabo. So the Keating proposal faltered for lack of agreement. From that point, it became clear that the Commonwealth would largely act unilaterally. In the meantime, as the Leader of the Opposition has noted in his address today, the coalition's Mabo subcommittee was undertaking extensive consultations with Aboriginal groups, visiting the Murray Islands, the Kimberleys and elsewhere and discussing the issue with affected parties. We wanted to encourage a considered and informed national response. On 28 June 1993, we released a detailed discussion paper that set the criteria and principles against which any federal government response should be measured. This document formed the basis for the coordination of our remarks and has been a good guide to the consistency of our approach. In summary we said that all Australians should be treated equally under the law; titles should be validated immediately; native title is the law and we therefore recognise the High Court's decision; jobs and development should not be jeopardised; mineral rights should be protected; reconciliation should continue to be pursued, but that the Mabo issue and reconciliation should be settled separately. In contrast, the government has been through these wild gyrations of policy, late night cabinet meetings and the like before finally it introduced this very complex bill last week. Contrary to the predictions of some commentators, the· coalition has rejected the option of a hardline position and adopted a principled and practical approach to Mabo. Our response to the Native Title Bill rests on three pillars of principle. One, recognition of the decision of the High Court that native title exists nationally at common law. Two, recognition that native title is prot-cted by the existing federal law, the Racial Discrimiriation Act and affirmation of our support for that law. Three, recognition that the states have constitutional responsibility for land management and the need for this to be maintained because a Commonwealth takeover is both impractical and will undermine the proper functioning of the Australian federation. Against those principles, the Leader of the Opposition has today moved a second reading amendment which sets them out succinctly. Mr Deputy Speaker, the first thing that strikes us when we read the government's proposal is that the explanatory memorandum claims that the purpose of the bill is to provide for the recognition and protection of native title; whereas already the law in Australia, without any need for federal legislation, is that native title is recognised by a legal system and is already protected by a federal law. The proof of the pudding is in the two Mabo cases. In Mabo case No.1, the Racial Discrimination Act was used by the High' Court to thwart Joh Bjelke-Petersen's attempt to stop the Mabo case dead in its tracks. In Mabo case No.2, the High Court recognised native title. For the recognition and protection of native title, as the Mabo case has proved absolutely beyond doubt, no new and additional federal law and bureaucracy is necessary. When the Prime Minister told the Australian public in his televised address just a week ago that we owe it to Aboriginal Australians to recognise this native title, he was just misleading people. That is the law in the country today. He knows that. When he saw Richard Court in Perth four or ·five weeks ago, he basically said to the premier, 'Don't blame me for native title; blame the High Court'. Later in his address, and noting that the High Court had made a decision, the Prime Minister-without blinking an eyelidasserted that there was not a body of law to give effect to the High Court's decision. This is an incredible distortion. The plaintiffs in Mabo obtained a declaration of their native title. That is what they wanted and that is what they got. Therefore, it is just absurd for the Prime Minister to say that there was not a body of law to give effect to the decision. The bare essentials of this bill pretend to provide rights which have already been given, not by the Prime Minister, but by the High Court. It rriakes nonsense for anyone to suggest that the coalition should support this bill to recognise and protect native title as we are 011 the public record as supporting the recognition and protection of native title already. The Mabo decision was handed down only because of the judicial activism of the High Court. The Labor Party would never have fulfilled the expectations it had created about granting land rights. Bob Hawke cried on the last day of his prime ministership, but there was no way known the Labor Party was going to proceed with national land rightsJegislation. I do not dwell on the issue, but I think the new direction of the High Court in respect of judicial activism is a great folly. I have said so before. I note the recent remarks of the Chief Justice in which he defended this new role for the court. Time does not permit me today to give a detailed response to those recent remarks, but the issue is of national importance, and it should be, and will be returned to at a later date. Before commenting on some of the details of the bill, I want to say something about our first pillar of principle: the recognition of rights. Political parties that promote the private ownership of property and the freedom of the individual must be in the forefront of protecting property rights. Of course, governments can acquire private property but only if they pay compensation and only if they do not discriminate against any citizen or group of citizens. So rights, and in this case property rights, are fundamentally important to Western democratic liberal societies like Australia. I look at it this way: some people say that Mabo is a distraction from Australia's real problems of· economic mismanagement and particularly high unemployment. Nothing could be further from the truth. The real issues in our society are how we treat each other-how we treat the unemployed, the disadvantaged and our Aboriginal citizens. The weight of evidence suggests that, where citizens enjoy rights and respect the rights of others, those circumstances best foster economic success. The consequence of this logic is that, to promote material well-being, our first priority must be to ensure that our people to people relationships are well-founded. In other words, we have to confront first the rights issues. This approach to rights issues is relevant to the Mabo debate and, for that reason, when canvassing the arguments for and against a referendum on native title in the Canberra TImes back on 13 August 1993, I made the point: Needless to say no referendum should displace the need to pay compensation in appropriate cases. In Adelaide in October, I said: ... all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians, are entitled to the enjoyment and protection of their property rights ... In other words, we have to respect each other's rights. The issue then is to define those rights. No-one questions the legitimacy of the High Court per se. I have made it quite clear that, personally, I do not think the High Court should have overturned the acknowledged law; but it did so and its decision is now the law. It has defined rights and those rights must be respected. Of course, a High Court ruling can be overturned, but to overturn this decision-that is, to turn the clock back to pre-June 1992would require the passage of a law that would have to be retrospective and designed to overcome the constitutional requirement to pay just terms for the acquisition of private property. . Whilst the coalition will obviously continue to monitor the Mabo issue-and High Court decisions will be pivotal in marking out the development of native title law-it can now be said that whatever options we may consider in the future, including a referendum, we will never support retrospective discriminatory laws designed to compulsorily acquire property without paying compensation. Having recognised the rights accorded by the High Court and having reaffirmed our support for the Racial Discrimination Act which protects those rights, I totally reject Labor's propaganda that the coalition is promoting states rights over people's rights. This is just a useful cliche for the minister to throw to the airwaves. Our policy protects rights by federal law. It also keeps our federal system intact and so, by the devolution of power, protects people's rights by putting limits on the powers of politicianssomething I would have thought all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians, ought to strongly support. We will not stand by and allow the Keating government to use native title as an excuse to grab more power for Canberra at the expense of our federal system which has long protected the rights of all Australians. From this policy vantage point, it becomes possible to more clearly understand the true intent of the Keating legislation. Our policy position declared last week on 18 November, by unequivocally acknowledging people's rights and saying unequivocally that we are prepared to maintain federal law to protect those rights, puts an end to the dirty line the Labor people have been running that we are not prepared to acknowledge people's rights. Once we get past base A, then we can start to look at the real intent of the legislation. This legislation is about a lot more than Mabo per se. But it does include, 'beyond recognition and protection, the law to enable the validation of existing titles to land. Basically, as a policy concept, that is one which we have long supported and called for. We do- however, have doubts about the means by which ,the government intends to effect the validation process through the special measures provisions. I say that because the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination does provide for the implementation or introduction of special measures provisions. But the convention does make it clear that these measures are for catch-up purposes only and, accordingly, are to be temporary in nature. Moreover, those special measures are to be for the sole purpose of advancement of Aboriginal peoples. It is questionable, in my view, that this test satisfied as the bill has other purposes, includfor ing the validation of certain land grants with the consequent extinguishment of native title. I believe that these concerns have the potential to undermine the constitutional validity of the bill and it is therefore no surprise that neither of these qualifications is referred to in the preamble to the bill which makes extensive references to the special measures provisions contained in the convention. In my view, the simplest and most effective course of action is to temporarily relax the operation of the RDA to validate past grants, which is what the government was going to do on and up until 2 September this year. Mr Tickner-So you support over-riding the RDA? '",47
135,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,There are many other problems with the billMr Tickner-So that is your view?,51
136,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was the government's view back on 2 September and the minister publicly supported it, so do not give us this selfrighteousness. All it does is provide backdated compensation, and at question time the Prime Minister mounted the argument for it. Write that down and also write down the basis of my article in the Canberra Times which argued this case six weeks ago. Mr Tickner-That is the coalition view?",51
137,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me go on. There are many other problems with the bill. The fact is that it is very complex. It fails to remedy the uncertainty that has arisen about land I do not know why the minister is surprised because it was in our statement last week which the minister ought to have read. The bill is also impractical in attempting to manage state land systems. It will precipitate legal wrangles. It will certainly precipitate a constiian tutional wrangle. It goes way beyond the High Court's decision. It provides native title holders with a right of negotiation over future development, which amounts to a de facto right of veto, and it proposes with a costly land acquisition fund. The principal problem will be that, for the industries most affected, any development project is likely to is be bogged down in the tribunals and courts years, which will be at very great expense to all Australians. There are other aspects of the bill: for example, legal assistance is not being made equally available to claimants and respondents; the tribunals will not be required to abide by the normal rules of evidence; assessors must wherever practical be indigenous persons; and assessors will be able to prevent the cross-examination of witnesses. These proposals are simply not fair and should not be pursued by the government. From this analysis it is obvious that this bill is incredibly complex and largely unnecessary. It contains a lot more than recognised by the High Court in Mabo, it goes well beyond Mabo, and that is confirmed in the preamble to the bill. The Leader of the Opposition outlined the coalition's alternative in his speech on the second reading, and in his statement last week he outlined the details of the coalitionalternative which flows from the three pillars of principle which I outlined very briefly to the House today. In summary, rather than building a new bureaucracy of tribunals, assessors and registrars, which will only create further uncertainty, destroy investment and lose more jobs, a fairer and more workable response to Mabo would see the Commonwealth and the states working together to validate existing titles through complementary legislation and leaving the states with the right to manage land titles in the future, provided that they recogtitle. nise the High Court decision and meet the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act. As time is now getting away from me, I also endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in respect of the Western Australbill. Subject to the proviso of acknowledgment of the High Court's decision and the operations of the Racial Discrimination Act, I would similarly support and extend his remarks in respect of Victorian and New little detail South Wales legislation. I also refer very briefly to the special circumstances in the Northern Territory. Given that we now have the national land rights system brought down at common law by the High Court, I think it is appropriate that there be some review of the operations of the statutory federal scheme in the Northern Territory. Mabo raises a lot of other issues. One of the important issues is the question of self determination. An understanding of the right of self-determination is made more complex because it means different things to different people. The government is in the process of signing a new UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. That will, of course, extend beyond the Mabo debate and raise other issues. Given the government's handling of this particular issue, I would not trust sign a UN declaration without a proper debate in the federal parliament. As I understand it, that matter is coming up in the UN Human Rights Commission in 1994. There ought to be a proper public exposure of the issues in this parliament. Obviously the Mabo debate will continue for many years. This legislation is just another chapter. Inevitably all these issues will end up back in the High Court whence they originated. After that process the coalition will have to consider the option of advocating the repeal of this bill if it passes the Senate. (Time expired)",51
138,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On few occasions in a nation's development is an opportunity provided to a society to correct a great social injustice or a grave misdeed. This year, in the International Year for the World's Indigenous People, our nation has been offered such a chance. We have been given a fresh start to pass the test that we have been continually failing for more than 200 yearsthe test of extending to the indigenous people of this land the same opportunities and hopes, the same dignity and care, that we have offered to other peoples from around the world whom we invite to join our community. The legislation under debate, the Native Title Bill 1993, is a major component of the successful response to this test and significantly advances upon the other Commonwealth achievements .of this decade to date: the establishment and work of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, self-determination for Aboriginal and lslander people through the operation of ATSIC, and the Commonwealth response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. All of these endeavours now have a new foundation upon which to continue to advance their common aims and objectives, which are to provide Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with the same living conditions and life opportunities as all other Australians. This new foundation is the ending of the legal fiction of terra nullius and the recognition of the legal fact of native title. The High Court of Australia in its decision in June 1992 it to did what successive British and Australian governments had failed to do since the first permanent settlement of British people in 1788: it gave legal recognition to prior occupancy of this continent. The court held that Australia at the commencement of British settlement was occupied and possessed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who had their own laws, customs and traditions, and whose native title to land survived the Crown's annexation of Australia. In reaching its decision the court acknowledged that earlier perceptions of Aboriginal society as disorganised groups wandering the bush were quite wrong and effectively racist. As the main judgment said: It is imperative in today's world that the common law should neither be, nor seen to be, frozen in an age of racial discrimination. Specifically, the court found that the Crown gained radical title-that is, the ultimate or underlying right to control or administer the land-but did not wipe out existing native title. It did not give the Crown exclusive ownership of land. From the commencement of settlement, respective governmentsBritish, colonial, state, territory and Commonwealth-could extinguish native title by legislation or by granting interests in land such as freehold and certain leasehold interests. Since the passage of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975, the power of the Crown as vested in state and territory govemments to extinguish native title by legislative or executive action is subject clauses of the Racial Discrimination Act. This judgment was no radical or revolutionary departure from the High Court's charter, as has been claimed by some reactionary elements. The Court did not usurp the role of the parliament by making its own laws. The High Court exercised its proper authority to review the basis of law in this country. Its ruling on this case was consistent with the British common law, which is the foundation of the Australian legal system. The High Court followed the same approach of similar courts in Canada, the United States and New Zealand-all former British colonies which have similar legal systems to Australia. The court adopted the same reasoning as the British Privy Council in various African land cases and as the High Court itself did in the Papua New Guinea land case. The High Court recognised that there has been a second stream of law existing side by side with British common law since first settlement. It recognised that the indigenous people of Australia had traditional laws and customs and that native title is part of that process. Native title existed over almost all mainland Australia and Tasmania at the time of British settlement in 1788, the exceptions being genuinely uninhabited areas. Since then the actions of government have wiped out native title over large parts of the continent. With the passage of the legislation under consideration, the government has called a halt to the wholesale extinguishment of native title rights sti11 in existence. This government has seized the historic opportunity given to us by the High Court to restore the rights of Aboriginal and Islander Australians to possession of their land. As has consistently been the case throughout generations of governments at state and federal level, it is only Labor which has the vision, the commitment and the wi11 to appreciate the enormous significance of this judgment. Only Labor has the capacity and the skill to engage in a legislative, social and political process to advance and firmly establish the principles of justice, equity and human rights in response to the recognition of to the overriding native title. The opposition has palpably failed Australia and all Australians of present and future generations. Rather than joining the government in a national, common, progressive response, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has allowed the coalition once more to sink into the lowest depths of bigotry, scaremongering and incitement of division in our society. His performance in the alleged address to the nation last Thursday evening and his comments made in this debate today emphatically demonstrate to the Australian community the incapacity of the Leader of the Opposition to rise above short-term partisan politics when faced with an issue of overwhelming national significance. His comments are designed to appeal to the redneck conse-­ vative elements in our country and to appease those within his own party ranks who would have been quite at home in the periods of mass shooting, nour poisoning and genocidal days of frontier Australia. . It is a great disappointment to many people on this side of the House that the spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation on policies to address Aboriginal needs which were a of feature of this last parliament did not continue when confronted with a more fundamental challenge to the established regime. I tum now to some specific clauses of the bill. The first and most crucial clauses in this legislation are clauses 3 and 9. Clause 9 reads: Native title is recognised, and protected, in accordance with this Act. Native title is defined as the rights and interests that are possessed under the traditional laws and customs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in land and waters and that are recognised by the common law. To facilitate certainty, the Commonwealth has provided a straightforward mechanism to determine whether or not native title exists and what the rights and interests are that comprise native title. This clear recognition of native title in the Commonwealth's act stands in stark contrast to the legislative response of the Western Australian. Liberal gqvernment, which seeks to extinguish all native title rights and replace them with a deed or grant from the government over traditional land. Such an approach destroys the fundamental principle of an inherent right to the land, as determined by the High Court, for indigenous Australians and replaces it with a government handout which can easily be withdrawn on a future occasion. This latter process is the preferred model for many Liberals and emphasises their complete lack of social or political conscience. The bill does comply with Australia's international obligations. Its approach is nondiscriminatory. It constitutes a special measure for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders under article 14 of the Internaof tional Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and under section 8 of the Racial Discrimination Act. Unlike the claim in the distortions peddled by the Leader of the Opposition, the bill clearly validates past acts of the Commonwealth, states and territories on land title. The governcance ment has, since the High Court's decision, consistently stated that the interests in land granted by governments should not be placed at risk as a result of the recognition of native title. This has been achieved in this bill. There is no risk, as a result, to people's backyards, or business, or mining, or the pastoral industry from this act. The frenzied attempt by the opposition to create hysteria and fear about the security of existing titles has been a dangerous but futile effort.· The common sense of the Australian people has rejected these attempts to distract them from the objectives and benefits of this legislation. The process for determination of native title and for future use of native title land take up a significant proportion of this bill. The procedures for the establishment of a National Native Title Tribunal and the recognition of the state and territory systems which comply with the principles of this bill are outlined in clear and easily understood detail. The membership of the tribunal will comprise a president and other presidential members who must be judges of the Federal Court or former judges of any Commonwealth or state court. It requireS the participation of non-presidential members who have special knowledge in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies, land management and dispute resolution. The Federal Court will hear contested claims for a determination of native title or for compensation. The court will also hear appeals on specific decisions or matters from the tribunal. This legislation is a result of an extensive public debate which has dominated the federal caucus and cabinet, state leaders, the media, the opposition, Aboriginal interests and their community leadership, and everyone else who had an opinion, since June last year. As a member of the caucus Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs committee and as chair the parliamentary committee, I was an active participant in this process. I was fully aware of the various negotiating positions, the variety of legal advice, the concessions being made by parties to the negotiations and the intransigence displayed by others. Apart from the enormous historical signifiof the High Court decision itself, of great importance in this tortuous process was the recognition, at last, of Aboriginal Australia as an equal party in the negotiations. Never before had Australia's indigenous people been so directly and extensively involved in the process of formulating government policy and legislation in an area of significance to them. This recognition by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was a vital demonstration of a new maturity in white Australia's dealings with the original inhabitants of this land. It had never happened before, but it must and will be the pattern of the future. It also contrasts markedly with the inability of people on the other side in this place to demonstrate a simila:r maturity in their relationship with indigenous Australians. As far as Aboriginal and Islander people are concerned, significant gains in this legislation protect their interests and bring about much greater clarity to the meaning and significance of the native title decision. Of particular importance is that the Commonwealth government has maintained its leadership role in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs conferred upon it by the decision of the overwhelming majority of Australians in the 1967 constitutional referendum. Second, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 will apply to the native title legislation. This suspended in order to validate past grants. Third, there will be a choice of forum for native title claimants. Claimants will be able to take their claims to the Commonwealth tribunal-whether or not the states and territories have established their own native tribunals-and the Commonwealth will require the states and territories to satisfy the Commonwealth criteria before state and territory tribunals are recognised as appropriate bodies to deal with native land title. Fourth, where pastoral leases have been acquired by Aboriginal people, the Aboriginal lessees will be able, under the legislation, to convert their pastoral lease into native title where it can be shown that native title would have existed but for the pastoral lease. Fifth, validated mining leases will not extinguish native title. Codes of conduct will also be developed to set out appropriate arrangements to apply to mining on native title land. Sixth, there will be a right of negotiation in relation to activities on native title land. be no mistake about the importance of the way in which this parliament and this government respond to the High Court decision. Our success or failure in resolving the issues resulting from the recognition of native title will have a significant bearing on our standing in the world. We cannot resign ourselves to failure or hide behind the excuse of the perceived difficulties involved. We nonAboriginal Australians should remind ourselves that it is our responsibility to act decisively and with compassion on the continuing evidence of demoralisation, desperation and fractured identity of so many Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. At Redfern in December last year, at the launch of the International Year for the World's Indigenous Peoples, the Prime Minister eloquently summed up the challenge as follows: Isn't it reasonable to say that if we can build a prosperous and remarkably harmonious multicultural society in Australia, surely we can find just solutions to the problems which beset the first Australians-the people to whom the most injustice has been done. The starting point might be to recognise that the problem starts with us nonact will not be Aboriginal Australians. It begins, I think, with that act of recognition. Recognition that it was we who did the dispossessing. We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life. We brought the diseases. The alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised discrimination and exclusion. I quote further from the Prime Minister's speech: We need practical building blocks of change. The Mabo judgment should be seen as one of these. By doing away with the bizarre conceit that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans, Mabo establishes a fundamental truth and lays the basis for justice. It will be much easier to work from that basis than has ever been the case in the paSt. For that reason alone, we should ignore the isolated outbreaks of hysteria and hostility of the past few months. Mabo is an historic decision-we can make it an historic turning point, the basis of a new relationship between indigenous and non-Aboriginal Australians. The message should be that there is nothing to fear or lose in the recognition of historical truth, or the There can extension of social justice, or the deepening of Australian social democracy to include indigenous Australians. There is everything to gain. These words clearly articulate the vision that has driven the Prime Minister and others on this side of the House for the past 12 months to achieve a fair, just and equitable response that advances the High Court decision into a practical set of procedures. It is now essential that those Australians who share this vision and the commitment to social justice give their support to the federal legislation. Those seeking to destabilise, to undennine, to tear down these goals, cannot be allowed to succeed because of the silence of the many Australians who do support that basic Aussie ethic of a fair go. The debate cannot be dominated by fear, prejudice and discrimination. For us to have any hope in the future; justice must be finally achieved. Finally, I wish to acknowledge the endorsement that this legislation has received from a large number of important Australian leaders. During the process of national debate leading up to the finalisation of this legislation, I did express some concerns at the position that was being pursued by the Queensland government and, in particular, the Queensland premier. I am pleased in this debate to acknowledge that the Queensland government has expressed !ts support for this legislation, and I note its intention to pass complementary legislation to this Native Title Bill through Queensland parliament. The Queensland premier's endorsement of this federallegislation is appreciated and is a demonstration of the continued commitment of the state Labor government in Queensland to social justice. I commend the bill to the House.",52
139,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Native Title Bill 1993 is, of course, the government's response to the High Court decision on the Mabo case. Before making my contribution as Leader of the National Party, and as the member for Farrer, I welcome various people to the gallery, including Aboriginal and other representatives. This debate will take place over three days-three days when there will be a lot of committees meeting and other activities associated with the parliamentary sitting week, three very important days in the history of parliament&ry democracy and in the determination of the future of this nation. I declare that I have no particular pecuniary interest or member's interest to disclose. I resent any ministerial attack or assertion to the contrary. I would pose the rhetorical question to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, that we have just dealt with an industrial relations bill and I did not hear too much from those on the government benches about trade union positions or declarations associated with industrial relations legislation. My interests are properly declared in the Register of Members' Interests, as are all other members' interests. That iswhy we set up that register. So let us stay the course with that register whilst ever it exists. I again state that I deal with this bill constructive basis and not on anything to do with any particular land title I mayor may not hold. Let me also say that I do have broad respect for all participants on all sides of the argument in relation to the Mabo issue-a very contentious and controversial issue. I do not accuse the Labor Party or the Australian Democrats of being un-Australian or of having any other derogative motivation. In fact, it is fair to say that all sides of parliament seek a fair and sensible outcome to the Mabo, but there is legitimate disagreement over the best method which might be adopted. I believe that everyone on all sides of the political spectrum wants to see improved living standards for Aborigines, improved health statistics, longer lifespans, better education profiles, less alcoholism and so forth. Improvements have been carried out, for example, at Alcoota, north-east of Alice Springs, which I think is a very good model of a community that is making very real progress-a community I was pleased to visit with Senator Grant Tambling and others earlier this year. I make it quite plain that the National Party and the Liberal Party have approached this issue, and will continue to approach this issue, in a constructive way. I say to the government that this issue is not going to go away simply with the passage of this legislation, should it pass through the parliament later this year. I do not believe that anyone in this country seriously wants to put down indigenous people or their legitimate aspirations. These things, in a sense, are not political issues. No party has a monopoly on compassion in relation to this particularly complex issue. The Mabo debate, and the more general reconciliation debate, are essentially about the method-the means rather than the end objective-of improving the health and educational lot of so many Australians. We all want to see the very best possible outcome for Aborigines in Australia. Our differences are in regard to the way we go about improving the lot of Australians of Aboriginal heritage. From my point of view, one of the great hurdles, one of the great difficulties, in on a coming to terms with this issue on a factual basis has been the interventions of the politically correct agenda setters who have been a unreasonably reactive to contrary points of .view and have tried to be both possessive and patronising in the way that they want the debate presented to Australia as a whole. I genuinely believe that history will treat the Mabo debate as a particular and very special one, an indication of the immaturity which was associated with the reportage of the debate in the course of the recorded history of the decade of the 1990s. I do not care what the issue is, whether it is Aboriginal affairs, drug abuse, the justice system or the High Court, as referred to by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), but when plain, irrefutable facts are deemed to be inconvenient, politically incorrect, unwise, unhelpful whatever, frankly, the way so many have been treated in the course of this debate is a great pity. I have been one of the prime targets of the politically correct agenda setters. Frankly, I am not so concerned about that because it is my experience that the most valuable contributions in this general debate have invariably come from those in communities whose life experience has involved direct contact with Aboriginal communities rather than just reading about the issues in a benevolent frame of mind from the leafy suburbs of Sydney or Melbourne. It is these people-that is, those who live and work with Aboriginal communities-whose comments and views have shaped my contribution to the general debate. To illustrate. how much spin was put on the debate by the politically correct agenda setters, I would like briefly to recount some of the issues I raised and their treatment by the print media in particular. I raised those matters reflecting the legitimate .concern of millions of Australians in order to stand up to the politically correct agenda setters and so that we might have a parameter in which we could work purposefully as a nation as a whole towards a proper solution to the Mabo question. Back in June this year I delivered a speech to the New South Wales National Party conference at Wagga. I made the point that Aboriginal dispossession was sad but inevitable. To make. a judgment about this, one has to bear in mind the social Darwinism which pervaded white colonial culture and the expansionary competitiveness of the European superpowers at that time. Does anyone seriously suggest that in 1993 the great land mass of Australia-the world's largest island continent-would be undiscovered and not just in the 18th century? It is said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that the concept of terra nullius is a denial of Aboriginal existence. It is no such thing. From this, of course, follows the fallacious nature of the government's response. Any reading of history will demonstrate an acute awareness by the first British settlers, including men like Arthur Phillip, of or the existence of the natives and the need to deal with them in a benevolent manner. Terra nullius as a concept meant that the native inhabitants did not intensely utilise their land, as much as simply traversing it, living as a nomadic people. The history of the British as colonisers is well recorded. It has its good points and it has its bad points. It is well known that they invariably went out of their way to seek treaties with indigenous people wherever. As Professor Blainey and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) have pointed out, treaties were made in New Zealand, Fiji, India, Malaysia and North America. It is on the historical record that instructions were clearly given to Captain Arthur Phillip to make treaties with the indigenous people of Australia when the British first settled here. The reason no treaties were made does not represent a denial of Aboriginal existence but, rather, that there was no leadership or cultural structure with which to negotiate. Ironically, quite recently the Prime Minister himself was wringing his hands at the difficulty he was having in negotiating with the Aboriginal community, referred to by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr HewsOJ1) in his excellent address. At any rate, these arguments are at the core of my first sin from the point of view of the politically correct agenda setters. They never mentioned that in the same speech I highlighted where there was real progress, such as at Alcoota. Neither did they mention my praise of Aboriginal culture as manifested through their rock art, crafts, music, dance and their tribal customs and practices. They made no reference to my reference to Mungo National Park and other places around Australia which are of great significance to all Australians, particularly Aboriginals. So we move to my next sin-binning in which I used the tenn 'guilt industry'. Once again there was a barrage of criticism by those with compassionate hearts but often with little grasp of the issues. Of course, the great irony has been that the Prime Minister, in his fonnal televised address, said there was no room for guilt and that we had to look forward in a positive way. So the Prime Minister has done a complete U-turn on that aspect of guilt, something that he crjticised me on in January of this year. It seems that it is okay for the Prime Minister to say that there is no room for guilt but that it is not okay for the Leader of the National Party to say it. I move on now to my third sin-binning, when I simply made the point that it is not only Australians of Aboriginal heritage who can feel a strong attachment to the land. The National Party, above all, understands what it means to have a strong attachment to the land. There are families in Australia who have held their land for generations. Their forebears worked the land and were buried on the land. They have lived for generations in the same homestead. Out of that process is created an extremely strong bond with the land. For these fanners and their families, their holding of land and their attachment to it goes deeper than just an investment. They consider themselves custodians of the land, not merely investors in the land. It is not correct in all the circumstances to argue that this attachment to the land is qualitatively different the deep attachment felt by Aboriginals and that the land has greater significance to many native tribes. It is perfectly reasonable to to the House in the context of this debate that many fanning families have as deep an attachment to the land as native tribes have had over the centuries. I highlight that on this complex. occasion. Fourthly and lastly, I was sin-binned on the issue of aboriginality. On that issue I simply quoted the government's definition of aboriginality, comparing it with definitions used overseas. I did not argue that it be changed but, of course, I was sin-binned for even daring to mention it. I thank Frank Devine and the other columnists who focused on the criticisms mounted by the politically correct agenda setters for pointing out that in this country, if we want to progress the Mabo debate and come to some solution, we must be able to handle it in a mature way and not brand people as racist who dare to raise legitimate dimensions associated with Aboriginal affairs. I want °to move on now to the specifics of the government's Native Title Bill. Firstly, I want to make it absolutely clear that the National Party totally supports the arguments put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, both in his televised address and in his most recent speech to the parliament today. I will not repeat what the Leader of the Opposition has said in detail but I would like to make several observations. The government has not attempted serious negotiation of this issue with the states, which have responsibility for land management. It is known that both Richard Court in Western Australia and Marshall Perron in the Northern Territory have indicated their opposition to the government's approach and their resentment of the fact that they were squeezed out of the negotiations at various key stages. There is another state to which I would like to draw the attention of the HouseQueensland. Wayne Goss, the Premier of Queensland, has been virtually sHent in making any specific endorsement of the government's proposals. Yes, he put out the mandatory minimal statement of support, but from there will be a new tenn in the Australian political lexicon from this day onwards-the 'Wayne Goss whisper'. The Wayne Goss put whisper was about all We heard from Wayne Goss in support of the government's Mabo legislation. Mr Reith-He whispered that it was",56
140,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, he whispered that. He really wants nothing to do with the approach. But, for the sake of the Wik people's claim and CRA's Gladstone and Weipa investments, he has been dragged screaming across the finishing line. He has done it reluctantly, with a Wayne Goss whisper, and with an approach that is anything but supportive of the true terms of the federal government's legislation. It is widely speculated that Wayne Goss, along with the other two leaders I mentioned, opposes the tribunal dimension associated with the Mabo legislation. This is a major blow to the government which, when combined with a significant opposition from within the Aboriginal community, makes for a contentious approach which is headed for trouble. In a press statement, Mr Ray Robinson informs us that at a demonstration in the Roma Street forum, which was attended by 4,000 Aboriginal people, he put two questions. He asked whether there was support for the federal Mabo legislation. The response from the 4,000 people attending that Aboriginal demonstration in the Roma Street forum was 'No'. When he putthe second question, which was whether they were satisfied that the Aboriginal people meeting with the Prime Minister and Cabinet had a mandate to represent the Aboriginal people, the answer was again a unanimous 'No'. These are not Tim Fischer's words but the words of Ray Robinson at the· meeting in the Roma ·Street forum in Brisbane. There is division within the Aboriginal community. Indeed, Pat O'Shane has said that this legislation should be 'junked' - her word-and I must say that she is right, if for the wrong reasons. This legislation should be junked in the interests of the future of Australia, the Australian standard of living and the well-being of Aboriginal people. Bearing in mind the complexity of the government's approach, I would contrast the far simpler and more workable approach of the federal coalition. It is a framework approach with four absolutely fundamental principles. First, despite the deliberate distortion tions of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander Affairs-although, to be fair, he finally corrected himself this day on this matter-the coalition acknowledges the High Court decision and, therefore, acknowledges the existence of native title. I took that position early on, well ahead of the rest of the debate. Of course, in so doing, I always accepted the need to put some depth and width into the debate if we are going to carry the vast majority of Australians forward ' on that key point-the acknowledgment of the existence of native title. Secondly, the coalition believes that the Racial Discrimination Act-the relevant federal l\?gislation-must be adhered to. Thirdly, the coalition believes that just terms compensation must be paid in certain circumstances. These were detailed by the honourable member for Flinders in his address, so I will not dwell on them. Lastly, we are strongly of the view that for reasons of common sense, practicality, and to reneet the fact that our Constitution says that Australia is a federation, titles in this country are and should continue to be managed by the states. In that regard, titles legislation should apply to all citizens, including those of Aboriginal heritage. Those opposite like to highlight the role of the National Farmers Federation in the impact of this legislation on the pastoral industry. I remind those opposite, before they get too smug, that many of the constituent oodies of the NFF totally and fundamentally disagree with the position of the NFF, and for good reason. I also warn the House that there will be a major change in the published position of a number of organisations, particularly in Queensland- as they realise the effectiveness of the type of leasehold that dominates the Queensland land system. It is ,a term leasehold, not leasehold in perpetuity. Sadly, there is now a huge wedge of difference in the way term leasehold versus leasehold in perpetuity is· affected by this legislation, let alone in the security of term leasehold versus freehold. I have here a fact sheet issued by the NFF. It deals with pastoral leases which are deemed valid and where there is no statutory reservaof Aboriginal interest. The fact sheet says: Legal advice is that the valid grant of a pastoral lease is almost certain at common law to extinguish native title. It goes on to say: It is possible that valid pastoral leases may 'be tested in court to decide whether any form of native title remains, even though there is no support such action from mainstream Aboriginal groups. It is little wonder that many of the constituent bodies of the NFF have serious reservations about, and in some cases total opposition to, the current NFF position. Pastoral leasehold must be fully validated without qualification. That includes lease in perpetuity, and it includes term leasehold, which relates to the majority of the Queensland land mass. Clearly, other speakers in this debate will further develop this point because it is critical to the end objective of validating existing leasehold and freehold title. I accept that that general objective is supported by both sides of the parliament. The debate is over the method, the end result and the end outcome arising from this legislation, especially with regard to Queensland term leasehold where introduction there is a fixed end date for the leasehold part of the pastoral lease system and the holder in question must apply for renewal that lease. This is now an exposed situation for those leaseholders. Incidentally, I have never said in the course of this debate that backyards are at risk the Prime Minister, after attacking me on score, eventually had to withdraw that claim. I choose not to make that comment even this occasion, although I note that there been some interesting developments in Alice Springs this week in relation to that aspect Mabo. The ultimate judgment on this legislation concerns its complexity and, therefore, the fact that it simply will not work. My view is that this legislation is a prescription for long and drawn out legal battles, for lining of lawyers' pockets in many ways and for greater uncertainty in the investment climate-which is about the last this country needs. What is needed is a simpler, more workable approach. That is precisely what the Liberal and National parties offer on this occasion-a simpler and more workable approach which means that we can properly come to grips with the ramifications of the Mabo High Court decision and look after the fundamental problems associated with Aboriginal welfare, living standards, health and education. It is for these issues that future Australians will judge this government and future governments. It is for these reasons that I strongly advocate the coalition's approach and oppose the legislation before the House.",58
141,Mr LES SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I say, as did the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) earlier today, what a proud moment it is to be able to stand and support the Native Title Bill 1993. In this, the 37th parliament, I believe we have before us probably one of the greatest opportunities in the history of all parliaments to correct a great injustice. I think it is important that this legislation is carried, and it is unfortunate that it does not enjoy the bipartisan support that it should have. During the debate outside this place leading up to the of this legislation, I have had the as opportunity to discuss the various issues with landmany people-both Aboriginal and nonof Aboriginal-and I have come to the view that we are making the right decision. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that on 27 September 1993 the parliament carried a and motion of condolence upon the death of one that of the most outstanding Aboriginal women .that we have seen in modem times. I was on inspired by .that wom;m when I had the have opportunity to meet her-on only one occasion, unfortunately-at an ATSIC regional of conference in Queensland. We ,spoke about a number of issues and, as usual, she was outspoken and certainly took the opportunity to tell members of parliament where we were own going wrong. We talked about the 1967 referendum, to which the minister referred the earlier, and the outstanding support it had received. But she reminded me that there was still one problem that had to be corrected: the thing that concept of terra nullius. I think that is what this legislation is all about, and certainly the High Court's Mabo decision addressed just that. I was certainly inspired by that lady and what she had to say. Tonight and over the next two days of debate I think we will have the opportunity to correct that injustice. The High Court's decision on native title-commonly referred to as the Mabo decision-provided us with the oppor0!1 tunity to face the truth about our past and to build a more just and democratic society for the future for all Australians. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was correct when he said in his press release of 3 June 1992-the day the High Court handed down the Mabo decision-that it would become one of the most analysed and dissected decisions in the history of the High Court. By doing away with the obscene and racist notion of terra nullius-the notion that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeansthe Mabo judgment laid the foundation for justice. The challenge for this government has been to deal with the implications resulting from the High Court's decision in a way that delivers justice to Aboriginal and Torres Islander people while ensuring certainty for existing property owners. In order to achieve this balanced response the government embarked on a lengthy process of consultations with Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, as well as with state governments, mining companies, farmers and other industry groups. The majority of the parties involved in these discussions participated in a constructive way and showed a willingness to compromise. This bill is a result of these community consultations. The government's legislative response to the High Court's decision on native title is fundamentally about human rights and correcting over 200 years of injustice suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The government and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, churches, welfare groups, the National Fanners Federation and the other industry groups which have supported this legislation have shown that they are able to rise to the occasion created by the Mabo decision. But very sadly, the opposition-the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in particular-has shown that it is not able to rise to the occasion. The opposiAboriginal tion, to its credit, behaved in a responsible manner following the High Court's decision last June and supported the consultation process initiated by the government. However, since the return of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith)-who spoke earlier-to the front-bench, this commitment to a bipartisan approach has fallen away. Last week's shadow cabinet decision to oppose this bill removed all doubt that the Liberal and National parties have been captured by people promoting an extreme right wing agenda. The address by the Leader of the Opposition to the nation on Thursday of last week represented a new low point in the coalition's contribution to the issue of native title. The speech deliberately distorted the facts of both the Mabo decision .and the government's Native Title BilL During this regrettable episode the Leader of the Opposition again raised furphies, including the claim Strait that people's homes or farms were under threat. He said, 'Land will be actually locked up from economic development'. The absolute support of the National Farmers Federation for the Native Title Bill at its national conference last week demonstrates just how hollow this claim is. This disgraceful effort in scaremongering is complet-ly false, as the native title legislation, rather than stopping investment projects, will return certainty to our land management system. Another reason given by the Leader of the Opposition for the coalition's decision to oppose the legislation was his claim that the legislation was a grab for more power for Canberra. This statement reflects very poorly on the opposition leader. Honourable members opposite have sadly chosen to put their loyalty to one state premier, the premier of Western Australia, above any commitment to the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. A party which puts the rights of states above the rights of people is not even worthy of the name LiberaL Human rights must come before states rights. The move away from bipartisanship on this issue is disappointing. From my contact with coalition members of parliament through my membership of the Standing Committee on and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I know that a significant number of coalition members do not support the extremist views now being promoted by the leadership of their parties. I would urge the more moderate members opposite to follow the example of people such as former senator and member of this House, Fred Chaney, and express their opposition to the hijacking of the discussion on native title by the extremists in the coalition. While the opposition has failed to seize the historic opportunity presented by the High Court's decision on native title, the government has not missed this opportunity. The Native Title Bill 1993 provides a framework for the implementation of the High Court's decision in the Mabo case, while at the same time proteCts the rights of existing property holders .. The bill is not just a landmark in Australian legal history; it will also provide a firm basis for reconciliation between Aboriginal Australians and non-Aboriginal Australians. I now tum to some further aspects of the bill. It is not the intention of the government to catalogue the native title rights Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in this legislation. The High Court's Mabo decision made it clear that indigenous people's native title rights vary from location to location, depending upon traditional laws and customs of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the area under consideration . The legislation puts in place a process to determine in which cases native title applies. The bill introduces a National Native Title Tribunal, as well as giving the Federal Court the ability to adjudicate native title and compensation claims. The Native Title Bill will recognise tribunals or similar bodies set up by state or territory governments where these tribunals have been established in a legislative framework consistent with the federal act. While individuals will be free to pursue a native title claim on their own, the government will be able to recognise organisations which are representative of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to pursue claims on their behalf. Under the bill, the Attorney-General will have the ability to provide funding for these groups to pursue their claims, subject to guidelines which will be developed by the government in consultation with representatives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other interested parties such as the National Farmers Federation. This provision is important as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are amongst the most socially and economically disadvantaged in our society. If the government, through this legislation, were merely to give indigenous people rights as individuals to pursue native title claims, such a right would have little meaning in practice as a large number of them would simply be unable to afford the legal expenses involved in such a claim. The recognition of representative groups will have the added benefit of bringing some order to the. way claims are brought forward, increasing· the operational efficiency of the tribunal system. An important point to emphasise about this legislation is that it protects the rights of existing property holders. All grants ofland made before 31 December this year, and the renewal and extension of these available to grants, will be made valid. One point of contention which has arisen from the clauses of this bill providing for the validation and security of existing grants of land is in the treatment of mining leases. Mining interests have objected to the proposed legislation because it gives native title holders the right to negotiate the revival of native title when the mining lease is finished. These are not reasonable objections as these rights are not in excess of rights which already exist for holders of other forms of title. All the federal government is asking the mining companies to do is negotiate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who hold native title-as they would with any other landowner. Negotiation is not something we should put aside. It is very important that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the right to negotiate like anybody else. It is not a big ask. Aborigines will have the right to negotiate-and that is important-with anyone seeking to take out a mining .lease, but will not have a veto over any mining proposal. In the case of exploration leases, native title holders will have the right to negotiate for four months with another four months for arbitration. Where mining leases are concerned, the time wiJI be six months each for negotiation and arbitration. There is nothing in the legislation to prevent negotiations at a regional or local level between governments, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and other interests. I encourage that aspect in the bill for negotiation at the regional and local level-and certainly at the state level. The emphasis is on encouraging conciliation-encouraging indigenous people and mining companies to develop a workable arrangement for projects at a local level. Contrary to the claims of the Leader of the Opposition in his address to the nation, the Native Title Bill will not stifle investment in the mining and pastoral industries; nor will it result in large tracts of land being locked away from future development. On the contrary, industry is a big winner from this legislation. If the government had taken no action and simply allowed the issues raised by the High Court's decision to be worked through the courts, the legal action that would have resulted would have meant a high degree of uncertainty over a substantial number of projects, to the great detriment of the investment climate. This legislation returns certainty to the investment climate by validating all existing titles. The High Court's decision on native title was an important symbolic victory for all Aborigines and Torres Strait Islander people but, whatever the significance of this symbolic victory, it will not do a great deal to address the dispossession suffered by those Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders living in urban areas. In order to go some way towards addressing the dispossession suffered by those Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who have been cut off from their traditional lands, such as those living in urban areas, the bill also provide.s for the establishmoved ment of a land acquisition fund. The exact details of this fund will be set out in legislation to be introduced in the new year. This biJI, without doubt, is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever to .be debated in this House. The government's legislative response to the High Court's decision on native title delivers justice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people while, at the same time, ensuring the integrity of Australia's land management system, thus ensuring continued economic development. I would like to comment on certain aspects of dispossession. There is little doubt-and it was highlighted by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody-that dispossession is one of the cornerstone problems facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Sadly, Aboriginal deaths in custody still continue today-so we have a . long way to go. It is worth mentioning today . that with this legislation we will go through some of those reconciliation processes. Clearly we need a whole cultural change for nonAboriginal Australians in the way we treat Aboriginal people in Australia. If this legislation goes some little way to achieving that, it will .,be a great achievement. There are mixed views in our community about this matter and it is our duty as members of parliament to explain as much as we can, and as often as we can, to the general community just what this native title legislation is all about. It is important that Australians come to terms with the 205 years of iJItreatment of Aboriginal people. This is our opportunity to do it. It is interesting to report that over time. I have had conflict with some of my state colleagues. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) acknowledged that. To them. I say, 'Thanks for your tolerance', because we are here now. ,The honourable member for Moreton reminded us that the Queensland government was prepared to offer complementary legislation. I certainly welcome that and congratulate the Queensland premier on that initiative. In some ways it has been difficult getting through these important issues. In talking about community support, I was by one of my sons who said, 'Dad, what are you blokes doing about the Mabo decision? Why don't you do something to fix up the problems we have in the treatment of Aboriginal people?'. This young fellow is a pretty good writer. I asked his permission to use in the· debate tonight some prose he wrote. He talks about community spirit and what needs to be done. The article is entitled, 'Community spirit', and was written by my son, Stephen Scott. It states: Community spirit is used as a support network. The strength of community spirit depends upon the support required by those who constitute that community. Australia's indigenous people are a good example of this extension or more profound meaning of community spirit. Not only do Aborigines share a common ancestry, they also share a common cultural agenda, that is, the preservation of a civilisation which has suffered under the domination of another. It is that common history of suffering that enables Aborigines to look beyond their tribal ancestry and identify with a wider indigenous community. It is that suffering which strengthens the spirit of the Aboriginal community into a of resistance and solidarity. During this debate many Aboriginal people in different communities have come together for a common cause. That has been important in getting us to the position we are in today. I thank my son Stephen because those words send a message home to us. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody has been mentioned. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) mentioned it and there is plenty of community support as well. Last week my eldest son attended a peaceful rally in Brisbane in memory of a young man who died on his way to prison. I also thank my son for his commitment to this cause. We should all be indebted .to Miss Lois O'Donohue who is in the gallery today. She is the chair of ATSIC and has been magnificent throughout these discussions. She has been very influential in bringing together a lot of people in our community. Along with others, I acknowledge her fine contribution on this issue and to this country. I appreciate the way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been prepared to negotiate and talk to various people-our caucus committee in particular. We have worked this issue through and, at the end of the day, we have come up with the right decision. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who is at the table, has my thanks for his support throughout this process. All his colleagues appreciate his contribution, together with those of his ministerial colleagues. I will not name them all but they are all worthy of acknowledgment today. I have mentioned our state colleagues. I ask members of the Australian Labor Party throughout Australia to think very much about what this means to us as a party with a very deep social conscience. That is what this is all about. It is all about human rights and justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which is important. I would like to acknowledge the contributions of a couple of other people apart from the contribution of members of the Australian Labor Party. My local priest, Father Kearney, force always inspires us in our local church on the requirement to be more responsive to the needs of Aboriginal people, and I acknowledge his contribution. A friend of mine who is on a farm up around Kingaroy encourages me to do my bit here; he too is doing his bit out in the rural sector. He told me one day that he had the opportunity to say a few words in his church. When he was talking about the Mabo legislation he put the question. to the congregation: what would Jesus Christ do?

142,Mr NUGENT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think in many ways the day that the Native Title Bill was introduced will be remembered with some sadness and regret by those of us who believed that the Mabo High Court decision might signal a new era in the indigenous affairs of this nation. This Mabo legislation represents, I believe, a lost opportunity, and I think the government alone must accept responsibility for this because it has failed to deliver a solution judged by its own yardstick. The government's whole handling of the Mabo issue has been divisive and it will almost certainly do long-term damage to indigenous interests and probably to race relations in this country. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been driven by a desire to impose his own solutions and to take control to himself without being able to carry the rest of Australia along with him, whether that is the coalition, the states, much of industry and many in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. Let me say quite clearly that it is important to acknowledge the existence of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this land and their occupation of Australia prior to European settlement. The coalition accepts the High Court decision and acknowledges the need to then incorporate native title into our land management system in a clear and unambiguous manner. The coalition has reaffirmed its commitment to both the Racial Discrimination Act and the reconciliation process. How could we not, given the current disadvantage in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, where life expectancy for today's male Aboriginal baby is 18 years less than for the rest of us-IS years less for females; where middle ear infection afflicts so many of our Aboriginal school children; where there are huge housing backlogs; and where Aboriginal people are overrepresented in gaols and too many are simply economically and socially disadvantaged. To those who like to make the point, this is not about taking a guilt trip; it is about recognising that the severe disadvantage suffered by a section of our community flows from successive Australian government policies and the actions of previous generations of Australians. We must deal with the disadvantage, the ignorance and the prejudice which has continued to filter through to our society today. I repeat: this is not about guilt; it is about acknowledging that to take away land from our indigenous people was not just an act of denying ownership, as our own Western concepts of ownership might see it. To take away their land is to take away their spirit, and whilst the vast majority of Aboriginal people themselves fully accept that after 205 years of European settlement their physical and spiritual connection with the land has been broken, the symbolic recognition of this important relationship is why the High Court's decision held out so much hope for future reconciliation. Yet this most fundamental aspect of the whole Mabo issue seems to be the one which most non-Aboriginal Australians find so difficult to see. Perhaps the way Raimond Gaita put it in the Age recently might assist. He said: To wonder why native title has been so important to many Aborigines is like wondering why Jews who are now German citizens would wish to rid German law of every vestige of the laws which denied that their annihilation could be a crime. It is up to Australians today to recognise the need to deal with the consequences of previous actions. What went before simply has not worked. Governments of all persuasions and with policies of all types have left Third World conditions in this, one of the richest countries in the world. The federal government's responsibility for Aboriginal affairs is driven from the 1967 referendum. That is where the mandate has its source. But it is a fine dividing line between that and usurping states powers in land management. We need to wrestle with that potential conflict of interest. The practical difficulties of discharging federal responsibility for indigenous people when it is in conflict under our federal system of government, where the states have that land management power, needs to be handled with great care and finesse. Unfortunately, this government has failed to discharge its duties in an effective manner in the native title legislation currently before the House. The Mabo decision recognises the truth that terra nullius was a fiction, and it gives Aboriginal people some clear rights in respect of their inherited land. We should respect that in no lesser manner than we do the rights of all other Australians. So often we hear talk that Mabo is about 'giving' land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is not about giving land title to them; it is about confirming that they have title to land which has always existed. During this whole Mabo debate we have been talking about certainty of title: certainty for miners, certainty for farmers, certainty for investors, certainty for freehold owners-all important considerations. However, how many of us have talked about the importance of certainty for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people? For those indigenous people who can establish an unbroken pattern of existence on their land, according to the Mabo decision they may also have certainty of title. This means that those people can now look to the future of their children and their grandchildren knowing that those children will inherit their land. Such certainty is neither more nor any less than the entitlement of other Australian titleholdel,'S. I was one of those who, soon after the High Court decision, had hoped that the symbolism of Mabo could help address some of the broader issues. However, even I, as someone who had that view then, have been forced the government's disastrous handling of this tionist route. matter to concede, as in practice the government has also conceded, that land manageapproach ment and reconciliation matters have now be dealt with separately. The government has in fact acknowledged this, as the land acquisigot tion fund is barely mentioned in the bill the so-called social justice package is simply not there and now is to come, we are told, some time next year. Let me review how the government has handled the whole sorry process. After much delay, it produced its 33 principles and tried to railroad these through the COAG meeting suggest in Melbourne in June. There was no prior political consultation with the states. suggested at that time to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) prior to the publication of 33 principles that we might discuss possible common ground, he evinced enthusiasm, went off to see the Prime Minister, but ultimately never came back to take up the challenge. So how can he now attack us for not being was bipartisan when his own Prime Minister the spurned our advances? Has his memory failed him? The government has, of course, constantly changed its position over the last few weeks and months, depending on whom it spoke to last, be that industry, states or Aboriginal leaders. Is that really the action of a Prime Minister with a vision or is it rather the action of a Prime Minister who is being driven by political caucus considerations? Even as late as a week before the legislaany tion was introduced I made another approach to the minister to see whether there could belatedly, some common ground found. This met with a flat rejection of any suggestion that the two sides could talk together. And yet, day after day, the government has been years. saying that it wants a bipartisan approach. It any has simply not been telling the truth. It is any hypocrisy, and a breathtaking hypocrisy at that-even repeated in this place today by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in this debate. He knows the· truth; he knows that he was approached to seek common ground. Quite simply, the Prime by Minister has chosen a deliberate confrontaI contrast that with the more successful of his predecessor Bob Hawke when to he set up the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Hawke came to us, talked about it, agreement, and only then introduced the and legislation which then, of course, received unanimous support in this parliament. Is it not an irony that the preamble in the Native Title Bill and the preamble in the reconciliation act espouse virtually identical values? Yet the former is the cause of division and the latter has produced cooperation and consultation. I that this is entirely due to the arrogant manner in which the Prime Minister has When I conducted the current debate. I am ashamed to say that we have an those Australian Prime Minister who is playing politics on this vital issue. In his Redfern speech last December, he tried to raise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander expectations. Did he not fully realise the import of what he about? I have to say that the talk around corridors of this place is that the Prime Minister blandly read out what his speech writer had prepared without realising the significance or the ramifications of what the words actually meant to the nation. The government of course acknowledges that the legislation will help only between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the Aboriginal community. Yet this legislation gives precious little detail about the land acquisition fund, and there is nothing in it to give substance to social justice type of aspirations for the overwhelming majority of our Aboriginal and be, Torres Strait Islander people who will not directly benefit· from Mabo. They are the people most in need because they are the ones who have been so appallingly treated over the Our Liberal history in Aboriginal affairs, believe, has been good. I remind the House that Liberal governments brought in the 1967 referendum; created the Aboriginal Affairs Office and the Council for Aboriginal Affairs; and implemented the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. The first Aboriginal member of this federal parliament was a Liberal. I have been around the country during the last three years, but more particularly the last six months, meeting community after munity. I have to say that what I found in the Aboriginal community, by and large, is either a disinterest in, or a lack of knowledge about, Mabo. Many communities have specifically rejected the self-styled negotiating team their representative. I have great respect for some members of that negotiating team, but I have to question whether they are represenmore tative. As for the bill itself: the impracticality the legislation, its complexity and its tainty mean that it will be in the courts  said, and as my leader quoted earlier, it is reading porridge. Of course, state expressed reservations-not only Mr Court  and Fahey. It is hardly resounding support from across the nation. It is perhaps worthwhile noting that the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has acknowledged some good points in the WA . legislation. It has also criticised the WA legislation but has gone on to urge, even this late stage, the Prime Minister to negotiate with the states to find some common ground to resolve this issue of national significance. I believe that that would be true statesmanthis ship, and I ask the Prime Minister why he not big enough to hold out the olive branch. The Prime Minister likes to describe himself as a leader. It would take a big man to change his stance and negotiate. But if such an approach worked, would his place into history not be assured? Would he not truly set persist. this country on a path to reconciling all Australians? As for the administration of land manageof ment, we of course acknowledge that under I our federal system this is a state issue. That does not necessarily mean we support a particular state's action. It means that it is a state's right to take action, provided that that action complies with the Racial Discrimination Act. If that action does not comply, it will be tested in the courts, if necessary. I remind the House that that is precisely what happened in the original Mabo case. The Queensland government tried to legislate to extinguish Eddie Mabo's rights and ultimately comthe High Court found in his favour. We on this side have specifically embraced the High Court decision and the existence of native title. We specifically are prepared to stand by the moral certitude of the Racial as Discrimination Act in relation to what the states might do and the defence of indigenous rights. But we are also concerned with the than 90 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who will not of gain from the native title legislation. I ask: uncerwhere are the government's much promised for plans? We acknowledged the need to separate land management from justice and equjty long like ago. The government did not, but that in fact leaders have is what it has now done. The government will be held to account for its ongoing conduct of indigenous affairs. Once the Mabo issue is resolved, I will still be raising questions about the effectiveness of the measures that the government has put in place to deal with Aboriginal disadvantage because it is too serious a problem to ignore. The Prime Minister may think he has 'solved at Mabo' but the reality is that he has divided the country, set back race relations and, afterwards, all the same old problems will still be there. We acknowledge the disgrace that country will always bear whilst it allows is even a small proportion-in particular, the indigenous proportion-of our population to live in conditions which so many suffer today. now It is simply unacceptable. Regardless of whose fault the present situation is, we have do better and we cannot let the status quo In conclusion, the question could well be asked why I, perhaps as an obvious proponent the justice of the High Court decision, would vote against the government's bill. The bottom line for me is simply that I believe that the legislation will not achieve what is claimed for it and that it is basically poor legislation. Because the government has mishandled the Mabo legislation, because the government has adopted a confrontationist and non-conciliatory approach, because the legislation is simply bad legislation and cannot be easily amended, because I regard it as a lost opportunity, and despite my deep and heartfelt belief that the High Court decision was the right one, it is with some sadness that I have to say that I will personalargument ly oppose this legislation together with the rest of my party. Had the government's actions matched its rhetoric and had it approached the whole Mabo situation in a truly national manner, a much better solution would, could and should have been found-a solution which all parties could have subscribed to. I believe that the Prime Minister's failure of leadership on this issue will not, in his entire career, stand more starkly exposed than it does today.",64
143,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Sitting suspended from 6.36 to 8.00 p.m.,68
144,Mr HOLDING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise to speak on the Native Title Bill. The High Court of Australia in its Mabo decision, in its rejection of the outmoded and false concept of terra nullius, provided this parliament and this nation with an opportunity to redress Australia's oldest and most continuous social wrong and to recognise the depth, nature and spiritual attachment of Aboriginal people to this land. This was the opportunity to provide the basis for a permanent and lasting reconciliation. The speeches delivered today by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) were at best a non-response to Aboriginal hopes and aspirations, and at worse a craven capitulation to those forces within their own parties and to those sections within the corporate sector-particularly certain sections of the mining industry-who will pay lip-service to the principle of native title so long as Aboriginal people do not get any land. In fairness to the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, he makes no apology for the fact that he has been and continues to be opposed to any form of land rights. He is hopeful that, by legislation, he can reverse any benefits that the Mabo decision may confer on our indigenous people. He has never ceased attacking the decision and the personnel of the court. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition-with his leadership difficulties-has fallen in behind the states' rights arguments of Mr Court. Sadly, that is the political reality. In doing that, the Leader of the Opposition has adopted every sleazy that has ever been used over the last decade to hinder Aboriginal aspirations in respect of land. In his speech on television the other night, the Leader of the Opposition was happy to raise the fears of the average Australian that his or her home was under threat. He said: Australians want to be sure they do indeed own their own home. He knows-as members of the coalition know-that native title will largely benefit those Aboriginal people who have maintained constant contact with their land, which of course is mainly in those parts .of Australia where those Aboriginal people live and where white people do not live and do not want to live. He knows that the average Australian home is in no way under threat. In his TV broadcast he indicated that he wanted to ensure that 'all, Australians are treated equally under the law'. That is a commendable concept. But he knows that, in terms of land, that is not the case. Farmers in Western Australia have veto rights in respect of mining operations on their land. I support that. I share the sentiments of the Leader of the National Party when he says that many Australian farmers-particularly second and third generations-have deep feelings towards their land. Many farmers in my state of Victoria would like to have some veto rights over their land because many of them find themselves in a situation where a small mining company, under its miner's right, comes in, digs large holes in their land, leaves it in a mess, goes broke and they are left without any compensation. This view that Australians are treated equally under the law in respect of land ownership is a mere nonsense. I would have thought that, of all the forms of title. that secure, inalienable freehold title-which Liberal and Labor governments have given to Aboriginal people"":""""could be regarded as probably one of the JTIost secure forms of title that exists in our law. However, at the last election the Leader of the Opposition committed his party and all its members to .alienate Aboriginal owned land secured by inalienable freehold title over Uluru-or Ayers Rock, as it is more commonly known-and Kakadu. He was going to take this land that the Commonwealth government did not own and give it back to the Northern Territory. How can someone who was committing an alternative government to that position have any credibility when he now talks about security of title? The next issue is that some Aboriginal people are opposed to this legislation. The Leader of the Opposition quotes my friend Charles Perkins, and Paul Coe; the Leader of the National Party referred to Ray Robinson and Pat O'Shane-all of whom have said publicly that they disagree with this legislation. But what both honourable gentlemen forget to mention is that those people disagree with this legislation because it does not go far enough. There would be many-myself included-who would share that thought. Here again we get this double standard applied to Aboriginal leadership and ATSIC. They have to have lOOper cent support on any proposition before it will have any credibility with members of the opposition. Think about it. If we applied that standard to our own parliament and to our own state legislatures, no government could govern. There is not only disagreement within this parliament on a range of issues-and this was a good example-but also division within parties. There is nothing new about that; that is part of the history of Australian politics. But when we come to an issue over which the leadership of the Aboriginal people in Australia patiently negotiate through a body like ATSIC, the opposition points out that there are some Aboriginal people who do not agree with the conclusion. What sort of an argument is that? It is an argument without credibility. It is an argument without honour. The fact that has been ignored by every were coalition speaker today who used that argument is that this legislation is not as good as Aboriginal leadership would want it to be. It is the result of a compromise. It is the result of Aboriginal people sitting down with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and caucus committees, night after night, arguing their way through until they believe that they have a' resolution to what were very difficult problems. They came to an agreement. Of course it is not perfect. What piece of legislation is? What piece of legislation which is the result of that kind of negotiating process gives everybody what they want? The Leader of the Opposition and his spokesmen know that to be true but, as far as they are concerned, unless Aboriginal leadership has virtues which no Australian political party or political leader happens to possess, we cannot make a decision because Aboriginal people are not in agreement. The other principal argument is that this legislation interferes with the traditional role of states and land management. Think about that. One of the great achievements of the Fraser Liberal government was the introduction of land rights legislation based on the recommendations of Mr Justice Woodward. I have heard lots of criticism, particularly from the Northern Territory government from time to time, on aspects of that legislation. But I have never heard it seriously suggested that, in respect of the Northern Territory, its land management functions in its legal administration of the land were in jeopardy. When decisions are made under that act, a Northern Territory title is issued, not a Commonwealth title. If we look at the legislation, which does not in any way seriously interfere with the issuing of titles under state jurisdiction, We are told that somehow this legislation interferes with states rights. I always thought that people had rights. I was not aware that states had rights. States have the right in certain areas to act in accordance with the constitution. The highest court in this land has indicated that the concept of native title does exist. We have this coalition getting in behind Premier Court and some of the more reactionary elements of its own party and of Australian society to say, 'We can't support this legislation because we are really going to give our support to Premier Court and his legislation, which he admits is designed to destroy the very concept of native title'. It is regrettable that since the Fraser governlems. ment every initiative that has been taken by successive Labor governments to recognise Aboriginal heritage to strengthen the relationship and. rights of Aboriginals over their own traditional land has always been opposed by coalition members. It is regrettable that, in respect of the legislation now before the parliament, we are not getting considered amendments, positive constructive proposals but, rather, wholesale rejection. The very people who were urging urgent action to resolve this issue would now happily see this legislation bogged down at best in a Senate committee or at worse defeated, so that Aboriginal people, in pursuing their rights, would be involved in endless litigation. And these were the people who; less than a month ago, from the moment the High Court made its decision, were urging prompt action, prompt decisions in order that these issues could be resolved. They said, 'If they are not resolved'-we can think of the problem it would create for investment from overseas'think of the damage that it would do to our export industries'. If we took their political attitudes as being accurate, what damage would be done if they were to defeat this legislation? Because that would not stop the legitimate aspirations of Aboriginal people; they would be back before the High Court. There would be claims throughout Australia which would take a great deal of time on which to deliberate-and what would that do to the so-called investment climate about which we have been told? There seems to be a view, particularly within the coalition, that this problem of the relationship of indigenous people to a dominant, non-indigenous community is somehow a uniquely Australian problem. It is not and it never has been. Recently, the Canadian government gave back to the Inuit people an area of land greater than the whole of Victoria. Those people will make the decisions about who comes onto their land. They will make the decisions about development and investment. That is a Canadian response. The New Zealand government never had any problem about making treaties with its people, and there are still unresolved probBut one of the principal issues around the world is that many of the conflicts are related to the demands of indigenous people against an occupying group that has come in at a later point in time. Some of those conflicts have been running for hundreds of years-one only has to look at the situation in Ireland. This was and is a great opportunity not just for this gove11lment but for this parliament to respond to the aspirations and the hopes of its Aboriginal people. In this area I doubt whether one will ever get legislation which will be 100 per cent perfect. However, sadly, we are seeing the coalition create arguments, many of which are patently false, which it has set up for the purpose of creating fear and confusion in the broader Australian community. I would like to say to my friends in the coalition that they might do well to ponder the words of a great Australian writer, Xavier Herbert, who wrote: . Until we give back to the blackman just a bit of the land that was his, and give it back without provisos, without strings to snatch it back, with complete generosity of spirit in concession for the evil we have done him-until we do that we shall remain what we always have been so far, a people without integrity, not a nation but a community of thieves. I commend that concept to the Leader of the Opposition and to the Leader of the National Party and I ask, in the name of a united Australian people, that they think again on the damaging political course that they have embarked upon on this very important piece of legislation.",68
145,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Barker) (8.18 p.m.)For some time. I have looked forward to debating the Native Title Bill. I knew the moment that I read the High Court's decision last year that it would bring a great disturbance to this country. I knew by the very terms of the judgment that it would be tested in many courts in the land. I believed that it was probably the most important matter decided upon by the High Court since World War II. I noticed in the judgment the caution by Mr Justice Brennan that, when changing the law, the disturbance to be apprehended should not be disproportionate to the benefit flowing from its overturning. However, I believe that the court forgot that self-admonition and delivered to Australia a disturbance which the country has never voted on till now, never legislated for and, I think it is true to say, which the people have never considered. Some of the obiter dicta was not argued in regard to people who live on the mainland. There is no· doubt that the jobless rate for Aborigines is six times the national average; their average income· is markedly less than that of other Australians; their life expectancy is 20 years less; and their child mortality is three times higher. We have achieved this frightful result even though we have come from spending something like $24 million in 1971 to $1.3 billion today; but the tragedy continues. Nevertheless, I wish to make the point that I do not believe that the Mabo decision is the answer to that particular problem. Since June last year, this government, if we are to believe it-and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) has just said so-has laboured mightily and delivered a series of extensions to that decision: a new form of title, the equivalent of takeover of the sovereignty of the states to some extent; and, I believe, an unworkable !?eries of tribunals and courts to deal with it. At the same time, whilst the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was here earlier tonight carrying on a piece about the fact that the Premier of Western Aqstralia was going to extinguish native title, you yourselves have done it in this bill-not for all of the leases, but for those post-I97S leases that might be interfered with in category A by native title possibilities. As well as that, I believe you have tried to extinguish whole parts of this debate in the process that you have embarked upon in the last six months. To some extent the debate about Aboriginality, as the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said tonight, cannot be gone into; it is not politically correct. You have tried to extinguish views which do not hold with the views of the Labor Party on terra nullius. As we all know, terra nullius was a concept involving a lack of land ownership, of ownership of individual parts of that land, and that it was considered there was no-one to treat with. Nowhere do I see anyone, except the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) on occasions, standing up and saying that Aboriginal interests already have 14 per cent of Australia-20 per cent of my state, or 19 per cent to be exact; 13 per cent of much maligned Western Australia and 40 per cent of the Northern Territory. Lastly, you have tried to put up the idea rate that when the High Court makes a decision, that decision is inviolate. Well, you have already belied your own argument in this bill. In the preamble to the bill you say: Their rights and interests of native title holdersunder the common law of Australia need to be significantly supplemented. It is worth remembering this decision and some of the comments made by the Chief Justice. Back in 1968, Warren Burger, then a circuit court of appeals judge and later chief justice of the United States, said to the Ohio native title; a judicial conference: A court which is final and unreviewable needs more careful scrutiny than any other. Unreviewable power is the most likely to self-indulge itself and the least likely to engage in dispassionate selfanalysis. In a country like ourshe was talking about the USno public institution, or people who operate it, can be above public debate. So let nobody put up the idea that the High Court should be above the debate, because it should not. Let me come to one or two specific matters. Firstly, I will come to the matter of native title on pastoral leases. You in the Labor Party and your supporters are not arguing that native title exists on pastoral leases pre-1975; you are arguing the opposite. You are arguing that the ordinary grant of a pastoral lease would extinguish native title. But there are claims. There are claims today on these pastoral leases in Australia for an area of which, combined, equals the size of Queensland. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, the last speaker, was saying that thes y court cases will come back. They do not have to come back; they are here. So my first disagreement is with that part of the legislation. You are not prepared to guarantee to provide security except for 11 pastoral leaseholders holding some country at the top of the Kimberleys who received their leases after the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. You are not prepared to guarantee security from native title. Somehow this is supposed to set a precedent, together with the Mabo decision itself, to protect the 99 per cent of pastoral leaseholders with valid pre-1975 leases. They are valid leases, but they have no immunity from native title; immunity from native title they have not. The question needs to be asked: when you are saying on the one hand that the Mabo decision extinguishes them-which I do not believe because there are cases in the courts based on the Mabo decision-why would you not extinguish those decisions in the legislation? The reason is that the Aboriginal representatives would not allow you to do so. You could have extinguished the problem by legislation, but you are leaving it to the High Court decision to do that, and that is obviously open to very great doubt. How many Aboriginals will benefit from this decision? For a while we thought it was 10 per cent, but now representatives of Aboriginal negotiators are saying five per cent. That is 12,500 people-'-0.075 of one per cent. For that number of people, I say to you that this matter could be handled in· another way, and I believe the Premier of Western Australia is trying to handle it in another way. But for that number of people we will tum our land title system on its head. It is argued that ATSIC and the land councils have said that there is no point in claiming native title on these old pastoral leasesbut they are claiming them. They are claiming them at Arabunna, at Yorta Yorta, at Barunga, at Utemorrah, at Wiradjuri and in the Bowen basin-and the Wik claim and the rest; as I land said, amounting to an area equal to the size of Queensland. These are not scare tactics; these are just facts. That is all they are-facts. There are people defending them today. Today in the courts respondents are defending them with their own money-unless they qualify for the hardship clause, and we will see what happens about the hardship clause. One would have to ask oneself: what did the National Fanners Federation accomplish for its constituents, for its rural pastoral leaseholders? It accomplished validation for 11 post-I975 leaseholders in the Kimberleys and some words in the preamble to the bill. I think you did a pretty good job on the federation; I think you knocked it over, and I think it thinks you knocked it over too. The real test will be to see whether these claims are withdrawn. If your arguments are right, then all the claims will be withdrawn from the courts, will they not? In other words, there will be no point in these claimants going to the courts to claim native title. But they have not gone away. In fact, when we talk to their legal representatives we learn they will not go away; they will stay in the courts. These claims will disrupt security; they will be ongoing. Where claims are occurring land will be devalued. Already in the Kimberleys there was one sale where there was no bid-not on the basis of a claim, but simply on the basis of a threat of a claim. You are saying those Aboriginal representatives will not be making a claim. But it is not up to them; it is not up to the Aboriginal representatives. It is up to the claimants themselves, and if they want to make a claim they will claim- Nobody will be able to stop them. The test will be whether those claims are withdrawn, but they will not be. Next I want to talk about the discrimination inherent in these decisions, both in the High Court decision, where I believe it is unintentional, and also in the discrimination which you have welded into your legislation, between Aboriginal and Aboriginal-after all, only five per cent will get a benefit-between Aboriginal and European and between European and European. Sixty-six thousand Aboriginals live in cities. How will it benefit them? How will this legislation benefit those Aboriginals who live in the cities? How is a pastoral lease bought somewhere going to benefit them? How is the legislation going to benefit all the people you talk about-aIl those people who have been dispossessed? The one group of Aboriginals most severely disenfranchised of all the groups must surely be the ones who live in Me,Ibourne, Sydney, Canberra or anywhere else where there is·freehold land, or anywhere else where there are perpetual leases. They will not get any benefit that I can see that relates to what they do today out of this legislation. Let us come to the Aboriginal and white groups. There are different ownership systems for the two groups. One group is under Mabo and the government's native title equivalent. No other Australians can aspire to that title system. In other words, we are not going to be equal under the government's law. Finally in this matter let me come to mination between white and white. In the much maligned Western Australia, so far Aboriginal interests have 325,000 square kilometres-there will be more, and there needs to be more to solve some of those Aboriginal problems. In the Northern Territory there are over 500,000 square kilometres, 40 per cent of the territory. In South Australia there are 190,000 square kilometres, nearly 20 per cent of the state. In Queensland there are 41,000 square kilometres. In New South Wales there are 1,500 square kilometres, the size of one decent sheep station out in the west somewhere. In Victoria the amount of land that has been given to Aboriginal interests by all of those Victorians,including some of them who come in here and bleed in front of us, is not statistically measurable. So the Northern Territory has given 1,400 hectares to every Aboriginal person in the territory. In my state of South Australia it is the same, about 1,400 hectares. In Western Australia it is 800 hectares. In Queensland it is somewhat less. In New South Wales it is 2.4 hectares-the state where the minister comes from and he comes in here bleeding almost every day. In Victoria, where there are 14,000 Aboriginals, it is damn all, nothing, not measurable. Yet those states with 10 million people are going to make these sorts of decisions, are they not, as long as it is not their state but somebody else's. They are going to give away somebody else's land. Let us come to another point. In New South Wales and Victoria nearly all the land is either freehold, or perpetual lease, or otherwise spoken for. So there will not be any native title for Aboriginals in those states. But they will be consistent in New South Wales. They will not be giving away any land to Aboriginal interests, and they almost never have. In Victoria they will be absolutely consistent because they will not be giving any land to Aboriginal interests and they absolutely never have. This bill is going to perpetuate the removal of more land to Aboriginal interests. But it will not be the land of a New South Welshman and it surely will not be the land of a Victorian. It will be someone else's land; discrisomeone from a state which has already provided large tracts of land to Aboriginals. Three of those states-the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia-have provided for many a year rights of traditional pursuit: hunting, gathering, living, staying on and camping on all pastoral land in South Australia, on all pastoral land in Western Australia and on all pastoral land in the Northern Territory.· These are rights that are not provided in New South Wales, even where there is perpetual lease. While I am on the subject of freehold and perpetual lease, I point out that this morning the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs really got into the gutter. On the ABC he said that because the honourable member for Kalgoorlie held shares in a mining company, his position with respect to the native title legislation was unsustainable. He went on to say: ... the public really ought to have a very close look at some of the major Coalition opponents of the Mabo legislation because they have key holdings in major mining and pastoral operations. Presumably, he was saying that if a person has land which could be subject to native title claim, that person has a vested interest, a conflict of interest. I can only assume that I was one of those to whom he was referring in regard to pastoral interests. I would like to the minister that he ought to do his homework because all the land that I have any commercial interest in at all is either freehold or perpetual lease, apart from some minor land around towns and stock routes and so forth which are unclaimable by native title interests. So my interests are either freehold or perpetual lease. Perhaps the minister is now saying that perPetual land will be subject to native title claim-or has he just made yet another mistake, as usual? ' He was also talking about mining shares. I suppose he is now saying that the 15 members of the ALP who are members of this House with property and mining interests which may be subject to native title claims in the future-interests in such companies as BHP, CSR, the Commonwealth Bank, Dominion Mining, Centaur Mining, North Broken Hill, Boral, Western Mining, Santos and all the rest that. government members have interests in-should not be allowed to vote. I would be in favour of that. If he wants to hold strictly to that sort of rule, I say that they do not vote. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie can come and vote for us and we will knock the government over. Before the minister gets too emotional about these issues and goes on the ABC and gets it wrong, he ought to check his facts .. Finally, this Mabo decision and its expansion are' so disruptive that, apart from helping some Aborigines, it is totally counterproductive to the development of this nation. Not only has John Prescott, the managing director of BHP, described it as a 'porridge', John Ralph of CRA said that the company is increasingly investing overseas. AMEC said that the Mabo decision is no good and so have many others. Today Ros Fardon, who is the Director-General of Mines in my state, said: It's beyond dispute that the impact of the Mabo decision on mining in Australia will be negative and that negative effect will be very large. As everybody now knows, if a person is going to dig a hole in Australia, that person buys the pastoral lease. A person cannot take the choice or have the risk of the possibility of somebody-a pastoral lease holder or tell anybody else-interfering with that person's security if that person is going to put a billion dollars in a hole in the ground. That is why it is so important-apart from pastoral lease holders who operate cattle, sheep and other operations-that mining ventures have that security. Lastly, but not least of all, it is beyond doubt in this legislation that the minister and the government are going to interfere with the sovereignty of the states. It is for these reasons and many more that we should reject this bill out of hand.",70
146,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The previous speaker, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), I think started his contribution by joining a few other honourable members of the opposition in condemning judicial activism. I think the honourable member for Barker quoted Warren Burger as someone who said that judges should be careful about the consequences of their decisions. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), in his contribution, went so far as to reinforce some comments which he has made in recent days in attacking the High Court's decision on Mabo. But I did not hear the honourable member for Barker or the honourable member for Flinders condemning so-called judicial activism when the High Court, in a quite radical judgment, overturned this government's legislation on political advertising. Surely honourable members opposite would not call that decision as one in keeping with past decisions, interpreting the constitution. That decision, for the first time in Australian judicial history, said that there was an implied bill of rights in our constitution. People such as the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Barker would have been out there commending the High Court for its judicial activism in taking a decision which they supported. But when the High Court brings down a judgment which says that under Australian common law Torres Strait Islanders. living on the Murray Islands have just as much right to inherit land as the rest of us, those people say that the High Court is exceeding its powers. I can understand it if some people who are more expert in law than me say that they are against any judicial activism. But when people are selective in the cases that they are prepared to welcome judicial activism and prepared to condemn judicial activism in others, then I think it is pretty clear to see what their real motives are. The honourable member for Barker, in his contribution, also said that the premier of Western Australia might be extinguishing native title, but that this side of the House had no right to criticise Premier Court for doing that because our legislation also provides for extinguishment. In fact, the honourable member for Flinders has also made similar comments on radio. They claimed that because our legislation does provide for some extinguishment we forfeit the right to criticise Premier Court. But there is a wide gulf between the extinguishment which is provided for in our legislation and the mass extinguishment which Premier Court is seeking to implement in Western Australia. In our legislation, native title is extinguished as part of a process of validating freehold or commercial leasehold or pastoral leasehold. But we do not, as Premier Court has suggested, provide for mass extinguishment everywhere in a particular state. That is the great difference between what Premier Court is doing and what this legislation provides. The onus is on the opposition. A number of weeks ago I made the comment that many people have spoken of their concerns about our allowing vetos as part of our response to the Mabo legislation. But the only person who has been given a veto on the Mabo legislation is Richard Court. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) gave him that veto. The opposition said that if Premier Court was not happy with the federal government's legislation the federal opposition would vote against it. We saw this with the budget when the opposition declared its total opposition from the very beginning. The result is that the opposition sidelines itself and ceases to be important on whether this legislation will be passed by this parliament. We saw during the budget debate that all it takes is the Democrats and the Greens to join the opposition and legislation will fail. It is very clear that the opposition is seeking to avoid any responsibility in th.is legislation by placing itself in complete opposition to the government. It does not seek to work ,with the government to come up with a package'that responds to the High Court's decision, that tries to deliver more justice to Aborigines and allows development to continue for the nation. That would be too hard. That would require the opposition to have to sit down and work out the best way for this country to respond to the High Court's decision. It is not interested in doing that. ' If Richard Court had any problem with our legislation, the opposition had to vote against it. That is the reason why it will cast its votes against our legislation. Yet it was not that long ago that everyone was saying that it was in the interests of the country to get a uniform national response to the High Court's Mabo judgment. We had every Premier-Labor, Liberal, and Country Liberal from the Northern Territory-on the steps of the Victorian parliament back in June at the COAG meeting saying that they wanted a uniform .,national response to Mabo. The reason we all wanted a uniform national response was that, if we had the same legislative guidelinesimplemented by the Commonwealth, state and territory parliaments, that would provide the greatest amount of certainty. That would provide the best opportunities for the country.",74
147,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Why would it do that? Tell me why?,75
148,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Because we would have the same rules operating in every state. That would provide more certainty for the people who might be thinking of investing in this country.,75
149,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Why is that important? MrLEE-If the honourable member for O'Connor has some difficulty with the logic behind a uniform national response, I invite him to listen to the words of his own leader three' weeks ago; On 26 October the Leader of the Opposition, on the AM program, said: We've always said the top priority is for the States and Commonwealth to sit down together and negotiate a national outcome. That's got to be the top priority ... It is very clear that the federal government has gone to great lengths to reach agreement with Premiers-Labor, Liberal, whatever-but Premier Court was only interested in one thing: the extinguishment of native title in his state. That was the only response that he would wear. That is the reason the federal opposition will vote against this legislation. It was only three weeks ago that the Leader of the Opposition was saying that he wanted a unifonn national response as well, yet we are now in a position where the federal Liberal party has no view. That is the position of the federal Liberal party. The Leader of the Opposition has no opinion on what the Mabo response should be through this Commonwealth parliament. Mr Costello-Quite wrong.",75
150,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member says it is quite wrong. The decision taken by his party was,76
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, Order! The honourable member for Higgins will cease interjecting.,76
152,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The position taken by his party wasMr·Costello interjecting,76
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! If the honourable member keeps on going I will deal with him.,76
154,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The position taken by his party was that John Fahey should have one approach in New South Wales; Richard Court should have another approach in Western Australia; Jeff Kennett should have a third approach in Victoria; Marshall Perron should have a fourth approach in the Northern Territory; and Wayne Goss can have a fifth in Queensland. How does that provide any certainty for investors? How does that provide Aboriginal people with the rights they are entitled to? It is just ridiculous for the opposigets tion to say th\lt this issue is so tough that it will abrogate any responsibility and leadership on this issue and leave it to each of the states and territories to make up their own minds. This issue is so tough the opposition will have no view and leave it up to each of the states and territories to make up their own minds. Mr Costello-Why don't you set out a position? A moment ago you said he had no view. That was your argument. Did you listen to the 30-minute speech?,76
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The honourable member for Higgins will cease interjecting. Mr Free- Mr Deputy Speaker, may I take a point of order. The honourable member for Barker was heard in silence. I ask you to ensure that the minister is also heard in silence.",76
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister is absolutely right. There is certainly a point of order. I would ask the honourable member for Higgins and the honourable member for O'Connor to cease interjecting. The minister might like to direct his comments through the chair. It may also help if he were not to enter into an exchange across the chamber. I assume the honourable member for O'Connor is standing on a point of order. Mr Thckey-Yes, it is a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Put simply, there would be no objections from the opposition if a minister of this government decided to address the contents of his government's legislation instead of running rampant over what the opposition is doing.",76
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! There is no point of order. The minister is speaking to the substance of the bill, which is quite a substantial bill, as you well know.",76
158,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Those opposite argue that the Commonwealth parliament should have no position on Mabo, that we should leave it to each of the state parliaments to respond. That is the alternate position. At the end of the day Richard Court may get his legislation through the West Australian parliament-we will wait to see whether our Commonwealth legislation through both houses of this parliamentbut whatever happens, even if the opposition has its way and the Commonwealth passes no legislation at the federal level and all of the states pass their own legislation, there is no guara'ntee to investors, whether they be miners, pastoralists, tourist developers or whatever, that the state legislation will comply with the Racial Discrimination Act. There is no guarantee that the state legislation will be upheld if challenged in the High Court. So how does that provide certainty? The only way to provide better justice for Aborigines and certainty for investors is to have that uniform national response which at the federal level we have set out to get. I am pleased to say that not all Liberals out to sabotage our response to Mabo. A number of premiers from both sides of politics have worked in a cooperative manner with us. There are many parts of this legislation that have been amended, altered and improved because of the cooperation of those premiers. It is a great tragedy for this country that we have not been able to have this legislation adopted with as much support from federal Liberals as we have had from state Liberals. At the end of the day, I think it be important for industries-whether it is the mining industry, the tourism industry or people involved in forestry or fisheries-that we seek to have the best opportunity to provide certainty for future investment. We also have to ensure we are responding to the High Court's decision so that we are recognising native title but that we do this in a way which provides these industries with the maximum amount of certainty. That is what this legislation sets out to do. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made it clear in his response to the High Court decision that we will be seeking to provide greater social justice for Aborigines and to ensure that we provide an opportunity for further economic development in the. country. It is important to understand that we have set out in this bill to provide opportunities for these industries. As the honourable member for Barker pointed out, the mining industry has been particularly critical of our legislation. It is important that we understand what this legislation provides for the mining industry. It allows for validation up front. It provides for the government to pay for the cost of any compensation which is required to validate past grants of interest in land. Despite what the honourable member for Flinders has said, there is no right of veto-de facto or otherwise-provided for Aborigines in this proposed legislation. The legislation would give native title holders a right to negotiate-the same right to negotiate that any of us would have whatever the colour of our skin. It sets strict time frames for the period of negotiation. If there is no agreement after three or four monthsset the time provided for in the legislation to reach agreement-it goes to an arbitrator for settlement. Again, there is a strict time frame of three or four months. If the decision of the arbitrator is unacceptable to a state or federal government, on the grounds of state or national interest, the legislation provides for the elected government to overturn the decision of the arbitrator. How could that be equated with a veto? The legislation gives people the right to negotiate, the right to go to an arbitrawill tor, and provision for a government to overturn the decision. How could that be described as a veto? Anyone who seeks to suggest that that is a veto is deliberately attempting to mislead. Very importantly, our legislation provides for existing state processes where states have accepted our national standards. For example, if the Fahey government in New South Wales enacts legislation which complies with our national standards-it is clear from Mr Fahey's correspondence with the Prime Minister that he has no philosophical objection to the contents of our legislation; he is simply seeking further assurances on funding to his state on matters that will arise as a result of our legislation-it will be the Supreme Court of New South Wales that decides where native title exists in that state. It will be the state mining wardens-the augmented mining courts-that will have the responsibility for future decisions about mining development and exploration in that state. The same thing could have happened in Western Australia if Richard Court had really meant what he said on the steps of the Victorian parliament. If Richard Court were prepared to implement legislation that met our national standards, the federal government would be picking up the full cost of compensation for past validation in Western Australia. Richard Court could have had the right for his state government to override the decisions of the arbitrator in Western Australia. Richard Court could have had the Western Australian Supreme Court making decisions on where native title will lie in that state. However, for whatever reason; Richard Court does not want to behave like John Fahey, Jeff Kennett or Ray Groom. He has his own agenda and, as a result, he will deny his state the benefits provided for people who are interested in investing in the mining industry in that state. Most importantly, Richard Court is seeking to deny the Aboriginal people of Western Australia their right to native title. Richard Court is seeking to overturn the decision of the High Court that recognises that Aborigines in Western Australia have certain rights to land under Australian common law. That is the ultimate tragedy of the Western Australian legislation. Perhaps an even bigger tragedy is that the Liberal Party at the federal level has been forced to adopt a policy which allows Richard Court to do just that. He is the one who has been given the veto, not the Aboriginal people. I would like to conclude by making two more points about providing certainty through this legislation. Our legislation is the only legislation that can provide validation of past grants of interest in land. It was not that long ago that some people were saying that the first test of this legislation would be Comalco's decision to spend $1.75 billion on expanding a smelter at Gladstone after the Wik people had put in a claim for land presently covered by mining leases at Weipa. This legislation will validate those leases and provide certainty for Coma1co to go ahead with its investment. This issue was of such importance to the Leader of the Opposition that he said: ... as eRA has said many times, they have an expansion planned in relation to the Gladstone smelter, they have until the end of this year as there is an absolute deadline to actually take a final decision on that. They can't take that decision for the expansion, the $1.75 billion expansion, until they know their titles are s.ecure . . . To be fair to the Leader of the Opposition, since he made that statement CRA has been given an extension to 31 March. However, the only way that Coma1co's leases can be made secure is if this legislation gets through parliament. By voting against this legislation the opposition is placing that $1.75 billion investment in jeopardy. This legislation will provide the certainty that industry needs. It is the opposition that is seeking to create uncertainty, to heighten the fear in the community and to create the distortions. That is a tragedy, not just for Aboriginal people but for all Australians. I have had the great honour of serving on the ministerial committee that has worked to develop the government's response to Mabo-a committee chaired by the Prime Minister. There will probably be no more difficult an issue that the Commonwealth of . Australia will have to deal with in a generation. It was a great honour for me to work with my colleagues and the committee support staff-some of whom are in the chamber tonight-who made every effort to ensure that this legislation provides greater justice for Aboriginal people and an opportunity for further development of Australia to the benefit of all Australians.",76
159,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand here tonight to oppose the Native Title Bill and to support the coalition and opposition amendments. I would like to start with a reference to which the Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) might like to stay and listen to for a minute. Today we had the Parliamentary 'Secretary to the Attorney General, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), raising the issue of standing order 196. He actually warned honourable members that if they held land, shares, pastoral leases-all those sorts of things-they could be at risk if they participated in this debate or, more importantly, the vote. He suggested that they would have a pecuniary interest. ' I find that very interesting because the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has stood up in this place day after day, telling us that all of those particular titleholders have absolutely nothing to worry about under the federal legislation. If that were the case, how can they be said to have a pecuniary interest? It is a very interesting situation: the government jumping from one position to the other when it suits. For instance, the government did a hatchet job on the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) because he had the temerity to stand up and represent the views of the people who elected him-Aboriginal and European. In this pla<;e, one is deemed to have a pecuniary interest when one's assets are at risk by the implementation of certain proposed legislation. One minute we are being told that our pecuniary interests are at risk, and the next minute we are being told that we have absolutely nothing to worry about. Mr Costello-It was a weak point.",78
160,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was an absolutely dreadful point. It is just so silly. The logic of not stand up in the first place. The minister can only have it one way or the other. Either the people who hold those titles are totally protected by this legislation or they are not. If they are totally protected it is .doubtful that they have anything to worry about with pecuniary interest. That sort of misunderstanding is representative of the way in which this debate has been conducted. We heard from one minister of the Crown who said that he was on the committee looking at this legislation. One would have thought that he would have taken his full 20 minutes to deal with the 115 pages of complexity that is involved in this bill. Not him; in typical style he spent his time making allegations and very doubtful legal assertions about how this legislation might operate. Coming back to the matter of pecuniary interest, might I say that I hold the view that the honourable member for Makin expressed today. I believe that people who have property and investments will have them put at risk if this legislation is passed and becomes the major force. I do not think that it can protect people's property. Therefore, as a holder of shares, farming and residential property, and some other business investments, I declare my interest. I also declare the interest of the people in my electorate, and the people of Western Australia in general, who do not want the government's legislation, who do not want its help and who do not believe that it is necessary. I reject out of hand the remarks of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs when he said: We are not prepared to leave this matter to the courts. We are not prepared to let the High Court decision be overridden by the WA government. They are pretty interesting statements-they are pretty interesting to me. But, more importantly, the minister has told us which legislation might fail and' he expresses concern in his own speech addressing this legislation. I reject those remarks. I have faith in the courts' ability to deliver justice. They do not need the help of unnecessary legislation passed in this parliament. The coalition response to this legislation is encapsulated in a few very simple principles. it did There is a commitment to the Australian constitution as it was originally written and as it is written today; the protection it deliberately provides to people in less populous states; and the rights of our court to interpret our laws and to apply the common law within the limits of our constitution. It also stands committed to those fundamental principles of all good law: simplicity, certainty and equity. In terms of the opposition's position, there seems to be some public criticism that people within our party have expressed differing views. All I say is that that exposed this issue to everybody'S opinion. In the end, we walked out of the room as one man with the position I represent to the House tonight-one of commitment to the rights of Aboriginal people and their land titles, whatever they might be; one of commitment to the High Court to interpret if and when they are impaired; and one of commitment to the consti- ' tutional right of state governments to address the issue and be answerable to the High Court. They are the fundamentals of this situation. There is no particular monopoly on morality in this parliament. There is no particular monopoly on administrative ability. Of course, we have a dreadful vacuum in that regard as far as land administration is concerned, it never having been practised at the departmental level. I reject the myth that states' rights somehow mean the rights of an incumbent premier or an incumbent government party. States rights are about the rights to have their constitutional rights protected and toelect or reject state MPs who do or do not carry out their wishes. In the context of this legislation, the people of Western Australia elected a government and have indicated very clearly their total support for the continuation of the constitutional right of their state government to manage land without the paternalistic advice of the massive voting blocks of Labor voters in the larger states, such as New South Wales. These are rights carefully protected for the Western Australian people in nothing less than our constitution-that little green book that most other countries would see as standing above all else, particularly when they go off and sign conventions with the United Nations. The people have pride in it, they have faith in it and they are committed to it. It is only this parliament that tries to subvert that constitution day after day in order to enhance the power of the executive government. Outside of the paranoia of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to go down in history as a Prime Minister who has done something other than create one million unemployed, there is no legal or moral reason for this parliament to provide any legislation on this issue at all. The reasons are simple. When the High Court identified native title, it did no more than declare that a group of people with ancestral links to titleholders of land prior the European settlement had a continuing right in common law. It further recognised that subsequent government acts had extinguished much of that title right up until 1975 when, in response to an international treaty or convention, the federal government passed into Australian law the Racial Discrimination Act-which I will henceforth refer to as the RDA. The High Court ruled that, henceforth, acts of extinguishment contravened the RDA and that, in regard to titles issued after that date, the issuing authority-almost always a state government-had the responsibility to compensate such native titleholders for any loss or impairment they consequently suffered. It is as simple as that. That is what the of people of a state court ruled. Nobody has suggested that the only solution that the High Court offered Australia was that people should have some land fenced off and they should go and sit on it. Nobody has suggested that. What a tragedy it would be for Australia and the Aboriginal people if that were the case. Only a change to the Racial Discrimination Act to in some way remove its application to land title could release the states from that responsibility. This was the reason for federal involvement and consideration. The Keating government decided against such action. This was its political and constitutional right. It could have simply left it at that. That is all the government had to do. It had to consider whether or not it would change the Racial Discrimination Act and, having decided not to, it really had no role in the issue. It did not have to do anything unless it thought it was the sole repository of moral standing in Australia. The Prime Minister saw this as an opportunity to take over land management from state governments. He saw it as an opportunity to create his own form of native title, which in no way reflected the traditional rights and which upped the compensation stakes probably to un affordable levels. Had he not done so, had he not bored in and produced this 150 pages of 'porridge'-as Mr Prescott from BHP said after three days of very careful, examination, and no doubt the to best possible legal advice-each state government would have had ,to act within its clearly defined constitutional powers to formally define native title and to decide compensation arrangements where, in the process of protecting or creating alternative titles, it impaired native title rights. That is all that was needed: individual state governments doing what they have always done, and not doing it in exactly the same way, as the minister said was totally necessary. Land is not like a truck; it does not cross borders. Our title arrangements, state by state, are quite different. That has never frightened off investors because they learn the law of that state and they comply with it. Such a proposal for state governments is not a unique, nor is it a difficult process for land administration departments. They have conducted all these activities for decades and/or centuries, and, as I just said, in a variety of fashions. Such a process would not disenfranchise the native titleholders involved because they have protection under existing Commonwealth law-particularly the Racial Discrimination Act and the existing High Court precedent. That is there whether the state or the Commonwealth legislates. But the states have a proper constitutional power base to bring the sort of certainty that the previous speaker was telling us was so important to CRA and others-and it certainly is important. When we talk about the role of the court and the arguments that the minister put about the state of Western Australia disenfranchising the native titleholders or 'extinguishing their title, let me put this question to the parliament: is the High Court, which created native title, now so callous or forgetful that it would not protect it? If a state were to attempt to do that, put simply, the state would lose. Its legislation would not surVive. The states know that and Richard Court knows that. Not only did he prepare his legislation very carefully but, more importantly, during the process of its debate in the parliament there have been many and substantial amendments as advice has come forward from all sectors. There was nothing under the arrangement I have just mentioned to stop the Commonwealth, as it has done, ensuring that native title holders had sufficient financial resources to prosecute their cases in the court. No-one needed to disenfranchise them by lack of access to the courts. That was a role for the Commonwealth if it chose to spend taxpayers' money in that way. There was nothing to stop the Commonwealth agreeing to assist the states to fund the compensation. Considering the disparity of the compensation payments between the states, the Commonwealth Grants Commission could have played its proper role without all this legislation and the Prime Minister making any promises or threats. As approved under section 51(xxxi) of the constitution, there was nothing to prevent the Commonwealth buying or resuming land on state just terms and providing it to Aboriginal peoples whose ancestral links were associated with the areas of land where their title rights were extinguished pre-1975. It was a very proper role for the Commonwealth as a result of what the High Court said. But we have to go the whole hog. The Prime Minister has to take himself into the area of land administration. State governments which failed in their first attempts in the High Court-they were doing their best-would simply have had to alter their legislation to conform with the High Court's ruling. This is not an unusual process at state and federal level. This would have been the truly cooperative approach, with the Commonwealth doing the things for which it has resources-responsibility and constitutional right-and the states doing what they have power, responsibility and experience to do. This would have been a truly cooperative approach and would have achieved the principles of simplicity, certainty and equity. A very important fundamental would have been achieved; the automatic recognition of ,native title rights-because that is what the states would have been obliged to do. They did not have to create law; they only had to recognise it as the court has done. It would have involved the acceptance of state government rights to impair title rights in the process of national development; in other words, granting titles to CRA or to Mr and Mrs Smith who just want a house. The contemporary process of the payment of compensation would follow should such impairment occur. The states could have done that. Such a process has one outstanding advantage which has been totally negated by the Prime Minister's legislation. I want honourable members to realise that a lot of Aboriginal people want to get on with mining without this process-but some are not on their ancestral grounds. The people of Noonkanbah want to get on with their activities on a pastoral lease-but it is not on their ancestral grounds. Under this process members of the community, whatever their background, would be allowed to get on with their personal lives or business activity, free of any threat to their past or future title rights. At the same time the state government takes responsibility to negotiate or litigate any claims related to impairment of native title rights that had emanated from the granting of that title. This is the essence of the Western Australian government's solution, endorsed by the vast majority of the citizens of Western Australia who, in my opinion, also have rights. Many Aboriginal people that I talk to have endorsed it. Let me tell honourable members about some I rang the other day. Mr Dodd-Who are they?",79
161,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You drongo, you would never - ven talk to them. Let me tell honourable members about some people who rang me the other day. Three years ago, ATSIC bought them two farms in my electorate. It still has not bought them a tractor or any implement to run those farms. They are not very impressed with the system. They do not really want it. These people of the Aboriginal race do not want the solution of corporate homelands which this legislation will provide. They do not want corporate homelands run by land council bureaucrats, whose agendas are totally unrelated to the needs of individual land-holders. Frequently these people would prefer the financial compensation so they could move their families to regional centres where the established health, education, housing and employment opportunities are available to give their kids a chance. These are the people I talk to, not the Aboriginal bureaucrats who sat down in the discussions with the Prime Minister-only one of whom had any claim to democratic election and represented Aboriginal people. Mr Snowdon-How would you know? You would not know what they want.",82
162,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I asked them and they told me, you mug. Mr Snowdon-How would you know?",82
163,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I just told you; I asked them. You would not bother. In contrast, this legislation today destroys all these fundamentals. The honourable member should go back to his dog shows. This legislation is not simple; it is 115 pages long. It is uncertain. The draftsman has drawn upon a raft of obscure and untested constitutional powers to establish a federal power that can override the the clearly defined state powers of land management. The Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) said to me, 'We won in Tasmania'. In Tasmania those opposite had a federal power that dealt with the environment-and the Tasmanian dam was about the environment. This time they are relying on a power that says people will not discriminate by race. How does that come into land management-unless there are Vietnamese land titles, United Kingdom land titles, and so on? In fact there is no link. The link and responsibility was the Racial Discrimination Act. It is there; it will protect native title, however the states choose to legislate. That is where this matter should be left; between the state, the High Court and the Aboriginal people. Richard Court's legislation provides that when there are negotiations they are held not in Canberra or Perth, but on the homeland; the minister goes to the Aboriginal people. I ask those opposite to tell me where that sort of provision is in their legislation. It is not there. The real risk and lack of certainty is in the Commonwealth's legislation. There is not one established Commonwealth power to deal with land administration, yet they say there is certainty. There is no certainty; nor is it equitable. It creates super land title for one ethnic group and attempts to slew the legal process by placing defined ethnics in special positions as adjudicators. That is wrong. Why does the assessor have to be of the Aboriginal race? That is an outrageous proposition in terms of the Racial Discrimination Act. The community perceives this as unequitable. It creates anitnosity and not reconciliation. 'I can give examples of how well-meaning government in the past has done that. I am reminded of Carnarvon, but it is too late to tell honourable members. (Time expired)",82
164,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (9.16 p.m.)-I would like to say at the outset that it is a great privilege to be part of the debate this evening in support of the Native Title Bill currently before the parliament. I want to make one observation which may be of interest to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Even though time and time again he has demonstrated his total incapacity to understand the issues around native title and the wishes and desires of Aboriginal people around Australia, I want to say to him that I am probably the only. person in this parliament who has had any direct experience of living and working with Aboriginal people and working with the land councils. Mr Thckey-Well, you are wrong.",82
165,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member should listen to what I say about working with the land councils. My job prior to coming into this parliament was as a senior project officer for t.he Central Land Council. Mr Thckey-Worked with the land council? You were a bureaucrat.,83
166,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And proud of it. I have to say to the honourable member for O'Cone nor and to each of the other members of the opposition who have spoken in the debate thus far that not only have they shown a complete misunderstanding of what Aboriginal people are after, but they have .shown what I believe to be, ultimately, a racist view; that is, they are not prepared to accept the valueMr Thckey-You can withdraw that.",83
167,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, I said, 'a racist view'. If you are a racist, say so. Mr Thckey--'-I will take a point of order when the honourable member sits down. Mr Chynoweth-Oh! Mr Thckey-It just happens to be the standing orders of this place. I ask for the words to be withdrawn. Irrespective of the parliamentary secretary's interpretation, the word 'racist' used in this place is unparliamentary.",83
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Newell)The honourable member will resume his seat. The honourable member for the Northern Territory will withdraw the reflection.,83
169,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw the reflection that he believes he is a racist. Mr Thckey-No, you will withdraw",83
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You will withdraw.,83
171,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will withdraw; and I will rephrase it. The fact is that the arguments that are put in this debate are often racist. People can walk away from that view if they like. Mr Thckey--'- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take another point of order. There have been no racist remarks in the debate here. It is not for the parliamentary secretary to say that they have been racist. It is a reflection on the people who made those speeches. It is unparliamentary, and I ask that it be withdrawn.",83
172,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"How do you know whom I am talking about? Mr Thckey-That is not the point. It is part of the standing orders"" Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER .......There is no point of order.",83
173,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The fact of the matter is that there are people in this House who understand the implications. Mr Thckey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a further point of order. The minister has failed to withdraw.",83
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I ruled on the honourable member's comments in the terms that he had actually expressed them and I said that there was no point of order.,83
175,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What we need to understand, and what the honourable member for O'Connor needs to understand,is that Aboriginal people's views are different from the ones he represents. Mr Thckey-No, I represent as many Aboriginal people as you do.",83
176,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are different from the ones the honourable member for O'Connor represents. He does not give credibility or credence to the views of their representatives in this place when they come and argue. He has already essentially said this evening that, apart from one person, the negotiating team was not representative. Those people are absolutely representative. I challenge him to go to a Central Land Council general meeting or a Northern Land Council· general meeting and express that view. Mr Thckey-Well, I will. You can invite me along.",83
177,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will not invite the know, honourable member along. I would not invite him to the butcher's shop. He does not underdepartments stand, nor do those honourable members on the front bench who have spoken. This bill not only deals with the issue of Aboriginal native title, but also-unfortunately for the opposition-reflects a vision of society that tolerant, which those opposite cannot be, understanding, mlltually respectful and a vision of what Australian society could be and, indeed, should be. But that is not for want of any ambition by the honourable member for O'Connor. This bill puts to rest the myth that prior to British colonisation Australia was a land without owners. It challenges those eurocentric that. notions that Aboriginal and Islander people belong to another time and history and, perhaps for the opposition, even another place; perhaps they come from Mars. It challenges the erroneous assumption that the first Australians are not interested in economrole ic development on their land. It challenges fictitious construct of Australian history which the dispossession of Aborigines and Islanders was viewed as inevitable br pronegotiating gressive. It challenges us to accept the faCt that indigenous Australians have the right use and enjoy land with which they have maintained a continuous attachment. It lenges us to recognise the rights Aboriginal people attach to the ownership and use of land, rights that non-Aboriginal Australians have enjoyed since 1788. Fundamentally, the Native Title Bill invites all Australians, including the opposition, participate in a society for which the gatherthose ing standard is common decency. There few issues which confront a cpuntry in suSh a demanding manner. After so many years of getting it wrong, Australia has a chance of putting it right at last. Despite the views of the opposition, particulady those of the honourable member for O'Connor and other members of the opposimatter tion who have spoken in the debate, we need to understand that there have been· detailed and unprecedented discussions, consultations and negotiations to achieve a balanced approach. As honourable members opposite will they have involved representatives of . state governments, state premiers, premiers and their various agents for some months. They have been intricately involved in discussions and consultations with the federal government about the content of this legislation. It has been an ongoing process is where documents have passed to and fro and where ideas were bounced off the state governments through this working party process. It is something for which the opposition gives the the government no credit. Even Premier Court would acknowledge that he had an open invitation to send people to any of these meetings. Every other premier did. Mr Williams-He doesn't acknowledge",84
178,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He ought to acknowledge it. Australia has come to a point where it has to acknowledge the reality. We need to recognise the good intentions which have come with this piece of legislation and the that is being played by the various the negotiating teams. I note that Miss Lois in O'Donoghue, the chairperson of ATSIC, is in the chamber this evening. She was part of this team and was disparaged by the opposition and those other Aboriginal negotiato tors-Daryl Pearce from the Northern Land Council; David Ross from the Central Land chalCouncil; Noel Pearson from the Cape York Land Council; Daryl Cronin on behalf of the Kimberley Land Council. Other people assisted in the process, including Marcia LangtonI note that she is also in the gallery-pastoral industry and mining industry representatives, to the ministerial committee on Mabo, all of ministers and the ALP caucus. Fundaare mentally, we had the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to do this right. What gets up the nose of the opposition is the fact that the Prime Minister spent the time to get it right when the opposition has no hope of getting it right. The Native Title Bill deals with a subject that in its essence is very simple to underStand. What Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have now they will continue to have. The bill is not about taking away anyone's rights. The bill validates invalid grants, thereby ensuring certainty of titlepresumably those opposite agree with that approach; provides for compensation on just terms where native title is affected; sets up a system for dealing with future grants over native title land; creates a division of the Federal Court to deal with native title determinations and the issue of future grants; supports the establishment of state and territory tribunals which comply with the Commonwealth principles; allows Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people' a right to negotiate in relation to matters which will affect development on their land; provides a fast tracking procedure for grants with minimal impact on the land; arid allows Aboriginal and Islander people a choice of court for the determination of native title. This system will ensure the recognition an.d protection of native title which would otherwise be extinguished by some of the states and territories. I want to give two instances of these states and territories and what they intend to do. Firstly, in Western Australia there is absolutely no doubt that Premier Court's legislation, as he and the honourable member for O'Connor acknowledge, extinguishes native title and substitutes grossly inferior statutory titles which, in some cases, cannot even be exercisfjd. It attacks the rights of Aborigines. It represents a total lack of understanding of culture, tradition and lifestyle. It is what we have come to expect from Premier Court and the Western Australian conservatives. I want to paint a small picture for honourable members. In 1985 when I was working at the Central Land Council I had the good fortune to be involved with a group of Aboriginal people who lived in Western Australia. They were from the Lake Mackay area, north of Kiwirrkurra. They were a group of nine Pintubi people-two generations-who had never spoken to a non-Aboriginal person. They came in' from the bush and I had the good fortune to be working with the Central Land Council and dealt with them through other people. Some time later I accompanied the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, on a trip with them through their country. Is the honourable member for O'Connor saying to me that those people do not have rights, that they should not be recognised? Is he saying that we should support Premier Court's proposals which would extinguish their rights and say to them, 'Never mind, you have never had any association with us. We still want the doctrine of terra nullius to be operative, but the court has made a judgment which we have to live with so we will give you a bodgie set of circumstances where your existing rights, we believe, will be knocked over'? Does that recognise the way in which they live? The fact is that, in interpreting the court's decision in the way he has done, Premier Court has made it very clear that what he is about is extinguishing native title. MrThckey-How is he going to get that past the High Court?",84
179,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He will not; that is the point. It is a stupid piece of legislation. Court seeks to eliminate their rights. That is the sort of thing that the opposition is proposing to support. It is proposing to support propositions which would extinguish native· title. The second area that I want to deal with is the Northern Territory. Myths are being perpetrated by the CLP Northern Territory government through its Chief Minister that Aboriginal Australians in the Northern Territory' are anti-development, .will lock away land and hold separatist attitudes. That it is a view which ultimately is based on racism. If honourable members examine what Marshall Perron has been saying over the last 24 hours, they will see what I mean. All they need to do is observe the behaviour of his government. It is deceitful, duplicitous and malevolent. The honourable member for Tangney ,(Mr Williams) need not shake his head, because that statement is true. Yesterday, on . ABC radio in Alice Springs, iri answer to a question, Marshall Perron said: Our land has been claimed and what we want to do is to see that the native title holders have the same rights and responsibilities as other Aborigines elsewhere in Australia. Whose land is being claimed, for goodness sake? Is he trying to tell us that Aboriginal territorians are not part of the Northern Territory community? He is being exclusive. He is saying that they do not have rights, that he does not recognise it is their land that they are claiming. He was very clear about that. This morning Marshall. Perron addressed the Legislative Assembly. Again, his language was exclusive, elitist and separatist. He said: Does Labor think it's fair that land be taken from the Territory estate from the Territory taxpayer? Who are Aboriginal territorians if they are not part of the territory community? Are they not taxpayers? Is it not legitimate for them to be land-holders? Is it not legitimate for them to be landowners? Is it not legitimate, after the High Court's decision, for them to have Some native title rights? That is not acknowledged by Marshall Perron. Is the opposition saying that it supports those propositions, because they are· exactly the sorts of views which it is purporting to represent? The deliberate and, in my view, intentional implications being put forward are that Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are not territorians and· are not taxpayers. I believe this is a perpetuation of the scurrilous and absolutely shameless views of Marshall Perron in the Northern Territory. Not only that; his comments reveal a gross ignorance of the contents of the federal Native Title Bill, despite the fact that his officials have been involved with Commonwealth officials for some months in working out the details of the legislation. He is ignorant of that fact. In the course of Marshall Perron being interviewed, he was asked: Would it be fair to say that your opposition is not so much to the Native Title legislation but more to the fact that you perceive it to be inconsistent the Land Rights Act? The answer was yes. He then went on to say: We do have some concerns with the Federal proposal that there is only a Federal Tribunal that will be used by native title claimants around Australia ... Even the honourable. member for Tangney knows that that is wrong, but Marshall Perron seeks to perpetuate the myth that that is correct. Anyone who has read the legislation knows that it is wrong, but to Marshall Perron it is correct. He went on later to make an admission. The question was: So the Mabo legislation as it is at the moment, although there is some rather minor problems you have with it, that is not the problem. The problem is the Land Rights Act itself and you want to see that amended. He answered: It is indeed. . That is his position; it has nothing to do with native title. It has nothing to do with the native title legislation. Mr Williams interjecting",85
180,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is, because it has everything to do with his predilection towards abolishing the rights that exist under the land rights act. I will explain the duplicity on that matter, since the honourable member for Tangney asked. On 24 February 1993 Mr Neil Bell, the honourable member for MACDonald in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, received a letter from the Minister for Aboriginal Development, Steve Hatton. Amongst other things, that letter says: ... the government does not seek to diminish the principles on which the Act is founded. That is the land rights act. In the minister's last sentence he says: The veto provisions in the land rights act as it now stands providing strong control for traditional Aboriginal owners is supported ... That is a fair statement. What did he say in August? He said that it was no longer supported. What was the difference? The original reference was a month before a federal election. What is he saying now? The world is falling in on the land rights act. If that is not duplicity or opportunism, I do not know what is. The underlying premise behind those with statements is racism. He is saying to people on the one hand that he is prepared to send his mjnister out to tell Aboriginals that the land rights act will not be amended in a way which will disadvantage them. On the other hand, he is telling people to come round to the back door and tell the Prime Minister and this government that they want to amend the land righ- act and knock off the right to withhold· consent from mining development on their land. That is absolutely .duplicitous. Do those opposite support it? In all of those circumstances, Marshall Perron has refused to acknowledge that Aboriginal people deserve the same fundamental, civil, racial and political freedoms as the rest of the people in the territory do. We have only to look at his record on excisions. Part of his concern about this legislation is the possibility that Aboriginal people might want to acquire some titles through pastoral leases. The fact is that, if he acted properly the excision legislation, the likelihood is that there would not be this yearn to purchase leases. His government has not done its job; it has not met its side of the agreement with this federal government. Lastly, I make this observation: Mick Dodson worked in the Northern Land Council for a number of years as its director; Daryl Pearce has been its director this year; David Ross has been the Director of the Central Land Council since 1989. On not one occasion have any of these people met Marshall Perron. On not one occasion has Marshall Perron sought to meet with them to discuss his concerns about the land rights act. Basically, he does not want to talk to them as, basically, he does not give their view any legitimacy, because it does not accord with his, in my view, very racist interpretation of what the Northern Territory community is about. It is not right at this stage in the 20th century for him to have those views. We want this community to come together. It will not come together by that sort of divisive attitude. He should find very little problem with the Native Title Bill, support it and not go on with this other sCllrrilous activity. (Time expired)",86
181,Mr ANDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is by any definition a difficult debate on the Native Title Bill. Establishing a fair and just approach to the issues raised by the High Court decision on Mabo has deeply concerned many people-me included. There can be no doubt that the Aboriginal community is disadvantaged relative to the broader Australian community, nor is there any doubt that the disadvantage arises in large part out of the dislocation of the past-some of it arising from simple, pure injustice, some of it from ignorance and some from a combination of both. There is also no doubt that we have a responsibility to attempt to put right the disadvantage that affects so many Aboriginals. But I believe this can be achieved only out of a spirit of goodwill and commitment to reconciliation, not of recrimination or contempt on the part of all involved. The attachment of guilt to contemporary on Australians by contemporary Australians is all too common today and will, like the attitudes of contempt and recrimination that I have just referred to, also prove in my view to be counterproductive to reconciliation and the pulling together of all Australians as one people. Reconciliation is, after all, set before us as a chief objective of the government's legislation, which in itself goes considerably further than the High Court's decision"". My family has a long and proud history of good relationships with the Aboriginal people dating back some five generations. I say at the outset that my opposition to this bill is not born out of a desire to deny Aboriginals their rightful place and opportunities in what is, or should be, one of the most fortunate and blessed societies on the globe with plenty of everything for all. But I worry very much about the narrowness of the 'politically correct' when they argue that to oppose this legislation is to be a racist. It is not just the tag that concerns me; it is also the lack of understanding that drives the expression of that view. It worries me that, in common with perhaps the rest of the Western world, we are losing sight of the nature and value of an individual human being. We are losing our respect and appreciation for others and in the process we are seeing our society polarised. We are fragmenting into groups which then accuse.all of those who do not agree with them or do not belong to their particular group as being somehow out of order, inappropriate or beyond the pale. The Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who now lives in exile in America, like a lot of Aboriginal people suffered terribly in his own land because he was not at that time and place regarded as being politically in order. He was politically incorrect in his views and the things that he was prepared to stand up for. Imprisoned, beaten, starved overworked and half frozen, he naturally came to hate and resent his oppressors. But he wrote in his book, The Gulag Archipelago, which was his account of his imprisonment, that he, amazingly, found personal freedom when he realised one day that the dividing line between good and evil lay not between captor and captive, Catholic and Baptist, man and woman or black and white; rather, he said that the line lies somewhere across every human being. None of us has a monopoly on good or bad. Solzhenitsyn saw that we need to be careful in judging others lest we pr-ume, mistakenly, that we would have behaved differently. We must shift our focus from the indignant assertion of the importance of our rights and talk more of our responsibility to others and then an atmosphere in which the past can be appropriately, fairly and properly acquitted can be created. I think that herein lies a vitally important understanding if we are to really progress reconciliation. It is not primarily at the level of the provision of the material that we can bring black and white Australians together, it is at the level of attitudes towards one another. I represent 8,000 Aboriginals in the electorcleaned ate of Gwydir. Of the 147 seats in this place, it ranks fifth in the proportion of Aboriginals in the population of that electorate. It is the gulf in willingness and-dare I say itsometimes capacity to understand and accept each other that is the greatest obstacle, in my view, to better relationships. Bad attitudes exist all round. They are not at to anyone side in the debate. Too many whites talk disparagingly-dare I say-and quite disgustingly sometimes of blacks in ways that reflect a belief that Aboriginals are somehow inferior, unworthy and lesser. On the other side of the coin, I have been told quite openly by young Aboriginals in the streets of my country towns in the most contemptuous terms that we stole their country and that we havee-Oow got to pay them back. Just three days ago I was talking to a school teacher-a woman I have the highest regard for-who has dedicated much of her life to trying to help Aboriginal people. She told me that she finds it very hard now because increasingly she is referred to, behind her back, as white trash. What hope is there of building decent relationships on these sorts of attitudes, regardless of who is responsible for them or who holds them? I believe that many of the efforts made by the broader Austmlian community to redress the disadvantage faced by Aboriginal people, often at considerable cost and sometimes with the best will in the world, have sometimes-and I do not blame the Aboriginal people for this at all-exacerbated, not helped the problem. For example, I think of a time. I raised a very serious matter of corruption perpetrated and driven-I have to say it-primarily by somebody who I think was certainly not at all Aboriginal. This was a serious matter of corruption in one of the towns in my electorate concerning a small group of people led by this individual. This individual had got hold of the leaders of power in the local Aboriginal business and housing and investment corporation and they were outrageously rorting the system to the extraordinary cost of the rest of the Aboriginal community. All of my efforts and those of many others to have the matter up fell on deaf ears. No-one wanted to know. The Federal Police, the New South Wales Fraud Squad, the Australian Securities Commission and even the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and ATSIC were all but powerless. This issue concerns me enormously because I think it goes to the heart of future relationall quarantined ships in communities. The clear message to young Aboriginals in that community arising largely out of this episode was: 'Rip the system off. Play it for all you are worth because nothing will happen to you. Even if one day they do decide it has to stop, they will not take any disciplinary action. There is no accountability'. So they do rip the system off. Worse than that, they become contemptuous of the white community and its law at the same time. Tragically, as Aboriginal elders in that community tell me, often they are then lost not only to their own culture but to ours as well. They float in a noman's-land. That is a tragedy for those young people. An Aboriginal pastor said to me recently that material assistance-money or whatever-must be well targeted and it must be given in the context of a clear willingness by both parties on the ground at the local level where relationships have to happen in a very real way. There must be a clear willingness to be reconciled; to acknowledge what is being done; to accept that, when a full and fair deal has been offered, enough will be accepted as enough. There must be the willingness to give; there must be the willingness to acknowledge the giving. The truth for many is that, in the way that it is done at the moment, the more that is given, the more that is demanded. Again, as many Aboriginal leaders-some of them with an immense sense of frustration-have said to me, a rebellious and contemptuous cargo cult mentality is starting to seriously damage many young Aboriginals. To believe that the government's approach with this legislation will result in reconciliation and building of one nation-even allowing for the fact that it will not affect the most dispossessed and by far and away the most numerous Aboriginals in our community, those urban and town dwellers-is in my view simply naive. It may very well simply make the whole thing worse by building expectations and creating further hope that material well-being-the good things of life-will most likely flow from contentious and divisive litigation under the very complex approach adopted by the government. I do not for a moment-far from it-deny the need to be generous to the AbOriginal community. I think it is absolutely essential that we are. We have to ensure better living standards, better health, longer life spans, better education profiles, less alcoholism and better employment prospects. We have to grapple with those more intangible things: the self-esteem of young Aboriginal people, their attitudes and their willingness to accept discipline-both self and imposed. But I do not think that this legislation will achieve it. If it continues to be as confusing and as controversial out there where black and white have to get along at the local level as it has to date, it may very well make for worse relationships, not better. If it weakens Australia further in economic terms, and we cannot seriously pretend that we can return to the land use patterns engaged in by either our own culture or by the Aboriginals 200 years ago, it will further undermine our capacity to look after the disadvantaged of any race in the community and it will further build tensions that are already evident between what might be called the working poor-there are lots of those in country towns-and those of all communities and all backgrounds who increasingly do not have jobs and are the butt of much local community resentment. I want to move on to another issue that concerns me enormously. The spate of silly and vexatious claims all over the countryside in recent months does cause me to question the motivation of some claimants. I would suggest that it is very much in the interests of Aboriginal communities if this stops as the quickly as possible. I note the concerns of many farming organisations and their individual members and remind the Aboriginal community that the negotiating committee advised the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the following terms: For the record, we should say that it is not the intention of our organisations to seek to test the validity of pastoral leases issued before 1975 for the simple reason that no point would be served by that course-given that in the unlikely event of the action succeeding the consequence would be that the Act would immediate validate, and in doing so, extinguish any remnant native title. Our agreement has provided the practical outcome that Aboriginal people require, namely a continued right of currently enforceable access and use, and the right to seek to convert to a more secure title upon acquisition. I hope those organisations are proved right and can establish that message quickly with those who were not part of the negotiating process or tensions in some parts of the country will escalate to truly unhappy proportions. The NFF acknowledges that valid pastoral leases: ... may be tested in court to decide whether any form of native title remains, even though there is no support for such action from mainstream Aboriginal groups. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said tonight, there is something of a 'myth of national consensus' surrounding the idea that all Aboriginals are adequately represented by the negotiating committee. So I really do hope that we can reach some broad agreement on this, because the legislation is not quite as it was originally indicated to us that it would be by the Prime Minister in this regard. The coalition's belief is that pastoral holds should be fully validated without qualification. I will leave it to others here tonight-there is no point in my running over ground that others want to cover-to refer to the need for greater certainty for the mining industry. But I do want to make the point to all and sundry that farmers and graziers become very deeply attached to their land, as do Aboriginals-I do not dispute that latter part of the remarks at all-and that there is no gain for anyone in creating unnecessary anxiety, concern and tensions in rural communities. That is not to deny Aboriginal peoples justice; it is to say that we cannot institute new injustices to make up for apparent past injustices. I want to conclude by referring to the words of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in summarising our position: firstly, despite the distortions of some on the other side, the coalition acknowledges the High Court decision and therefore acknowledges the existence of native title. Secondly, the coalition believes that the Racial Discrimination Act must be respected. Thirdly, the coalition believes that just terms compensation must be paid in certain circumstances. Lastly, we are strongly of the view that, for reasons of common sense, practicality and of course our constitution, titles in this country are, and should continue to be, managed by the states and in that regard ought to apply to all citizens including those of Aboriginal heritage. I passionately believe that we must seek to be one people, rejoicing in our diversity. I sincerely hope that the argument, sometimes the acrimony that we have been through in recent times through that process, will result in a more united and peaceful community here in this country.",87

I know many honourable members are wondering why I am speaking on the Native Title Bill-a piece of legislation about which my office has recei-ed only three phone calls and four letters-and as a representative of an electorate which at the 1991 census had only 264 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in it. This to me is the most important leaselegislation I have spoken on in my eight years in parliament. This legislation is a large step towards making certain that the culture and life of a group of people on this planet do not disappear. I grew up in the suburbs of Melbourne and never saw an Aboriginal until I was 14 years old. I never spoke to one until I was 21, and knew nothing of their traditions or lifestyle. In the mid-I96Os I worked in Darwin and this started my education regarding Aboriginal people. Naturally, it was the biased view which was prevalent at those times. The only good thing about the Aborigines was that if one worked at the leprosarium, which had 99 per cent Aboriginal occupancy, one received treble pay. Greed certainly overcame my bigotry and my fear of catching leprosy. However, while working there, and with those who had this disease, my views were changed. The Catholic nuns who ran 'Delissiville Leprosarium for the government enabled a group of people, outcasts from Darwin, to survive. These people were an inspiration to me in the way they managed this terrible affliction. They left a lasting impression on my mind. I had nothing more to do with Aboriginal people until I was elected to parliament. Only then did I become more aware of the plight of the Abori-ine. I have listened to the debate and I would like to try to bring into it the question of Aboriginal spirituality and through this their connection with the land. Of course, I can never feel for the land as they do. I can never appreciate their myths and traditions because I have been raised with the Christian myths and traditions, implanted over 52 years of my life.. The goals of christianity and the Aborigine have been formulated out of very different world views. The Christian seeks union with God in Christ and life eternal. The traditional Aborigine in identification with his or her ancestral spirit lives a symbiotic existence with the land and powers, and in participation with community aims to maintain the harmonious balance that originated in the dreamtime. . There is no personal creator God or impersonal absolute in the Aboriginal world view. However, the 'dreamtime', a reality which is beyond space and time is perhaps this culture's equivalent to the 'ultimate-. It links the Australian Aboriginal people with the spirit world and a concrete past which is ever present. Mythology tells us that just before living memory in the primordial past the uncreated and eternal ancestor spirits travelled across the surface of the pre-existent and featureless land. 'The law' or way of life was given and all forms of life were created as the ancestors indulged in some action or left a boqy part behind: a spear strikes another in combat and turns into a quill creating an echidna; an ancestor's eye becomes a waterhole; a spine a ridge; a footprint a hollow. Such significant sites are sacred and dangerous to the uninitiated because the 'powers' or spiritual essence of the ancestors is embodied within them. Aborigines perceive themselves to be the recipients of the powers and the land is central to their spirituality. Aborigines speak confidently about the ownership of land. One has said: When we talk about our land, that's my land, it's myself. It's not just an area like tribal land, it's my land. Gallarrwuy Yunupingu has stated: , This land is my backbone .. . I only stand straight, happy, proud and not ashamed about my colour because I still have land. I can paint, dance, create and sing as my ancestors did before me. I think of land as the history of my nation. It tells of how we came into being and what system we must live. My great ancestors who lived in the times of history planned everything that we practise now. The law of history says that we must not take land, fight over land, steal land, give land and so on. My land is mine only because I came in spirit from that land, and so did my ancestors of the same land ... My land is my foundation. These people are expressing the sense of identity and their spiritual connection to the land. In 1981 the World Council of Churches stated: The spiritual nature of the relationship between Aborigines and their lands, fortified by sacred worship, rituals and ceremonies, have helped to preserve historical memory and links with their ancestral lands. Aborigines know the land to be theirs by virtue of this memory. We have been told over and over again by Aborigines that land is their spiritual heritage. It is part of their being a people ... Land was synonymous with Aborigine existence. It could not be defiled, desecrated or cheapened. The expropriation, erosion, plundering, misuse or spoil amounts to the destruction of the Aborigines' cultural and spiritual heritage; in contemporary understanding it amounts to cultural genocide. Therefore, recovery of land has a deep spiritual meaning for the Aboriginal communities. The Aborigines are asking, ""How come that whites can have the land they did not own, but the Aboriginal claims are rejected even for the land which was historically theirs, through connections with their ancestors?"" They cannot give up these land claims without destroying themselves as a people. I will give honourable members an example of the destruction of a tradition and culture. The Devils Marbles and the surrounding area, known as karlukarlu, is a focus for rain dreaming. It is very spectacular country, where enormous round rocks stand in the desert. During rains numerous small streamlets run down from the rocks and ridges, wild figs grow from the crevices and water collects in the rock holes and depressions high on the marbles. The desert lives. The colours and contrasts are sudden and dramatic: red rocks and green water heavy with slime weed, tall anthills and spinifex plains. The country is extremely rich in dreaming sites and ancestral activity. But when the road was built from Alice Springs to Darwin it was located through the very centre of the marbles so that important sites are no longer accessible to the Kaititj. Sorrowfully, the women claim that they can still hear the old people crying from the caves. This loss has meant that certain very important rituals can no longer be performed. But, since the area is within a day's travel of . Warrabri, women inay still hunt, camp and dream there. Nonetheless, by losing access to important sites where they could express their attachment and whence they could draw power, women have been weakened. One ritual object associated with this area was so powerful that it was believed a man would meet a violent death if he came within close range of it. This terminal sanction is no longer available to these women, and therefore their powers have been lost and their culture and traditions diminished. I wonder what sort of outcry there would be if we put a road through St Paul's Cathedral or St Patri.ck's Cathedral? How much would people cry? It just would not happen. The connection between what I have said and the legislation before us today will, I trust, make some impression on those within the Liberal and National parties who have a genuine concern for the Aboriginal people of Australia. Urust that the mumbo jumbo of the lawyers and opponents will not distrac,t them from the basic objective of this biIl, which is to support real justice for all Aboriginal Australians.",90
183,Mr ROCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is something of an understatement to say that the 1992 decision of the High Court in the Mabo case has become a landmark in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. Regardless of whether we agree with the High 'Court's decision, there is no doubt that we must come to terms with its implications for land title in this country. The High Court's decision raised a number of other questions about the rights and welfare of Aboriginal people which the government is also seeking to address through this Native Title Bill. The High Court has been criticised from many quarters over its Mabo judgment. It is true that not all of those criticisms are justithe fied or particularly valid. For example, the claim that the High Court should not make law ignores the role that judicial decision making must necessarily play in determining what the law is in particular circumstances. In determining what the law is, law is effectively made. Such judicial law making is perfectly compatible with our system of parliamentary democracy and the doctrine of the separation of powers. Indeed, such judicial law making is often superior to the law making that goes on in this place, notwithstanding another doctrine-that is, the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy. Having said this, it should be noted that numerous other criticisms can be made of the High Court's decision in the Mabo case, criticisms that do have some validity. These criticisms can be made, while at the same time accepting that the High Court was correct in recognising the existence of native title in the case of the Murray Islanders. A view has been put about that the High Court's decision in the Mabo case should in some way be above cri.ticism in all its particulars. The correctness of the High Court's decision in recognising native title for Murray Islanders has been used to obscure the failure of the High Court to discharge the full extent of its judicial responsibilities. In this regard, I would like to quote what Professor Geoffrey de Q. Walker of the University of Queensland law school had to say on the matter. He said: The debate that has' followed Mabo highlights the fact that from a constitutional viewpoint, it was not (except in relation to the Murray Islanders) a judicial decision at all. ' You will all notice that most of the controversy has centred on how the court's decision should be 'implemented', by federal or state legislation, or both. . Yet the hallmark of a genuine, judicial decision is that it requires no legislative implementation, for the simple reason that it declares what the current law is, and applies it to the facts. Each time a court applies a principle to new facts it is to a - egree developing the law, but sweeping new proclamations of policy or calls to arms that require acts of parliament to put them into effect are quite outside the judicial function. The Mabo case, therefore, except in relation to the Murray Islanders, represents another usurpation by court of the constitutional powers of the Australian parliaments and people. Like many critics of the High Court'sdecision in the Mabo case, Professor Walker makes these criticisms while recognising the correctness of its findings on the native title of the Murray Islanders. Many commentators, however, have maintained that the High Court's decision must be accepted without question and in its totality simply because it is a decision of the High Court, the highest court in the land. In a narrow sense that is true, and it is to be ,expected that this argument is put forward chiefly by lawyers. But this does not mean that the High Court's decision and reasoning in the Mabo case should be immune from discussion and debate. It must be remembered that there are very few mechanisms provided for, either in the constitution or in our conventions of government, by which the High Court can be held accountable for its actions. There is some accountability to the parliament of a very basic sort inasmuch as the executive appoints the justices of the High Court. But beyond' that, there are very few formal constraints on the actions of this country's most powerful judicial body. In fact, there are some very real and quite proper constraints on the ability of members of parliament to reflect on members of the judiciary under our conventions of government. This is in sharp contrast to a country such as the United States which subjects its Supreme Court justices to a great deal of scrutiny. However, we do have some very powerful informal constraints on the High Court, and perhaps the most powerful of these is the weight of public opinion. It is only in the course of public debate that the decisions of the High Court are tested and subjected to appropriate scrutiny. Those who think the High Court should be immune from or above criticism for its decisions are effectively proposing to remove one of the few mechanisms for holding the High Court accountable for its actions. The fact that we are debating this legislation, and that legislation addressing some of the same problems has been proposed in Western Australia, demonstrates that the High Court's decision has been found wanting in telling us what the law is. Its judgment simply raised many more questions than it answered in the Mabo case. If the role of the High Court is to determine what the law is, then it failed in this particular judgment-except for its findings in relation to the Murray Islanders. The High Court told us what the law should be in a particular case, while at throwing a large part of our systems of land title into serious doubt. The High Court provided little by way of reasons or justifications for its wider findings. In a sense, it simply washed its hands of responsibility for the many legal questions it raised. The High Court must therefore take some responsibility for the acrimonious debate that has followed its decision. The emotive language and sentiments expressed by some members of the High Court in their Mabo judgments have not helped matters either. While such sentiments may be justified by the historical record, they do not belong in a legal judgment. The language in which the judgment is couched has been used by participants in the subsequent debate to suppress discussion rather than to facilitate it. It is significant that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) borrowed heavily from these statements at the outset of his second reading speech. His comments are calculated to suppress criticism of the legislation by wrapping it up in a tendentious and incomplete account of our history. The point to be made is that the High Court's decision should have been ,more explicit and detailed in its consideration of the question of mainland native title, or it should have refrained from any substantial, comment. However, having handed down its judgment, we are stuck with it and have to make do as best we can. Any legislative response on Mabo must inevitably involve a compromise between the many conflicting interests. The legislation we have before us today is one such compromise. There are many other possible solutions to the issues raised by the Mabo judgment. The best available solution would have been a cooperative approach by the Commonwealth and the states. Such a cooperative approach was within reach at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments-the COAG meeting-that was held in June of this year. It was an opportunity squandered by this federal Labor government. The Prime Minister must bear most of the blame for this wasted opportunity because, after all, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) the same time were only bit players. The Prime Minister must bear the responsidetermined bility. The failure of the COAG meeting the continuing intransigence of' the Prime Minister have condemned us to separate state and federal legislation on the question of native title. A joint resolution of these lems would have spared· us the uncertainty that will inevitably spring from any conflict between state and Commonwealth legislative responses. This legislation represents Labor's preferred response after much negotiation only some of the various interested parties. The government seems to think that, if it win the support of a certain critical mass interested parties, all will be well. Unfortunately, it has failed to secure th- support at least one major state. That state also pens to be the one that is potentially the affected by the Mabo judgment-Western my' Australia. This has set the scene for a conflict tween Western Australian and Commonwealth legislation. The federal government will prevail in this matter only by using the weight of its considerable constitutional powers people against the state of Western Australia-in particular, section 109 of the which provides for the supremacy' of Commonwealth law over state law. However, it may well be that the dubious legal foundaneeds tions for Labor's Native Title Bill will result in the state of Western Australia prevailing over the Commonwealth in any dispute over the constitutional validity of their respective legislative responses. The government of Western Australia is right to press ahead with its own legislation. In the final analysis, it must resist the attempt by the Commonwealth to usurp state prerogaWestern tives over. land management in Western legal Australia. No self-respecting state government would have it any other way. Western Austions, tralia stands out in this respect only because it is the most affected by any concerning native title. Other states are not similarly affected, although the risks to their constitutional rights and prerogatives are equally great. Under this legislation, the bulk of Western Australia will potentially be subject to native title claims-claims which would then be by the powers assumed by this and Commonwealth government. If the approach embodied in this bill were adopted in Western Australia, the adverse impact on investment in the mining, petroleum, pastoral and agriculprobtural industries will be considerable. The Prime Minister has criticised the Western Australian, government's legislation for the uncertainty that it will supposedly create. Yet that is exactly the impact that his legislation with would have in Western Australia. In fact, most of the criticisms the federal Labor Party can has directed against Western Australia's of 'legislation apply to this bill in spa?es. Even more to the point is the fact that this of federal legislation will have a detrimental hapimpact on Aboriginal people in Western most Australia. Many Aboriginal communities in state are completely opposed to this-the Commonwealth's-Iegislation. The fact that beother Aboriginal communities in Western Australia are supportive of the same legislation serves only to highlight how divisive the Commonwealth's proposals will be for these in my state. It is a classic illustration of the dangers· of centralist solutions to constitution complex problems. Western Australia has developed a legislati ve response to Mabo that meets the specific of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in our state. The Western Australian legislation confirms the validity of existing titles. It extinguishes native title in Western Australia but replaces it with statutory rights of traditional usage. These statutory rights follow the criterion of traditional' laws and customs used in the High Court's Mabo decision. Hence, a major advantage of the Australian legislation is that it gives protection to rights of traditional usage without the need for any proceedings, declaradeterminations or registration. If only the same could be said for this Commonlegislation wealth legislation! The Mabo judgment needs to be kept in perspective. Only a small numbe'r of Aborigines will benefit directly from it, no matter what our legislative response to the High Court's decision may be. The legislation is no substitute for the other measures necessary to secure the well-being of Aboriginal Australians. We should not pin our hopes for improved Aboriginal welfare on this or any other native title legislation. That is why the Prime Minister is to be condemned for raising the expectations of Aboriginal people in this context. He knows full well that this legislation cannot and will not deliver on those expectations. The hopes the Prime Minister has raised will be cruelly dashed once the realities of this biIl become apparent. The federal coalition is proposing an approach to Mabo that should have been adopted by the Commonwealth at the outset. What is needed is a cooperative approach in conjunction with the states that will ensure the passage of complementary rather than conflicting legislation at the state and federal levels. As I have already noted, such an approach was open to Labor. In the end, however, the Prime Minister threw away that opportunity. It is not too late for the government to abandon this legislation and adopt a cooperative approach. If Labor was genuinely concerned about the future of this country, including the future of Aboriginal people within it, that is what it would do. It is only the stupid pride and arrogance of the Prime Minister that stand in the way of an equitable and workable solution to the question of native title.  Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (10.19 p.m.)-At the outset, I want to say how simply outrageous it really is for those ite to mouth the cliches, go all the way through the arguments but then come down at the end of each speech-as they have, speaker after speaker-and say that they cannot support this legislation because of the complications involved. Those opposite have put an absurd argument, through their arguments, that all we need to do is validate existing grants. All the while, they have been saying that they are really with the High Court in spirit in recognising the decision. It is completely and absolutely hypocritical. It serves to remind us all here tonight about the law that underpins this legislation and how this has come about, because this has been prompted by the High Court of this country, the highest court in this land under our constitution, in a decision it made last year-a decision that abandoned the pretext that a state of terra nullius existed in the Australian continent prior to European settlement in 1788. The two parties in this place that supposedly pride themselves on defending the institutions of this country, decade in and decade out, have time and time again and speaker after speaker attempted to tear down and repudiate the High Court. Because it does not suit those opposite in their political game to agree with one decision of the High Court, I appeal to them not to imperil the longevity of the good word of that court. It is my intention, obviously, to support this legislation, not merely because of its content and its intent but because there is a strong argument, I believe, as do many others, that native title may be seen to exist with or without the' ruling regarding terra nullius. Even if one takes the view that terra nullius was appropriate, I argue, as does a substantial body of opinion, that there were mechanisms in English law to give native title to indigenous people all along. These mechanisms were based on traditional occupancy and· use of land. There is a view held by some that when the British claimed sovereignty over New South Wales in 1788 they were claiming ownership of all that territory. Such views have been given weight by court judgments since, even until relatively recent timesjudgments such as those of Justice Blackburn in the Supreme Court of the Northern Terrioppos- tory in 1971 when he declared: ... on the foundation of New South Wales ... and of South Australia, every square inch of territory in the colony became the property of the Crown. We can go back further, to the early years of the 20th century, just over a decade after Federation, when Justice Isaacs said in 1913 that he believed the start was with Governor Phillip when he received a commission from King George III in 1786 that 'the whole of the lands of Australia were already in law the property of the King of England'. So we have an entrenched view amongst many in Australia, all of whom have a sincere belief that the British came, saw, conquered and procured. But this is not the case. For some time now, across the world in so many countries-for example, Canada and New Zealand to name· just two-where English law has been taken as the basis of statutory law, prominent and modern legal authorities have found views such as those I have indicated and attributed to Justice Isaacs to be, and I quote Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray, 'startling' and, indeed, 'incredible' . For Justice Isaacs's view to be accredited, one must accede to the suggestion that a small and fragile founding British settlement, at a single coastal location, could, on the , moment of its establishment, dispossess as many as half a million indigenous people, gathered in hundreds of tribal groupings, occupying the vast expanses of the Australian continent-the true length and breadth of which was unknown to those newcomersand further that this could be the case simply as a consequence of the acquisit-on of sovereignty by the Crown. Indeed, this is not the case. It is important to dwell on this. To understand Mabo we must understand what has happened in the past and understand it in the context of our own rich English derived common law traditions. It is my intention to show that in English law-the standard and model of our own legal system-common law Aboriginal title has always existed. To be short, the legislation before this House now is therefore not revolutionary in either its content or its intent but in fact serves merely to take Australia, at least partly, towards the recognition and operation of rightful land title for our indigenous people-a step long overdue and, indeed, one taken long ago by many nations with similar British colonial history and development to ourselves. It is perhaps first best to clarify that there is a fundamental distinction in English law between territorial sovereignty, which is a matter of jurisdiction involving questions of international and constitutional law, and title, which is merely a matter of propriety rights which depend for the most part on municipal laws of property. Acquisition of one by the Crown does not necessarily involve acquisition of the other. This I think is a mistake so many have made and which some in Western Australia, amongst our political opponents, probably find a great comfort. Acquisition of possession and ownership are not a prerequisite to sovereignty in English law. It is certainly the case that, once the Crown acquired sovereignty by taking possession of territories, English law extended to that new colony as far as it was applicable to local circumstances. It may also be stated that the moment sovereignty over vacant territory was acquired the Crown was the legal holder of all lands until it granted them out. Even settlers in new colonies were unable to acquire land by simple occupancy; they had to look to the Crown for grants. In handing down its 1992 Mabo judgment, the High Court, in its unique considerations relating to such matters, abandoned terra nullius in the Australian circumstance. Prior to the Mabo decision, the situation in Australia has been one that adopted-indeed, one may even say adapted-a legal position regarding native land title. This emanated from the pretext of terra nullius in relation to the status of land on the Australian continent before European settlement. This pretext did not, as we now know, mean that Australia was classified as uninhabited but that it was peopled by an indigenous race who, though living on the land, were considered nomadic and possessing no ownership, as we understand it, of particular parcels of it. In reaching its decision, the High Court of Australia was applying itself to the facts as we know them today-that is, taking into account not only accepted common law practice here and abroad but also modern anthropological evidence regarding the established behavioural norms and customs of indigenous people. I have referred to native title and believe it appropriate to quote from Justice Brennan who defined the term as conveniently describing 'the interests and rights of indigenous inhabitants in land, whether communal, group or individual, possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged by and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous inhabitants'. Justice Brennan arrived at his definithat tion from a Privy Council decision as long ago as 1921. I will return to that a little later. Whether one wishes to consider the legislation currently before this House in terms of the recent High Court decision abandoning the idea of terra nullius and its flow-on or whether the preference of the observer is to pay greater credence to traditional aspects of English law and its significance for us, it would seem that support for this current legislation is very difficult to deny. I say this simply because, in both instances, a case for the acknowledgment of native title exists. This is because of the actions undertaken by indigenous people in the past in the use of lands. I clarify the point: with or without nullius, native title can be established based on traditional use. This legislation recognises that moral right. The early British claim of sovereignty over the whole of Australia was not surprising given the attitudes of the late 18th and early 19th centuries and can fairly be classed as unexceptional. The claim to the actual ownership, however, of every inch of land is another matter. The usual justification of the British at the time-a justification we here in Australia have, until the High Court Mabo decision, taken as given-was that the Aborigines had never actually been in possession of the land but, instead, ranged over it rather than resided on it. In some cultures, land is seen more as a sacred provider, to be used with a respect bordering on reverence. Herein lies the difficulty. The more that this is interpreted as the case, the less likely it is that English law courts would regard the Australian Aborigine as ever having had proprietary interest. As I am suggesting, even a customary law approach has its limitations. To consider this line of debate further, and to emphasise the long standing existence of common law Aboriginal title in English law, one needs to reflect upon the significance of the indigenous land use and the effect of various actions which establish occupancy over a period of time. In English law, and therefore in Australian statutory law, occupancy is a matter of fact, depending on physical presence on, or control over, land. On the other hand, possession is a conclusion of law and, as such, it may be said that possession cannot exist outside a legal system. Accordingly, in the context of English law, effects indigenous people, seemingly without a recognisable system of law at the time, could not be said to have been in possession of land prior to the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty. There could, however, have been occupancy because that is a matter of fact not dependent on law. There are standards within English law that provide that possession-and therefore titledepends on occupation. This can be estabterra lished by proof of acts performed by the occupier on, or in. relation to, the land. This is of specific relevance to Australian Aborigines. For nomadic hunter-gatherers, the circumstances are not easily established. Much case law exists around the world on this point. It is probable that such groups would not have been acknowledged as having been in occupation of the lands that they possessed around 1788. However, modern anthropological research reveals that few hunter-gatherer groups roam indiscriminately. Indeed, they tend to attach to definite areas where there are often spiritual ties. They are familiar with available resources. Conflict with rival groups is at a minimum. Boundaries are clearly defined and recognised. In such situations, access to lands and resources may be accorded to outsiders, but permission is usually required. In its Mabo decision, the High Court accepted evidence that an established continuous presence, in terms similar to those I have just outlined, existed in the specific matter before it. All of the six judges of the court who gave effect to the concept of native title at common law considered it applicable to the mainland. I again make the link between traditional English law and the significance of presumptive title. This can be attributed to indigenous occupiers through their retention of possession-and attributed to them the moment a territory is acquired for settlement. Presumptive title is what is meant by common law Aboriginal title. To honourable members opposite, who are touting the view that if we still had access to the Privy Council it would overturn the High Court decision in the Mabo case, I can only say that the apron strings were cut long ago. Furthermore, the Privy Council clearly not showed its hand in 1921 when it recognised we have. native title as existing separately from existing categories of English property law. deed, other countries have moved much earlier than we have to give recognition native title. In the United States, Chief Justice Marshall of the US Supreme Court recognised can Indian land title in a series of judgments in the early 19th century. Marshall's decisions had influence in countries right ac;ross the globe. For example, in New Zealand in 1847, the courts held that, quite apart from the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, Maori land title existed and could only be extinguished by Crown.   1973, Canada recognised native title in a case brought by the Nishga Indians. In that inough stance it was held by the Supreme Court, Calder v. Attorney-General of British Columbia, that native title existed and did not depend on treaty, executive order or legislative enactment for its existence. It could only be extinguished by surrender to the Crown by specific legislative enactment to extinguish title. I emphasise that the Calder case in Canada enunciated a principle common to all these international cases and, indeed, to the Mabo decision. The principle is that native title existed prior to European settlement and depended on the indigenous groups' own concepts of ownership. The concepts need not correspond with conventional common law elements of ownership, as we now understand them or as our forebears did in 1788, but have to be capable of articulation under that native law. The purpose of this bill is to do that under our law. I say to the House that, as nonHigh Aboriginal Australians, we do not and should not apologise in any way for being here. What we should do, and what we are doing with this legislation, is to recognise that people were here and had ownership of land before we did-ownership which, in other forms, was respected by conquerors and settlers alike in different parts of the world, contemporaneously, certainly earlier than It is highly regrettable that Canada, New InZealand and the United States, to name just three countries from among so many others, to could do this, in some cases over a century ago, and that we could not. That is a fact we all have to bear. The onus is on us. The onus Ameriwas on us a long time ago. I repeat my plea to those opposite to thwart the call from radical elements in their own ranks to attack the High Court. It is regrettable that those opposite, by their whole attitude to this bill and by amendments from their side of the House, look to be yet another the century behind on this issue-at least in values. If it is good enough for the English common law world to have recognised so ago the very thing that we are attempting to do with this legislation, if it is good enfor our side of the House to be trying to in do something about it in 1993, surely it is good enough for them to support the bill.",92
184,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I had hoped that the Native Title Bill would finally put an end to or the public anxiety which has been generated over the government's handling of the High Court's Mabo judgment, but that is not the case. The Mabo debate has not ended; it is only beginning. Once the bill is enacted, once the full implications of the government's response to the High Court's decision filters through the community, once the bureaucracy that it will spawn is put in place, once the expectations of the Aboriginal community are. dashed as resources are soaked up by legal groups and other interests, and once the they resource development sector is buried in a mire of new regulatory entanglements, that is when Mabo will take its full effect. After almost 18 months of allowing the Court's Mabo judgment to be bounced around in the public arena, we still do not have a national solution. We only have a political solution to the issues raised by the some High Court's decision. Along with many others in the community, members of the coalition are profoundly concerned that the government is driving the community towards if a national debacle on the Mabo issue. I do not mean a debacle simply from the partisan perspective, but from a public administration perspective as well. That is the important issue. After a long series of policy twists and turns, about-faces, compromises and backdowns, the federal government's desired legislative response to Mabo has not taken on any decisive shape. The bill before the House is a reflection of the constellation of Laborrelated interest groups. Either way, the Mabo issue is set to continue to undermine investment certainty and give further reasons for resource development companies to look offshore when building their business plans. These remain dangerous days for development industries whose viability ultimately depends on certainty of title. The process, if it can be called that, by which we have, reached this point in the history of the response to the Mabo judgment, has been tortuous. Accordingly, it provides a particularly colourful case study in public administration-or, more correctly, public maladministration. When John Prescott, head of BHP, said that the legislation was like reading porridge, he put into words what everyone else was thinking. At 115 pages, and containing 238 clauses and numerous amendments, what else could it be? I would not hesitate to admit that the Mabo issue as defined by a majority of the High Court presented the federal government with a challenge. But we have governments, a well evolved political system and the resources of the Public Service to resolve issues such as this. Consequently, we should not feel too prudish about pointing the finger. The High Court's judgment set up the circumstances in which a collision between a, social justice concept involving our nation's. indigenous peoples and the states' lanq management regimes was possible. It was possible, but it is the government which has now made the collision inevitable. I do not doubt for a second that Mabo was a complex issue to deal with. It was always going to be a difficult matter to translate workable publi,c policy, but few would have predicted the debacle that now threatens to come to pass. Ideally, for instance, we should have been spared the debates of the last year over Mabo. But as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) raised Aboriginal expectations, as he manipulated the original High Court decision and extended his policy ambitions and his political objectives well beyond the scope and meaning of the original judgement, he created more groups who saw themselves, rightly or wrongly, as potential winners and more groups who saw themselves as potential losers. The Prime Minister so' enlarged the M-bo arena that a huge amount of anxiety has been generated and everyone has had to fight for their territory or else fear losing it to another party. If there has been a tough and emotional debate over Mabo it is not because, as the Prime Minister thinks, the community is full of bigots and racists, but it is because the forces he unleashed pushed interest groups to preserve and build their stakes in the national debate because they believed these to be at risk or else they felt they could be expanded through the Mabo response. This situation arose simply because the federal government has tried to juggle the nation's land management system with a targeted social justice agenda. The govern-. ment wanted security of conventional title but a new and substantive role for Aborigines in the definition of land ownership and use. Regrettably, the twin goals could not and cannot be integrated in the way that the Prime Minister wanted. Despite the very real constraints on the High Court's decision on what constitutes native title and in what circumstances, certain Aboriginal groups have proceeded under the expectation that the federal government has initiated a new national land rights act. Fearful that the Northern Territory's experience with Aboriginal land access legislation was about to be extended nation-wide, the resources development industry has-and for very good reason, as the bill before the House demonstrates-reacted accordingly. Rather than creating a national consensus into about a carefully crafted and constrained policy model-which is the genuine task of the federal legislature-the government simply drove Mabo for political purposes and now the entire community is set to pay the price. However deeply the federal government might like to dig down into its rhetorical resources to elevate the rationale for its conduct, nothing can conceal the fact that this was a strikingly naive policy path to chart one which continues to threaten social harmony and economic development in this country. If we want to grasp how far into new and bizarre territory events have taken us, we might like to recall some of the social criticism Mabo-style which has arisen over the course of the debate. The Australian Council for Overseas Aid, ACFOA-which was also a participant in a meeting of the Senate minor parties and the environmental lobby last September, giving some idea of its political affiliations-saw fit to claim that, even if we extinguished native title as planned under the government's then draft legislation to validate existing titles, we would risk litigation under United Nations covenants. ACFOA also claimed Australia was set to become the new South Africa of our hemisphere. If the Mabo debate has done nothing else, it has shown that some community groups with time on their hands have previously undiscovered talents for vaudeville, or else a thinly disguised contempt for the society in which they live. Mr Reith'-It's not vaudeville.",98
185,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We had better give them the benefit of the doubt and hope it was vaudeville. Regardless of this, I cannot help but think the c()mmunity will come to see in this bill lost opportunities to concentrate debate on crucial areas of national concern. This is especially so in respect of Aboriginal affairs policy. No area of public policy has been so driven by cliched political debate as Aboriginal policy. No other group has been done sQCh a disservice by a government than the Aborigines. The government's chronic inability to put significant public resources in the hands of those most in need amounts to nothing more than a continuing betrayal of the Aboriginal community. This bill will only perpetuate the basic problems which stifle the flow of funds to those in desperate need. When, since 1983, the federal government has out laid $7 112 billion in nominal terms on Aboriginal assistance, how can it be that we still have a distinct community group suffering a level of across-the-board disadvantage and that is without comparison? Where have the resources gone? How much trickled through the bureaucracies and legal groups to address the simple health, educational and welfare needs of the Aboriginal communities at the ground level? Let us see how the open-ended and undefined compensation schemes referenced in the Native Title Bill defy the historical experience of other allocations to Aboriginal groups. What confidence do we have that the undefined compensation provisions of this act will ever reach those who really matter? Since 1967, we have allocated nigh on $10 billion, in nominal terms only, through the old Department of Aboriginal Affairs, ATSIC, and other departmental programs, on Aboriginal issues. Why have the people who count not benefited markedly from this? There must be something profoundly wrong with the way in which resources are allocated and distributed. But we would not want to question that, would we? . Remember what happened when the politically incorrect New South Wales magistrate, Pat O'Shane, raised this issue? What was the charming piece of invective unleashed by the caring, sensitive, New-Age Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner)? His response to a public policy crisis involving his own portfolio constituency was, 'Well, she's just bitter and twisted, isn't she?'. He must have gone to the same school of public administration as the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly), that is all I can say. The cpnfusion and chaos which has characterised the federal government's approach to the Mabo issue largely results from the government's inability to separate out public issues and tackle them systematically. In this case, the failure to separate the moral and social dimension of the Aboriginal issue from the basic requirement that & mature nation must retain a stable and simple mechanism for validating and dispensing title will be costly. In so far as the current legislation moves to integrate Aboriginal economic aspirations into the land management system, we are set to go on paying that price for decades to come. This is not an issue of social justice versus economic pragmatism. The Prime Minister and his acolytes might want to run that one through the media as much as they like, but I can attest to the House that anyone, including me, who has been to distant Aboriginal settlements and met and talked with the people who really matter in this debate-not the dodgy, ambitious legal eagles running in and out of the media circus, but the tribal elders and the Aboriginal families confronting life as they face it day in, day out-is profoundly and irrevocably affected by the dignity of their feelings, the scale of their need and the vast gulf between them and the politics and issues of public administration which preoccupy the cities. Where there is a difference between our side of politics and the other side, the political battle is being fought out over the best way to help, administer policy and keep up resources to those in need and the best way to secure, at the same time, the interests of all Australians. For the Prime Minister to claim the great divide over Mabo is between those who care and those who do not is as ugly and pernicious a claim as any Australian can utter against another. Regardless of this, the coalition-by its past actions and commitments to the future-has demonstrated to those who have watched and listened that it will press on with great cause to help Aboriginal Australians build their lives and strengthen their communities. But it will do this in a manner which does not discriminate against other Australians, breed division or waste scarce resources when so many are .in need-both black and white Australians. I made the point earlier that it was vital that a response to the High Court's Mabo judgment had to be genuinely national and workable. As it stands, the bill before the House is neither. Rather than being national in vision, it is vainly centralist-and completely unworkable. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs h-ve derided the mining industry for its intense involvement over the Mabo response, its exclusive and narrow interests, and for its impatience with a public policy process that lacked any system or orderly development. Therefore, only on rare occasions could the mining industry have a concrete input into the process which has led to the bill before the House. The concerns raised by the mining industry constantly over the past 18 months have been of singular significance, but they have never been addressed properly by the government, because they have no place in the bureaucratic political settlement which the Native Title Bill reprt-sents. The mining industry rightly wants to know how, outside provisions for the relaxation of the Racial Discrimination Act and complementary state and territory legislation, past title grants can be validated securely. As it stands, all we have at present is a validation process for past invalid grants of title. All other valid titles are exposed to any number of claims based, for example, on the co-existence of native title. What this means for mining operations, their planning and investment schedules, is anybody's guess. The government has argued that valid grants will not be subject to claims because it would be hard to win such cases. That needs to be tested in court. There is any amount of sCbpe in the bill for native titleholders or claimants to hold the mining sector to ransom, either through the threat of litigation or through costly and time consuming delays resulting from the rights the bill confers on native title claimants in respect of development and exploration. This is not a doomsday scenario. This is an industry which was brought to a standstill in the Northern Territory by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Providing a right for native title claimants to negotiate or the right of accredited native title tribunals to dispense title grants with a view to the interests of claimants-both of which are part and parcel of the bill-represents huge sovereign risks for the mining sector. When we see freehold titles-a residential building project, in fact-being subject to litigation in Alice Springs at the moment on the basis of Aboriginal sacred sites claims, the prime ministerial guarantee that valid leases will not be subject to native title claims loses credibility and we suddenly come to appreciate the mining sector's concerns. When we translate the related issues of the impact on future title grants to Western Australiawhere some 5,000 to 7,000 new mining titles are issued each year-we can get a grasp of the importance of regional settlements in the process of adapting the land use regime to the High Court's judgment. Similarly, we get a grasp of the real impact of an unwieldy, centralised Commonwealthled bureaucracy overlaid on the existing state based titles system which this bill also establishes. We should watch out for the dual system of tribunals. That is what forum shopping will produce. There will be queues outside the Commonwealth's National Native Title Tribunal. That will place another serious impediment in front of the mining sector and discourage investment. Legal firms will also be watching that. The concerns expressed by the coalition have not been racially based, as the Aboriginal affairs minister has claimed like a parrot, every time he steps near a microphone or a television camera. They have principally been about administrative concerns of the magnitude that I have outlined, The bill has not addressed them at all. We can get over these issues if we trust our hand to the processes which have been up and runlling for years. Even before Mabo, the state based land management regimes had already underpinned a dialogue between miners and Aboriginal groups that was achieving more in terms of equity and social justice for Aboriginal communities than a federal bureaucracy will ever bring. The hard work carried out between miners and Aboriginal elders at the ground level is where all the action has been for years; but the government has discounted that vast effort. That is what is forgotten or purposely neglected by the bureaucrats and government. There was a serious and systematic process of negotiation and quiet reconcilisadness, ation proceeding already, which did not require intervention-let alone managementby governments and officialdom. The mining sector instigated this years ago. Just as when politicians discovered the concept of sustainable development back in 1989, the mining industry had been implementing the concept for years through mine site rehabilitation and other sophisticated, scientifically based environmental practices. They led the debate on this issue too, just as on black-white relations. Numerous members of the modem day mining sector know more about Aboriginal needs and sensitivities than many of us will know in a lifetime. They have learned this working at the ground level with Aborigines. But this huge, unpretentious dialogue has been swept aside by the government and this bill will never yield outcomes as concrete and practical. I assure the House of that. The coalition recognises the existence of a type of native land title and that the lot of Aboriginal Australians has been far short of good and it is determined to correct that. But we must ensure that the nation can get on with its business without undue disruption, division and needless government intervention and interference. We must pursue a sensible and practical way that addresses the real needs of black Australians. (TIme expired)",100
186,Ms DEAHM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Macquarie) (10.57 p.m.)Everyone who is speaking on the Native Title Bill over the next few days, whether speaking in favour of the bill or against it, will not fail to acknowledge that this is a historic occasion and a historic piece of legislation. It is from that historical aspect that I Wish to direct my remarks and look at the historic and cultural background of the relationship of Europeans to Aborigines in Australia and at the role of education in the forming of opinions and positions on the vital issue of the relationship between Aboriginal and European culture. . When I was a child, Aboriginal people were 'the people who live at La Perouse' or they were a, problem country people had to deal with; I seldom saw an 'Aborigine and learned nothing about them at school or at home. Somewhere in my psyche there loomed a mingled with irritation that the rich and wonderful country I lived in had a colour problem. How adult white Australians react to Aborigines today no doubt is strongly conditioned by their experience as children. Many of my generation-and I would suspect before and after as well-had a similar experience. It was all a result of the sad but necessary colonisation of Australia by Europeans. The reasons for the great silence about Aboriginal culture and history are varied. But most would have aligned with the apparent necessity to feel comfortable with colonisation, to confirm our rights as settlers in this most non-European of countries. Unfortunately, silence has resulted in ignorance-and ignorance breeds false assumptions and irrational beliefs. It is my contention that if we had all been educated in the culture and history of the indigenous people of this country, and how they related to European settlement, we would not be debating tonight whether or not land title exists and whether or not indigenous people are entitled to that land. Had we all had this educational background, it would not have taken until 1992 for the High Court of Australia to pronounce that terra nullius does not hold up in relation to European settlement. This 18th century theory would have been debunked long ago. Being a student of history, I am a firm believer in the lessons we can learn from this inspirational subject. I think it is necessary to look at Aboriginal history in the context of Australian history in general. Until very recently it was felt that Australia had no history. The consequence was that we taught our children at school-certainly in my generation-about those countries which were much older than ours. Consequently, when I left school I knew more about the Tudors and the Stuarts, the Wars of the Roses and the many wives of Henry VIII than I knew about the colourful and fascinating history of my own country. Gradually, and thankfully, this problem is being overcome. Aboriginal history courses are now available in most universities in New South Wales and, no doubt, the rest of Australia. Aboriginal studies are also now taught at primary school level. I was privileged to be a student in the first Aboriginal history course at the University of New England in 1988. It was a great revelation but a sad reflection on the importance we place on Aboriginal history that it took 200 years to teach it at tertiary level. Perhaps one of the reasons why Aboriginal history has not been widely taught was the attitude that, firstly, the indigenous people of this country were inferior to Europeans and, secondly, that they were a dying race and, therefore, there was no point in learning about people who were not going to be around for very much longer. Racist attitudes regarding Aborigines were rife from day one of settlement of the colony. Such attitudes have been excused by many people in our society as merely the attitude of the time. However, these eurocentric attitudes were not universal among the colonists. Indeed, the instructions given to Governor Phillip were that he should treat the Aboriginal people with kindness and that the two races should live harmoniously together. However, a total lack of understanding of the differences between the cultures soon put paid to that fine ideal. The dying race theory is also based on racism. The theory of social Darwinism prevailed among many of the early colonists. Its view of the survival of the fittest and the ranking of races according to their place on the ladder of civilisation put the Aborigines on the bottom rung. The theory that the stronger race obliterates the weaker gave rise to the common acceptance that Aborigines would soon die out. Another great European attitude, that of patemalism-I have heard a bit of that in the House tonight-then came into play. Mr MCGauran-From whom?",102
187,Ms DEAHM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"From your side. The theory of 'smoothing the pillow of the dying' became accepted practice. It was official government policy that Aborigines were to be treated with so-called kindness during their dying days. The brief history of the Aboriginal people since European settlement starts with the dispossession by theft of their land-land which was precious as a food source as well as a source of identity and a spiritual home. This was followed by total annihilation in some areas, and decimation in others, by wholesale massacre, poisoning, disease, malnutrition and despair. The women were raped and taken as sexual comforters for male settlers. Children were forcibly taken from their parents and used as slaves or cheap labour. A free moving, semi-nomadic people lost their rights of movement in their own land. They also lost their basic human rights. But, above all, they had instilled into them by their white masters, including, in many instances, members of Christian churches, a deep feeling of inferiority, baseness and a lack of selfrespect. It is a chastening thought to realise that massacres were still occurring well into this century and that only isolated instances, such as the Myall Creek massacre, resulted in the punishment of white offenders. It was the middle of this century before the practice of removing children from their parents was stopped. Is it any wonder that many Aborigines have an antipathy towards the police and government officials when their earliest memory was of such people tearing them from their mother's bosom or herding them into a reserve? While many perpetrators of such alienating behaviour were well-intentioned Christians, the degree of blatant racism which colours our past is horrendous. There is plenty of evidence that racism was often merely a justification for the unbridled greed for land and an increase in personal wealth. If one covets a person's land, it is easier to take it and shoot him down in the process if one views that person as less than human. Like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I do not believe that this generation of Australians should wallow in guilt for the deeds of our forebears. However, armed with the knowledge of what really happened rather than glossing over and trying to minimise the misdeeds of past generations, we can both understand current relationships between the races and make restitution where appropriate. Compassion is a more productive emotion than guilt. I would now like to tum to the central issue of the topic, that of the relationship of land Aboriginal culture and, therefore, to the main issue of land title. The attitude of European people to land is today as it was in 1788. Land is something to be possessed, to be used to increase profit, to be bought and sold. Ownership is the all important central factor. For European people, ownership of land also provides status. Such an attitude prevails in our society today, where owners of property are afforded a higher status than people who do not. People who own large tracts of land tend to be the richer, more prosperous in our community. On the other hand, the Aboriginal attitude to land is at the very core of their existence and their culture. Land is sacred to Aboriginal people. They do not own the land; they belong to the land. The Aborigines had what Henry Reynolds in his book The Law of the Land called 'a sophisticated system of usage and tenure'. Each tribe or nation of Aboriginal people had its own designated area of land on which it hunted and gathered and held its religious ceremonies. Every member of each Aboriginal nation knew every part of that land intimately. It held its secrets and its spiritual connection for them as any recognised Western religion does for its adherents. The make-up of Aboriginal society could not have been more different from European society, not just in its attitudes to land but also in the cultural make-up of family groups. The European arrivals found it more difficult to understand Aboriginal culture than· any other culture which had been colonised by Europeans. They found no temples, no meeting halls, no villages and no apparent societal structure. Their response to this was to assume that there simply was no structure to this society. They rejected Aboriginal culture as non-existent and failed to understand the intricate make-up of Aboriginal society. This was also manifested in the European and Aboriginal attitudes to work. Europeans were brought up under what is known as the Christian work ethic-that work is necessary for the salvation of the soul as well as for the preservation of the body. Aborigines had no need for such a culture. Certain times of the day were spent in hunting, fishing, gathering to and the preparation of food. There was no need for any other activity which was not central to the spiritual dimension of their lives. Time not spent in hunting and gathering food was spent in ceremonial rituals and in teaching the young the heritage of their culture. They had no need to invent the wheel. It is, therefore, understandable that conflicts arose when Aborigines were dispossessed of the land to which they belonged and were placed in reserves which were, to them, foreign territory. Granted it is not surprising that Aborigines were branded as lazy. They did not understand the European work ethic, nor did they have a need to. But taken from their spiritual home, they soon degenerated into despair and, very often, died as a result. It is not surprising that there was an extreme clash of cultures between European and Aboriginal life. The rifts between the two cultures widened as settlement moved further into the hinterland of the colony. As Aboriginal people were systematically deprived of their land, the new settlers were given free grants of land. In areas where there was no particular jurisdiction by the colonial powers, settlers adventurous enough to move into these areas were allowed to squat on whatever land they were able to conquer for themselves. These squatters were eventually given the land which they had taken and cultivated. The descendants of these squatters still occupy huge tracts of land throughout Australia, particularly in the western and northern parts of New South Wales. It is an interesting aside to observe the argument that Aborigines already own or control areas of land disproportionate to their numbers. I notice that the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) has expounded this argument in his speech earlier this evening. When this observation is made, nobody ever recognises the huge tracts of land, the thousands of square kilometres, owned by a single person or a small company. Much of this land, as I have already observed, is owned by the descendants of those early squatters who gained this land at no monetary cost. We now often revere these people as pioneers who were willing to go into the outback, fight the hostile natives and gain this land for themselves. What these detractors, including the honourable member for Barker, fail to observe is that the indigenous population of this country owned the whole lot of Australia-loo per cent. All they are asking now is a recognition of that fact and the use of and title to those lands which have not been alienated by other titles. Is this too much to ask? Unlike many of my colleagues in this place, I am not a lawyer and I will not, therefore, attempt to argue the legalities of the land title issue. However, it should be noted that the doctrine of terra nullius was attached to the new colony on two separate grounds. The first meaning of terra nullius is that of a country without a sovereign recognised by European authorities. Australia certainly fitted into this category, as no kings or queens could be found amongst the Aboriginal people. The second meaning of terra nullius is a territory where nobody owns land and where no tenure of any kind exists. It was no problem for European settlers to establish a case on both of these grounds. Much debate has taken place on the definition of tenure and occupation. Because the Aborigines-as Henry Reynolds· said'ranged over it rather than resided on it', it was easy to make a claim that the Aborigines did not in fact occupy the land. This mistaken assumption was based on European interpretations of what occupation meant and not based on Aboriginal occupation, which was valid and has now been established as such by the High Court. The issue of land rights has been seen by many in the Australian community as an issue which has only arisen in recent times and which has sprung from a new found independence by Aboriginal people following the 1967 referendum. Nothing could be further from the truth. Land rights were in fact recognised by the British government in the 1830s. In fact, the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion in July 1834 to the effect that inhabitants of British colonies should be afforded protection and their civil rights. Thomas Buxton was the political heir to the slavery abolitionist William Wilberforce. After the successful abolition of slavery, he turned his interest to the state of natives in British colonies. I am indebted to Professor Henry Reynolds for his research on this matter when he published his book, The Law of the Land in 1987. In this publication Professor Reynolds quotes Buxton and I think this is worthy of repetition. He stated: It might be presumed that the native inhabitants of any land have an incontrovertible right to their own soil: a plain and sacred right, however, which seems not to have been understood. Europeans have entered their borders, uninvited, and when there, have not only acted as if they were undoubted lords of the soil, but have punished the natives as aggressors if they have evinced a disposition in their own country. Buxton, and other anti-slavery activists who formed the British and Foreign Aborigines Protection Society, soon became the focal point of agitation for improvement in the lot of Aboriginal people in the empire. Professor Reynolds has made a substantial case that land rights existed long before our modem times. Sadly, the colonial governments to whom these instructions were passed never acted on them. However, it does prove that Aborigines have had the right since that time . to claim their land and it is to our shame that this has not been recognised until the High Court made its pronouncement last year. I have made history the theme of my speech tonight. I would like to conclude by once again drawing attention to the historical nature of, firstly, the High Court's decision in the Mabo case and, secondly, the legislation currently before this House. As my colleague the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) said early this evening, I am proud to be a member of the Australian Labor Party. I believe that it will be a landmark for this government and for the Australian Labor Party to have introduced and passed this legislation. I believe that there are many on the other side of this House who support this legislation, but are not able to vote for it because of the stand taken by their leaders. This is a sad situation. I believe that we are not only looking at a practical and legal situation, but also a historical and spiritual one. Spiritual issues are not the stuff of which this House is generally made. But I firmly believe that because of the spiritual nature and connection of the Aborigines to their land, we also have a spiritual connection with those with whom we share this great country-those from whom our forebears took this country, but with whom we now share it. I believe that if we are not able to grasp the significance and enter into a full reconciliation with the indigenous people of this country, we will be poorer as human beings and as Australians. I do not believe that we can call ourselves a mature nation until we have come to terms with the situation of our to live indigenous people, we have understood their history and their culture, and have become one with them.",103
188,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I fully support the coalition's total opposition to the government's Native Title Bill, which will amount to a litany-to use the words of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) today-of uncertainty, complexity and division. On 3 June 1992, the High Court of Australia invented native title when handing down the Mabo decision. The case of Mabo v. Queensland related to a claim for native title on the island of Mer. The Murray Islanders were not nomadic, hunter gatherers like the Aborigines. They had a highly developed social system, living in village houses, cultivating individually owned plots of land and there was no community title. The Murray Islands were not claimed as part of Australia in 1788 and were not annexed by Queensland until 1879. Thus, the High Court's rejection of the long standing doctrine of terra nullius was probably understandable in the case of the Murray Islanders. It has often been suggested that terra nullius meant that Australia was uninhabited. The reality is that it meant that though indigenous people lived on the land, they were considered nomadic peoples with no ownership in particular plots of land. Thus, while the High Court's decision on terra nullius was probably correct with respect to the Murray Islands, it drew a long bow in seeking to extend its ruling to the mainland nomadic peoples. . The majority decision by six High Court judges introduced uncertainty into 200 years of settled land law. The judgment has been described as an attempt to usurp the role of parliaments by inventing law rather than being merely satisfied to interpret it. The High Court judgment and this bill will be devastating in many ways to social cohesion, the economy and to a proper constitutional division of responsibility between the states and the Commonwealth. Quite frankly, I think the High Court got it wrong. But whether we like it or not, the law of Australia on this matter is as created by the majority six High Court judges and must, therefore, be dealt with. The judges have thrown the community a hand grenade which must now be defused. The High Court found that a form of prior title, which it deemed native title, s.urvived. The government's legislation goes well beyond the High Court's decision, which made it clear that it is very difficult to establish native title. The High Court said that persons claiming native title must be able to prove that they are part of the traditional group, whose ancestors held native title before sovereignty was acquired by the Crown, or that native title was passed to them by traditionallaw. That, of-itself, is not enough. They must also be able to prove that they have maintained their connection with the land and their observance of traditional laws and customs-although some judges considered that, if there had been· continual occupation, it might not necessarily be required for laws and customs to be observed. Native title is not freehold title; despite the attempts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to convert it to something similar. It· is a bundle of rights, mostly not possessory, to be determined by reference to the laws and customs of the particular tribe or group. This bundle of rights may include the right to hunt, the right to gather, the right to have access to land for purposes such as ceremonies, the right to have access to sacred sites, or the right to use the water flowing through or springing from the land. Unfortunately, the bill before the House seeks to give one group of Australians virtually a blank cheque at the expense of other Australians. In other words, all Australians are equal, but some are more equal than others. The government's legislation is fatally flawed. In going well beyond the court's determination, it purports to transform native title into a form of super title not envisaged by the High Court. Also, the government has confused the Mabo decision with the process of reconciliation. The Mabo legislation we are debating tonight is complex beyond belief. It isa lawyer's picnic, the tab for which will be picked up by the long-suffering taxpayer. Can you believe,· Mr Deputy Speaker, that Labor intends the taxpayers of this country to fund land claims which could have the effect of gutting the Australian economy? The legislation is constitutionally doubtful. When we go through the very many clauses and pages of the bill, it is fairly clear that the government is expecting the High Court. to rule out some parts of the legislation-and, indeed, the government is hoping that some parts will survive. It has been clear, since we enacted our constitution, that the states have haq responsibility for land management. This legislation amounts to a grab for power by Canberra seeking to control an area in which the federal parliament and the federal area of government has had absolutely no expertise in the years since federation. The government's legislation permits possibly two per cent of Australians to own up to 25 per cent of the nation. I think that that is a matter which the people of Australia are going to have to consider very carefully as to whether that is fair, whether that is equitable and whether that is in the economic and social interests of the people of Australia. The legislation will cost the Australian taxpayer up to billions of dollars in compensation. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has outlined .the possibility of extra taxes to pay for Mabo. A very strong argument has been put forward by many people that compensation could well be capped. We will find that there is an erosion and an evaporation of investment in the mining industry, the tourism industry and primary industry and that jobsincluding Aboriginal jobs-will be lost. We will not even see them disappear because, in today's competitive climate, there are countries that provide certainty and a much safer shelter for investJTlfmt than the Australia that the government is seeking to undermine through the Mabo bill before the House. This bill also institutionalises uncertainty and it spawns a bureaucratic nightmare. It is quite dear that Australia's credit rating is in jeopardy. I think it is very sad that the Mabo decision has caused an increase in racial disharmony in this nation. Aborigines have admitted that, since the High Court brought down its Mabo decision, there has been a rise in feeling against Aborigines by the general community. I think that that is very - unfortunate. In fact, I have had many people contact my office and suggest that' the Native Title Bill amounts to apartheid in reverse at a time when South Africa is dismantling that much discredited system. The High Court accepted that native title can be extinguished in several ways, and suggested that it has been extinguished throughout much of the nation. Th<e High Court said that native title could be extinguished through legislation, inconsistent Crown grant, inconsistent Crown reservation or dedication, surrender of title to the Crown, or abandonment or failure to maintain traditional' laws and customs in relation to the land. The simplest way to restore certainty would be for states to legislate to validate titles. It has been suggested that native title should be extinguished and the pre-Mabo situation restored. At common law, there is no need to pay compensation to extinguish native title, but the problem for the states is the federal Racial Discrimination Act 1975 which the Whitlam government successfully enacted with the assistance of the High Court's fairly wide interpretation of the external affairs power. The effect, therefore, is to change the law so that extinguishment of native title by legislation can only be achieved in a nondiscriminatory way; that is, if compensation is paid. Were the Commonwealth to lift the Racial Discrimination Act, this constraint on the states would be removed and the validation and extinguishment of existing native title could take place without compensation and without legal difficulty. Again, many people have contacted my office to say that this is the course of action which should be followed and that in fact the more than $20 billion, which has' been paid by successive governments to Aborigines over the last 20 years, could be deemed to be a form of compensation. . This-and I want to make it quite dear-is not the coalition's policy. Sadly, the billions of dollars pumped into Aboriginal assistance over the last 20 years have done little to boost Aboriginal health, education or living standards. Throwing money at the problem has done nothing to address Aboriginal disadvantage. I think it is an indictment on this parliament and on successive governments that they have, in effect, tried to solve the problem by producing a bottomless pit of funds or a private pipeline to the Treasury. The sad fact of life is that Aborigines are as bad off now as they always have been. I think that that is a very great tragedy and every one of the 147 members in this place would surely agree with me on this point. The government is attempting to hijack the matter of land management in Australia. We find that members opposite will piously state that the Native Title Bill does not attempt to usurp the traditional rights and responsibilities of the states in relation to land management. The bill speaks for itself and most commentators have agreed that the government is intruding into an area which has not been a traditional area of Commonwealth responsibility. Those opposite might ask how we in the coalition would approach this important issue. I think it is pretty obvious that all Australians-Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal - should be equal before the law regardless of race. Also, in Australia, we share a common destiny as citizens of an undivided Australian nation. The coalition would pass complementary legislation to enable the states to validate existing land titles, induding rolling back the Racial Discrimination Act if that were required for this purpose. We would also accept the right of the states to extinguish native title provided that the law of the land, induding the Racial Discrimination Act, is complied with in so doing. As land management is a state responsibility, we accept the role and the right of the states to develop their own individual responses to the High Court's Mabo adventure. In addition, we will seek a full Senate inquiry into the legislation. We do not see the need for a bill comprising 115 pages with almost 238 clauses and with explanatory memoranda of about 118 pages. The Commonwealth is clearly seeking to intrude into an area of state responsibility. One thing that is obviously missing from the bill is a proper definition of Aboriginality. That is something that this government or a successive government is going to have to look at quite seriously. As part of our approach, we accept the right of state governments to extinguish native title or to develop their own approach to Mabo in accordance with the laws of Australia. I do not want to be taken out of context. We accept that state governments must observe the laws of the land. I believe that the Western Australian coalition government has come up with a proposal which, in effect, deals with the subject of native title as created by the High Court in the Mabo decision. It has brought in the Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Bill 1993 which provides a fair solution for all Western Australians,including Aboriginal people. The Western Australian law protects traditional usage of land by Aboriginal people. It will cause the state to pay compensation if the traditional use is impaired or extinguished. Compensation will be provided in all or any of the following ways: title to alternative land-an opportunity for freehold title; money; provision of employment on community programs; and opportunities which have economic or social value. Applications for mining or tourism will be dealt with promptly and fairly to keep the economy growing and create new jobs. The bill will result in control and administration of land staying in Western Australia. Land and mining titles are assured for existing and future title holders. Beaches, parks and all recreation areas will be protected for continuing enjoyment by all Western Australians. It is interesting to note that to complement this legislation, the Western Australia government has established a social justice task force dedicated to improving the lifestyles of Aboriginal people in terms of health, education, housing, employment and land ownership. The Western Australian solution is a very fair solution. It is a non-discriminatory solution. It is a solution which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) cons;ders to be a very much better approach to the High Court's Mabo judgment than that which we find incorporated in the Native Title Bill before the House. The people of Australia oppose this legislation. Every opinion poll we look at reveals that an ever increasing percentage of Australians believe that Australians should be treated equally. The message coming through loudly and clearly is that the government's approach is totally rejected. This bill is one of the most important yet one of the most disastrous pieces of legislation ever to be debated in the federal parliament. It does nothing for Aborigines. It does nothing for their job outlook. It does nothing for their education, health or living standards. This bill may, however, cause higher taxes and destroy our economic recovery. It is an example of the Prime' Minister's obsession with personal power and his place in history. This bill does. nothing to achieve its stated aims and leaves a nation divided against itself. It is a tragedy that this government, this Labor Party and this Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) have fanned social conflict and the fires of racism. What they have done in this bill is to tear up the concept of one nation, one people. What we need is a fair go for all Australians-Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal.",106
189,Mr KNOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In rising to support the Native Title Bill, I take pride in continuing a family association with Aboriginal people that predated my birth. My father, Bill Knott, former member for Wollondilly and Kiama in the New South Wales parliament, was a member of the select committee on Aboriginal land rights that instigated the land rights act brought down by the Wran government. Unlike most Australians-and indeed most parliamentarians-I have been fortunate enough to have always had Aboriginal friends. They are friends who, like my Anglo-Saxon Celtic friends, my ethnic friends-I might add that I am married to a person born overseas-and my women friends, have shared with me the highs and lows they have experienced in their lives. From this vantage point I would like to make some observations which pertain to this bill. The first observation I would like to bring before this House concerns the legal status of native title. In a pamphlet distributed on behalf of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (Inc), the first sentence reads: In 1992, the High Court of Australia reversed years of Australian law and invented a new form of land title-called 'native title'. This should read, if it told the truth, 'In the High Court recognised that the legal claim on territories now known as Australia was an illegal act against the direct and express interests of the Crown, George III, and by overturning terra nullius that expression of the Crown has at last been acknowledged-that is, that native inhabitants have ownership rights' . The High Court did not invent native title. George III, monarch and crown from 1760 to 1820, recognised native title and in fact gave specific instructions to his explorers in regard to claims on inhabited lands. Thus it is that the illegal concept of terra nullius was invented, and the first act of perfidy was performed against native Australians by Captain James Cook at Kurnell, in Botany Bay. James Cook claimed New South Wales for George III on the basis. that Aboriginal inhabitants were savages and not humans. I would like to make a point to the vast majority of Australians who have a long history of association with this our land, Australia. To the Bruce Ruxtons of Australia and the other valiant men and women who placed their lives on the line defending this land from Japanese aggression and attempted invasion: consider if those two brothers on the Kokoda Trail had said, 'Stuff it', or, worse, had been killed prior to reinforcements arriving and turning the battle. Consider, if you will, that the World War II fascist led Japanese army. had been victorious, had not been soundly defeated at Milne Bay and turned back at Kokoda. Consider an Australia which had been invaded by the fascist government of World War II Japan, and consider this in the light of what would have happened to the property rights of those Australians who were resident in Australia at that time. Should history have taken this turn, does anyone in this House suggest that the invading Japanese would have recognised the existing land title system? The answer is no. Quislings and collaborators would have been the only Australians granted Japanese title over land owned by others.· I ask honourable 200 members, where would they be with the argument that would still be raging about the injustice of imperialism and the Japanese land 1992, grab had history seen us come second in World War II? Would people like me be still in the hills firing bullets from· antiquated rifles? Would people like me be still involved in acts of terrorism against the invaders? My answer is yes. I suggest that the rule of aggression in this scenario would be wrong and that the pre-invasion inhabitants would have had rights-rights of land ownership. I would suggest that this is not an unrealistic scenario, as in the bleak days of World War II the course of history was in the balance. Thus I ask those Australians to consider the reality in the case of Aboriginal Australians. An invasion took place and the historical records show that there were acts of resistance by Aboriginal Australians. Pemulway was one such Aboriginal Australian; the military actions by Governor Lachlan Macquarie against the Dharug people and countless other documented cases of resistance engaged in by the original inhabitants of Australia are on record. Thus I put it to this House that the demands for redress of that invasion are no different from the demands we would be making had the course of World War II been different. I hold in my hand some of my heritage in this land known as Australia: medals awarded to my grandfather for his participation in World War I and his military identification tags, a medal which acknowledges my grandmother having had two sons in service in World War II, and a Commonwealth medallion representing my place in this House. Were I an Aboriginal, I would hold up a handful of earth representing the ownership of me by the land. To reinforce the argument that I am placing before this House, one only has to look at the reunified Germany. After almost 50 years, the reunification of Germany-in particular, Berlin-saw former residents rolling up and demanding to repossess houses and land that had been stripped from their possession in the period of government by the East Germans. Their claim was that the current occupation of property was illegal and did not take into account the prior ownership of their forebears. Let us look at car ownership in New South Wales. If I have a car stolen which is subsequently sold, resold, resold again and then resold again and I can show that this vehicle was the vehicle originally stolen prior to its illegal sale, who by New South Wales law owns the car? The answer is that I do-the original owner. My next point brings into play the dynamics of land ownership. In this House there are howls from those on the other side when the suggestion is made to tax inheritance. By their condemnation of tax on the property handed down through generations, they would seem to imply that individuals or families have a right to pass ownership onto the next generation. Indeed, some of the family fortunes represented here are likely to have originally derived from patronage to the officialdom of colonial Australia by way of land grants. To further the point, it is highly likely to suggest that those affected people would not enjoy the privileged positions that they currently hold in the social sets of our great cities and brown-tongue societies had it not been for the wealth inherited, which had its origins in the original land grants. What have the original owners of this continent-Aboriginal Australians-been able to hand down to their descendants? This bill is .not about giving Aboriginal people extra rights but about recognising that they are entitled to the same rights as all ians. I ask all fair-minded Australians to support equality before the law for Aboriginal Australians. I would like to turn again to the history of this land and the implications for the people of Australia of that history. Clearly, the majority of living Australians are not responsible for the atrocities committed in previous times. We personally have no guilt for the introduction of smallpox which decimated the Aboriginal population in the first 10 years of settlement; for the arsenic laced flour put out to poison them; for the young Aboriginals whose heads were kicked off like footballs in Western Australia; for the Aboriginal hunts popular in earlier times, for the massacre at Myall Lakes, Terry Hie Hie near Moree and numerous other places last century or in the Northern Territory in 1923; and for the rape of Aboriginal women and the exploitation of the men. We do not have personal guilt for these things. We were not part of that Australia. Nor are we guilty of the systemic and intentional destruction of Aboriginal soCiety in New South Wales by stealing the children from families because they were lighter in colour and placed with white families or religious orphanages in homes far away from their parents, their heritage and their cultural roots. Our society, however, is responsible. Whilst we do not have personal guilt for those past actions, we do have responsibility for our own actions and attitudes today. I ask fair-minded Australians to examine their own rights and to ensure that Aboriginal Australians are treated equally with all other Australians today-that is, that they are entitled to claim their legitimate heritage. Their heritage is their ownership of this land. I ask ethnic Australians to familiarise themselves with the history of this continent and consider it in the context of their own original country. Do the inhabitants of countries not have the right to fight for their birth right? Before we judge Aboriginal Australians by the impression created by the mass media, which paints a picture of drunkenness and despair, irrespective of th- facts, we should think of the way our own communities are other Austral- represented in the press. To the women of Australia who have not been able to fulfil their potential, I ask you to give to these people the right to self determination. That means that Aboriginals should be allowed to develop their communities on the basis of equal rights. To all Ausmoral tralians I say: we demand that Aboriginal Australians be treated in the same way we would wish to be treated-with respect for our human rights. Respect for Aboriginal human rights must recognise the unique position faced by Aboriginal Australians in the history and development of this land. I would now like to put forward a view for the future of our home, our beloved Australia. Honourable members may note I did not say New South Wales; I said Australia. I would like to look at those Australians who benefit from this Native Title Bill. The people who most benefit from this bill are ordinary Australians who live on and love this land. The treatment of Aboriginal Australians has been assessed by the international community and Australia has been found wanting. That is a record we need to address. As a child I have clear memories of playing with my friends who lived on the mission and the murie around Condobolin. I remember their homes made of discarded galvanised iron. I remember that the windows were unduly large and open to the elements. I remember there were 15 or 20 people in these houses: I remember the Christmas parties organised by Faith Bandler where the presents were old toys done up by a Sydney hospital worker out of love for his fellow human beings. I remember the thoughts of a close friend teaching at Macintyre High School at Inverell who was angry because his black students could not get jobs, even though their academic, records far outstripped those of white students at Inverell High School who did get jobs. I remember that I was treated differently from my Aboriginal friends when in the presence of other white Australians. I do not want my two sons to live in a where this is allowed to continue. I want a future for my sons based on egalitarianism, where they will not be called wogs because their mother was born overseas, where they can look at other Australians in all their diversity as their equals-a land we can all proud to extol to the world. The people who most benefit from this bill are the Australians who have the guts to acknowledge the wrongs of the past and the integrity to set a course that will redress that wrong. The Australians who most benefit are Australians who can hold their heads up in the international arena and say, 'We have seen injustice and we have acted to redress it'. Such a land is coming to pass. This Native Title Bill is a step in that direction. I commend this bill to the house.",109
190,Mr MACKELLAR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When the Mabo decision was brought down, it affected matters of fundamental importance to all Australians. When I say that, of course, it was particularly important to indigenous Australians. Since that time there has been a requirement of governments at both federal and state levels to react positively to the Mabo ruling. During the interregnum there have been many approaches suggested, ranging from the view that the High Court decision should be legislated away, to other extremes on the opposite end of the scale. It seems to me that at the heart of the matter are two issues: firstly and most particularly important from the indigenous point of view is the spiritual place that land has in the hearts and mind of our indigenous people. This is a special factor and it is very hard for many if not most nonindigenous Australians to fully understand or appreciate the special place that land has in the hearts and mind of our indigenous people. The second issue is the need for the response to the Mabo decision to properly address the uncertainties that have arisen as to the ramifications that the Mabo decision may have on existing and future land titles and leases. This second requirement is sufficiently complex in itself, .let alone if it becomes-in whatever way-mixed up with what has been called the reconciliation· proland cess. But, unfortunately, mixed up it has become. Therein, I believe, lies many of the problems of this legislation. There is no doubt on either side of the House that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are the most disadvantaged group in be our society. I do not 'believe anyone would seriously challenge that proposition. In any of the many criteria that one can use for· the assessment of disadvantage, the, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples unfortunately predominate: criteria such as infant mortaliundertaking' ty; life expectation and infant disease-the list goes on and on. There is also the fact that our indigenous people were in many cases treated extremely badly both by authorities and individuals in the past. Many of the contributions to the debate from members of the House have listed those injustices and that cruelty quite dramatically. However, that fact does not, in my view, mean that we now should hold a sense of collective guilt. Many of the things that were done in the past were done with the very best of intentions at th- time. They are now seen as cruel, thoughtless, totally discriminatory and foolish. But viewed through the eyes of the people at that time, they were not so described. Just as we believe that we now are acting responsibly and in the best interests of the people, I have no doubt that many of our decisions, in retrospect, and with the benefit of hindsight, will be seen as foolish or ill informed at the very least, and possibly dangerous at the worse. I believe that the problems of the indigenous peoples of Australia have to be addressed. Successive governments have sought and are still seeking to do just that. Literally hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent over recent years and yet still, as we all know, the disadvantage remains. This brings me the point where I have the greatest difficulty with the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in relation to his reaction to the Mabo decision. He has, in my mind, mixed up these two separate requirements: the requirement to eliminate uncertainty in relation to the situation surrounding land tenure in Australia and the requirement for a carefully considered step by step process of reconciliation. The cruel effect of his mistake has been the quite unfair and misleading expectations that he has raised in the minds of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia; expectations that in no way can be met by this legislation or any other single piece of legislation. He and his ministers have outdone each other in hyperbole when describing this legislation. 'Historic turning points', 'huge and 'immense complexity' are just some of the phrases that have been used. We have been challenged by the government and by others to react positively to the legislation and to support it unreservedly. Not to do so has been described as being racist, insensitive, acting solely on behalf of vested interests and displaying a contempt for the legitimate aspirations of our indigenous peoples. Speaking for myself, I had a profound hope that I would be able to support the legislation that the government brought forward. I wanted to be able to affirm clear legislation that endorsed the Mabo decision, cleared up uncertainty surrounding land tenure and was the result of agreement between the federal and state governments in Australia and other interested parties. Very sadly, I cannot support this legislation because it does mix Mabo with the process of reconciliation an(l goes way beyond the High Court decision. It is hugely complex and I believe unworkable. It does not create certainty but in fact does the reverse, with the added certainty of constitutional and legal challenge-with all the cost, delay and frustration that that implies. I believe it will have a, very significant negative effect on investment. That is important in these parlous economic times. It unnecessarily interferes with the constitutional responsibilities that the states have for land management and therefore represents a bid for a' more centralised control for Canberra. It creates a new, unnecessary, costly and complex administrative, legal and bureaucratic system. It proposes, with little or no detail, a land fund of potentially huge cost. In saying that, as I hope I have made clear, I believe that there is a necessity to respond positively to the Mabo decision, and the opposition has done that. I believe that it has done it in a way which is clear and which can be easily summarised. The opposition's response says to the states, 'You have the right to manage land title in the future, provided you recognise the High Court decision . and also meet the requirements of the Racial Discrimination Act'. We believe that a just and workable solution would include certain features. It would include provIsIon for the Commonwealth, states and territories to legislate to validate past grants of land titles and prevent the invalidation of existing titles where, at the time of grant, the land in question was affected, either wholly or in part, by the existence of native title or by a combination of native title and the operation of any law. We believe that there should be no relaxation of the Racial Discrimination Act, except to the extent that it may be necessary temporarily to validate past grants, the proviso that compensation is paid on a non-discriminatory basis. We believe that compensation is non-discriminatory where it is determined on a just terms basis and where provision is made for liability for the amount of compensation to be determined by a court in the event of dispute. The solution would include provision for government, not land-holders, to be liable for the provision of compensation for the extinguishment of native title. Where a Commonwealth, state or territory government settles a claim for compensation, but not otherwise, the settlement may, in addition to, or in substitution for, a cash payment as agreed by the applicant, inc1ude·a substitute grant of land or interest in land, the provision of services or facilities, the provision of employment or community programs, any other benefit agreed with the claimant, or a combination of any of the above. We recognise the desirability of government seeking to enter into regional agreements for the purpose of settlement of compensation claims. We also acknowledge the right of states and territories to set a deadline for lodging of compensation claims. We will provide for appropriate government funded assistance on an equal basis to both native title and compensation claimants and respondents. We have also said that we would commit the Commonwealth to reimbursement of the states and territories for any compensation paid for the extinguishment of native title associated with the validation of past grants. We believe that Commonwealth legislation should enable states and territories to confirm crown ownership of all minerals and petroleum and all existing rights of public access to, and enjoyment of, public places, including foreshores, beaches, national parks, recreational reserves and stock routes. We believe that state and territory laws must continue to apply to land, the subject of native title. We believe that this approach will not compromise existing rights of indigenous people, national development, jobs, the economic use of land or the further development of Australia's mineral, pastoral or other and then only on industries. There is another aspect of this whole situation which greatly concerns me. I do not want to put this at too high a level but, unfortunately, in my view, there are some within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who have as their ultimate ambition the creation of a separate Aboriginal state or nation within Australia. I am totally opposed to such a concept. It is extremely important that any legislation passed by this parliament does not produce results which in any way facilitate the development of such a situation. I therefore reiterate that I am truly sorry that this legislation is of a nature that I cannot support. I believe that it represents a great opportunity missed. Those on this side of the House have at least an equal amount of concern to that of government members for the future of all Australians. As a party, we have a proud record of demonstrated activity in the development of equal opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. If the Prime Minister had spent far more the time in consultation and discussion with state Premiers, I am sure that an agreed solution could have been achieved. Such a procedure could have achieved the results we were all hoping for rather than this costly, complex, confusing and constitutionally dubious piece of legislation that we have before us. My sadness then is not only that expectations within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have been raised to unrealistic levels; it is also that the Prime Minister and his government have failed to respond properly to the legitimate concerns of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians alike.",112
191,Mr HAVILAND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," It is with great pride and pleasure to have the opportunity to speak Qn this historic piece of legislation, the Native Title Bill. Many other government members have already pointed out the historic national significance of this bill and its fundamental importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and indeed to all Australians. Let me add my vQice to those other government members who have already covered these points in detail. . In the wake of the historiC High Court decision, it was never going to be easy to draft legislation which would provide· the appropriate level of justice, including social justice, for indigenous Australians and at the same time recognise the legitimate econotnic interests of those industries relying on certainown ty of land title and access to land use. This was particularly difficult, given our federal system and the constitutional role of the states in relation to land management. It appeared at times that some state governments were far more interested in protecting their power and their parochial territorial and political interests than they were in joining with the federal government in providing a framework for justice for indigenous Australians. Indeed, history shows that the track record of most state governments on Aboriginal affairs is a sorry one, and it was this situation which led to the Commonwealth assuming constitutional power to make laws in respect of Aboriginal people as a result of the 1967 referendum. It was the difficulties with the states over Mabo which convinced me-if I was not already convinced-of the need for a change to our structure of government in Australia. In this respect, I agree wholeheartedly with the contents of the private member's bill introduced in this place on 18 November by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). That bill provided for the phasing out of state governments and a new structure of national and regional governments. With Mabo and with so many other issues, state governments are often nothing more than a barrier to national equity and social justice, as well as to efficiency. Having said that, the situation currently is that states do have constitutional responsibility for land management. Given that reality and the constraints that it imposes, I believe that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his ministerial committee, including the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait. Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, have done a magnificent job in producing this bill and in winning support for it from the Aboriginal community, from industry groups and even from most state governments. It is a much better outcome than I expected, frankly, given the complexities of the issue, the competing interests involved and the role of the states. However, one state is determined to oppose this legislation and is seeking to introduce its contradictory legislation: Western Australia. Given recent political history on Aboriginal issues in Western Australia, and given my own experience having lived there for a few years in the 1970s and having visited there recently, I must say that this does not come as any great surprise. But I will return to that matter later. I will now talk about the R word: racism. Racism is one of the worse of all human prejudices. Much has been said and written by sociologists about racism and why it occurs. I am not a sociologist so I will not attempt a lengthy dissertation about racism, except to say that it is one of the worse human prejudices and, like most prejudice, it is often based on fear, insecurity or envy. Racism exists to some degree in most parts of the world. It has certainly existed in this country, particularly in relation to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, but also in relation to migrants. I have met a number of people over the years who are otherwise decent, reasonable Australians, but who have a lot of trouble avoiding prejudiced attitudes regarding race. The Aboriginal community in Australia has clearly been subjected to horrific, institutionalised racism throughout our history since 1788. Even the opposition would agree that this is true. I hardly need to elaborate on this simple fact. It is one thing to accept that racism exists and to work towards minimising it through education and through promotion of more tolerant attitudes as well as through antidiscrimination legislation such as we have. It is another matter entirely when community leaders, including politicians, seek to inflame, exploit or take advantage of racist attitudes for personal or political gain. That is why I have grave concerns about some of the statements made and attitudes reflected by some members of the opposition, and particularly the stance taken by the Western Australia government. I say this despite the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) earlier today in his contribution when he claimed that the opposition had been subjected to racist slurs. Certainly the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has also been very indignant and outraged by what he believes are racist slurs addressed towards the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition claims that his party has a proud record on Aboriginal affairs. Unfortunately, this claim does not withstand critical analysis. Some of the public comments made by members of the coalition parties have been designed to create fear and confusion in the community, the very fear which often leads to racist attitudes. I take the Leader of the Opposition at his word. 'I do not believe that he is a racist nor do I believe for one minute that all members of the coalition parties are racist. Of course they are not. In fact, I know that some opposition members are embarrassed by the coalition's position and by the behaviour of some of their colleagues. However, there are clearly elements of the opposition who are seeking to exploit the existence of racism for cheap political gain, and this is also true of the Western Australia government, as I will discuss. The Western Australia premier, Mr Richard Court, has consistently expressed his opposition to the High Court Mabo decision. The West Australian newspaper on 13 May 1993 states: Mr Court said he agreed with State Liberal Party president Bill Hassell that the Mr Court said that the High Court ruling was racist! Then he said: 'We'that is Mr Court and Mr Hassell- have a similar philosophy: one country one law, all of us living under the same rules. I might come back to that comment later in relation to some of the history in Western Australia. Mr Court said that the High Court decision, in his opinion, was racist. Now he has grudgingly accepted the decision but he has introduced legislation into the Western Australia parliament which seeks to nullify the effects of the decision by extinguishing all native title in Western Australia. So instead of native title, the Western Australian bill provides for certain - o-called rights of traditional land usage for Aboriginal people. However, these so-called land usage rights appear to be heavily qualified and subject to provisions in other legislation. What the Western Australia legislation amounts to is a denial of basic land rightsand I stress land rights-to Aboriginal people. Instead, they are to be afforded ch;trity., To elaborate on this I will once again quote the former Western Australia Liberal senator, Fred Chaney. On the Sunday program on 8 August 1993 Mr Chaney was reported as saying: The idea that Aboriginals have some rights of their own, as against privileges which are given to them by a benevolent government, is quite foreign to Western Australian thinking. As we have seen in the past, and as we are seeing again today, it does have the capacity to arouse a great deal of public feeling in the state. On 12 November in the Sydney Morning Herald Mr Chaney said that in Western Australia there remained: . . . an attitude that Aboriginals can almost be treated like kangaroos and simply moved on whenever there is a competing (land) use. The article says that Mr Chaney said that he suspected Mr Court's approach in introducing his own legislation had broad support in Western Australia, yet the legislation would simply remove Aboriginal rights and: ... replace them with something that is very much at the grace and favour of the politicians again. ruling was racist. He went on to say: I think the land issue and the issue of Aboriginal people having rights rather than if you like, gifts or charity from the rest of us, is something that sits very uneasily in the West Australia cast of wind. They are not my words, they are the words of a Liberal, a former member of the Senate, Mr Fred Chaney. He said: And to that extent, 1 think Richard Court is representative of a majority of electors heremeaning in Western Australia. As I said, they are not my words, they are the words of Fred Chaney, 'an unusual Western Australian Liberal-one with a social conscience, so much so, that he was known in the Liberal party over there as Red Fred. Having li.ved in Western Australia, I can identify with some of these comments about attitudes toward Aboriginal people in that state. However, I do not want to be unduly provocative, nor do I want to run the risk of inflaming racial tension in Western Australia or anywhere else any more than has already occurred thanks to statements by that government, so I will refrain from. describing some of my own experiences in that state. However, I remind the House of some of the statements that have been made by the Western Australian Premier. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in this House on 21 October 1993, in response to a question from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), the Special Minister of. State (Mr Walker) reported on a meeting that he had with Premier Court. He said: Premier Court obviously believes, and he says so, that he is ona political winner ... He repeated after an interjection that, yes, in his meeting with Premier Court, the Premier had said that he thought that he was on a political winner with his attitude towards this issue. Only last week at the National Press Club the Premier of Western Australia made some very interesting comments. He said that Western Australia reluctantly went into the Federation. He said that if his legislation was knocked out and the federal legislation was imposed upon Western Australia, it would be an issue that the state would go to the barricades on, or words to that effect. He then said that it would probably deliver every federal seat in Western Australia to the coalition at the next federal election. That just about says it all. It is quite clear what Richard Court's agenda is. As I said before, some people in the coaliquite tion parties think that there are votes in stirring up racial divisions and racist sentiments in the community, although, in fairness, the Premier of Western Australia might also have an eye to Canberra bashing. He might well be using the Aboriginal people and Aboriginal issues in his continuation of his policy of bashing Canberra-a policy which successive Western Australian conservative governments have perfected over time. That is what some of the members of the coalition parties-not only in Western Australia-are doing with their disgraceful misinfonnation campaign on the effects of the High Court judgment and the effects of this bill. What is even worse is that the Western Australian government's propaganda campaign is now being funded by taxpayers' money. The Premier has taken out large advertisements in newspapers, paid for by the Western Australian government, attacking the federal government and the Prime Minister over Mabo. What a disgrace! Aboriginal affairs and the treatment of Aboriginal people has been a sorry story in Western Australia, although not only in Western Australia. It is fair to say that the problems in Western Australia have not happened exclusively under coalition governments. There has been criticism of state Labor governments in Western Australia as well. But, in fairness, I have to point out that under the rorted electorate boundaries that have existed in Western Australia, Labor governments have never in history had a majority in the upper house. It was a Liberal-National Party opposition led by the aforementioned Mr Bill Hassell of the far right of the Liberal Party which blocked the Burke government's land rights legislation in 1985. Let us look at the record of a previous coalition government in Western Australiathe government of Sir Charles Court, the father of the current Premier. I do not have time to go into a lengthy history of that, but I recall that there was a state election in 1977 and some interesting things happened in the seat of Kimberley. The Liberal sitting member was elected by about 93 votes in the election in Kimberley, but it turned out that some fairly nasty things happened on polling day in the electorate. The Labor Party's candidate was an Aboriginal person named Ernie Bridge, who, of course, has gone on to be a member of the Western Australian parliament-a very distinguished one-and is now the opposition shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. There was a challenge to the Court of Disputed Returns after this election .in 1977. I have a copy of the judgment. I have had an interesting read of it. I will read one document that was tabled, which was the fairly significant basis for the Labor Party's claim. A petition to the Court of Disputed Returns says: For use on election day Ridgewho was the Liberal candidateadopted a plan to deprive illiterate Aboriginal voters, of the PoIling Stations, at Derby, Fitzroy Crossing, Go Go Station, Hall's Creek, Kununurra, Mowanjum and Turkey Creek of a fair and free opportunity of voting for Bridgewho was the Labor candidatethe candidate of their choice. The plan was contained in a document and annexures entitled ""Instructions to Legal Scrutineers in Kimberley Electorate"" and the means to give it effect was the despatch to the Kimberley District of five solicitors who (as 'at all material _times Ridge well knew) put the plan into effect at the places and urider the written authorities set out below. They were however all acting for hirn in the execution of the plan. I will not name all the solicitors. The petition goes on to say: The result of the execution of the plan was to pressurise polling staff and Aboriginal electors in relation to the use of How to Vote Cards and the asking and answering of S.119 questions ... of the Electoral Act in Western Australia. It continues: In addition to specific matters pleaded elsewhere in the Petition, and the loss of valid votes for Bridgethe Labor candidateelsewhere claimed in the Petition, Bridge said that because of the matters pleaded in this paragraph the electors of the Kimberley District may have been prevented from electing him. The Court of Disputed Returns upheld the appeal by the Labor candidate against the result of the election. A by-election was called and held later that year, but not before there was an outrageous attempt by the government of Sir Charles Court to change the Electoral Act just before the by-election to deny the right to vote of so-called illiterate people. This issue was red hot. In 1977 the Court government tried to change the Electoral Act-just before a by-election which it was forced into by the Court of Disputed Returns-to have the effect of denying illiterate Aboriginal voters a vote in the by-election. It was so red hot that members of his own government crossed the floor in both houses and voted against the legislation. The legislation was defeated. That has not happened very often hi. our history, but that legislation was so red hot that even some of his own - ide would not wear it, and they defeated it. I think it is important to look at some of the historical aspects of the politics of this issue. I implore members of the opposition, and even the Western Australian government, - to keep the cheap politics out of this and to look at the interests of all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians, who by any measure deserve a fair go after 205 years. Let us pass this legislation. I hope that even the Western Australian government concedes that it is in our national interest to have a national set of legislation which will benefit all Australians equally. I comPlend the bill to the House. - Wednesday, 24 November 1993",115
192,Mr STEELE HALL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is time to get the Mabo show on the road. There is far too much uncertainty in the community and a great deal of anxiety among members of the public. In considering this anxiety, one is led to voice these thoughts: what does the public really know about the Mabo situation and native land title, and how many of them would be aware of the detail of the High Court's decision? Having said that, as I am unable to incorporate this document, I intend to take several minutes to read into Hansard the head notes of the justices' decision. I have placed at the head of those clauses my own indexing of those head notes. I quote: Murray Islands not Crown land Held, (1) by Mason C.J., Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and MCHugh JJ., Dawson l dissenting, that the land in the Murray Islands is not ""Crown land"" within the meaning of that term in s.5 of the Land Act. . Meriam people shall have Title (2) By Mason C.l, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and MCHugh lJ., that putting to one side of the Islands of Dauar and Waier, the land leased to the Board of Missions and any land which was validly appropriated for use for administrative purposes the use of which is inconsistent with the continued enjoyment of the rights or privileges of the Meriam people under native title, the Meriam people are entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands of .the Murray Islands. Dawson J. was of the opinion that aboriginal title was a type of occupancy the existence of which depended on the permission of the Crown, the withdrawal of which (which was the same as the extinction of aboriginal title) might be effected by specific legislation or inferred from a course of action by the Crown inconsistent with the continued existence of Aboriginal title; in this case of the native inhabitants which might have existed in the land were not recognized by the Crown or were extinguished by the Crown on annexation. Queensland Parliament may extinguish Title (3) By Mason C.J., Brennan and MCHugh lJ., that the title of the Meriam people is subject to the power of the Parliament of Queensland and the power of the Governor in Council of Queensland to extinguish that title by valid exercise of their respective powers, provided any exercise of those powerS is not inconsistent with the laws of the Commonwealth. Australian sovereignty unquestioned Per curiam. (I) The Crown's acquisition of sovereignty over the several parts of Australia cannot be challenged in an Australian municipal court. (2) On acquisition of sovereignty over a particular part of Australia, the Crown acquired a radical title to the land in that part. Native Title survived acquisition of sovereignty Per Mason C.J., Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and MCHugh lJ. Native title to land survived the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty and radical title. Native Title can be extinguished Per Mason C.J., Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and MCHugh J.J. The acquisition of sovereignty exposed native title to extinguishment by a valid exercise of sovereign power inconsistent with the continued right to enjoy native title. Deane and Gaudron lJ. were of the opinion that extinguishment without clear and unambiguous statutory authorization would found proceedings for compensatory damages provided the proceedings for recovery were instituted within the period presented by applicable limitations provisions. Toohey J. was of the opinion that native title could be extinguished by clear and plain legislation or by an executive act authorized by such legislation, but that the extinguishment would involve a breach of the Crown's fiduciary obligation to the titleholders for which it would be liable to pay compensation or damages. Valid Title extinguishes Native Title Per Mason C.J., Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and MCHugh lJ. Where the Crown has validly alienated land by granting an interest that is wholly or partially inconsistent with a continuing right to enjoy native title, the title is extinguished to the extent of the inconsistency. Deane and Gaudron J.J. were of the opinion that such alienation would be wrongful and would any rights entitle the owners to compensation. Toohey J. was of the opinion that such alienation would be a breach of the fiduciary obligation owed by the Crown to the titleholders for which it would be liable to pay compensation or damages. Crown appropriation extinguishes Native Title Per Mason C.J., Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and MCHugh lJ. Where the Crown has validly and effectively appropriated land to itself and the appropriation is wholly or partially inconsistent with a continuing right to enjoy native title, the title is extinguished to the extent of the inconsistency. Deane and Gaudron lJ. were of the opinion that the appropriation would be wrongful and would entitle the owners to compensation. Toohey J. was of the opinion that the appropriation would be a breach of the fiduciary obligation owed by the Crown to the titleholders for which it would be liable to pay compensation or damages. Native Title is ascertained by laws and customs of indigenous people Per Mason C.J., Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and MCHugh lJ. Native title to particular land (whether classified by the common law as proprietary, usufructuary or otherwise), its incidents and the persons entitled to it are flscertained according to the laws and customs of the indigenous people who, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land. Native Title ceases with loss of customs, or occupation or death Per Mason C.J., Brennan and MCHugh lJ. Native title to an area of land which a clan or group is entitled to enjoy under the laws and customs of an indigenous people is extinguished if the clan or group, by ceasing to acknowledge those laws, and (so far as practicable) observe those customs, loses its connection with the land or on the death of the last of the members of the group or clan. Deane and Gaudron J.l. were of the opinion that such native title is extinguished if the tribe or group becomes extinct or abandons its connection with the land. Semble, the abandonment of traditional customs and ways will not extinguish the native title, at least where the relevant tribe or group continues to occupy or use the land. Native Title inalienable except to Crown Per Mason C.l., Brennan, Deane, Gaudron and MCHugh lJ. Native title over any parcel of land can be surrendered to the Crown voluntarily by all those clans or groups who, by the traditional laws and customs of the indigenous people, have a relevant connection with the land, but the rights and privileges conferred by native title are otherwise inalienable to persons who are not members of the indigenous people to whom alienation is permitted by the traditional laws and customs. Extinguished Native Title over waste land reverts to Crown Per Mason C.l., Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and MCHugh lJ. If native title to any parcel of the waste lands of the Crown is extinguished, the Crown becomes the absolute beneficial owner. Within those relatively short head notes lies the essence of the Mabo judgment. It would be good if all those people who have such strong opinions out in the community could read those simple few sentences and have an understanding of what the judgment is about. In particular, I woul!1 say to some representatives of the mining community that it would be good if they read it and allowed themselves to understand it. I did not appreciate receiving representations and a letter from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (Inc.) from Western Australia telling me a number of things which no manager of a company should believe. It represents the wild opinions held by a large number of people out in the community. For instance, I do not like reading: . Claims have already been made for vast areas of Australia, including major mining projects already in operation and employing thousands of Australians, whose jobs are now threatened. Those claims are not being made under the Mabo legislation, which is not yet passed. The document goes on: . New land for housing, farming, tourist projects and other business enterprises can't now be safely released by State Governments, because of the risk that titles may later be found to be invalid. Look at the breadth of that statement. It does not fit in with the head notes of the justices' decision which I mentioned earlier in my speech. Another section of the document says: Unfortunately, the High Court occupies a privileged position. It is not elected, so ordinary Australians have no say as to who will be the judges. It is almost a statement, rather than an implication, that the judges are enjoying a position which this group does not approve of. It goes on: The Western Australian Government . . . has expressed a will to grant land to Aborigines on the same basis as all other Australians if they agree to forgo 'Native Title' ... How can that be on the same basis as other Australians? It then goes on to talk o(the 11.2 per cent of land in Western Australia already held by Aborigines. It neglects to say that, in terms of agricultural and grazing pursuits, it is the land that has been left after being picked over by settlers since the first settlement of Western Australia. I do not deny that the mining industry has a very legitimate interest in this legislation, but I would like to think that those who make representations will base them on fact and not the fiction that has been presented in this particular document which, as I have said, does no good at all for the reputations of those who wrote it. The fact is that we in this parliament agree on a number of things. It is worth naming the things upon which both sides of this House do agree. We agree that native title exists. We agree that Aborigines should possess and enjoy their native title. We agree that if it is to be taken from them they should be compensated. And we agree that the operation of the management of native title should be subject to the Racial Discrimination Act. That is a large area of agreement between both sides of this House. It, therefore, comes down to the question of how this decision is to be administered. There are of course certain points in the legislation which are .the subject of some very strong opinions. For instance, to name one of interest to me, I believe there has been a disgraceful lack of attention paid to safeguarding those people who might be in the possession of a title and who are subject to a claim. They will have to meet very large legal expenses in legitimately opposing that claim. This bill does not make any definite proposal in that regard; it just allows it to happen. But those people who consider that they may be in a position of opposing a claim would like to know that they will not have to spend their life savings in so doing. I think that is an enormous defect in this bill. The extent of the fund for land acquisition is an unknown factor until funds are put into it. There are many areas of argument concerning important administrative detail, but I have mentioned those main areas on which we agree. So it becomes a matter of how this High. Court decision is to be administered. One can look at this bill-which, like the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), I would like to have supported-and say that it is totally a federal prerogative and that the Commonwealth will be the superior level of government in all of the arrangements; or we can take the view that it is a matter for state authorities to administer land tenure and that they should also administer native title as bestowed by the High Court. There are several problems about that. In 1985, Queensland moved to dispossess the people of the Murray Islands of their title or to ensure that they did not have one. That does not lead one to believe that states wi1l always be sympathetic to the question of native title. Then we come to the question of the Western Australian legislation. I fully understand the desire of Premier Court to make the administration of his government in land tenure, in all of its widest aspects, efficient and certain. There is no doubt he has moved somewhat dramatically to do that. But there is no doubt that, in so doing, he is extinguishing native title. In replacing it with statutory rights, which would then be compensated if they were taken away, is to move that level of compensation down a most significant step beyond the extinguishment of native title which is now, in that process, being accomplished without compensation. It does raise a very big question as to where it stands in the legal sense in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act. I do not think a number of people understand what a dramatic move the Western Australian bill is in removing wholesale a whole range of titles from Australian citizens. If people in their more sober moments thought about this, they would see it as indeed a dramatic move. What if a government of another colour and an.other day, for other reasons, said, 'We will remove a whole swathe of titles from home owners in a city or rural land-holders'? Would it be any more dramatic in personal terms than removing native title without compensation? I think it is a dramatic precedent that could be established here. The fact it will not be done anywhere else means even more that the legislation will ultimately be struck down in a challenge before the High Court as a result of the Racial Discrimination Act. My guess is that the Western Australian legislation will fail and we will be back to perhaps the area of cooperation which the original talks focused on earlier this year. I am very disappointed that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was unable to persuade all of the premiers in Australia into a cooperative scheme. I think that is a significant fault in the Prime Minister's approach to this bill and to this matter. He cannot escape the fact that, as the Prime Minister of this country, with all of the authority of that position and with the authority of the High Court decision itself within his hands, he was unable to procure an agreement between the state premiers on a cooperative basis. However, I believe ultimately this question will get away from the states rights issue, as the state legislation will fail because of matters that I have mentioned. I believe that this bill will pass this parliament. The fact that we vote against it here, in opposition to it, is symbolic since it will pass this House. I believe in all reality that it will pass the Senate. Those who want to rail against it in the larger sense of that document I referred to earlier in my speech do their own case no good because their need, as is a number of other needs in Australia, is to see this bill amended so that it will meet the wide section of needs and the wide set of criticisms to which it is now subject in the community. I see an optimistic future for Aboriginal land rights in relation to native title. I believe that all those who approach this question cannot approach it on the basis that native title is some second-rate title. It will be a title with many variations as to what it will bestow. It could bestow more of that sort of title which the Merian people have where they are entitled, as against the whole world, to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands. There will be more of that, as well as many subsidiary titles which will confer much less. But it is not a second-rate title. No-one can approach this debate and this question believing that. As I said, I believe that in the long run there will be a long road to travel on this question. No doubt, there will be several years of legal challenge. However, I am hopeful for the future and about the optimism which this will give to quite a number of Aboriginal people. I was deeply impressed by the leaders of the Aboriginal people in this negotiation who addressed our party meeting. There can be no-one more Australian than the descendants of those original settlers in this country. I am deeply impressed with their knowledge of their case and their knowledge of their people. I see the future, which will take several generations no doubt, if not longer, to reach the ideal, as a partnership with those original settlers. I trust that when this bill emerges from this parliament it will be in an amended form which will meet the criticisms which have been made of it.",118
193,Mr BEVIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have listened to this debate for the last couple of hours with a good deal of interest. I listened particularly closely to the comments made by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), the vast majority of which I agree with. His somewhat mild criticism of the inability of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to get the agreement of all the state premiers may be somewhat tongue in cheek. I do not think there are many, even amongst the optimists in this place, who would have expected an outcome of agreement with all of the state premiers, given the positions which some of them clearly adopted in advance and in public which made that task not an easy one. I readily acknowledge the sincerity and genuine interest and concern that the honourable member for Boothby has displayed. It stands in some contrast with some of the other contributions I heard a couple of hours ago. I simply point out to honourable members and those following this debate that, if they contrast the speech of the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) earlier this evening with the contribution we have just heard from the honourable member for Boothby, they would understand some of the debates currently raging within the opposition over this issue. The 1992 High Court Mabo decision has begun a very important but long overdue debate in our community and in this parliament. It quite properly put an end to the legal fiction of terra nullius. To suggest, as the courts have done since Federation-and, indeed, prior to that-that when the European fleets arrived here our land was not inhabited or it was inhabited by a life form that did not warrant consideration of ownership is a factual fiction and an affront to any sense of decent human dignity. Nevertheless, it was the legal fiction perpetuated by our courts until 1992 in the Mabo High Court decision, which quite properly has set the record straight and acknowledged that when Europeans arrived on our shores our land was inhabited by indigenous people who did have culture, a sense of community and an ownership of the land, and it recognised, in the case . of the Mer Islands and the Mabo family, an ownership of that land continuing to this day. About 10 years ago I had the opportunity to visit a number of communities in the Cape York area and particularly to visit schools in that region. It was a unique experience which I have held in my memories quite vividly to this day. A number of things stuck in my mind. At the time there was a Queensland National Party government and there was a department which was euphemistically referred to as the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement. It did anything but advance the cause of Aboriginal and Islander people. I well recall the permanent. head of that department, a Mr Killoran, whose habit it was to visit those communities and hand out boiled lollies and beads to the natives. I am talking about events that occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s. That was the practice of the permanent head of a department charged with the responsibility for assisting those indigenous Australians. His view was straight out of the 16th century explorers: give them boiled 10lIies and beads. That is literally what he used to do. I saw those communities and the people who had been dislocated from their traditional homelands, who had literally been herded like cattle to an area which the government decided they would inhabit. These were practices that we adopted not 200 years ago, but 40 or 50 years ago. In fact, when they sought to go back to their traditional homelands, we forced them, like cattle, back into those reserves. a consequence of our actions, we destroyed their culture in a large meas-re. We certainly destroyed their self-respect. Anyone who goes through those communities in the cape, through Edward River, Pormpuraaw, Kowanyama and Bamaga, and sees the range of communities there and the lifestyles they live will see the devastation that those iII-advised policy decisions led to. Understandably, there has been a good deal of comment about the Wes.tern Australian legislation and the position adopted by the Western Australian premier-and so there should be. The Western Australian government and its premier should stand condemned for the fear campaign which it has sought to produce in this campaign. I think probably the worse thing that I have seen during the course of the ·Iast few months of debate on this issue was when the Western Australian premier actually named suburbs in Perth that were going to be subject to Aboriginal land claims. I do not think anyone in this House would be foolish enough to suggest, even at. the outset of this debate, that residential land was about to be taken from underneath people's feet. Yet, for no reason that I can see, other than base, racist motivation or a desire to. instil fear in people, the Western Australian premier decided to pursue a line identifying suburbs ·where people livethe import of his accusation, the inference being that people's homes were going to be taken out from under them. That is a disgraceful position to adopt, yet that is the philosophical position which underpins the Western Australian legislation. It is a sad reflection on the leadership of the opposition that it has deteimined to follow the Richard Court response to the Mabo High Court decision. This issue and this debate is not about guilt; it is about people's rights and important fundamental principles of justice. I want to refer to the .comments of some commentators from backgrounds in social justice .and in legal areas, particularly the churches. A statement was issued in July of this year which. was signed by four Queen's Counsel who were former royal commissioners in the As inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody; the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney; the President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry; the President of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils; the Primate of the Anglican Church; the President of the Lutheran Church; the Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church; the President of the Churches of Christ; the President of the Uniting Church; and a number of other church leaders. They made this comment: This continent once belonged to many Aboriginal peoples. Over two centuries most of it was taken from them piece by piece without compensation. Where this has happened, it cannot now be undone: a new nation has been built and is here to stay. But some groups of Aboriginal people, mostly in remote areas, still have their traditional land. Simple justice requires that we respect their rights, no less than we respect the rights of other Australians who have inherited land. That is a simple enough statement which fairly embodies the key principles that the government has used in crafting this legislacouple tion. In the negotiations, I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) personally demonstrattives ed a commitment to those principles and ensuring that we established legislation which addressed not just the immediate questions of Mabo but provided a foundation for a genuine people debate with indigenous Australians onreconous people. ciliation. There are members of the opposition adhere to the principles enunciated by honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) here tonight-but sadly not all honourshould able members opposite. When it is all stripped away, we are left. with a states rights debate. If we take that view, the situation we confront is states rights versus justice; states rights versus racial equality; states rights versus human rights; and states rights versus individhonourable ual rights. I am quite proud and on the record that whenever I am confronted with those dilemmas I will opt for justice, racial equality, human rights and individual rights every time. I appreciate that the hour is late and couple of other people have yet to speak. want to make a couple of points about specifics in the legislation. Freehold and bill, the council said: residential lease land will extinguish any native title. People need to understand that that is the case. The procedures set out in the bill concerning the mining industry-which ians time does not allow me t- go into at this stage-ensure fair and equitable treatment for native title holders. This procedure will impede the proper development of Australia's mineral resources. It is a balanced view which gives state governments some power at the end of the day to overturn decisions of tribupolitical nals. Similarly, other important industri-s, such as the tourism and pastoral have been properly and adequately addressed in the bill before us. The bill and the principles which the ernment has set out have been endorsed by the leaders of Aboriginal and Islander munities, by church leaders, by most , governments-including some conservative state premiers-and, of course, by the National Fanners Federation. I will quickly read a of comments that have been made by key church groups that should be placed on the record. A joint letter signed by representaof the Assembly of the Uniting Church to , in Australia said, amongst other things: The greatest opportunity that Australia has had to end the process of dispossession of indigenous must not be turned into a legalized dispossesSion and extinguishment of the rights of indigenThat is an important point that those opposite who would do well to accept. The opposition's the fonnula-and Richard Court's fonnula-does precisely what the Uniting Church argues not be the case. The oppqsition's fonnula includes legalised dispossession or extinguishment of those rights. It is wrong and it should not be tolerated. I think that the position the opposition has adopted is inconsistent with the sorts of principles that the member for Boothby quite properpleased to put ly put before the House. The final quote to which I will refer is from the Australian Council of Churches, a group representing a number of denominations, including the Uniting Church, the Baptist a Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the I Religious Society of Friends. On 14 Novemthe ber, in a press release commenting on this ' We've taken a very close look at the principles in the legislation and we believe the government has got the balance right. For the sake of all Australit's time to lay these foundations and move on. It was correct. This is good legislation. It is legislation of which the nation as, a whole can not rightly be proud. I know that the labour movement is proud of it. It is a pity that on this occasion the opposition appears divided and led by people intent on seeking to score points from the current circumstance. In view of the time, I will conclude my industries, remarks there.",122
194,Mr EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, nearly 100 years ago our nation's govforefathers devised a constitution to bring together as a federation the states of the Great comSouthern Land, which we now know as state Australia. They enthused over the many benefits that such a federation would bring to this nation. Many times since that historic occasion those benefits have been realised. Our federation has withstood all attempts bring it down, from the threat of secession Western Australia in 1933 to the dark ages of the Whitlam years in the 1970s. Australia, with its many natural and economic wonders, has taken its place as one of the leaders of Pacific region and is regarded within tional forums with respect for its initiatives and rapid development during this century. Australia-its people,.its institutions and history-is renowned for its fairness and lack of conflict when allowing its people to. commodate those at a disadvantage within the community. We are a nation of supportive people, willing to act to halt any oppression. We have done so proudly many times history. Yet never before in our nation's history has the very foundation of our systems, our heritage and our peaceful enjoyment of country, been under greater threat than now With the introduction of the Native Title Bill. One hundred years after our country's leaders brought us together as one nation we have a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) determined to tear us apart. The threat to our great nation now is the insistence of the Prime Ministerthis intent on taking his place in history-on tearing up our history, its evolution and the prosperity it has brought to all of us. The Natiye Title Bill is an act of community division. Since settlement, Australian Aborigines, our nation's indigenous people, have been treated with discrimination and have been crippled the chains of segregation throughout period of civilisation of this land. One hunpeople. dred years after Federation, Aborigines lead a lonely life of poverty in a vast country wealth. One hundred years after we started talk about one nation, Aborigines languish in the comers of Australian society and find judgment said: themselves exiles within this land, with unacceptable health and education standards and employment opportunities. The majority consensus of Aborigines live in appalling conditions be which no Australians, be they black or white, for should ever accept. In his speech delivered in Redfern last year, the Prime Minister signed a promissory note to the Aboriginal people to which every to Australian was made to feel obligated to pay. by This note was a promise that white Australia would guarantee equal rights to those indigenous people seeking liberty from the shackles of white man's paternalism, offering the the pursuit of happiness through the recognition internaof their culture and heritage. It is obvious tonight as we debate this bill that the Prime Minister and his government its have defaulted on this debt and, in return, have placed a blank cheque on the table. But acthat cheque should be marked 'insufficient funds' because it is a bad cheque. This bill is bankrupt of the justice, equity and human rights which the Prime Minister so comprein our hensively promised last year. . This bill provides no hope to the Aborigine, nor does it allow white Australia to recognise the Aborigine's rights as determined by the our High Court. Most Australians love their country, and although Aborigines surely love their country they love their land even more. It has been suggested by those opposite that we Australians will not enjoy the tranquillity of our country until the Aborigine is granted native title rights. The winds of change on issue shake the very foundation of our country's federation and will do so until the . light of recognition comes from the bright day of justice for our indigenous people. But this bill does not provide such justice. I suggest to those opposite: let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for justice in relation to the Aboriginal people by drinking from the by cup of bitterness and hatred which this bill the will no doubt bring to many Australian We must forever conduct our struggle with this debate on the high plane of dignity of and discipline. Let us all rise to heights to greater than those brought about by the introduction of this bill. Justice Brennan in his There is a need for the community generally to develop its own thinking and to reach a moral .as to the appropriate balance in land use and management. Only then will the Mabo decision the opportunity fora just and proper settlement all Australians and not just for those Aborigines not yet dispossessed of their lands This Native Title Bill will not provide the justice of which the government speaks. It will increase division within the Australian community and it will eventually come back as abacklash to those who support it. We can never accept the brutality imposed upon the Aborigine and the unspeakable horrors of last century. We can never accept the missionary policies of earlier this century where the families of Aborigines were separated and the policies of integration destroyed many Aboriginal cultures. We can never accept the ongoing cultural reduction that the Aborigine is subjected to. We can never accept the lack of employment opportunities for the Aborigine. We can never accept the poor standards in health, education and welfare currently endured by our indigenous people. ' We must never be satisfied. We must never be satisfied with the way in which the people of Australia, black and white, have the conditions of our indigenous people to fall below those acceptable anywhere in our country. Over $1.3 billion is spent within area of Aboriginal affairs policy each year, but still we do not address the' immediate issues of our indigenous people. No black person should ever talk about social justice for his or her people when the continuing demands of fringe dwellers are not by him or her or others associated with this expenditure. I recently visited the community of Ninga Mia in Kalgoorlie to see the poorest area Australia that, I have ever seen.' Where those Aboriginal leaders demanding justice through this bill who allow such a community to exist without adequate basic human rights when $1.3 billion annually is spent? This will not solve the social justice matters so many demand, and apy connection with this issue to this bill is a formula for division because this bill does not provide for these justice issues. i remind those who doubt the integrity on Aboriginal affairs issues that the coalition has a good record on Aboriginal affairs. It was the coalition that initiated carried out the full citizenship referendum for indigenous Australians. It was the coalition that provided broad increases in grant programs for indigenous Australians. It was the coalition that established the Aboriginal affairs department and the Council for Aboriginal Affairs. It was the coalition which was the first to endorse and elect an Aboriginal member of parliament. It was the coalition that initiated the land rights act. The coalition has always had a clear and comprehensive attitude to attainment of social justice for our indigenous' people, and it is wrong for speakers opposite to imply that we are racist and scaremongers. Our conscience is clear on this matter, for we support the existence of native title as defined by the High Court whilst recognising that Aboriginal people have rights of traditional land usesomething which this legislation does not address. It misses the point of what traditional use is all about. It believes it to be freehold title when in fact it is native title allowing allowed and rec?gnising traditional use. The coalition supports the ongoing nondiscriminatory use of the federal Racial the Discrimination Act. The coalition reaffirms the securing of existing title and we assert the rights of states to manage land title. This government bill is bankrupt. It is bankrupt of creativity. It is bankrupt of simplicity. It is bankrupt of compassion and promotes divibeing met sion amongst ,all Australians. This bill will ensure that no-one will be satisfied with it. It will create division amongst white and black Australians, it will of create division amongst the Aboriginal comare munityand it will create division within industry and farming interests. It is proposed by those that do not understand the complexity of Australia and this great 'land. It, is bill proposed by people Who do not understand the differences between, the peoples of. Australia and the variances of its land. It is developed by those that would have Australians tum against Australians and it is pro,posed by those that would have the federation coalition's crumble to its knees. This bill does not address the High Court decision as it goes beyond the principles of and the judgment. It discriminates against the traditional use requirements of Aborigines and will create more heartache and long-term division amongst Australians than is necessary. This bill will not bring Australians together as our forefathers would have had us do. It is a complex formula for trouble which is the base of this government and the Australian Labor Party-the party of rhetoric and inactivity on the real issues of our community. Reconciliation will not come from this bill. Reconciliation will be put back to the end of the issues of importance because of this bill. I am mindful when I say these things that the Aboriginal community is keen to realise some sort of justice from this bill, to satisfy the trials and tribulations which Aborginal people have endured. Some Aborigines want the right of self-determination and some want the persecution of past ages to be recompensed. These people who want justice cry out for the fulfilment of their dreams, to reach the heights of their community goals and to provide their people with the very necessary justice so many Australians want for them. This bill will not provide it. It will destroy dreams, it will create division and it will increase racial intolerance to new levels where the very basis of the Australian compassion will be placed at risk. Why? Because it is wrong. It is impractical and will provide nothing but a complex legal industry which will drive those smaller investors in Australia to other parts of the world more willing to accept their investment. It will not help social justice for Aborigines and it will put back the reconciliation process. The coalition has a faith in the Australian people. It has a faith that reconciliation with our indigenous people will happen. It has a faith that the unacceptable conditions of many of our Aboriginal people will be overcome. It has a faith that true freedom for the Aborigine will be achieved. It has a faith that all Australians, be they white or black, Christian or not, will join together and say without any reprisal, 'I love my country, I love my land and I love my people'. This bill does not provide this. For this reason, I cannot support the discriminatory and divisive bill called the Native Title Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCLeay) adjourned.

This survey does not include the agricultural and community services sectors. As the ABS does not distinguish between tradeables and non-tradeables in its investment data, the various components of investment have been defined as follows: Non-tradeable component of Business Fixed Investment: Finance, Property and Business Services and Other Selected Industries (ie Electricity, Gas and Water, Construction, Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, Transport and Storage) less Other Non-Manufacturing. Tradeable component of Business Fixc::d Investment: Mining, Manufacturing, and Other Non-Manufacturing (including communication, NA commodity tradeable sectors in each year since 1980-81, including estimates for 1992-93. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The estimated levels of investment in the relevant sectors in each year since 1980-81 are shown in the table below: IN CONSTANT PRICES ($M, 1989-90) Tradeable Non-Tradeable Total Commodity Non-Commodity 5594 6208 9598 21400 7706 6068 11145 24919 7330 5163 9850 22343 4409 4927 10784 20120 3637 6220 11632 21489 4700 7284 11733 23717 5358 7784 11769 24910 5119 8547 13451 27116 4951 9255 16358 30564 5070 9151 15774 29995 5756 8039 13869 27664 5647 6869 10496 23012 5264 7551 9801 22616 entertainment, recreation, restaurants. hotels and personal services). Commodity component of Tradeable Investment: Mining and Basic Metal Products. Non-commodity component of Tradeable Investment: Manufacturing (excluding Basic Metal Products) and Other Non-Manufacturing. The above figures should be interpreted as a broad guide to, rather than as precise estimates of, the composition of investment. Data limitations preclude a more detailed breakdown of the available industry groupings. The Private New Capital Expenditure survey does not provide constant price data by industry. Industry estimates derived for the construction of the above categories have been compiled by Treasury applying a weighted average of the two asset-type denators· (buildings and structures; equipment, plant and machinery) . to the current price industry estimates. This methodology means that there can be a small discrepancy between published constant price total investment and the sum of estimated tradeable and non-tradeable investment for each year.
