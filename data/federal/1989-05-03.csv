2,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"1 welcome the opportunity of leading the Opposition's contribution on the Audit Amendment Bill. It is basically a housekeeping Bill in the sense that it picks up a number of small oversights and makes a few changes, minor changes in most cases. Against that background, we are not, obviously, opposing the Bill, although I shall be moving an amendment to the motion for the second reading to raise a couple of issues in the area of public sector auditing which I believe are particularly important. I hope that this is the last time we will have to do a bandaid job on this legislation. The Audit Act is one of the oldest Acts of the Parliament, brought in in 1901, and there is a desperate need to reconsider the overall Act. As part of my amendment, I shall be foreshadowing the idea, which has been picked up by a recent study by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, effectively to put a case for repealing the Act and replacing it with two separate Acts, one in relation to the activities of financial administration and the other in relation to the activities of the Australian Audit Office. Unfortunately, these two things have been put into this legislation over the years and it has become a very cumbersome piece of legislation that has been excessively amended and is now quite out of touch both with the processes of government and with the requirements of an independent auditor at the public level. It is against that background that I particularly endorse the thrust of many of the recommendations of the recent Joint Committee of Public Accounts study entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament. I will direct some remarks to that in a moment. I also commend the Government on the treatment of this Bill, in the sense that it was prepared to delay the consideration of it until the report of the Joint Committee was brought down. I believe that the Government will be moving an amendment at some point which picks up an outstanding matter of disagreement between that Committee and the Auditor-General, which I too will welcome. The Bill contains provisions divided effectively under two heads: what I might loosely call finance amendments and audit amendments. The finance amendments relate to the Minister for Finance and his financial admiriistration of the Department of Finance, and the audit amendments relate to the activities of the Auditor-General and certain of his audit procedures and the scope of those audits. Many of the clauses are minor housekeeping changes. I will direct my comments to those two aspects of the Bill separately, and begin with the finance amendments. Basically, I do not have any particular need to comment on clauses 3, 4, 5, 6, 15 and 23. They all seem to be fairly sensible changes. In most cases they either pick up an earlier oversight-for example, as in relation to the treatment of the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in terms of his responsibility for the financial management of the service-or they clarify some inconsistencies or misunderstandings in the present legislation that relate to things like the operation of bank accounts under sections 21 and 20, and so on. The two finance amendments that I wish to say something about relate to clauses 7 and 24. Clause 7 is important. It emphasises how the passage of time has left this Act out of touch with the processes of goverriment. Clause 7 enables the Minister for Finance to direct that moneys appropriated to one parliamentary department should, on the transfer of functions, be transferred to the parliamentary department gaining those functions. Also the clause enables the. Minister to give directions which apply retrospectively or reduce amounts previously transferred. Is it a commentary on the sad state of the Bill that it does not allow the possibility for these sorts of directions for transfer of functions between parliamentary departments to occur? It is a basic feature of government today that governments tend to restructure the public sector and its departmental responsibilities when they move in. Although the Act relates to departments of state it does not relate to parliamentary departments. It is a difficult process. If we are trying to shift the parliamentary functions close to the end of the financial year, and the transfers are made on the basis of estimates which are subsequently found to have been inappropriate, there is need for retrospective adjustment in that sense. It is a logical change and it should be welcomed. The key thrust of the amendment is that it will allow transfers to be corrected and fine tuned. In that sense it promises better accountability to Parliament in that departmental expenditures will be more accurately identified. One would have to endorse that strongly. Clause 24 is designed to allow regulations to be made which give legal backing to guidelines given by a Minister on matters within that Minister's responsibility. This is probably the most controversial of the finance amendments presently before us. As I understand it, it has arisen out of some controversy between the Department of Finance and the Department of Administrative Services as a result of the Government's recent decision to streamline purchasing procedures. As I understand it, Administrative Services wanted the power to make its own finance regulations. Not unnaturally, Finance was reluctant to concede that sort of power. It believes, I gather, that it would be inappropriate to break up the process of finance legislation and hand it back to separate Ministers. The Department of Finance has maintained that if Administrative Services wants such a power to make finance regulations it should seek to do so under its own Act, rather than forcing a break-up of this Act. In those terms I read clause 24 very much as a compromise in the sense that it involves the introduction of a new section of the Act which will enable the regulations to authorise a Minister to issue guidelines on any policy matters which have a service-wide financial application for which that Minister is responsible. As such, it provides direct legal backing under the regulation to guidelines given by Ministers. In a broader sense this amendment should emphasise to the Parliament and departments the fact that Ministers who are responsible for particular policies need to have the necessary statutory clout for those policies to be taken account of by officers in other departments. As an example, I cite the Australia Made campaign. I move on to the second set of amendments to the Bill, the audit amendments. Again, I find most of these-with two exceptions-generally uncontroversial. In that sense I do not want to make any comments on clauses 8 to 14, 16, 18 and 20; I would rather concentrate my remarks on clauses 21 and 22. These clauses have in effect been taken up in more or less a direct way by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its report on the activities of the Auditor-General. I will make some comments in that context as well. Clause 21 is designed to provide that, where the Auditor-General audits the financial statements of a body, the Auditor-General shall also audit and report to the Minister administering that body on the financial statements of a subsidiary company of that body. This is a particularly important provision; it raises the issue of the mandate of the Auditor-General, and his mandate in terms of the full extent of departmental and government business enterprises as well as statutory authorities and subsidiaries which should fall within the domain. Recently, there has been a trend on the part of some statutory authorities and other government business enterprises to move away from public sector to private sector auditors. This seems to be a matter of great concern to the Auditor-General, as I have read not only in the Joint Committee of . Public Accounts report but also on many occasions in the newspapers. This issue will be one of the key elements of the Public Accounts Committee report that will require attention. In a housekeeping sense, this amendment moves ·just a short way towards what appears to be the objective of the Auditor-General in this respect. This makes it mandatory for subsidiaries to be audited, as well as the pa:rent company, but it applies only to subsidiaries acquired after the commencement of the operation of this provision and thus does not disturb present arrangements. However, I believe that the proposals of the Public Accounts Committee will involve a disturbance of present arrangements-and I will come back to that matter later. The second reading speech clearly pointed out: It is anticipated that unless there are exceptional circumstances the Auditor-General will carry out both the Audit Act and companies legislation requirements concurrently. In normal circumstances it is not expected that an auditor other than the Auditor-General would be appointed to report under the companies legislation. In a sense, in this provision the Auditor-General is seeking to restrict access to outside auditors in relation to subsidiaries that are established in the future. This potentially, of course, raises the important principle of choice between outside auditors and the Auditor-General. The private sector accounting firms are obviously seeing this as the thin end of the wedge, a wedge which I suggest has been widened quite dramatically by the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I will come back to this point. The other clause in the audit area on which I want to comment is clause 22, and this involves indemnifying the Auditor-General and his or her officers against liabilities arising out of civil proceedings in relation to things properly done in the normal course of duty. I guess that in a sense this clause mirrors the indemnity insurance which a company auditor would obtain. This issue has received quite a lot of attention in the profession in recent years. This raises the question of whether the Auditor-General should be required to take indemnity insurance so that he is put on an equal footing when competing with private sector auditors. Apparently, the amendment is based on legal advice that such indemnity is desirable although it seems that at present there are no specific circumstances that necessitate this amendment. The measure was originally recommended by John Monaghan in his 198485 report. I gather that such instances have arisen overseas, and in that sense this is an anticipatory clause. However, it may have a particular significance in the context of a generalised broadening of the mandate of the Auditor-General-and I will refer to this again in a moment. By formally including such a provision in the Act the Auditor-General would no longer need to rely on what would be, essentially, a grace and favour decision of the Executive Government, and it could be more consistent with the independent status of the Auditor General. Clearly, indemnity would not be available for acts or omissions made in bad faith. Against that background, and in foreshadowing some of my amendments, I shall now move on to make some general comments on this very useful report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, entitled, as I have said, The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament. I begin by congratulating the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) and his Committee on this report. It is about time in a sense, as I said before. It raises many of the key issues that need to be considered, I believe, in considering the proper role for the Auditor-General and the accountability of government departments and agencies to the Parliament. I had the privilege of serving on that Committee in its early days. I am familiar with some of the early work but did not have the benefit of participating in many of the public meetings and discussions that subsequently took place. On reading large parts of the report I gather that it has been a very productive exercise for all those involved. I should begin by generally endorsing the principal aim of the report. The report basically was prepared to examine the role and condition of the Australian Audit Office. The report argues: . . . a strong Australian Audit Office is essential for maintenance of the accountability of the Federal Government organisations and officials to Parliament. The statutory relationship between the Auditor-General and Parliament, which has not changed since Federation, needs major revision to reflect, first, the evolution of government in the 88 years since Federation, and second, evolution in the role of audit. The intention is to add meaning to Parliament's status as the Auditor-General's client. Therefore, fundamental to reform of the Audit Office is establishment of a better foundation for relations between the Audit Office and the Parliament. One can only endorse the sentiment as summarised at the beginning of the report. On that basis the report then addresses the question of what should be the limits of the Auditor-General's responsibilities and for which Federal Government organisations he should be the external auditor. There is quite a large number of recommendations which generally, I suppose, endorse. Obviously strongly endorse the idea, as I said before, splitting the Audit Act, effectively repealing the current Act and replacing it with two separate Acts. Some of the proposals for establishment of a parliamentary committee and an advisory panel and the establishment of the Auditor-General as a statutory thority with a statutory appointment and on are generally in the right direction and would significantly improve the status of the Auditor-General vis-a-vis Parliament. I also welcome some of the comments the report on the additional weight to· be given to the user pays principle in deterthat mining the allocation of resources Auditor-General, although I wonder whether the Auditor-General is really yet in a posithe tion to be able effectively to cost his audits in the full sense of that word. These are issues that are raised in the report but are probably not dealt with in sufficient detail for the Government to make some of the decisions it might have to in due course. I was somewha- surprised at the audit cycle that was foreshadowed in terms of the Audit Office adopting a broad cycle for grams with expenditure or revenue greater than $10m. It proposed to have a 20-year cycle for government companies, a 10-year cycle for statutory authorities, a five-year cycle for departmental commercial undertakchoice ings, a five-year cycle for department outriGeneral ders and a three-year cycle for departments. It· is interesting; to my mind, that the Audiworry, tor-General wants to increase substantially his role vis-a-vis government companies, tutory authorities and subsidiaries but. the cycle seems amazingly long in its duration for there to be an adequate reporting. A of government enterprises, even if they are maintained essentially fully within the sector, can go through substantial change a period of 20 years. I just note some reseras saying: vations about the way that at least part of the report was prepared. Whilst I make some of those sorts of eral comments on some of the earlier recI ommendations of the report, I think the key thing to comment on is probably what will be the most difficult issue. That will be the question of the mandate of the Auditorit General. It is summarised in the summary in I recommendations 19 to 25. In that regard I I would like to make some comments on the of related issue of contracting audit services to the private sector. I think this will be an issue which will generate a considerable the amount of heat-if I could put it that bluntly-in the future from both sides. I have read something of a campaign in a lot auof public forums and accounting magazines so and so on that the Auditor-General should make a very strong case as to why the bulk of activities of government should be brought under his control. I am now perceiving an in equally strong case from the accounting professions on the other side who are feeling they have identified a new area into by the which they would like to go. Public sector auditing is becoming one of growth areas of the accounting profession. Some of the recommendations of the Committee in that sense are seen as a giant step backwards and likely to freeze out accountants from the auditing of companies and agencies which stay essentially within the government sector. From our side, the process of privatisation would greatly change the nature of that. Privatising a whole range proof presently government-owned corporations would really put them genuinely in the private sector and leave their management the choice as to where they got their auditor from. In a sense they would not have the of choosing between the Auditorand the private sector in those terms. Neither would the Auditor-General need to because in most cases the allocation of government funds to those organisations stawould cease or significantly cease. I can understand the point of view of the Auditor-General that he wants to be the key lot link in the chain from government enterprises to the Parliament in an auditing sense. public The current Attorney-General, Mr John in Taylor, was reported in the New Accountant Where the government has an interest in an entity the Australian Audit Office should have a central genrole to play in the accountability chain. can understand that that is his primary interest. I am not sure whether it should be put as any interest of the Government in those organisations or whether at some point should be narrowed down to the position of a majority interest; but I can understand his point of view. But I wonder whether he has really thought through the practicalities of trying professionally to audit organisations which in many cases are becoming increasingly private sector oriented, particularly in circumstances where, as he admits, he has had very real problems hiring the appropriate staff and keeping pace with the profession in terms of the people who are able to be hired and trained within his office. I can understand the point of view of private sector auditors who would be a bit upset at the prospect of losing that potential growth area, but I equally wonder whether they have thought through some of the fundamental difficulties that they will have to address in converting, in effect, standard private sector audit and accounting techniques in a way that would prove useful to meeting the requirements of parliament and the issue of accountability of public money. These issues are fundamentally important. They are dealt with to some extent in this report, and there is limited literature on some of these issues. However, it is an area which will need a lot more attention and discussion before the Government· ultimately takes this report into account and brings forward legislation, which I would urge it to do quite quickly. I was interested in some of these arguments being addressed in a recent brief article by an old academic friend from the University of New South Wales, Bob Walker, in the New Accountant on 9 March of this year. He raises some of these questions, prior to the report hitting the deck, as to the different problems that will confront both sides as they try to address these issues and meet a sensible outcome. I will quote what is very much a summary quote from that article where Professor Walker says: . . . the reconstitution of public bodies as corporations may be accompanied by significant changes in the nature of audit work, and the type of audit work that will be delivered to parliaments (and hence placed on the public record). ""Corporatisation"" may lead to standard form audit reports that simply report on whether financial statements provide a true and fair view. It seems highly unlikely that those audit reports will report on unauthorised expenditure, fraud, internal control weaknesses, or the adequacy of accounting records-let alone on efficiency and effectiveness of management. In that brief point I think Professor Walker summarises the essence of the issue-that the interests of Parliament and the normal checks and balances that might be appropriate.in the private sector may prove to be insufficient when one is auditing government expenditure or funds allocated through government. When taxpayers' funds are involved, the form of accountability to parliament could be quite different. I think it is interesting that in this report Professor Walker also cautions the profession on the extent to which it has rushed into the idea of public sector auditing in the following terms: Finally, while some elements in the profession have been swift to promote the idea of private sector involvement in public sector audits, little concern seems to have been given to insulating an auditor from pressure. I think that one of the very interesting issues which will emerge in the course of this debate is the extent to which the Auditor General would feel the need to maintain a watchdog role over any private sector auditors involved. This may call for some very interesting discussions during the process of establishing these audits. In this context I want to go back to sO!l1e of the specific recommendations which have been made and to which I referred in recommendations 19 to 25 of the report. I refer particularly to the concepUhat exists in this report that, in a couple of cases, although the Auditor-General should be reinstated as the external auditor of, say, statutory marketing authorities or of most government companies, the possibility exists for contracting out those services to private sector auditors. I do not know whether this is a genuine intentlon on the· part of the Committee. There is not a lot of debate on the pros and cons in the Committee report as I read it. Some of the arguments are put there. I would obviously strongly endorse consideration of the possibility of a lot of contracting out on this basis. I think it would be an interesting test for the Auditor-General's Office to actually sit down and specify the precise terms and conditions of the audit that it wants carried out by the private sector agencies. In that sense, it could force the changes in accounting stanqards and techniques which might currently apply in the private sector to fit more appropriately the requirements of the Auditor-General himself and the need for accountability to parliament. I - hould also refer to the other point which was emphasised by Professor Walker:.that in setting up some of the. audit contracts it may be important that private sector auditors seek particular terms which would minimise some of their concerns about undue pressure which might be brought to bear during the course of an audit or the concern . th-tperhaps their work would be assessed and publicly reported to Parliament in a way which gives them very little direct opportunity to defend th-mselves. In this report ProfeSsor Walker further states; The Auditor of a Government owned company about to be sacked can hardly mount an effective appeal to the body of shareholders if the shares are predominantly held by the Minister (as nominee fqr the Government), The professional bodies have been enthusiastic in seeking wider access to public sector work, but do not appear to have considered the pitfalls, Against that background, Professor Walker suggests that perhaps there should be special terms for contractual arrangements in terms of the audit of government owned corporations, which could address some of the potential difficulties' before they become problems. He cites the example that in the engagement letter one could grant the auditor the right to report directly to Parliament in extreme circumstances, To summarise, I am very much attracted to many of the ideas put forward in the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I am strongly attracted to the idea of giving the Auditor-General a central role in the chain of accountability to Parliament and I understand the position which he has to maintain in that respect in terms of a full ,reporting to Parliament of the activities of government at all levels. I would also strongly urge consideration of th- process of contracting out and, in, that respect, the - efinition of the conditions, At this stage, I formally move the following amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to 'substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that: (I) in view of the archaic nature of the existing Audit Act, consideration be given to repealing the Act and replacing it with two separate Acts, one relating to financial administration and the other to the activities of the Australian Audit Office; and. (2) in reviewing the legislation, the Government should, as a matter of priority, consider the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its recent report The 'Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament """,10
3,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ruddock-I second the amendment.,15
4,Mr BRUMBY,Unknown,"It is my pleasure to support this legislation before the House. The Audit Amendment Bill, as has been noted by the previous 'speaker, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr , Hewson), amends the Audit Act 1901, and it is that Act which sets the fundamental framework .for Commonwealth' financial administration. It, is worth emphasising that not one, cent of public money is spent or raised in Australia without the provisions of , the Audit Act c,oming' into effect, and they cqme into effect to ensure that there, is proper accounting and auditing of those transactions. I mentioned that .the Audit Act was enacted in 1901. It is a matter of some note that the Audit Act was one of the earliest pieces of legislation passed in the Federal Parliament. My research indicates that it was the fourth, Bill to be passed in that first Parliament. Since that time it has been pro' gressively updated to take account of contemporary developments in sound financial o management and the evolution of accounting and. auditing standards. So the Audit Act is an important Act. Governments cannot spend or raise money without the Audit Act coming into play and it was one of the earliest pieces of legislation passed in our first Parliament. The proposal- contained in the Bill now before us continue in that pattern and tradition. The Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) stated in his second reading, speech that the principal ' ' amendments proposed here are to improve the administrative procedures, followed by departments, make arrangements for signing audit reports, enhance the Auditor-General's powers to undertake audits and indemnify the Auditor-General and his or her staff. In a nutshell, that is the proposal which we have before the House at the present time. The provisions of the Audit Act, as I said, are the cornerstone of public accountauditor ability for the financial activities of government ment. Since governments have no money of their own, merely what they acquire through taxes and other charges from the communiform ties which they govern, it is the safeguards contained in the Audit Act that compel govthat ernments to make their financial transactions visible, available and public. It is that visibiloffice ity which allows governments to be called account publicly for their actions actions in their stewardship of the public purse. That is probably the most important point that can be made about the Audit Act. In order to be judged on that stewardship, is essential that parliaments acknowledge need for a strong, professional and, most importantly of all, independent auditorreport general's office. . The amendments to this Bill are well in keeping with that principle. For example, this Bill will enhance the independence the Auditor-General from the Executive Government by providing him with a statufunctions tory indemnity from liability that may. arise in connection with the proper exercise of functions. At present, that indemnity would be given merely at the discretion of a govments. ernment should the situation arise. As the honourable member for Wentworth pointed out in his contribution, under the present situation-we are talking about clause 22 of the Bill-a payment made by a government would essentially be a payment simply grace and favour nature. These amendments will ensure tQat a suitable indemnity providepartments sion is inserted in the legislation, thereby guarapteeing the independence of the be Auditor-General. There is a further provision allow the Auditor-General to undertake project performance audits. These audits are aimed at examining and reporting on the efficiency and economy of particular tions of a department or agency but they are undertaken without the heavy formality full scale efficiency audit. Project performrangements. ance audits will be on a smaller scale than efficiency audits and will represent a most useful addition to the Auditor-General's mandate for improving accountability in the public sector. The Bill's provisions regarding who should audit the subsidiaries of a parent have body for whom the Auditor-General is the should also reinforce the achieveof proper levels of accountability. It will mean that the parent body, for example, cannot create a subsidiary company to perfunctions outside the scope of the Auditor-General's purview. Let us not forget the Auditor-General is required to be accountable for the resources that hIs or her consumes. So the Auditor-General's to office itself must be subject to audit by an and transexternal auditor. This Bill includes some clarifications and adjustments of existing provisions. Again, it is fully consistent with the philosophical it thrust of the Audit Act. The Bill also clarithe fies and streamlines a range of financial administration issues, including the ability to more accurateiy to parliament the actual proportions of expenditures that fall between departments affected by administrative arrangement orders- I am referring to of the proposed amendments to section 35A of the Act. In the past other departmental have been moved around between departments and it has been necessary to his transfer funds quickly ftom, as I describe them, losing departments to gaining departIt has generally been impossible to split the appropriated funds accurately. As a result, the appropriation wash-up has finished . looking somewhat distorted and has been of little use to Parliament in its important oversighting role. The amendments conof a tained in this Bill will allow for the retrospective splitting of appropriations of affected by administrative arrangement orders so that the Parliament· can provided with an accurate picture of what actually occurred. Again, it is a good and which will common sense provision. The same sorts of issues apply to any realignment of functions with the parliamentary departments. There is an added complioperacation there in that parliamentary departments are not subject to orders by the of a Governor General for administrative arThe Bill seeks to accommodate that deficiency by specifically allowing the formal involvement of the President and the Speaker in the function splitting process of the departments of the Parliament as a trigger for the reallocation of their appropriated funds. One of the more interesting provisions in this Bill is the proposal to give statutory recognition to gui<;ielines on certain policy matters which a Minister might issue. By allowing regulations which would compel of-cers to have regard to policy guidelines Issued by a relevant Minister it will add certainly a strength and a consistency to the standard of administration for dealing with those areas of activity. At the same time, it will send the right signals to people such as contractors, suppliers and so on that the policy frameworks in which they operate in their dealings with the Commonwealth will be much more open and, in a sense, more accountable. It is sending a signal. It will add s-me strength and consistency. It will proVIde a better message. Again, that is consistent with the major objectives of the Audit Act. One of the matters that the honourable member for Wentworth dealt with for some time was the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled The Auditor General: Ally of the People and Parliament. It is a very good report. The honourable member for Wentworth debated at some length recommendations 19 to 25 of the report. Those recommendations deal with the question of the mandate of the Auditor General. Basically, the view put by the honourable member for Wentworth was that he would like to see a lot more contracting out of Auditor-General services, which is consistent with what he described as the Opposition's philosophical move towards privatisation. I do not think it is appropriate ?uring . de-at- on a Bill of this type to go mto pnvattsahon at length, but I simply point out to the honourable member for Wentworth that the report to which he referred was a joint parliamentary committee report of the House and the Senate and that the recommendations made in it-Mr Ruddock-You are not being political, are you?",15
5,Mr BRUMBY,Unknown,"No. The recommendations contained in the report had unanimous support. If one reads recommendations 19 to 25, one will be left in no doubt that the Committee took the view that the mandate of the Auditor-General ought to be extended, and so too ought the resources available to it. If one reads the summary of the recommendations at the introduction of the report, one will note also that it refers to some reduction in resources to the Office of the Auditor-General over the past decade and improved efficiency which has occurred as a result of those changes in resources. I point out for the benefit of the honourable member for Wentworth that the recommendations are unanimous, and they suggest a stronger mandate for the Auditor-General. In addition, they recommend that the Auditor-General's scope for auditing of, for instance, statutory marketing authorities should be re-extended. I believe that the provisions in the Bill before the House deserve to be accepted because, as I have said, they are intended to improve the efficiency and accountability of the public sector in line with current standards. In my view, they will certainly add to the strength with which a government should be prepared to conduct its financial affairs. I support the legislation and hope that it has a speedy passage through the House.",17
6,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"1 hope that my speech on the Audit Amendment Bill will not strike a discordant note, but I have some observations to make which will reflect somewhat upon the comments of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) and the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). I do not think that either of them has readily understood what was intended by the part of the Public Accounts Committee report entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament on which they both endeavoured to join issue-that is, the section dealing with mandate. While the honourable member for Bendigo remains in the chamber, let me help him by saying clearly that there is nothing in the report that would suggest that the Public Accounts Committee had a view on the policy question as to whether privatisation was desirable. Mr Martin-Nor should it.",17
7,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,And nor-should it. Mr Brumby-I didn't suggest it did.,17
8,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"The honourable member was suggesting that the honourable member for Wentworth was advocating an approach which involved privatisation and that we might look at this report in the context of an enhanced role for the Auditor General, recognising that it was a bipartisan report and that that was in some ,way in opposition to the approach that he wanted to take, which involved greater privatisation. I am making the point that the Public Accounts Committee did not have a view on the question of privatisation. That is a policy question. The Public Accounts Committee mandate goes to the whole question of administration. I think it is important that the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who I hope is listening to my comments, appreciate that chapter 8, which deals with the Audit Act and the Companies Act and codes, was written in the context of a view about the role of the Auditor-General and his accountability and his role in the accountability chain. I think it is important that .the fundamental principles that were addressed in this report be understood, because we wanted responsibility for the Auditor-General out of the Executive and put clearly in the hands of the Parliament, so that the Auditor-General's role and appointment would clearly be seen in terms of accountability to the Parliament and not to the Executive, which comes out of this Parliament. Once we understand that point, I think the further. steps follow quite clearly, because if the Auditor-General is responsible to Parliament and he is fulfilling a role as a parliamentary officer, then our view-and it was a bipartisan view, as the honourable member said-was that whether we go down the privatisation road, whether we use corporations or statutory authorities, the Parliament, in pursuing the whole question of accountability through the Auditor-General, has supervision of the whole range of authorities and bodies and ensures that they are accountable to the Parliament. We were not against the use of private sector auditors. In fact, we specifically provided that private sector auditors ought to be able to be engaged, but that they ought to be. engaged within that accountability chain. In other words, the Auditor-General himself would make increased use of private sector auditors, but in terms of the accountability chain we would ensure that in carrying out that function the private sector people were supervised by the Auditor-General in relation to the ,particular standards that we expect in the public sector area. Last night I spoke in the Parliament on another Bill, which will establish as a corporation a government statutory body-the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. The Government has determined that the Auditor-General will not have a role in relation to the auditing of that new corporation, so a private sector auditor will be engaged to audit it. If we in the Parliament had a view about the use of tax havens, we could well find that under the arrangements that have been put in place, using private sector. standards, an organisation with extensive overseas work could well be using tax havens with advice from private sector accountants which the Parliament would not find out about until it became a scandal in its own right. One might expect that audits sup-rvised by the Auditor-General would ensure that a matter. of that sort, where we expect accountability to the Parliament, was properly addressed. The report was not about whether we are in favour of privatisation. If an organisation were ultimately privatised, of course it would go down the private sector route and use the Companies Code and appoint its own auditors. Then the responsibility would be to its shareholders. But while the shareholders are the people of Australia, through the Government, we are saying that accountability in those circumstances is absolutely essential. I think my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth misunderstood it, and the honourable member for Bendigo, in trying to make a political point about privatisation, also misunderstood it. Let us understand what this Bill is about, because I want to raise a major matter which I do not think has been addressed in the speeches we have heard to date. When I said that I would strike a discordant note, I suppose I meant I would do so in raising a fresh issue. This Bill, the purposes of which were clearly set out in the explanatory memorandum and addressed by the Minister for Employment aQd Education Services (Mr Duncan) ,in his second reading speech, is essentially a technical Bill to deal with minor reforms that can be put in place before the major questions-which the Public Accounts Committee has raised-are addressed at some time in the future. Honourable members have within spoken about the Public Accounts CommitI tee report because they think there is not much in this Bill to address-it deals with technical matters. All too often when we deal with technical matters, when people tell us that they are technical matters and when we are briefed on these as techniauthorise cal matters by the Auditor-General and the ters Department of Finance, we accept them at they their word. I certainly did. I am therefore alarmed, quite frankly, that notwithstanding Ministers. all the talk that we get about public accountability, implementation of other government programs is being undertaken by the addition The of certain clauses in this Bill, the implication tions of which have not been explained to tions us. I became aware of this only two days ago work, in the context of a Public Accounts Comgeneral mittee review relating to consultants when 'Guidelines' we started dealing with the Government's purchasing arrangements-a program which involves $8 billion of government funds. that public hearing we found out that a review of government purchasing arrangetions ments was announced last year. In relation to that review, and putting in place government ment decisions arising from it, important forms were to take place in terms of either amendments to the Audit Act to facilitate the removal of the regulatory power for ernment purchasing and the substitution new arrangements by the use of the issue guidelines. I asked rather innocently in those public hearings when we might see the amendments to the Audit Act to give effect to these decisions, and I was told that they were already before the Parliament. So I scurried to my amendment Bill and found the last clause, clause 24, 'Guidelines by looked through the Minister's speech to find what he had said about clause 24. In quick reading I could not find anything, but if the Minister, in replying, would like address my attention to where such combility ments appear in that speech, I would be grateful for his advice because I had diffiinvolving culty in finding them. In the explanatory memorandum I find these statements under the heading 'General outline': Enable regulations to be made to give legal backing to guidelines given by a Minister on matters that Minister's responsibilities (clause 24). go to the paragraph dealing with 'Guidelines by Ministers' in the explanatory memorandum, to find out what it is all about. I we' find that find that it says: This clause proposes' the inclusion of a new section in the Act which will enable the regulations to a Minister to issue guidelines on any matfor which that Minister is responsible (provided are matters on which regulations may be given). The purpose of this clause is to give direct legal backing in the regulations to guidelines given by It all sounds innocent enough. It continues: basic legal framework for financial administrato which, by law, officers must conform, is the Audit Act, and the Finance Regulations and Direcmade pursuant to the Act. Within the mandatory constraints of that frameit is also proper to augment it by the issue of guidance from time to time in the form of on particular matters on which the Audit Act impinges . . . When we read all that it sounds innocent In enough. But when we understand the framework, we find that matters on which regulaare made, dealing with government purchasing at this time, in which the Parliahas a role, where regulations have to rebe put to it, laid on the table and can be allowed or disallowed, are to be substituted. That is what it is really about, begovcause in any matter upon which regulations of may be made, the regulations are taken out of and the Minister now issues guidelines. The only time when the Parliament will have a role is when the regulations are made to give the Minister power to make guidelines. From then on, the Parliament is not involved at all. That is the crux of the matter. So in the accountability chain, the Parliament is written out and it is left in the hands of MinisMinisters'. I ters to write guidelines. This happens at a time when a number of my us on the Public Accounts Committee are concerned about this very question which we to have all talked about today-the accountaof this Parliament for government ex.penditure, and a program of expenditure $8 billion to' substitute guidelines for regulations. We are all talking about public accountability at the very time when we have before us information that suggests that those who are at the pinnacle of responsibility do not appreciate their responsibility to parliament. I know that not everybody reads the Canberra Times, and that probably fewer people read the Hansard of the Public Accounts Committee and have any appreciation of the issues which are being addressed from time to time, but let me encourage honourable members to look at the Canberra Times of yesterday. There are two items which honourable members ought to look at. One is an article by Dr Keating, the head of the Department of Finance. The heading reads, 'Purpose rather than process-now the bureaucratic creed'. He talks about the new management style that we are getting in the Public Service. We have heard a great deal about letting the managers manage. He makes these statements about public accountability: Much greater emphasis is being given to improving program performance and effectiveness. Public accountability is being enhanced through the upgrading of departments' annual reports and explanatory notes to estimates- . that is the method by which we are getting greater and enhanced accountabilityprincipally by reporting on a program basis with measures of program performance. This should improve the quality of public Qebate, including most importantly, scrutiny by the Parliament. The enhanced responsibility of departments which has accompanied the removal of central agency controls has also meant that departments can reasonably be required to live within their budgets. Cash limits now apply and are quite deliberately intended to make the managers manage and to accept the responsibility that has now been given to them. At the same time, an article on the front page of the same paper, with the heading 'PS heads ""breached their Act"" "" states: Up to half the Secretaries of Commonwealth Departments were gUilty of breaching the Government's guidelines on annual report and therefore the Public Service Act . . . In the one breath we have the head of the Department who is responsible for these reforms saying that we will get greater accountability through annual reports; in another breath the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has endorsed and circulated guidelines to all Government departments seeking responses in relation to reports of the Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee dealing with the employment of consultants. The guidelines by which accountability is to be given to this Parliament are clear and precise. Up to half of the secretaries of the Commonwealth departments are guilty of breaching those guidelines. That matter will be the subject of a separate review and undoubtedly of a report by the Public Accounts Committee to this Parliament. We will have a better understanding of how those breaches have occurred and what excuses are being mounted in relation to the issue. It goes to the very point that I am raising. If we are serious about public accountability, those who are at the pinnacle have a responsibility to ensure that that accountability is given to the Parliament. We, as parliamentarians, are entitled to know whether there is real accountability. I should not have to ferret around at public hearings to find out what is intended by a clause in a Bill. It should not be a matter of somebody having to raise an issue because it was not mentioned in the Minister's second reading speech. I said that might strike a discordant note, but why was not this issue clearly addressed? Regulations which require the Parliament to perform a role are being substituted directly with guidelines which Ministers can issue. Ministers do not have to tell the Parliament what the nature of those guidelines is. I regard this as a major issue. I am sorry that I have had to raise it without giving notice even to my colleagues, but it is an issue that the Parliament needs to address before this Bill wends its path through the Senate. I hope that the Government· will have another look at it. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate ask questions about this issue themselves and that there will be an opportunity to address those questions in the light of public accountability. Everybody is feeling quite glib about this issue; the expectations are high. But the performance of those who are charged with specific responsibility under the Public Service Act has recently been found wanting. I have not found other aspects of the Bill on which I want to demur. There are some useful proposals in it. The Public Accounts Committee looked at the Bill and endeavoured to facilitate certain additional changes to assist the Auditor-General, dealing with the way in whiCh the Parliament might be informed about minor breaches of the law which he comes across in the course of his inquiries. We still want to be informed about those matters, but we have hit upon a compromise which is very helpful. I hope that this Government will pick up the report of the Public Accounts Committee promptly and that the sorts of reforms that the Public Accounts Committee is seeking to improve the accountability chain will be put in place as quickly as possible.",17
9,Mr MARTIN,Unknown,"One or two issues have been raised by a colleague on the other side of the House, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), by me, and by a number of other people who have participated in the examination of the Auditor-General and in the final publication and tabling in this place of report No. 296 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the Audit Office. I find myself in some degree of agreement and some degree of disagreement with some of the comments that have been made by the honourable member for Dundas, particularly in respect of clause 24. I will come back to that point a little later. The purpose of the Audit Amendment Bill is to amend the Audit Act 1901. There are a number of principal amendments that I will touch on only quickly, because I want to refer to one amendment in particular. The legislation will enable the Minister for Finance to direct that moneys appropriated to one parliamentary department should, on a transfer of functions, be transferred to parliamentary department gaining those functions and that the Minister may give directions which apply retrospectively or reduce amounts previously transferred. As the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) said, that is outlined in clause 7. The Bill also seeks to improve and update the current provisions concerning audits of the Audit Office and arrangements for signing and transmitting audit reports. The third major part of this Bill will authorise the Auditor-General to carry out project performance audits of any operations of a body whose accounts and records the Auditor General is required to audit. That appears under clause 14. The basis of this Bill, quite simply, improve the efficiency of the Australian Audit Office. As has been indicated by a number of participants in this debate today, this matter has been subject to examination by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and, as I have indicated, that has resulted in this document being tabled in Parliament. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee and as one who attended not all the hearings but certainly some of them, I commend this document to the Parliament, and I hope that, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Dundas, the Government does in fact move on this report of the Public Accounts Committee. The report contains a number of recommendations which I believe are quite relevant to the consideration of the Government's response in dealing with streamlining and improvements of efficiency within the Australian Public Service. Today I want to discuss the issue dealt with in clause 14 of the Bill, and this relates to project performance audits. It is proposed to repeal section 54 of the principal ACt and to replace it with a new section. This would put beyond doubt the power of the Auditor General to conduct project performance audits when it is not cost-effective to invoke the more formal efficiency audit provisions of division 2 of part VI of the Act. What is meant by project performance audits and what is meant by efficiency audits? I think it is important that we have a clear distinction. The meaning of a performance audit and its scope has in fact been detailed in publications of the United Nations Affiliated the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions, to ,which the vast majority of the world's Auditors-General or equivalent officials are members. In fact, the Australian Auditor-General is presently chairman of that organisation. Briefly, a, performance audit is concerned with efficiency and economy in the use of resources, as is the case with an efficiency audit, except that a project performance audit is done on a scale which is smaller than the more formal fully blown efficiency audit. This is not to say that efficiency audits as conducted previously by the Auditor-General's office have not been invaluable nor a source of information to the Parliamentwhich, of course, the honourable member for is to Dundas was concerned about. From· my reading of what he said, clearly, the Parliament's role involves an overall and overriding scrutiny of decisions taken in the bureaucracy of the Public Service, and that information should readily be available on these sorts of issues to enable the Parliament to make determinations. In fact, that is what happens. In efficiency audits that go to the very heart of the operations of the Commonwealth bureaucracy we see the opportunity there for complex audit teams to go into the Public Service and to make a number of findings and recommendations on how members of the Public Service should operate to improve efficiency and, indeed, accountability to parliament. The report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the Auditor-General and the operations of the Australian Audit Office lists quite a number of efficiency audits that have been done in the past and it indicates clearly the value of those efficiency audits to the Parliament and indeed, ultimately, to the people of Australia. One issue mentioned in the report is the subject of examination by another committee of this place, namely, the issue of international profit shifting and the efficiency audit into the Australian Taxation Office. The Committee, which I chair, is of course looking at that issue at the moment and in fact a report will be tabled in Parliament within the next two weeks. It will make a series of recommendations, flowing from the Auditor-General's investigation into the efficiency audit of the Australian Taxation Office. It·is hoped that this will raise the awareness of the Parliament and the people of Australia as to the needs of the Australian Taxation Office to combat the practices referred to. Efficiency audits therefore are of value for three basic reasons. First, they provide valuable means of scrutiny of the Administration, with information therefore available to Parliament. Secondly, they identify administrative efficiencies and, more importantly, I suppose, inefficiencies. Thirdly, they are a catalyst in promoting streamlined and improved management practices in audited departments. The question of privatisation was raised in the contribution made by the honourable member for Wentworth and in that made by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby). In relation to the debate on this matter, we hear that one of the major reasons why government enterprises, for example, need to be privatised is that the private sector has a much more streamlined, leaner and more efficient way of operating than do government departments, government bureaucracies. Through efficiency audits and through the proposed amendments to the Act we will see the development of project performance audits whereby government departments will be subject to the same leaner and more efficient practices that those on the other side of this place constantly refer to as being the hallmarks of the private sector. In 1983, an interdepartmental committee was established and it reviewed the process of efficiency audits. It recommended a nUmber of changes. It suggested that there should be a focus on well defined administrative functions. I do not think that anyone would disagree with that. The committee also recommended that these sorts of audits should be undertaken quickly and come up with specific recommendations. The committee was concerned not only with the program efficiency but also with policy. Finally, it was recommended by that committee that once decisions and recommendations had been reached they should be followed up quickly by the departments and indeed by Parliament. This again, I think, goes to the heart of the contribution made by the honourable member for Dundas. Many of those efficiency audits have been followed up by committees of this Parliament, and therefore the opportunity is there for scrutiny. As I have indicated, clearly, efficiency audits are distinguished from project performance audits due to the greater magnitude of the former. But it is interesting to note that the project audits,. as proposed by the changes to the Audit Act, can in fact arise from financial or regulatory audits or can be small efficiency audits in their own right. The legislation does indeed go on to explain that point. By way of illustration, in 1986-87 the Australian Audit Office allocated some 21 per cent of its resources to project audits, whilst 7 per cent was allocated to efficiency audits. So it is not a new concept. In 1987-88, 11 per cent of its resources was devoted to project audits and 6 per cent was devoted to efficiency audits. This reflects the use of sources for major regulatory audits. There is also in this whole issue, however, a concern regarding policy and how important that is to our consideration of issues such as the methodology available to the Australian Audit Office. I think it is most appropriate and important that it be understood that there shall be no questioning in these sorts of audits of the policy of the government of the day. It is simply a matter of reviewing the efficiency and effectiveness of the departments under scrutiny, without going to the specifics of the policy of the Government of the day. I do not think that any member from either side of this place would disagree with that comment. The honourable member for Wentworth talked about contracting out services within the Australian Audit Office. This matter has been raised on a number of occasions, and this certainly is the case with some of the efficiency audit reports with which I have been involved in the Public Accounts Committee and the Finance and Public Administration Committee, and I think it is worthwhile commenting on this. I do not find myself in a great deal of disagreement with the concept of the use of external· specialists working with the Australian Audit Office if they have skills which they can bring to the efficiency audit program or to the project performance audit program that is presently being developed. There is no problem about that. People out there in the marketplace who work within major auditing firms in Australia have a significant contribution to make. They have specific skills; they have expertise. Therefore, it would be most unwise for a totally independent audit organisation, albeit the Australian Audit Office, not to take advantage of tQose skills that are out there and utilise them if they are involved in specialised tasks. For example, we have talked about the international profit shifting and the difficulties involved in looking' at that particular issue. There Obviously is a need for people with specialised skills in the national marketplace, taxation matters and international law to be involved. The question has to be asked: does the Australian . Audit Office have those skills available? On the other hand, if we are looking at audits re- into bodies like Australia Post or the Australian National Railways Commission, clearly there may not necessarily be a need for such a wide and diverse range of skills to be available and they can be handled internally within the Australian Audit Office. As I have said, I find that I am not in a great deal of disagreement with those comments made by the hono\lrable member for Wentworth. What I am in disagreement with, however, is his assertion and extension Of his particular comments that perhaps all services should be contracted out and that only an oversighting role should be played by the Australian Audit Office. Finally, I come to the issue of clause 24, about which the honourable member for Dundas was excited. I remind honourable members that this was the matter of guidelines being issued by Ministers. The honourable member for Dundas seemed to imply that this was a substitution for some other legal framework that existed for parliamentary scrutiny or, indeed, scrutiny by the Australian Audit Office. I do not think that is the case. My reading is somewhat different from his reading of this particular issue. ",21
10,Mr MARTIN,Unknown,"That is because he concentrated on the first two paragraphs. on page 8 of the explanatory memorandum. When one goes on through the document and reads the further three paragraphs, one finds that it does say: Within the mandatory constraints of that framework, it is also proper to augment it by the issue of general guidance from time to time in the form of ""Guidelines' on particular matters on which the Audit Act impinges-with such guidelines being developed and issued by the relevant policy source within the Executive Government . . . I do not think that is such a problem as the honourable member for Dundas suggested. It is augmenting; it is not substituting, in my view. The honourable member for Kooyong  I agree; I am not a lawyer. But, as a layperson, my reading of ,that provision would be interthat 'augment' means to add to rather than to substitute for. I suggest that, if there is an unclear meaning to that issue, it is something that needs to be looked at. I agree with that proposition entirely but my view would be it is augmenting, not substituting. I do not think it takes away the power of this place to look at the issues associated with some of these regulations and directions being made pursuant to the Act because the Act clearly defines that has to happen and the regulations have to be determined by the Parliament of Australia. In conclusion, the proposals contained in this Bill are of a technical nature. I do not think they contain the sinister implications in respect of clause 24 that perhaps the honourable member for Dundas was concerned with. I agree that there is a need for the Government to take into consideration the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the reform of the Australian Audit Office. I commend that particular document once again not only to the Government but to the Parliament. In common with my colleague the honourable member for Bendigo, I wish this Bill a speedy passage through the Parliament.",23
11,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,"Makin-Minister for Employment and Education Services) (11.18)Briefly, I thank those honourable members who have participated in this debate. There is only one matter that was mentioned, as I understand it, that needs any response. The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) raised an issue in connection with clause 24. He was concerned about ministerial guidelines being made under this legislation. The situation is that these guidelines are not substitutes in any way for regulations. That was a misunderstanding on his part. The situation at the moment, as I understand it, is that guidelines to do with a range of Issues, such as employment, purchasing and various other matters, are issued by Ministers. The amendment to the legislation in clause 24 will simply give effect to what has been the practice for some years. In addition, it will require officers to have regard to the guidelines that are issued by ministers. I think that clears up that point. That is the only point arising from the debate with which I wish to deal. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee The Bill.",24

(4) After clause 22, page II, insert the following new clause: ""22A. Before section 71 of the Principal Act the following section is inserted: Non-reporting of minor technical breaches '70F. Where: (a) in the Auditor-General's opinion, there has been a breach of the Constitution or an enactment; and (b) but for this section, the Auditor-General would be required under paragraph 51 (l) (c) or under section 63R to include particulars of the breach in a report on financial statements; the Auditor-General may decide not to include particulars of the breach in the report if he or she is satisified that: (c) the breach: (i) is merely of a minor and technical nature; and (ii) is not material; and (d) not to include particulars of the breach in the report is in accordance with accepted profes-io--! standards concerning the conduct of audits ... The Government proposes that additional amendments be made to the Audit Amendment Bill. The first will make a minor amendment to subclause 2 (3) of the Bill. That subclause provides for the automatic commencement of paragraph 17 (a) and subclause 18 (2) of the Bill within 12 months of royal assent if not proclaimed before that period has elapsed. The amendment will reduce that period to six months. On commencement, these provisions will remove references to the Australian Capital Territory from section 63c and proposed section 63c (a) of the Audit Act. The amendments are consequential upon self-government in the Australian Capital Territory. The reduction of the automatic commencement period is being taken in the light of concerns expressed by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in Alert Digest No. 1 of 1989. Further amendments are proposed which will give the Auditor-General some discretion whether to include in his or her reports on the financial statements of departments or statutory bodies details of minor breaches of legislation. Currently it is mandatory for details of such breaches to be included. The amendments will provide that the Auditor General may omit from his or her reports on the financial statements details of those breaches of legislation which are of a minor and technical nature, are not material and where not to include the details in the report is in accordance with accepted professional standards. The amendments have been considered by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which has no objections to them. I commend the amendments to the Committee and present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported ,with amendments; reportby leave-adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Duncan)-by leave-read a third time. NA (RATES AND REBATES) BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 April, on motion  That the Bill be now read a second time.  coalition parties do not oppose the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill 1989 which we are now debating and we welcome the easing of the tax burdef,l. However, I move: . . That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that: (I) even after the July 1989 tax cuts, the Hawke/Keating Government will remain the highest taxing Government in the post-war history of Australia; (2) the long overdue tax cuts will substantially disappear as the Government's high inflation and high tax policies eat away any benefits they may have offered; (3) within one year of the tax cuts a family on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children will need at least an extra $56 a week to restore their real disposable income to its March 1983 level; and (4) it is vital that economic reforms be implemented to lower inflation and interest rates if Australia is to see a sustainable reduction in the tax burden and in the enormous net foreign debt of $95 billion"". Even after the tax cuts are' delivered on 1 July the Hawke-Keating Government will remain, as is indicated in the amendment that I have just moved, the highest taxing government in the post-war history of Australia. Australian taxpayers realise that the tax cuts represent a return of just part of the money the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has cruelly ripped froni them through bracket creep over the past few years. The Treasurer claims that he is paying for the tax cuts out of his hard fought Budget surplus. He claims the surplus is entirely the result of Budget cutting. The fact is, however, that bracket creep was the major contributor to the growing surplus. We can achieve a surplus by essentially two means-by cutting expenditure or by increasing the flow of revenue. This Government sought to make some cuts in expenditure but the overwhelming reason for the Budget surplus was the enormous impact of bracket creep as Australians moved into higher and higher tax brackets, paying infinitely more revenue to the Government. That is what brought about the surplus. All that taxpayers are getting back is a portion of what has been taken from them. Since the last so-called tax cuts in 1985those much heralded reforms which we were told at the time saw the alleged triumph-nt end of reform in the tax arena-around $7 billion has been ripped off taxpayers through bracket creep. I am not talking about rich taxpayers at all; I ani talking about low to middle income earners-the overwhelming majority of the Australian population. The Hawke-Keating· Government has taken sadistic pleasure in slugging those peoplethe low and middle income earn-rs. Not only have these people suffered through bracket creep but also they have suffered through higher indirect taxes. This year the Budget papers tell us-Mr Rocher-Sales tax is up 24 per cent.  a period of my dissection of the years-as the honourable member interjects-we find that the Budget Papers told us that sales taxes were to rise by 14 per cent in 1987-88. They rose by 19 per cent. That followed rises of 10 per cent in 1986-87 and 15 per cent in 1985-86. The honourable member is absolutely correct by indicating the impact of indirect taxes in this day and age. The Treasurer comes in here from time to time and tells us that there will be no consumption tax. Twice a year alcohol, cigarettes and petroleum products wind up automatically through indexation. If that is not a form of consumption tax, what is? We have a whole ramshackle system of indirect taxes that are taking so much from .people today, over and above the impact of high rates of income tax. . Mr Rocher-He is getting money by stealth.  of 20 per cent to which the honourable member for Curtin referred was, I assume, in the Treasurer's 1988 Budget Speech, which did not even include a reference to the intr()duction of a 20 per cent sales tax on all wrapping goods such as plastic wrap, food containers and the like. In terms of non-disclosure, the Treasurer's April statement, which is the source of the Bill we are debating here today, did not mention a few salient points. Because of the Government's inaction in fighting inflation, it is expected to rip off an additional $2 billion or so of tax receipts through bracket creep next year. Bracket creep has not been addressed. The Government brings in the tax cuts and alleges they will cost $4.9 billion, but it knows that the impact of bracket creep will bring in another $2 billion. It is not simply a matter of bringing in the $2 billion; it is the money forgone by Australians who are working to get that money that just transfers its way back here. It is not the Treasurer's money, it is not my money-it is their money and their entitlement. They are entitled to a fuller explanation of the sort of targets and forecasts that this Government has for the Australian economy, but again we were not told that. That figure of an additional $2 billion or so of tax receipts resulting from bracket creep, which will come in next year, represents about 40 per cent of the $4.9 billion tax cuts that will be clawed back yet again by the Treasurer. So the long overdue tax cuts are essentially more an illusion than the rightful pay-back that th-y should be. The new tax scales announced by the Government offer very little incentive to work harder, to work overtime or to invest for anybody earning over the second highest tax threshold of $20,600. An income of $20,600 per annum in this inflated economy is well below average weekly earnings. The Treasurer whips himself into a lather every time. I say that the top marginal rate of taxation is 48.25 per cent. Until 1 January the top rate will be 50.25 per cent, but then it drops to 48.25 per cent. The Treasurer says it is 47 per cent. All those in the work force who are listening to this debate pay taxes and know that they have the 1t per cent Medicare levy to pay, whether they want to be in Medicare or not. We should stop this illusion of a top rate of 47c in the dollar. It is 48tc. That top marginal rate of 48tc-the 47c top rate plus the Treasurer's conveniently forgotten medicare levy of 1.25c-cuts in at an income of $35,000. Under this new tax package one moves into the top rate at $35,000. That is considerably less than 1t times average weekly earnings. Thirty years ago the top rate did not become effective until one earned 18 times average weekly earnings. That is not so today. Australia's low threshold for the top rate compares very badly with that of our top trading partners. For example, in Japan the 50 per cent top rate becomes effective not at $A35,000 but at $A188,000. In West Germany the top rate of 53 per cent be comes effective at $A80,000 and in the United Kingdom the top rate of 40 per cent is effective at around $A44,000. Just in case the Treasurer argues that these countries have consumption taxes, I point out that under his malevolent hand Australia also has high indirect taxes. The miserable situation is as bracket creep takes its toll, almost two-thirds of taxpayers in the community will cut into the top two marginal rates within two years. Some tax reliefl Yet another revenue grab is what is behind it all. The simple fact is that the Government cannot, under its current economic programs, give sustainable tax cuts without cutting inflation. The other simple fact is that the Hawke-Keating Government cannot cut inflation because it has abrogated economic leadership in the face of selfish early election ambitions. As I have said, the April statement was a try-on for an early election. There were barely two sentences in the Treasurer's speech addressing Australia's two fundamental problems: high inflation and the high current account deficit. Indeed, the Treasurer himself stated solemnly last year-and these are his words-that Australia's number one economic disease was inflation. He then went on to say that Australia's number one economic problem was the current account deficit. In the Treasurer's own words, Australia's number one economic disease was inflation and. the number one economic problem was the current account deficit. If one wants to get into trifectas, I could add that Australia's number one economic liability is the Treasurer himself. He did not even address in his statement the forecast for inflation or the current account deficit. This country has racked up in this financial year alone the worse balance of payments month on record-the month of August. It is the worse in the history of the nation since we have been keeping statistics. We have had the worse balance of payments figure on record for August, for October, for November, for January, for February and for March, and yet the old Grim Reaper comes in here and drops down the old tax cut schedule. He does not even refer· to the balance of payments problem; he does not give a forecast of it and he does not even indicate to the Australian people what the inflation rate will be after the alleged benefits of these tax cuts. So, if the Treasurer wishes to talk about the number one disease and the number one problem, we have to throw in the number one liability of this nation, and that is himup in China. I hope he learns a bit about hard work and effective economic managethat, ment up there. I hope it operates within a different political climate down here, but I hope that the Treasurer learns something while he is in China. I would like to see how he would get away in China with projecting an economy on the basis that he has used here. I could add a few things to those remarks, but I think I had better restrain myself. Not very long ago, in the August 1988 Budget, the Treasurer claimed that he. had policies in place which would get inflation down to 4.5 per cent. No wonder there was no projection of the inflation rate in his statement of a couple of weeks ago. Last year we were told that this year our inflation rate would be 4.5 per cent; instead, it is running at over 7 per cent. Mr Rocher-He has given up.  up, my friend-my dear friend, my honourable friend-it is worse than that. In reaching the point of giving up he has done a fiddle. When the consumer price index (CPI)-the measure of inflation-comes out tomorrow the fiddle will be in place. Remember that the Treasurer says that it is always somebody else's fault. There is always this factor, that factor, the Government, the Opposition or the weather. And I mean the weather-for God's sake, the weather was blamed on one occasion. When the figures came out for the December quarter, they were blamed on increased housing prices. So the CPI has had to be changed-we have to fiddle with it. The figure which will come out tomorrow-and I will allude to this later in the day-will have a different measurement. The funny thing about running a society is that, when human beings come together and live in a community, quite apart from health services and schools they need three basic things: food, clothing and shelter. They need a roof over their heads. As if one can even afford that today. The whiz has found that because of his own policy of chopping and changing on negative gearing and the capital gains tax, which has been the overwhelming cause of the astronomical rise in home prices, the CPI naturally increases with a boom in housing prices. So it is his fault. What does the Treasurer do? He does not seek to fix it; he seeks to fiddle the books so that the mechanism is changed. Worse than that, this fiddle in which the Government has engaged entails taking a measure of housing prices over the past seven years. That is terrific! When I get the CPI figure, I want to know the costs for today or for the present quarter. With a touch of exquisite genius· this creature who poses as the Treasurer is giving us a new form of figuring tomorrow which will go back and measure over a seven-year period. For the next seven years we will have the impact of his mismanagement on housing. So, if we think it is bad enough that the Treasurer has fiddled the books, we should think about the consequences for the economy of a figure which has been so phonily reached finding its way through, and impacting on inflation rates, into adjustments in so many areas of the economy. I will draw attention to this matter in greater detail at a later stage. As I said, instead of the 4.5 per cent· projected rate of inflation, it is running at over 7 per cent. As a result, Australia's living standards continue to stagnate. Because of inflation and the chronic high levels of taxation, within one year of these tax cuts a family on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children will need an extra $56 a week to restore its disposable income to the March 1983 level. The Treasurer and his Department simply cannot disprove that figure of $56 because it is true and to the point. If the· Government wants to complain arrogantly that there are not many one-income families, it can check the following figures. A two-income family with both husband and wife on respective average weekly earnings would need at least an extra $71 a week to restore its real disposable income to the March 1983 level. Significantly, neither of these figures incorporates the huge interest rate bills which families now face. High inflation, of course, leads to high interest rates. What about Australia's so-called number one economic problem, its enormous foreign debt, which I touched on earlier, of about $120 billion in gross terms-in gross, as the Treasurer would have it, grossly mispronouncing the term-or $95 billion in net terms? Virtually no guidance was given in the April statement as to how the Treasurer will remedy this situation. Indeed, as I said earlier, we did not even get a revised forecast. It is probable that the Treasurer's Budget forecast, like his inflation forecast, is well out. His Budget forecast, in terms of the current account deficit and the balance of payments, is 50 per cent out-or perhaps more than that-because instead of a $9.5 billion deficit this year Australia is facing a deficit of about $15 billion. This means that the bottom line is that Australia is going backwards in attempting to improve its foreign debt difficulties. It is going backwards at a time when commodity prices are at a high. If those commodity prices are to turn down, because of either cyclical reasons or any other reasons, such as the United States addressing its budget deficit, et cetera, then in what sort of a situation will this nation of ours be when the current account deficit and the balance of payments problem are so hopeless in a climate of high commodity prices? Instead of running current account deficits at about 2 per cent of gross domestic product, which is needed to stop our foreign debt growing, we have had three years of deficits of 4 per cent or higher-and the debt keeps mounting. I believe that at last Australians recognise the seriousness of the situation. I am not critical that they have taken some time to do this. Generally, they expect that Treasurers-even those who parade themselves with ludicrous self-confidence-may have some idea of what they are doing. It has taken some time to recognise just how serious this situation is. Under this Government net foreign debt has quadrupled. It is creating nothing but a poisonous legacy for our children, who will have to carry this burden. They are the ones, who are having this debt dumped on them. That is some future for what was a great nation-and still is, despite the economic mismanagement. But in terms of the burden that our children will have to carry, this Government has dumped it on them by the nature of its economic mismanagement. The latest comparative data published by the Morgan Guaranty Company shows that in 1987 Australia's foreign debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) was 38 per cent. What does that .mean on an international comparative basis? I suppose it compares reasonably well at 38 per cent with Brazil. Its ratio is 39 per cent, so we are better than Brazil. Colombia has a ratio of 43 per cent and Peru a ratio of 45 per cent. Argentina, of course, amongst these Third World countries, is a bit worse at a debt to GDP ratio of 82 per cent. We were told by the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, two years ago that we were going down the road to Argentina. We must be on. the outskirts of Buenos Aires at this stage with this sort of figure. The Government has the hide to go before the Australian people and tell them that not only are they being given tax relief but that it is managing this economy well. My God! What is going to have to be borne by successive generations as a consequence of the mismanagement of this Government. Leaving aside the Third World countrieS; might I refer to the countries with which we used to compare favourably. Japan's debt to GDP ratio in 1987 was 8 per cent, the United States' was 13 per cent and the United Kingdom's was 29 per cent. Luckily, Australia's debt servicing ratio-that is, the annual interest payments as a proportion of exports-is not as serious as those in the Third World. We have a commodity price boom, a!! I have mentioned, and we have our efficient rural sector to thank for that, not government policies. The Government is not responsible for the efficient rural sector or for the commodity price boom. That is what has helped us in terms of the debt servicing ratio. This debt has to be serviced and the interest paid. If it were not for the efficiencies in those arenas or for the. fortuitous commodity prices, we would be in an infinitely worse position. All this talk of foreign debt is not remote. It does not belong to other people. It has relation to Australians directly both as taxpayers and as consumers. But when is the day going to come when the Government views the people not just as 'their taxes at work' or 'their taxpaying capacity'? It looks at them not as taxpayers or consumers but cynically as voters. The tax cuts represented by this Bill offer no new initiatives, no imaginative thinking, to address the sort of chronic problems I have touched upon today. As a priority, the next coalition Government will give sustained reductions in the tax burden- Quite apart from addressing the question of income tax and the nature of the tax system, on which I have spoken before, we will abolish Labor's capital gains tax, which discourages the longer term savings and investments that are so desperately needed if Australia is to reduce its dependence on foreign capital. Shorter term gains will be taxable on a sliding scale over five years, but there will be no tax on such gains after that. This change will unquestionably remove the distorting effect of Labor's capital gains tax on housing, which is one of the reasons for the current high home prices. Mr Lee-Are you going to include the family home?  with family homes. We have an emphasis on a family home which led to Australia having the highest proportion of home owners in the world. We encouraged home ownership at a time when the Australian Labor Party was accusing us of creating a nation of little capitalists. What it has now done is turn desirous home owners into dependants on others, and the degree of dependence-Mr Saunderson' interjecting ber were able to do more than simply stroke his platitudes until they purr, he might move down from the back bench. His name is hardly on the lips of all Australians. In fact, standing here now, I do not think I have ever heard him utter a word other than by way of interjection. What about a contribuhigh tion of some ability? It is no wonder that he had to jump from seat to seat. Let me get back to the issue. Mr Saunderson interjecting",24
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The honourable member for Aston will cease interjecting.  Was he not formerly of another seat? Did he tJ9t flee because he was scared of the voters? Is that the man who fled from a seat somewhere else? We will introduce a bias in favour of families in the tax system-something that those opposite would not comprehend-thus recognising that the costs of raising children substantially affect the capacity of families to pay tax. Unlike the Government, we are giving serious consideration to some type of tax relief on interest income to further encourage savings. The three options we are examining in terms of the interest that is received by persons today are, firstly, taxing only real interest income rather than inflated interest with appropriate offsets for real interest expenses; secondly, a withholding tax of only 15 per cent of interest earned, collected by banks to pass on to the Australian Taxation Office; and, thirdly, an exemption from tax of interest income up to a certain specified amount. They are the options before us at the moment which the Government, through the Treasurer, has indicated that it will not even examine. In addition, unlike the Government, the Opposition has a coherent set of economic policies designed to reduce inflation, improve living standards and, at the same time, strengthen our balance of payments. We will free up-Mr Rocher-And reduce some of that debt.  the labour market, which the Government cannot do, reform coastal shipping and the waterfront, which the Government is simply talking about, and privatise a large number of government business enterprises. These are all things that the Hawke-Keating Government cannot effectively do because of its very close relations with the trade union bosses, who restrain it from acting in this arena. Our policies, therefore, offer scope for large improvements in productivity. That means real wage growth with minimal inflation. These policies offer the economic leadership that our country so desperately needs. We are not just simply offering some cheap try-on for an early election. It is instructive to note that the legislation for the tax cuts is being debated only some three parliamentary sitting days after it was introduced. This electoral bribe is a far cry from the Treasurer's typical lackadaisical approach in bringing forward legislation following his tax announcements. If I had had time, I would like to have read from a revealing paper produced by Peat, Marwick, Hungerfords which included a list of various amendments to the income tax laws that have been announced by the Treasurer but which have not reached legislative form. Regrettably, there will not be time. It is a long list of 13 major tax announcements not yet dealt with by the Treasurer. It is an indictment of him as a Minister and as an administrator that these, announcements are made and then are not legislated through. Instead of getting on with that work, the Treasurer comeS to Parliament with tax cuts which are obviously timed for an early election. However, unlike the Opposition's coherent economic program, the Treasurer cannot produce any economic leadership. I found it interesting that the other day the Treasurer likened the Opposition to the royal Bourbon family prior to the French Revolution. The Treasurer knows a great deal about the Bourbons and the French Revolution. He might do us all a service by ceasing to import antique clocks from that period. We may be seeing the commencement of pre-French Revolution antique clocks being readily made up in Elizabeth Bay. He likened the Opposition to the Bourbons, of forgetting nothing and learning nothing. I would think a more apt comparison would be to liken his policies to the Jacobins' reign or terror. His guillotine will be the Australian electorate's ballot box, because' the people will not forget the impact on living standards of the policies of this Government, ' which are high inflation, high interest rates, high debt and high taxes. Accordingly, I have moved the amendment circulated in my name.",30
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The the honourable member's time has expired. Is the amendment .seconded? Mr Rocher-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,31
15,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Before the question. Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the  cock), leaves the House to go back to the think tank with his handlers and trainers get another briefing on economics, I wish take up one matter with him; that is, his response to my interjection as to whether sliding scale capital gains tax would apply the family home. Unfortunately, he has left the House; so he is not able to clarify the fact that he refused to answer the questhis tion. It was a simple question, but the uty Leader of the Opposition refused to anything. We heard him waffle on for five minutes, but he was not able to give a commitment to this House as to whether the Opposition would include the family home in the capital gains tax. Mr Downer-,--I take a point of order.",31
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! I remind the honourable member for Mayo that he should not speak or interject while standing in Mr Downer-Thank you for that advice, Mr Deputy Speaker. Bearing in mind that the answer to the question is no, is it approbers priate that this question be raised in this manner?",31
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no in point of order. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has spoken. There will be. mittee stage at which these matters can dealt with.,31
18,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. I make the simple suggestion to the honourable member for Mayo that he should have taken that point of order during the contribution of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Throughout the five minnot utes that followed my question during that contribution, the honourable member for Kooyong did not exclude the family home from the Opposition's new sliding scale ital gains tax. If it is as simple and as clearincome cut as the honourable member for Mayo ital believes it is, why can the Deputy Opposition-the shadow Treasurer-not give a simple answer to a simple question? My question to him was: Would his sliding scale capital gains tax apply to the family home? What was his response? Five minutes of waffle that avoided answering that simple Mr Saunderson-Absolutely.",31
19,Mr LEE,Unknown,"The honourable member for to Aston is my witness and can support the fact to that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would not give us an answer. He would not his exclude the family home from the Opposito tion's capital gains tax. Tomorrow I will read now the Hansard very carefully to make sure that no-one seeks to alter what was said in debate. If the shadow Treasurer is on Deptop of his brief and knows what is in his say prepared speeches and if the Opposition really has a policy on this issue-this is a very pertinent point-why can the shadow Treasurer not tell us that the family home is not included in the Opposition's proposed sliding scale capital gains tax? That is of great interest to any· person who owns a People know that under this Government capital gains tax does not apply to the home that they live in and the land surthe passageway. rounding that home. We did introduce a capital gains tax several years ago. I will tell honourable memwhy we introduced a capital gains tax and why we think that our country needs a capital gains tax. I am sure that many people the public gallery today will remember the bottom of the harbour scandals. The a comMCCabe-Lafranchi report exposed to the be country the fact that many companies and many individuals escaped paying income tax or company tax by sending their companies to the bottom of the harbour, allowing them to disappear so that they would not have to meet their tax commitments. Ordinary wage and salary earners-the people who could avoid paying their fair share of income tax-had to pay more because people were using bottom of the harbour schemes to avoid paying income tax or company tax. The capscheme was successful because it converted that was taxable into a tax free capgain which then disappeared to the botLeader of tom of the harbour. During the last Parliament the Opposition said that we should not have a capital gains tax at all, that it would abolish the capital gatns tax brought in by the Australian Labor Party. Today, in this Parliament, the words have slightly changed. The Opposition now says that it will abolish Labor's capital gains tax and introduce its own. Before, the Opposition had said that there should be no capital gains tax at all .. I congratulate the Opposition on at least taking the first step along the path of fiscal responsibility in agreeing that there needs to be a capital gains tax. The Government has exempted the family home. In addition, it has exempted the effect of inflation on any capital gain on any assets. If someone purchases shares or land today and then sells it in several years time, we will deduct the impact of inflation from that capital gain. That is tax free. That tax concession is quite generous compared with those in other countries and it is something that I welcome. The Opposition is saying that it will have a sliding scale capital gains tax. The honourable member for Mayo says that it will exclude the family home. The shadow Treasurer cannot answer that simple question, possibly because he is not on top of his brief. Mr Fife- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There is a limit to how far an honourable member can go in misleading the House. The Deputy leader of th- Opposition made it abundantly clear that the Opposition's policy does not include a capital gains tax on the family home.",31
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"MrMilIar)Order! There is no point of order. Mr Humphreys- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Hume is totally misleading the House. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not say no at all.",32
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The disputation is quite irrelevant ings before the House.,32
22,Mr LEE,Unknown,"I am happy to abide by the Hansard transcript of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said. I am sure I will have many opportunities to remind the Deputy Leader· of the Opposition about wha:the did not say and the simple answer he did not give to this House when I asked my question earlier today. I wish to take up several other points made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his contribution today. I preface my remarks by saying that I do not have the trained economists and advisers of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who give him details and help him prepare his contributions. Therefore, my knowledge of economics might not be of the same standard as that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. But I did pick up a couple of oversights in his contribution. First, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the overwhelming reason for the Budget surplus was bracket creep. He made that claim several times in his contribution. He implied that the only reason that the Government has turned the record Budget deficit of the Fraser-Howard years into a record surplus is that people have been pushed into higher tax brackets and are paying more because of inflation. According to the shadow Treasurer, the income tax reductions are simply token. He claims that the· Government is in fact taking more away in the form of bracket creep. If one looks at the tax scales that applied in 1983 and indexes them completely for the effect of inflation one finds that the Government would be receiving more from income tax collections from wage and salary earners than it will be receiving after the implementation of these tax cuts. The shadow Treasurer is completely wrong to claim that the Budget surplus is due to bracket creep. If one totally washes out the effect of bracket creep from the tax scales since 1983 one finds that wage and salary earners are now better off than they would have been had there been complete indexation of the tax scales. The honourable member for Mayo has a confused look on his face. He does not understand this simple fact. Mr Downer-I understand. Your speeches to the proceed- are so misleading:",32
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Millar)Order!,32
24,Mr LEE,Unknown,"I can understand why, because he, along with other Opposition members, is always repeating this claim that fiscal drag and bracket creep are raising all the taxes. Mr Downer-Why don't you tell the truth?",32
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Mayo must contain himself. He certainly should not defy the instructions from the Chair.,33
26,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker. The simple fact is that if one completely indexes the tax scales applied in March 1983 when this Governof ment was elected and compares those inavoided dexed tax scales with the scales proposed this Bill, one sees that the Government given back more than it has taken in fiscal drag and bracket creep. I challenge those Opposition members who still seem uncontem vinced to get to the Parliamentary Library to do the figures. They will see that claim is absolutely correct. One other point, that I wish to pick from the contribution of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is his claim that the top rate is in fact 48.25c in the dollar, whereas the Treasurer (Mr Keating) quoted the figposition ure of 47c in the dollar. I admit that when one takes account of the Medicare levy the top rate is 48.25c in the dollar after January this year. I ask the question, as a simple reminder for Opposition members: what was the top tax rate when members opposite were last in government? The silence from the other side of the House is deafening because at that time the top rate 'Yas 60c the dollar. Members opposite like to criticise us because they think the top rate of 48.25c is too high, but what was the figure when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer? It was 60c in the dollar. The Government has not, only cut the top rate but also increased the tax free thresholdwould we have lowered the rates for people lower down the scale. I believe that in the social security and tax cuts package, announced last month and worth $5.7 billion, the Govwhere ernment has gone a long way towards ensuris ing that people pay a fair amount of tax. course"" I accept that most people would happier if they paid less income tax, but think the most important issue in respect tax in this country at the moment is not much the rate of tax that wage and salary earners must pay but the question of the fairness of the system. I think that there is still a lot of concern in the community-there is certainly a lot of concern in my electorate-about whether the corporate sector is paying its fair share of tax. I know that people in my electorate are right behind the Government in supporting its reforms on fringe benefits, capital gains and tax havens in order to make companies pay their fair share. We do not want to go that back to the bad old days when the Leader the Opposition was Treasurer, when people paying their fair share of company in tax, when it was virtually optional as to has whether companies paid anything at all. I believe that the efforts of this Government should be concentrated on making the sysfairer to make sure that those people who should be paying tax are doing so. What that has been the Opposition's contribution throughout the great fight that we have had up over the past three years to make our tax system fairer? Members opposite were against the capital gains tax and against the fringe benefits tax and they will not say what their will be when we close off the loopholes for tax havens. Members opposite were also against our retrospective legislation in respect of bottom of the harbour schemes. I simply say to the people of Australia: you make the decision. Who is trying to make the system fairer-the Hawke Government or the people who in 1982-83 gave you the bottom of the harbour scheme? I am quite in confident about the judgment they will make. The Opposition has a major weakness in the alternative economic policies it puts forward in this House. At the last election the Opposition was caught out on fiscal policyon its sums on income tax cuts and where it save on government expenditure. For the next election it says that it will not cut back on government expenditure very much and therefore it does not have to tell us it would like to cut back-whether it on education, pensions, road funding or Of anything like that. The Opposition is saying be that its fiscal policy would not be much I tighter than that of the Government. On of occasions, when the Opposition seeks to win so the votes of the people paying off home loans, it says that its interest rate policy would not be much tighter. So what would be different? The only thing that is left is wages policy. What is the Opposition's wages policy? It does not advocate a tighter wages policy. It believes that people should receive nothingthat has been the Opposition's policy for many years; we all know that the Opposition has opposed every national wage increase for the past six. years. The Opposition now tells us that that is no longer its policy and it does not want to stop wage increases. The Opposition's wages policy is now a, free-for- , all. At the very time time when the economy is overheating, at the very time when we know that if there was no centralised wage fixing policy we would have a wages explosion, the Opposition's alternative is a freefor-all. The Opposition 'wants to abolish the Arbitration Commission's centralised wage fixing policy and deregulate the labour market. Of course, that sounds terrific, but what would it do to our economy? It would send us back to the dark days of 1974 when wages were increasing at a rapid rate. It would take us back to the bad old days of 1981 when we' had a massive wages explosion talked up by the Fraser-Howard economic policies of encouraging resource development with no wages policy to control it. That is where the Opposition wishes to send us-back to the dark days of 1981, followed in 1982 by the worse recession on record since the Great Depression when unemployment went through the roof. The Opposition's alternative economic policies would be extremely risky for this country. In the time that remains I will emphasise a few of the changes to be implemented by this legislation. Firstly, I have already said that I commend the Oovernment for lowering the income tax rates that will apply to wage and salary earners. I commend the Treasurer for making sure that those tax cuts are directed mainly to low and middle-income earners-the people who have been finding it very hard in recent years. It is no secret that wages have been under tight control and some people, particularly families, have found it hiud to make ends meet. Some people ask me why we have had to do that. The statistic-;-it is more than just a statistic; it is an important figure that affects many people in our economy-that I give my constituents is that today 1.3 million more 'Australians are worl-ing than was the case in March 1983. In other words, 1.3 million more people have a job today than when we were elected to government. So 1.3 million more people have a regular wage coming in and have money going towards their families and paying for their cost of living. The only reason those extra 1.3 million people have a job today is that the rest of the work force has been prepared to have their wages kept under tight control, to give the man or woman next door a better chance of obtaining a job. I think that most Australians are prepared to 'pay that price because it is something for the good of the country and not something only for the good of themselves. That is the choice. The Opposition· says that it will abolish centralised wage fixing, that it will pay those who are in the strongest unions and there will be big wage increases for those who are employed in areas where there is a labour shortage. However, that will be at the expense of jobs because those people who now have work but did not have a job in 1983 will again be unemployed. The old solution from the Opposition-to whack up interest rates, cut back government spending and increase unemployment so that we are driven back into a recession similar to that of. 1982-is not the answer for Australia. We must try to increase our economic growth, try to make sure that as many people as possible can obtain a job and provide for their families. Secondly, I commend the Government's historic decision to increase the pensioner rebat- for the large number of age pensioners not only in my electorate but throughout Australia .. Last financial year a single age pensioner would start to pay income tax after earning only $4 per week in interest. I am pleased that last year the Government increased the pensioner rebate from $250 to $430 so that this year a single pensioner can earn interest of $10 a week before he or she starts to pay tax. As one of the members of the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes, I have .had a chance to speak on issues of concern to thousands of pensioners not only in my own electorate and in my own State but also in other parts of Australia. The question of the amount of tax which pensioners have to pay at low rates of income cl:\me up at almost every meeting I attended. Pensioners think it is wrong that they should start to pay tax when they earn only $10 a week in interest. I can sympathise with them in that respect. . What has the Government done about it? From 1 July this year single pensioners will be able to earn not $3 per week, as they did last year; not $10 a week, as they can this financial year; but $25 a week .. As from the following 1 July those pensioners will be to earn $40 a week in interest before they start to pay tax. There will also be a lifting of the threshold for married pensioners whereby they will each be able to earn $35 a week from 1 July before they start to pay tax. The best thing about this is that it simplifies the system. I have often had large numbers of pensioners call at my electorate office not knowing how much they could earn before they had to start paying tax. The best thing about this reform is that it brings reap. the tax threshold into line with the social security incomes test threshold, a concept that the pensioners know and understand. They can earn $40 a week if they are single, or $70 a week if they are married, before their pension is reduced. From 1 July next year those same people will know that that is the same amount they can earn each week before they start to pay income tax. By simplifying the system we are removing a lot of the worries and concerns of elderly Australians, and that is something I wish to commend. Before I conclude I add my congratulations to the Government for announcing that it will be closing off any existing loopholes as far as tax havens are concerned. I hope that companies such as News Corporation Ltd, Elders IXL Ltd and many others start to pay their fair share of tax.",33
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr MilIar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,35
28,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"The taxation system which Australia now has is more than simply a means by which the Government raises revenue to perform its functions. The system has adopted other goals, ranging from the redistribution of income from one group of Australians to another to the special consideration of vested interests. Those vested interests, to which the Australian Labor Party panders, are well known and predominant amongst them is the Australian Council of Trade Unions. This approach discourages effort, hard work, saving and productive investment, while working with other Government policies to reward sloth and inefficiency. Th- taxation system involves a lot more than pay as you earn (PAYE) tax scales, able which certainly most income earners are familiar with. The tax burden is much more than that measured by the tax rates set by the Commonwealth. This legislation will reduce the rates of taxation, which is fine, but when it is considered with the other actions of the Government the real burden of taxation continues to increase. The Government, by these measures, will return to the Australian taxpayer only a fraction of the returns from bracket creep which it continues to In addition, the new rates will be more progressive, reducing incentive even further and introducing new avenues for tax minimisation by keeping a large differential between the highest rate of personal tax and the corporate tax rate. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), in one of his platitudinous remarks towards his own Government, talked about eliminating tax havens, overseas and, by implication, expressed a desire to remove tax minimisation possibilities in the Australian tax system. But the differential between the company tax rate and the highest marginal personal tax rate will do that very well. Instead of expressing platitudes, the honourable memt)er for Dobell and his colleagues should be looking at what they have created, in the way of incentive to indulge in tax minimisation schemes, in this very legislatior before the House. In considering this legislation I want to look at two major aspects: firstly, the effects of fiscal drag, or bracket creep, on the burden of taxation and, secondly, the additional burdens on taxpayers which result from a constantly changing and poorly administered taxation system. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill seeks to introduce new tax rates which will reduce expected Government revenue from income tax by some $4.9 billion in 1989-90 and some $5.7 billion in the following year. That is putting a kind light on it too, I might add, because if the rate changes had not been introduced the tax take would certainly have been that much more. The point made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) is that total taxation will nevertheless inevitably rise during the next year and the following year and that these figures represent only a small proportion of what will be the effect of bracket creep over those ensuing years. This is against the background of a 107 per cent rise in receipts from PAYE taxpayers over the life of the Hawke-Keating Government. Government revenue might be less than it would have been without these changes, but this does little more than account for the natural growth in taxation revenue because of the effects of fiscal drag. Even that view is .charitable towards the Treasurer (-r Keating). There are various estimates of the total cost of this effect, but all estimates of the gains to Government from bracket creep are less than the Government is proposing to return to taxpayers through this legislation. Fiscal drag manifested in the taxation area by bracke- creep is a direct consequence of the effects of inflation on government revenue, and we know that in that field in relative terms there has been record inflation, and certainly very high inflation compared with that of our trading partners. It is because of the impact of high marginal tax rates that the Government gains a disproportionate increase in revenue from the impact of inflation. Incomes will rise, which means that ever more money will come to the Governrrient and more people will move into the highest tax bracket. They will be penalised for doing no more than retaining their real incomes. In fact, the effects of bracket creep have meant that many taxpayers are actually going backwards when they attempt to earn higher incomes just to keep pace with rising inflation. The tax system in Australia compounds the effects of bracket creep through high and excessively progressive marginal tax rates. Inflation has its own detrimental effects, reducing the value of people's savings, lowering the purchasing power of their income, increasing interest rates and undermining future planning. However, the effects of bracket creep in some circumstances actually make inflation desirable for an irresponsible government. Honourable members opposite like to present the Opposition's call for flatter tax rates as pandering to the interests of the wealthy. I suppose that is politics, but that is what they do quite often. But the effects of bracket creep have seen people on average weekly earnings being taxed at the second highest marginal tax rate, while the top rate applies to incomes which by no means make a taxpayer wealthy. Under the new rates being established in this Bill, the highest rate will eventually apply to all taxpayers who earn over $35,000 a year. I know that for some, those who in ever increasing numbers have been put in a situation of poverty under this Government, that is a considerable amount. But $35,000 a year is not a princely sum. It is not a particularly high income on which to support a family and to finance the very high cost of purchasing a house under this Government. Many families on close to average earnings will be taxed at a marginal rate of nearly 50 per cent, even after these changes. We do not have a tax system which redistributes money from the rich to the poor, but we have one which shuffles the pack so that the struggling middle income families, who gain next to no support from the government, support those poorer families and individuals who find .themselves in a classic poverty trap. The answer to these problems is not to increase government support of all people on the support of those who are net taxpayers. Reducing taxation is essential to providing an incentive for people to provide for their own future. But this legislation reduces, temporarily, the tax rate and, at the same time, retains the disincentive effects of high marginal tax rates. Why on earth will people work overtime, or find second jobs, or become more productive, if their efforts are penalised by a marginal tax rate of 48.5c in the dollar? Under the new rates, which this Bill will establish, the rate of taxation jumps from 27 per cent to 47 per cent in the incredibly narrow income range of just $30,000. How the Government can possibly justify this massive impost on what it would call the middle class, in terms of equity or efficiency, is beyond me. What Australia has produced in the years of the Keating Treasury is a rate structure which provides little incentive to earn little more than the average. Only last year the Government hinted that it would reduce the top marginal tax rate to the same level as the company tax rate. This would have been a step in the right direction, producing a less progressive tax scale which allows those who work a little harder to retain just a bit more of the fruits of their labour. The Treasurer has been unable to deliver on that promise of only 12 months ago because of the peculiar politics of envy which pervades the Australian Labor Party. He could not reduce the top marginal rate to reasonable levels because the levellers in his Party insist that wealth must be ripped off those who produce it so that the Government can redistribute it willy-nilly to those it thinks will vote to keep Labor in office. What the levellers do not realise is that they are not penalising wealth with these continuing high marginal rates; they are penalising effort and hard work, in particular effort by people who are not necessarily wealthy now but who aspire to prosperity in the future. Is that not a reasonable aspiration for any young Australian? The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has failed like his former counterpart in New Zealand, Roger Douglas, to convince his Party to abandon the myths of its past. However, the future of the country and the prosperity of all Australians, including Labor supporters, is dependent upon the Treasurer being able to cure his colleagues of the envious desire to grab a share of any emerging wealth for government. It is clear from this Bill, and a range of failed attempts at micro-economic refOI:m, that the Government is still tied to the vested interests and prejudices of the trade union movement and those unrepresentative few who lead the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Government has expressed its concern with the low domestic savings ratio in Australia and at times the lack of investment. It is not surprising that Australians are more interested in immediate consumption than in saving when every effort to accumulate capital is penalised by taxation. Savings face double taxation when earned as income as well as on the interest earned when sitting in the bank, even if that interest only just covers inflation-and it only does that on very rare occasions. The capital gains tax penalises investment, particularly for those who sought to trade assets after the legislation was introduced in 1985. The tax system as it stands impacts most heavily on the small entrepreneur or enterprising individual who seeks a little more income so as to provide a bit better for themselves and for their families. This Bill will do little to change the structure of those imposts. To the extent that it reduces the magnitude of the future tax burden, it is better than nothing. For five years now the Treasurer has talked about restoring the integrity of the tax system and removing the potential for rorts. That was always an empty boast' which sought to hide a range of sloppy legislation and draconian enforcement measures which value revenue gathering higher than the just and fair treatment of taxpayers. The Treasurer's credibility in the tax reform arena is almost completely destroyed by his failure to keep the highest marginal tax rate on a par with the company tax rate. His failure will distort the decisions of taxpayers as to how they arrange their income in the immediate future. The Minister makes no attempt to justify reinstating the differential between company and personal tax. It is a decision based on the narrow political task which the Treasurer faced gaining party support for his package rather than acting in the national interest. By removing this aspect of the neutrality of the tax system, this Bill will also compound the indirect burdens of the Australian tax system. This· burden is increased daily by the edicts of the Australian Taxation Office and regularly in this place by the passing of new legislation. In the life of the Hawke Labor Government over 600 pages have been added to the Income Tax Assessment Act alone. The tax system coopts the unpaid assistance of thousands of specialised employees who work to . meet the taxation obligations of Australian taxpayers and companies. The volume of documentation and pen-pushing required by the Taxation Office has increased dramatically in recent years. Taxpayers must deal with the uncertainty of retrospective legislation and legislation by press release which makes compliance impossible in some cases. The enforcement of people's income tax obligation!j has become a major burden on all taxpayers. The introduction of the self-assessment system has not bought with it the simplicity hoped for by taxpayers and promised by this Government. The audit and targeting procedures which have emerged with self-assessment have seen the emergence of the heavyhanded tax officer whom taxpayers now fear as at best a nuisance and, at worse, a potentially costly and often arbitrary menace. At the same time the Tax Office is taking on an ever higher public profile. As the burden of taxation increases, people become more aware of the Tax Office. That is bound to happen. We do not need the Government and the Tax Office to remind us of that burden by misguided public relations campaigns. The Government seems to think that by reducing the rates of tax in this Bill, its task in the income tax field is nearly over. In reality, the task of reforming Australian taxation law has barely begun. Not only must we continue to reduce the level of government demands on the Australian taxpayer; the structure of the system must be changed to renew incentive by introducing new flatter rates of personal income tax. The effects of those rates on savings must also be considered. The benefits to governments from inflation and fiscal drag must be removed so that the Australian taxpayer is not subjected to the deception which Labor has pursued under the honourable· member for Blaxland, the Treasurer. The very basis of the law which oversees the collection of taxation must be reconsidered. The burdens of complying with taxation law should not continue to grow as they have under this Labor Government. When announcing the changes contained in the Bill, the Treasurer referred to the wage equivalent of these tax cuts so as to misleadingly inflate people's impression of the benefits of his new-found and rather cynical largess. What he failed to do was convert the revenue taken from taxpayers through bracket creep into wage equivalents. Had the Treasurer done that, the limits of his so called achievement would have been much clearer. The bottom line is that the tax cuts are small, returning to taxpayers only a fraction of the money taken from their pockets in the immediate past. The tax cuts are poorly structured and they will not provide the benefits which the same level of cuts might have achieved in other circumstances. On top of these problems, the tax cuts are made even more precarious by the disastrous economic policies which the Government has pursued and continues to pursue. The Government is unable to make significant spending cuts to offset the initial effects of the tax cuts. Instead, it announces new spending programs. Generally, tax cuts are a good thing. However, those which are implemented in this Bill represent. much too little much too late. They will be eroded by the effects of inflation and interest rates.",35
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,38
30,Mr SAUNDERSON,Unknown,"1 support the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill. I want to make a couple of points in regard to the issues that have been raised. I refer in particular to the matter of bracket creep, or fiscal drag. I think it is important to remember that it is not only the Opposition that is prepared to argue policy in relation to this issue, and if people think that then they are being quite deliberately misled by the Opposition. The simple argument is whether tax scales are indexed or whether they· are adjusted on a periodical basis to take into account the effect of fiscal drag or bracket creep-whichever term one prefers. The Opposition parties were in government for 30 of the past 39 or 40 years but they did not opt for indexation of the tax scale. Members opposite had numerous opportunities to introduce tax indexation, but the respective Treasurers have chosen not to do so. They used exactly the same principle as ours-that is, to adjust the tax scales on a periodical basis to take account of the impact of inflation. It is nothing more than waffle on the part of members opposite to stand up here and argue about the impact of bracket creep. I draw to the attention of the House the points made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when he introduced the tax package earlier this year. As he pointed out then, the impact of fiscal drag or bracket creep has been more than offset by the tax package that the Government has introduced. We have been in government since 1983, and had we had tax indexation the community would be receiving less in terms of tax reduction than what we are providing in this statement. People are getting more back now than they would have under tax indexation. The argument put forward in this respect is a nonsense argument. The Government has made an adjustment to take account of inflation, and I think that on that score people ought to realise that they are better off now than they would be under the sorts of policies that are being hinted at by the Opposition-policies which members opposite are not prepared to commit themselves to implementing. Another point about tax cuts is that people should consider the record of the Government in that area. Since coming to office the Government has adjusted the tax scales on several occasions. The benefits from those tax cuts have been left in the pockets of taxpayers. There was the famous occasion in more recent times, when members opposite were in government, where tax cuts were offered prior to an election but immediately withdrawn once they were elected. So, they cannot be trusted to follow through in terms of their policy. The ,shadow Treasurer, the honourable  up here earlier and argued about the effects of inflation, the cost of housing, and the economic policies of the Government, and indicated how he thought they were wrong. However, putting aside all of his platitudes about the impact on the \.!ommunity and the home owner, we find that if we ask the honourable member serious questions about his alternative, his solution involves a monetary policy the same as ours. At best he can simply say that that policy might be marginally tighter than ours. That would mean that under a Liberal government interest rates might be slightly higher and there might be a greater chance of a depression. The honourable member can provide no other solution to these problems. In fact, he knows full well that the monetary policy that the Government is implementing is the same as that which members opposite would attempt to implement-and, I might say, with some exceptions. The Government's policy is structured around an attempt to ensure that we do not impact on employment and that people's living standards are improved, while trying to rein in the economy. We know that when tough times come the Opposition's policy is to take the easy stance-to implement monetary policy and not worry about its impact. The Opposition's approach is not to worry about how much unemployment occurs or whether a severe depression is created. Its idea is to implement monetary policy as hard and as quickly as possible. During the two years prior to the Labor Government's coming to office unemployment more than doubled and it reached the 700,000 mark. In other words, 350,000 people were putout of jobs in the last two years of the previous Liberal-National Government. That is a terrible and shocking record to have to live with: the only way that that Government could manage the economy was to create misery and poverty for hundreds of thousands of Australians. That was the only way that it could deal with the situation. Since the present Government has been in office, and in the unquestionably hard times that we have been going through, we have still been able to create 1.3 million jobs in Australia, with nearly 90 per cent of those being in the private sector. That represents an increase of 20 per cent in employment during our six years in office. We have been able to implement socially correct policies to help improve the lot of people on low incomes in Australia. We have introduced policies aimed at helping families to better their position. The aim of all these policies has been to promote a fairer and more just society. Much of this has been achieved because of the Government's ability to have an accord with the trade union movement. The Opposition sneers at the prospect of getting a substantial group in the community working together with the Government. An economic policy that actually works is sneered at by members opposite. Their solution is that there should not be any deals with the trade union movement, with the working people of Australia. They believe that any controls in this area should be thrown away and that there should be open warfare in which those who are strong and powerful will go out and win their wage rises and do all right in the world, while those who are weak will be left to suffer the impact of mismanagement of the economy, with unemployment rife and worse conditions overall for the community at large. When talking about the overall policy of the Government, I think it is important to consider the areas that have been improved since the Government has been in office. This does involve an overall package. It is not just a question of tax cuts and wage rises, and so forth. Other issues have to be tailored into the program. For example, we have introduced Medicare, a universal and fairer health scheme, to ensure that those people who had no cover at all, who could not afford to go to the doctor and who could not afford basic health care, were covered. Now all Australians are covered. This is a fairer system and it does not discriminate against people on lower incomes. Further, in terms of the first home owners scheme, more than 300,000 people have been assisted with buying homes which they would not otherwise have been able to afford. Because of that scheme, low to moderate income earning families now have their own homes.",38

34,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Does the Prime Minister agree with the proposition that major statements of policy by Australia's representative to the United Nations must accurately reflect Government policy? If so, why has the Prime Minister now admitted that the recent speech by Ambassador Wilenski in New York attacking Israel's human rights record could have been more balanced? Was Ambassador Wilenski's speech cleared in Canberra before its delivery? What steps are now being taken, in the light of the Prime Minister's admission that the speech was flawed, for a more proper and balanced explanation to be given before the United Nations General Assembly?",40
35,Mr HAWKE,Unknown,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The speech was cleared by the Foreign Minister . I have indicated to the Foreign Minister, and he has accepted, that the speech was inadequate in that, while the reason for vote was properly put-that is, the concern that this Government shares with other governments about actions by the Israeli Government in the occupied territories-it was nevertheless not balanced in that, in my judgment, it did not properly take account of the fact that there is continuing violence against Israel in the difficulties that exist for the state of Israel. However, having said that that should have been in, I repeat that the vote was the correct vote. I regret, however, that the balancing paragraph, or paragraphs, was not in there. I think it should be understood-and I think the Leader of the Opposition does understand-that in these circumstances there is not the opportunity in explanation of vote, which is a relatively short procedure, to give a detailed, full account of the total position of this Government or any government in regard to all the issues that are being discussed by the Security Council. If the Ambassador had had the opportunity and if the forum was such as to enable a detailed exposition to be given, of course, I have no doubt that the sorts of considerations that I think should at least have been alluded to would have been developed, and developed at some length. That having been said, I regret that there was not that balance there. I have expressed that view to the Foreign Minister-and he accepts it-and it has been conveyed to the Ambassador. I am sure that, at the next appropriate opportunity when that is available, that absence of balance will be rectified. I have taken the opportunity of conveying that view to those in the Jewish community in Australia who have expressed their concern to me. I trust that it will be accepted by them. Having said all that, I repeat what needs to be said, that we were in a position where the resolution before the Assembly deserved and warranted the support of the Australian Government. The vote, as the Leader of the Opposition may know, was 129 in favour; 2 against, the United States and Israel; and one abstention, Liberia. In expressing the view that I put, without qualification, that I believe the statement was unfortunately unbalanced in the way I have said, I do not want to be taken as indicating that the vote was not in the circumstances the appropriate vote. NA",40
36,Mr KERR,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Employment, Education and Training indicate whether the latest labour force statistics confirm continued growth in employment? Has this growth been uniform across Australia? In particular, what are the trends in Tasmania?",41
37,Mr DA WKINS,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Denison for his question. He is quite right to point to the very great success this Government has had in terms of job creation and the reduction of unemployment. We have indeed made this our No.1 priority ever since taking office in 1983. It has seen the creation of some 1.3 million jobs. That is aggregate employment growth of 21 per cent during those years. If we look at the recent trends, which the honourable member invites me to do, we see that they reveal that employment growth is continuing steadily, with an increase of 3.2 per cent over the 12-month period March to March or an additional 237,000 jobs. The growth across the States has been generally positive over the last 12 months, with increases amongst the mainland States ranging from half a per cent to 6.6 per cent. There is, however-and I regret to point this out to the honourable member-one exception. That, of course, is Tasmania, where there has actually been a decline of 3.19 per cent in employment in the 12-month period March to March. Tasmania has performed relatively poorly over the period since 1983. I mentioned that the national employment growth figure over the period since March 1983 has been around 21 per cent. In Tasmania it has, regrettably, been only half that. It is perhaps important to remember that just before the period that I am mentioning-in 1982-the Premier was going to the polls saying: This election is all about jobs and security. Our first priority will be to restore economic management and to create jobs for Tasmanians. If that is what people thought they were voting for back then, I am afraid they have been badly let down by that particular Government. Tasmanians have been voting again recently, only this time they have been voting with their feet. It is very sorry to record that in the 12 months to May 1987-and these are the most recent figures we have available-there was net migration of young people, 20 to 24-year-olds, out of Tasmania. That obviously indicates what these young people think in terms of their job prospects in Tasmania under Premier Gray. As the honourable member for Denison would know, Tasmania used to export apples; now it exports its future. CONSUMER PRICE·INDEX FIGURES  urer whether it is a fact that on 31 January this year Mr Tim Skinner, the First Assistant Statistician responsible for the consumer price index, said that there was no disquiet in the Australian Bureau of Statistics concerning the measure of the CPr. Why did the Government wait until the disastrous December quarter inflation figure before contacting the Statistician about a review of the CPI? Is it a fact that, of the five different measures for the treatment of housing costs, the debt profile method selected by the Government produced the lowest rate of inflation during the past two years?",41
38,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"First, I am not aware of the quotation which the honourable member refers to but I am aware of the gross inaccuracy of that part at the end of the honourable member's question where he says that the procedure which has now been· adopted, the debt profile procedure, was adopted by the Government. It was not adopted by the Government; it was adopted by the Statistician. We have seen a constant and relentless campaign on the part of this Opposition to denigrate and attack statutory officers who are appointed to those statutory offices in order that they can not only display but also exercise the' independence which they are called upon to exercise. It is not just the Statistician; the Statistician just happens to be the latest in a long line of statutory officers who have been subjected to this cowardly attack from this Opposition. It has attacked the Commissioner for Taxation on very many occasions. It has also attacked, in the most cowardly way, the Governor of the Reserve Bank. The Statistician made it very clear in his response to this question that he had been concerned about the earlier method of cal"" culating the effect of housing costs on the CPI. In any event, he was about to conduct a review. He has now undertaken that review. I would think that it is only the members of the Opposition, out of all of the commentators in Australia, who have singled themselves out as being the ones who do not think that the method that the Statistician has chosen, the debt profile method, is the most appropriate and accurate. That is totally baffling when we know that the former treatment was distorting the CPI in the way in which the Statistician has revealed. The Statistician revealed that the earlier method a was producing distorted result. How silly would it be for him, having realised that and knowing how important it is to have an accurate and well accepted CPI, to turn a blind eye to that distortion and say, 'It is a pity we made the wrong decision some time ago but we are going to leave it because we do not want to change it'? He realised the distortions were becoming serious. He therefore undertook the review. He has announced the results of the review. For those who are unaware of the reasons-and particularly for members of the Opposition who do not seem to be totally aware of the reasons-for the change that the Statistician has made, I table the information paper that the Statistician released. EX-PRISONERS OF WAR: NA",41
39,Mr UREN,Unknown,"I direct my question to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The Minister would be aware that 22,000 Australians were taken as prisoners of war by the Japanese 'by February 1942. He would also be aware that only 14,000 of those returned to Australia at the cessation of the hostilities. The Minister would now be aware that fewer than 6,000 of these former prisoners of war now survive. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in the April 1989 edition of the Medical Journal of Australia on the postwar mortality among Australian World War II prisoners of the Japanese? The article is the result of a comprehensive study by a group of eminent Australian doctors and statisticians and examines the impact of detention as prisoners of war on post-war survival and disease specific mortality. It looks at the mortality rate of Australian prisoners of the Japanese and compares this with those veterans who served in the same theatre of war but were not prisoners of war. The findings of the study state in part that from 1945 to 1959 the ex-prisoner of war group had estimated mortality rates which were four times greater than those of other servicemen. The article goes on to point out that former prisoners of war of the Japanese continue to have a significantly increased risk of death compared with other servicemen who served in the south-west Pacific and South East Asia. I ask the Minister whether he and his Department will examine the evidence ' contained in this article as well as 'the complaints levelled in my grievance speech of 20 October 1988 and in the representations made by the Ex-Prisoners of War Association. Would he and his Department recommend that Cabinet consider the provision of' adequate compensation to those ex-prisoners of war of Japan who require urgent assistance and the establishment of a special pension for such ex-prisoners of war calculated at a higher rate than the extreme disablement allowance available to all veterans but granted on the same prinCiples? '",42
40,Mr HUMPHREYS,Unknown,"The honourable member has raised in this House in recent months concerns about the well-being of former prisoners of war of the Japanese. In November last year he asked the Prime Minister whether the Government would give consideration to a survey into the health, future treatment and remuneration of this group of ex-service men and women. In responding to that question the Prime Minister said: . . . nobody in this House or elsewhere can or will dispute the unbelievable severity of the conditiorts endured by those who were held captive by the Japanese during the Second World War. I endorse those comments. There is no doubt that many prisoners of war in Japanese hands were very badly treated and those who survived deserve the best consideration and treatment the repatriation system can offer. With regard to the preface to this question, I am aware of the study to which the honourable member refers. The study was conducted by researchers from the Australian National University and the Repatriation General Hospital Concord and drew on information up to 1983. The findings were that there was a high mortality rate for exprisoners of war in the early post-war years, in the first five to 14 years after the end of World War II. In these early post-war years the ex-prisoners of war were likely to have died from tuberculosis, cirrhosis of accidents and suicide shortly after their return. After this time the difference in ·the mortality rate diminished. There is now only a marginal difference in the rate of mortality between surviving ex-prisoners of war and the veterans control group. The study did not comment on the health of living exprisoners of war. This study and other material have been reviewed by officers of my Department and others who are conducting a major review of the repatriation health system. As part of that wider ranging review the team is looking at ways in which the health of ex-prisoners of war can be maintained and enhanced. The honourable member is also aware of the other work being done by my Department to address some of the particular concerns which have been raised by him. When I have that report from the health review team and the other material to which I referred I will be in a position to put a submission to the Government. In the meantime, I will keep the honourable member for Reid informed of the developments and findings which may be of interest to him. MONETARY ,POLICY",42
41,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Acting Treasurer. The Acting Treasurer would be aware that the Reserve Bank of Australia engages in open market operations to tighten monetary PQlicy. Since April last year rises in unofficial cash rates bank bill rates, have preceded rises in mortgage interest rates. Can the Acting Treasurer explain to the House how the mechanics of open market operations lead to a rise in these money market interest rates which, in turn, flow through to home loan interest rates?",43
42,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"I am happy to arrange for the honourable member to have a briefing if he likes. The honourable member has this nostalgic recollection of the days before the exchange rate controls were removed when he and, the then Treasurer had great fun sitting around in the then Treasurer's office manipulating exchange rates and so on. I have nothing to add to what I said yesterday. The fact is that the Government is pursuing a policy of firm monetary policy and the activities of the Reserve Bank are the liver, consistent with that ambition. NA",43
43,Mr SAWFORD,Unknown,Can the Mjnister for Employment and Education Services advise the House of the result of the Government's changes to the student assistance programs?,43
44,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,"The background of the Government's policies in relation to student assistance adjustments was the quite disgraceful retention rates in this nation when this Government came to power. We found that only 36 per cent of young people in the secondary system stayed within the system to year 12. That situation was quite disgraceful by international comparisons and' we chose to see what we could d,o to improve that rate dramatically. One of the things that we did was to introduce Austudy, which is the Government's income support scheme for young people. In addition, we sought to align Austudy for 16to 20-year-olds with income support for unemployed young people of the same ages. In addition, in 1989 we have taken the first steps to align Austudy for older students with the unemployment benefit rates for those age groups. The outcome of those measures is there for all to see. We now have 330,000 young people and others on Austudy throughout the nation, which compares with 152,000 in 1983. At the secondary level the improvement has been quite dramatic. The number of students who were receiving income supand in port when the Liberal Government was in power under Malcolm Fraser, was 53,000. It is anticipated that 150,000 students will be assisted this year. This has helped to lift dramatically the retention rates. Last year, retention rates were about 58 per cent na.tionally and we confidentially expect that we will meet our target of lifting retention rates to 65 per cent by 1992. Regrettably, however, the improvement has not been uniform across the nation. We have done our bit. I want to refer to the situation in Tasmania, where 32.4 per cent of secondary students aged 16 years or more are On Austudy compared with a national average take-up rate of 28.6 per cent. That situation has arisen from the steps taken by this Government. Unfortunately, however, the Tasmanian retention rates have not improved-Mr Smith-Oh, they have so.",43
45,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,"They have not improved anything like the national improvement in retention rates. In fact, the retention rates in Tasmania are still, dismally for the nation, in the mid-thirties. The rate is about 35 per cent, which is appalling when compared with the improvements we have seen across the nation. Tasmania has the worse retention rates of any State, and the outcome of that is that it has the lowest skill development of any State. The consequence of this is that it has the highest level of youth. unemployment-almost double that national average. It is quite clear from these figures that seven years of neglect by the Gray Liberal Government has led to stagnation in Tasmania. That cannot be denied by anybody. Tasmania urgently needs a caring government. The problem needs to be tackled in Tasmania the way we have tackled the problem nationally. We have got to get rid of the 'Tasmalaise' and the only way to do that is to ensure that Tasmania gets a new government on 13 May, a government which will concern itself with the issues which are of concern to the people of Tasmania.

46,Mr BLUNT,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. Is it a fact that the recent announcement of a five-year strategy for national highways and arterials is the third time that this same roads program has been announced? Is it also a fact· that this latest announcement contributes no additional funds to roads but perpetuates the reduced funding of the Australian centennial roads program? Further, is it a fact that changed funding priorities for dangerous spots on highways were achieved by taking funds off other areas?",44
47,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"We would not say that the announcement was made three times, but those people who heard the announcement applauded the fact that we have committed $2.5 billion to the national highway system over the next five years.",44
48,Mr HAWKE,Unknown,They might like to hear it again.,44
49,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"The Prime Minister suggests that they may well like to hear it again, so let me inform them again: $2.5 billion has been committed to the national highway system by this Government over the next five years. There has never been a period in the history of this Commonwealth when the level of Federal funding for roads has been at that level. It is absolutely unprecedented. When that figure of $2.5 billion for national highways is combined with the $2.5 billion for national arterials, which I have announced previously on at least one occasion, we have a total of $5 billion. When we include as well the amount the Government has committed for local government and State arterials over this five-year period, it will be noticed that it is getting better"" Every time there is an announcement, the announcement gets better. The amount of $5 billion has been committed already, as well as $1 billion fQr State arterials and local roads. Is it any wonder that six State governments, two territorial governments and 850 local governments are applauding the Hawke Federal Government for this great contribution which has been made. the shadow Minister also asked a question about the adjustments that may have been made in connection with the Hume Highway. Yes, there have been adjustments. Let me be perfectly clear about this: those people who understand the nature of those changes also applaud them. We have made sure that those towns along the Hume Highway which have been subjected to such heavy traffic flooding through them, creating dangers, noise and pollution, will have that traffic removed. We ,shall get the traffic out, of those towns. Not only that, but we will do it by 1993-94, as the Opposition knows. It allowed this problem to persist. We made it perfectly clear that we would overcome those problems, and overcome them we will. Not only will we take that traffic out of those towns, but we will also clean up. the Cullerin deviation problem as well. There is over 30 kilometres of road involved and we will have that completed by 1983-84-1 mean 1993! That is even better than some of the claims I made before. We will also duplicate the Hume Highway from Melbourne to Wodonga. There has never been a more realisable program of road construction in' the history of this Commonwealth. We rejoice in it and the people applaud it. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE: NA",44
50,Mr LES SCOTT,Unknown,Has the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel seen recent reports of statements by the honourable member for MCPherson about Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) pilot resignations? Can the Minister confirm whether these reported figures are correct and can he provide any advice of measures which the Government may be taking to deal with this problem?,45
51,Mr SIMMONS,Unknown,"I have seen the reports to which the honourable member for Oxley refers. The honourable member for McPherson seems to make a habit of making fairly outrageous claims. The latest one is that 51 experienced pilots have resigned from the RAAF in the past few weeks. As usual, his claims have very litt,le to do with reality. I point out for the benefit of the House the facts ,of the matter. Nine pilots-not 51-have tendered their resignations in the past four weeks. These resignations will take effect in 1989-90. Ninety-nine pilots will resign during the 1988-89 financial year: This compares with a figure of 123 pilots during 1987-88, and, to date, 16 pilots, including the nine that I mentioned, have tendered resignations to take effect during the next financial year. The sole contribution of. the honourable member for MCPherson is to continually beat up the issue. I know he does not like my saying that, but I - il1 make the point again because that is what he does: he continually beats up the issue. He gets his facts wrong and he does not like to have that correction pointed out to him. He continually maligns the very high level of capability of which the RAAF is justly proud. Of course, as usual, he is devoid of any real suggestions of his own or of his party. I can assure the honourable member for Oxley and this Ho-se that the Government does not suffer from the same dearth of constructive thoughts and initiatives. Quite frankly, some of the many initiatives that have been developed over the last 12 months are a tribute which this House should acknowledge to the contribution made by my predecessor. The much maligned pilot bonus scheme ensured the retention of more than 100 RAAF pilots. The flying allowance has been more than doubled to up to $11,000 a year. The return of service for pilots has been increased from six years to eight years. Selected pilots who wish to continue to fly rather than do staff jobs can do so. Our pilots get to fly the very best and latest equipment. I wonder whether the honourable member for MCPherson has' some sort of option that he has not told us about, a scheme to sacrifice some of this equipment. Perhaps he wants to sacrifice part of the FA18 program or the submarines. He never tells us exactly what he has in mind. Other initiatives such as lateral recruitment, which has been criticised by the Opposition, are serious options that the Government is considering. They are all positive measures and in sharp contrast to the negative comments we continually hear in carping criticism from the Opposition. NA  rected to the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. In view of the Minister's interest in noise pollution caused by getting traffic out of the towns, I remind him that land-based transport costs represent 16 per cent of total production costs in the grain industry. Does the Minister believe that there are economic advantages in an unrestricted system allowing free road and rail competition for grain traffic? If so, what would be the size of the net benefits which might flow through to the community?",45
52,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"I am aware of some of the difficulties that have been created in the Opposition parties not only on this question but also on other questions concerning the grain industry generally. I should make it perfectly clear that that decision concerning the deregulation of the grain industry, and particularly grain marketing, handling and storage, was not taken in isolation from all the considerations that the Government had given to the need to bring about more competitive circumstances in Australia and to bring about fairly fundamental restructuring as .well. The Government has made it perfectly clear that questions of that kind would become a fundamental element as far as its third term was concerned. The decision was not taken in isolation. It was certainly not taken, as honourable members will appreciate, in the absence of substantial and significant advice that was available. Those who have expressed some concern about the implications that the decision might have should keep in mind the fact that shortly after that the New South Wales Grain Handling Authority, for example, was calling tenders for the handling of grain transport in New South Wales. Road transport tendered as well as rail, and rail won. So those people who have been claiming that as a result of that change there will be a significant changeover of grain transport from rail to road simply do not understand that, to a very large extent, the network which exists lends itself better to bulk handling of grain carried by rail. That is the evidence so far. We believe that will be the effect. In addition to that, there is also the need for us to ensure that whatever transport mode is being used in Australia, it will be subject to sufficient competition to ensure that it becomes efficient and measures up. If it does not do that, then those grain producers that the Opposition purports to be concerned about will not be picking up their extra $10 a tonne-that is the estimated benefit to them-and Australia, as a basic and important primary exporting country, will not get the benefits which can accrue. So there are mutual benefits right across the nation as a result of the decisions being made by this Government. The Opposition,in its better moments, will agree with this. NA",45
53,Ms CRAWFORD,Unknown,Is the Minister for Social Security aware of reports that single parents are better off on benefits than in the work force? Can the Minister provide any facts to the Parliament in relation to this matter?,46
54,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Forde· has a particular interest in the concerns of sole parents and recognises the fact that the Government has made a number of changes. Whatever the position may have been in 1983, the current situation is that sole parents are very much better off in the work force than they are likely to be on a pension. That is not to say that there have not been significant improvements in the adequacy of sole parent pensions, the associated child allowances, the level of rent assistance, which will increase next month, the access to a vast increase in the number of child-care places and so on. There have been very dramatic improvements for sole parents who remain, for various reasons, within the social security system. The thrust of Government policy has been to do everything it can to ensure that there are measures in place to provide very positive incentives for sole parents to leave the pension and move into the work force. Let me just summarise some of those initiatives. First of all, in the April statement there"" was the equivalent of a $20 a: week tax cut for sole parents around the level of aver""age weekly earnings. Secondly, there was a substantial increase in the sole parent rebate, and for the first time that rebate was indexed. Thirdly, in 1987 the Government eased the income test for sole parents by $10 to $40 and doubled the child disregard from $6 to $12 per child. The Government has also introduced the family allowance supplement, which now goes to a very large number of sole parent pensioners. The effect of that supplement is to provide a very positive incentive for sole parents to move from benefit into the work force in the sense that they can carry that family allowance payment-which is now $43, and $34 for younger children-into the work force in terms of their level of income. In respect of child support, we have also ensured that the free area is not filled up with any maintenance payments that might be received by sole parents. The net effect of those changes provides very substantial incentives indeed. Effectively, if one simply takes into account the changes in relation to the April economic statement alone, the reality is that sole ents with incomes close to $20,000 are, in net terms, not likely to pay tax. In other words, if transfer payments and tax deductions that are open to them are taken into account, they are not effectively net taxpayers. This is an extremely important question. From time to time right around Australia assertions are made, sometimes by representative groups of sole parents, that the Government somehow has not done enough to ease poverty traps and ensure that sole parents are better off in the work force. Nothing could be further from the truth. No government, not only in this country but also in many other countries, has done more to ensure that sole parents are better off in the work force. We have attempted to meet that challenge in an extraordinarily positive way. EX-PRISONERS OF WAR: NA",46
55,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Following the question of the honourable member for Reid, I ask a question of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Is it a fact that the Government has imposed a $5,000 annual levy on ex-prisoners of war in nursing homes even when they are in nursing homes for war related conditions? Is it a fact that there are ex-prisoners who are merchant mariners who are not yet covered by the Veterans' Entitlement Act? In view of the fact that the Minister and his Department recently paid one consultant alone over $170,000, principally to chair some meetings, will he expedite the Government inquiry into the entitlements position of ex-members of the merchant navy and speed up his response in relation to ex-prisoners of war before it is altogether too late?",47

74,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,Unknown,My question is directed to the Minister for Defence and concerns naval redeployment. What is the status of action being taken to enable half the Royal Australian Navy's fleet to be based in Western Australia? Might I say that this is a very important move. Is the RAN paying proper regard to environment requirements related to the expansion of the base of HMAS Stirling?,48
75,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Basically, the answer is yes. Just recently a public environmental report on stage 2 of the HMAS Stirling development was released and it is now available for public comment until the first week in June. Our desire is to get ahead with stage 2 as rapidly as possible. The environmental report outlines a number of steps necessary to protect the environment near the base. Where possible, we will be upholding those. We will hold a series of discussions with the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories after we have been able to assess that report. When that is complete, we will refer it to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I remind the honourable gentleman, although I am sure he does not need to be reminded, that about $135.6m worth of expenditure is now under way there to provide more berthing facilities and accommodation and engineering support for the construction program that will span the next six years. Stage 3 of the Stirling base is expected to be completed by the turn of the century. When all of that is finished, it will allow up to half the surface fleet to be based there, or more, having regard to the submarines and a substantial number of other types of ship as well. The honourable gentleman has no reason to fear that we will not take serious account of the environmental issues that will arise from this activity. We will be dealing with them but we do not anticipate that they will pose any inhibitions to what is a very substantial and dramatic 9hange to the dispersal of our Defence Force. NA",48

80,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member may proceed.,49
81,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"Mr Acting Speaker, you will recall that yesterday I asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which followed a question asked by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe). Subsequently, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) asked a question on the same subject of the Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). My question related to the taxation rebate for pensioners. I will very briefly state the words that I used. I asked: When Cabinet made the decision which was announced in the Treasurer's April Statement regarding a change in the taxation arrangements for pensioners to apply as from 1 July this year, what consideration was given to the pensioner tax rebate presently in place? Further on I asked: . . . what advice should members of parliament give to their pensioner constituents in relation to income earned as from I July this year. The Prime Minister undertook to provide me with an answer to that question. He has since addressed a letter to me in which he enclosed a press release put out yesterday by the Acting Treasurer, the Hon. J. S. Dawkins, M.P., headed 'PAYE arrangements for aged and service pensioners'. The Acting Treasurer said in that statement: It is regrettable that the Opposition has today sought to confuse the aged community about the major tax benefi ts for pensioners . . .",49
82,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,I rise on a point of order. There is no explanation as to where the honourable member is being misrepresented?,49

84,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"Thank you for pointing that out, Mr Acting Speaker. Indeed, yesterday's Hansard is not yet available, so I had to quote from my copy of the 'greens'. As I said, the Acting Treasurer said: It is regrettable that the Opposition has today sought to confuse the aged community about the major tax benefits for pensioners announced in the April statement. He also said: Only a very small number of aged pensioners pay tax by PAVE instalments. When I asked my question I used the term 'pensioner' in the sense of the green card with which we are all familiar and which all pensioners carry. It is put out by the Department of Social Security and is headed 'Pensions (Aged, Invalid, Wives, Carers, Widows and Supporting Parents) Benefit'. My question referred to pensioners-not aged pensioners. I was referring to pensioners in general. I was not trying to frighten the aged community as claimed by the Acting Treasurer, and indeed my question is still not answered.",49

92,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received a letter from the Deputy Leader of the Op inite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The unprecedented action in changing the measurement of the Consumer Price Index halfway through the regular review period. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places- ' .  Acting Speaker, on behalf of the Opposition I have written to you that there is a need to discuss this matter of public importance, namely, 'The unprecedented action'-as it is-'in changing the measurement of the Consumer Price Index halfway through the regular review period'. I have done this because the consumer price index (CPI) figure to be announced tomorrow is unquestionably a fiddle. The change in the measurement of mortgage interest charges in the CPI is unquestionably a result of political pressurepressure applied by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to the Australian Government Statistician. That is a strong statement, but I make it quite deliberately. Tomorrow's figure will undoubtedly understate the rate of inflation. This is probably an appropriate day on which to write to you, Mr Acting Speaker, seeking to discuss a matter of public importance in terms of the fiddle, cheating and manipulation that is going on in respect of the CPI. It is an appropriate day riot only because of the impact of that figure but because in one of our newspapers I see that one of the birth dates listed for today is that of one Niccolo Machiavelli. When the December quarter figure was released, we had a repeat of the normal propagation from the Treasurer: it is never the Government's fault when the figure is bad; it is always the fault of the system or it is someone else's fault. On this occasion, it was of course the cost of housing. Why did house prices rise so spectaCUlarly in this country? It was for two basic reasons: firstly, the Government's gyrations on negative gearing and, secondly, because of the capital gains tax. There is no doubt that they, are the two fundamental factors. I happened to say as an aside during a speech I gave this morning that when people gather together in a commllnity, and for all in this day and age they want health services and the like, there are three basic elements that are required, at least at the margin, for a civilised existence. They are food, clothing and, shelter. When the cost of a roof over one's hyad became astronomical, this Government decided to fiddle the books. In fact, the Government has made the figure that is coming out tomorrow not reflect the accurate measure of inflation and the consumer price index today; rather, it will be an average price increase in the housing component over the past eight years. Let me go back a little in time. To ensure that the CPI continues to measure accurately the rate of inflation of consumer goods and services, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) undertakes regular quinquennial reviews of the measurement of the CPI, the last of which. was completed in December 1986. When the Bureau completed this review there was no intention to make any change midway through the five-year period, that is, until the, Treasurer intervened. Indeed, in the letter I have written to you, Mr Acting Speaker, I used the expression 'the unprecedented action in changing the measurement. . . '. Never since we have had this statistic and the reviews put down has there been a change in any element of the mix in the period between reviews. In the 1986 review the Bureau examined two methods of treating mortgage interest charges. One was termed the 'simple revaluation' method and the other was the 'debt profile' approach. The ABS. states: Studies at the time showed that the two methods could be expected to produce very similar results. As an aside-and I do not blame the Statistician or the ABS-I state that I disagree with that because one of the methods reflects immediacy and the other is taken over time; so there must be a differential. In the end, after studying the matter in 1986 and after the ABS had consulted with a wide range of community groups-including the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI)-the ABS chose the simple revaluation method and no-one complained. No-one said that it was inaccurate and no-one called for a change-until 31 January this year when the CPI figure for the December quarter was released. It was, to put it mildly, a shocking result. The CPI had increased by 2.1 per cent in the December quarter alone. So who panicked? It was our old mate the Grim Reaper, the man who told us that inflation this year would be 4t per cent. He saw the figure rising astronomically and he staked what was left of his shrinking credibility on his anti-inflation strategy and said that inflation would fall to 4.5 per cent. The December quarter CPI well and truly torpedoed the Budget forecast. Unquestionably a major factor in the massive increase in the inflation rate was the sharp rise in housing prices which occurred in the latter half of 1988. The Treasurer could not wish that away, but he could fiddle it away for the future by changing the method whereby the indices for our cost of living were measured. I have indicated the reasons for the risethe gyrations on negative gearing and capital gains tax. Most governments, if they have a preoccupation with effective economic management and the betterment of the Australian community, would seek to rectify the economy, but did the Treasurer do that? No, instead of putting economic policies in place to reduce the rate of inflation, the Treasurer imposed pressure on the ABS to fiddle the CPI. Once again, that is a strong statement that the Treasurer put pressure on the Statistician to fiddle the CPI. I felt sorry for the StatisticiilO. He was good enough to attend my National Press Club address when I responded to the April economic statement and I credited him with the Opposition parties' respect for him. The Statistician has served well parties on both sides. There was no doubt from the Statistician's press conference that morning, when he announced the changes, that he had difficulty recalling who proposed the changes. I understood his difficulty, and I will give my reasons in a moment when I quote from the Treasurer's own press conference on 31 January when, unquestionably, he hedged in respect of how these changes came about. I will quote a few of the questions put to the Treasurer when he announced that he was foreshadowing a change. The journalist put it to the Treasurer, 'Do you always talk to the Statistician after these figures are released, Mr Keating?'. The Treasurer replied, 'No. Not always'. The journalist asked, 'What happened? Did you call him over today?'. The Treasurer said, 'No. I just spoke to him on the phone, but I have spoken to him on other occasions'. The journalist said, 'Why did you speak to him today?'. The Treasurer replied, 'Why I spoke to him today is because there is an obvious distortion here'. He picked up the phone then. The journalist asked, 'But you just said he raised it, not you. That is contradictory isn't it?'. The Treasurer said, 'No, it's not'. The journalist said, 'So you are telling me you rang him because of it, yet you say he raised it'. The Treasurer said, 'I rang him but he said that he recognised it as a problem here'. The journalist commented, 'I'll have to think about that one'. Then there was another somewhat inaudible and appropriate answer and the journalist said, 'But you raised the problem?'. The Treasurer said, 'I raised it with him but he was aware of it because in discussions this morning with his office and my office about some of the disaggregation of the numbers he was aware of I think what we regarded as a concern'. A little later on the journalist said, 'Did you speak to him about it last quarter?' and the Treasurer replied, 'No. But I think there was communication between my office and his about it and also between the Treasury and his office aQout it'. The journalist said, 'Did he express disquiet then?'. The Treasurer answered, 'No. But it is a measure which he has constructed and I think he probably wanted to see how it went'. Anyone reading that would know that the Treasurer lent on the Statistician to change the measurement. The corroboration of that was given later that day when one Mr Tim Skinner, who is the First Assistant Statistician, did an interview on PM with Peter Martin. He said, among other things, 'The Bureau still sees home costs and home ownership costs as being an important part of consumer expenditure and we see it as essential that they be included in the cpr. Peter Martin said, 'In your view, is there anything wrong with the means that you have chosen?' and Mr Tim Skinner said, 'Nothing that we're aware of'. Peter Martin asked, 'Are you conducting this inquiry merely as a result of a request from the Treasurer?'. Tim Skinner answered, 'Well, we can always look at the performance of the consumer pri-e index'. Peter Martin said, 'I mean, is there any disquiet within the Bureau about the performance?', and l)m Skinner replied, 'No'. The man in charge of this, straight, blunt and to the point, in a word of one syllable, renders a lie all that the Treasurer has said about the need to change the CPI and the measurement of housing within it. The harsh reality is that for the first time we have had a measurement changed during a period of review. For the first time a government has lent on an independent statutory officer, such as the Statistician, to have it so changednot to fix the reasons that have brought the astronomical changes about in the economic problems facing Australia but to create a fiddle, to cook, the books, to make it appear that the Government may be doing what it is not, namely, getting inflation down. That interview nails as a lie the remarks of the Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), today that the ABS was concerned.",50
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to withdraw that statement.  'a lie'?,52
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"That is correct.  ' that the Acting Treasurer was incorrect in answer to a question of mine today, when he said that the ABS was concerned about this and sought to rectify it. I asked, 'Does the Minister recall the reply of the man in charge, Mr Tim Skinner, the First Assistant Statistician, when asked whether there is any disquiet within the Bureau about the performance of Tim Skinner?'. The answer was, 'No'. So it is not just a matter involving the Treasurer at his respected press conferences, but in this House today the Acting Treasurer has misled this Parliament, and through it the people of Australia who are going to be presented tomorrow with the fiddle that I am referring to. An unprecedented review between reviews finally bore fruit, as we know, on 20 April with the Bureau's announcement that from the March quarter figure onwards-that is, the figure that comes out tomorrow-the debt profile approach would be adopted. Let me briefly tell honourable members about this debt profile approach, because it is different. It does not throw up the immediacy that the former method used. It involves taking a weighted average of home prices over eight years.   do not have to be Rhodes scholars, even if there is one spent one around this building, to know that instead of telling us the cost of housing and its impact today or in the previous quarter, he ought to tell us the average or a proportion thereof for the last eight years. The consequence of that is that it will feed in this unprecedented boom over the last two years into the CPI over the next eight years. This country is going to carry the consequence of this charade and fiddle over the next eight years, simply to try to make this Government look better. It is nothing to do with fixing the economy, nothing to do with addressing the living standards of Australians; it is simply to try to put on another suit that looks a little better. All this feeds in for the future. The question therefore is: Why did the Acting Treasurer in these circumstances seek to mislead the House today when he well knew, firstly, the impact in the years to come, and secondly, that what he said about the Statistician being concerned was simply incorrect? It comes down to this: the bureau will publish a March quarter CPI tomorrow, calculated using a debt· profile approach, and tomorrow's figure is the first of the fiddles. To make it worse, the official ABS quarterly inflation rate will be the increase in the index in the March quarter using the debt profile, compared to the December quarter using simple revaluation. In other words, we will have a comparison between March and December that compares oranges to lemons, not like with like. The net result, the quarterly figure, clearly will not only understate the true number but will also be completely illegitimate. It is quite clear therefore that tomorrow's figure is a fiddle simply designed to meet political ends. But the Government has not got away with it: its ploy has been seen through and it ought to explain its misleading to this Parliament.",52

100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The Acting Treasurer has withdrawn the statement.,53
101,Mr DA WKINS,Unknown,"I dispute that it is unparliamentary, but I withdraw it in any event. It matters little what this lightweight Deputy Leader has to say about me. It matters much more what he says in terms of impugning the reputation, honesty and integrity of the Australian Statistician. That is essentially what he is getting at, as I will prove in a moment from words which come directly from the Statistician. The point at issue in this debate is actually that the Opposition would like to have a higher consumer price index (CPI). The Opposition would like to have runaway inflation. It would like to continue the economic sabotage at which it is so practised so that it can ensure and encourage a higher rate of inflation because it thinks, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, that will create the circumstances and the times that will suit it, so that it might be able to sleaze its way into office behind the economic circumstances which it would like to see created in this country. The Opposition is disappointed at the success this Government has had in so many areas of its economic management. Unable to contest the success of this Government, it simply resorts to impugning the reputation and integrity of decent Commonwealth officials, statutory officials, who have their independence to exercise. This is not the first occasion and I dare say it will not be the last. Let me say absolutely that there is no question but that the review undertaken by Mr Ian Castles was at anyone's instigation but his own. His remarks were quoted in a newspaper of 21 April. He is reported as having said: The bureau's decision has been taken solely on the basis of statistical considerations, and in the interests of providirig the best possible CPI. He undertook that review, which led him to conclude that the CPI was, in fact, being distorted by the method that was being used for the treatment of mortgage interest charges. There are a number of methods that can be used. Before going into those alternative methods let me say what the Statistician said to me in a note which I received today. He said: I had ilt the timethis is the time that the last figures came outalready deCided that a review was necessary following 'an extensive discussion with the division head responsible for the CPI. That is what the Statistician is saying. That is what he is saying to me. Are Opposition members prepared to say 'now that he is a liar? They can throw charges around about the Treasurer and me, but are they prepared to say that the Statistician is lying to me? Are they prepared to call him a liar? Mr Reith-Do you call Skinner a liar?",53
102,Mr DAWKINS,Unknown,"I am interested only in what the statutory officer responsible for the Australian Bureau of Statistics says both publicly and to me. His simple point is that he' was by then aware that there was a divergence in terms of the CPI, calculated using the old method, and that which would have occurred using the debt profile method. The Bureau had been calculating an unofficial CPI, if you like, using the debt profile method. It was aware that there was a great divergence opening up between the two. Therefore, at the time of the announcement of the most recent figures, the Statistician decided to conduct a review and, as a result of that review, decided to change the method. He went on to say: It is of particular interest to note that the ABS has always preferred the debt profile method now adopted and was only persuaded to adopt the alternative because of its greater simplicity and criticisms of the preferred method by some major users. He goes on to say in another passage: It is one thing to adopt a second best approach for the sake of winning acceptance if the evidence shows it would make little difference. The point is that at that stage it was clear that it made little difference. He' goes on to say: It is another thing to persist with it when it clearly is giving the wrong results. So the Opposition is saying that it does not care if the CPI is wrong. It does not care whether the CPI had included in it a distorting element. It is interested only in getting the highest possible CPI that can be developed or produced. It is not interested in accuracy in terms of a proper measure of inflation; it is interested in distortions, just as its whole political conduct, its whole' political practice, is full of the most outrageous distortions. Opposition members' will continue to tell lies, to distort and to do all those things necessary to make points regardless of the facts and evidence to the contrary. It goes without saying how important it is that there should be an accurate CPI. The CPI is used by a large number of groups in the community. It is' used, of course, by the Government in calcUlating a number of benefits. Industry also has a number of important uses for the CPI. It is a responsibility of the Statistician to ensure that the CPI is accurate, and when he believes that it is becoming inaccurate, it is clearly his responsibility to try to make the correction. It would have been impossible for the Statistician to go back and correct earlier published CPI figures, but it was not impossible for him to review this matter and to make the changes as he announced in the document that he published a week or so ago. Honourable members do not have to listen just to me. I will quote from a very good article written by Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald in which he discusses this matter. He states: Andrew Peacock says it's unprecedent<?d for the Statistician to make such a significant change to the CPI method half-way through the normal five-year review period. That's true. But it's not a good enough reason to continue living with bum numbers . .only someone with a vested interest in high inflation figures would find that approach appealing. Touche! So how should the Statistician get the CPI back on track? Well, it would, be quite chaotic for him to revise the previously published figures. The CPI is never revised, for the good reason that it is used in too many contracts and pensions: The best way to rectify matters was to use the March quarter to get the index back to where it should be. In other words, Ross Gittins is saying that we need an accurate CPI and that this is the way - o get it. I do not think there is a single commentator or an economist in this country who supports the Opposition's position that we should persist with a CPI which turns wrong figures and which is, to use the Staton istician's words, clearly giving wrong results. But that appears to be the Opposition's position. It is not just a question of whether the figures are right or wrong; it is a question the underlying methodology which was the heart of the review undertaken by Statistician. The old method, the simple revaluation method, assumed that everyone with a home mortgage renegotiated that mortgage every quarter. That is not what h!lPpens. New mortgages are negotiated on continual basis, but the existing mortgages are not renegotiated in the normal course events every quarter. That is why it was so important for the Statistician, in his view, move to the debt profile method, which looked at the changes over time rather than looking at them quarter by quarter as though these massive changes were reflected in and every mortgage agreement between home buyer and bank. There is, therefore, a clear conceptual weakness in the old, simple recers valuation method. That is why, following his review, the Statistician decided to move the debt profile method. As a result of this change there will discontinuity between the old method and the new method. In the normal course of this events, that is something we would rather avoid. But why would one want to persist with a system which was wrong, which was producing wrong results, just for the purthey poses of continuity? The Statistician has cided that the best way is to fix it in this one-off way. That will be reflected in the figures h- produces tomorrow. The Opposimake tion is keen to try to disparage the Statistiested·in. cian and to try to disparage the integrity of the CPI solely because it has a vested est, it believes, in ensuring that there is higher recording of inflation, one which would assist the economic sabotage in which it so willingly and gleefully engages. The most tasteless part, of the Deputy Leader's contribution was the way in which he persisted with this absolute figment of his imagination, that the Statistician allowed himself to be leaned on and, therefore, subsequently, when he denies that he was leaned on, is essentially telling untruths. This is, of course, a quite consistent pattern of behavup iour on the part of the Opposition-to pick a statutory officer, an officer appointed by the Governor General pursuant to an Act passed by this Parliament. On being appointed to such statutory office, an officer is called upon to exercise his independence and of judgment on these matters. W,e have seen at members of the Opposition engage in an the attack on other statutory officers. This is not the first time that, Opposition members have attacked the Australian Statistician. Indeed, when they decided to make a complaint about the behaviour of the Stata istician in relation to the household expenditure survey, a couple of the Opposition of backbenchers decided to go the Ombudsman. It is interesting to note that only yesterday to the Ombudsman provided his report in relation to those complaints and they were absolutely rejected. I hope that that might be a lesson to the Opposition: members opposite each cannot simply go around impugning statutory officers. All the officers whom they have attacked have been very distinguished offiand that is particularly so in the case of Mr Castles. I know him very well, as he was to the Secretary of the Department of Finance when I was the Minister. I know that he be a would be absolutely scrupulous in the way in which he exercised his independence in role., But, of course, reputations matter little to the Opposition. Members opposite will attack the Statistician, they will attack the Commission of Taxation, and, because think he is too tough on business, they dewill attack the Governor of the Reserve Bank. No cowardly or disreputable conduct is beyond this Opposition. So long as it can a political point, that is all it is inter",54
103,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"We interhave just had to endure one of the most a pathetic defences of what is really quite improper behaviour on the part of the Government in respect of one of the key economic parameters in this country, namely, the consumer price index (CPI). I refer in particular to the wording of the matter of public importance presently before the House: . . . the unprecedented action in changing the measurement of the consumer price index half-way through the regular review period. To be clear, I point out that although this is the first time that the Government has changed the CPI half-way through the review period, it is not the first time that the Government has set out to fiddle it. The CPI was fiddled in the Budget for this year, and honourable members will recall the cut in excise which was designed-as stated quite explicitly in the Budget Papers-to reduce the CPI by about half a percentage point. That was the first fiddle, and what we are seeing now-the pressure brought to bear on the Australian Statistician-is the second fiddle. I have only a few minutes and I want to pick up two or three arguments that the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) put to this House today in defence of his Government. The first point he made was that we are embarrassed by the Government's record, that we are disappointed by its success in a whole range of economic areas. Obviously, he is not very well informed or well briefed on the Government's so-called success in relation to inflation. Looking back over the present Government's time in office and its so-called success, one notes that it has consistently overshot its forecasts for inflation. In 1984-85, the forecast was 5.25 per cent, while the outcome was 6.7 per cent; in 198586, the forecast was 8 per cent, while the outcome was 8.4 per cent; in 1986-87, the Budget forecast was 7.75 per cent for inflation, while the outcome was 9.3 per cent; in 1987-88 the Budget forecast was 6 per cent, while the outcome was 7.1 per cent; and in 1988-89, there was a projection of 4.5 per cent, but that is currently running at 7 per cent to 8 per cent-irrespective of the fudge that will impact on that figure. I find it interesting that the Minister feels that we are embarrassed by the Government's success. Secondly, the Minister referred to the quotes by the Statistician and his office that were mentioned by the Deputy Leader of  related to whether the Statistician was leaned on. The Minister quoted from correspondence which he apparently received today from the Statistician. We must be dealing with two different people or two different sets of circumstances. There is no doubt that the statements made by the Statistician at the time of announcing the review and by his senior officer responsible for the CPI, the First Assistant Statistician, tell a quite different story. It is up to the Acting Treasurer to explain to this House how there could be two such inconsistent accounts of the same series of events.",55
104,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,He might explain the coincidence of getting a letter today.,56
105,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"That is right-timely, was it not? The Acting Treasurer said today that he received this corrt:spondence from the Statistician, and. he referred to a statement that apparently indicated something to the effect that, following discussion with the division head who is responsible for the CPI, he had already decided to conduct the review. On my understanding of the structure of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the division head responsible for the CPI is Mr Skinner-the same person referred to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who quoted remarks that he made on the PM program on 31 January. In that program Mr Peter Martin asked: In your view is there anything wrong with the means that you have chosen for treating housing costs in the CPI? Mr Tim Skinner replied, 'Nothing that we are aware of.' He was further asked, 'Is there any disquiet within the Bureau about the performance?', to which Mr Skinner replied, 'No.' That is quite inconsistent with the account we have just been given by the Acting Treasurer. Secondly, we can look at the statements made by the Statistician himself. We do not have to rely just on Mr Skinner. We can go back, for example, to the Statistician's press release of 31 January, which stated: The Australian Statistician, Mr Ian Castles, today confirmed that he had agreed to undertake a review of the treatment of mortgage interest charges in the consumer price index. There is no suggestion there that he would be continuing what he was already doing. Presumably, for him to agree to that review someone had asked him or pressured him to un-ertake it. Thirdly, there is the correspondence that we have from the Statistician. He supplied us with a paper entitled The Standing Tripartite Commission Treatment of Home Costs in the CPI, in which he discussed various alternatives. The following statement is on page 4 of that document: The ABS still considers the conceptual basis treatment of housing costs in the eleventh series CPIthat is, the current seriesto be correct. It is up to the Acting Treasurer to explain to the Parliament the markedly different accounts of the apparent views of the same individuals over the period of the last few months. The Acting Treasurer made the further point that the Government had picked the most appropriate measure for housing costs in the CPI. However, in the same document from the Statistician five alternative measures for treating housing costs in the CPI were identified, and he presented, in descending order of their total increase for the two years to the December quarter of 1988, the impact of these measures on the CPI. Not surprisingly, this profile measure gives the lowest CPI outcome. Ironically, as a chart in that document shows, it gives us the same CPI outcome as though housing costs had not been included in the CPI at all. It is quite amazing really that the Acting Treasurer is prepared to defend that as conceptually the best measure, although on the same page in that document the Statistician says: The ABS still considers the conceptual basis of the treatment as appropriate. It is interesting to note that 14.5 per cent was the cumulative increase in the debt profile method over that two-year period. The worse measure-one supported by a number of other groups and, reportedly, by the Treasury-is the rental equivalence measure, which gives a 16.3 per cent total increase, or 1.8 per cent higher. Interestingly, the method that the Acting Treasurer is discarding, the simple revaluation method, was the second lowest figure. So, he has moved from the second lowest figure to the lowest figure, in order to get an 'appropriate' measure for the movement in housing costs as a component of the movement in consumer prices. We could stand here all day and debate the technicalities of this episode. I have no doubt that the Statistician was leaned on by the Government to produce this result. The key point for this Government is to go out for the from here and face some of the pensioners and others in this country who presumably now are going to be given lower adjustments to their pensions than would otherwise have been the case. How m.uch is the Government already clawing back from those decisions announced on 12 April by this fiddle of the CPI in respect of pensioners? Of course, there will be a host of other people who are now going to be adversely affected in a day to day market sense because the Government has decided to fiddle the CPI. There are those, for example, earning income in the form of capital gains. The inflation adjustment there is going to be lower than would otherwise have been the case. The Government has got a host of indexed government securities out there in financial markets. The inflation numbers are going to deviate quite significantly. The Government is living in a fool's paradise. It is playing around with one of the most fundamentally important economic statistics in this country and it is doing so to the substantial detriment of a whole range of people, most importantly some of those pensioners and other benefit recipients who depend so crucially on that adjustment, particularly in the environment of a government which does not address their needs seriously. The bottom line of this Government and its record on inflation is that it is totally pathetic. It has never had an anti-inflationary strategy for the entire time it has been in government. It is instructive to consider some of the statements made at the time the Accord was brought down in 1983 about how it was going to control inflation, bringing prices under control, so the Government could run a stimulatory monetary and fiscal policy. The Government has failed dramatically. We had an exchange rate crisis in 1985; we have now got a situation where inflation is again on the way up. It is accelerating away, not declining, despite what the Government will produce in terms of numbers tomorrow. Anybody who goes to the supermarket, collects a pension or tries to do some of those financial transactions will soon realise the magnitude and cruel nature of this fiddle with the CPI. It is about time the Government stopped such unproductive exercises and concentrated its efforts quite explicitly on bringing down the rate of inflation. It has never had a solution to that problem-",56
106,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,58
107,Mrs JAKOBSEN,Unknown,"I am sure that not one person in this House would deny the acting ability of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong  script reading, I am sure he will be snapped up by an enterprising dramatic group as soon as he gets back to Victoria. Sadly, the shadow Minister for finance, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), does not have the talents of the honourable member for Kooyong in this area and the entertainment value of his contribution was nowhere near the same. This matter of supposed public importance which has been raised by the Opposition today is about maintaining the status quo at all cost, especially when it may be seen to advantage the Opposition's political position. Why should something that is demonstrably wrong be left unchanged? The Liberal and National parties almost invariably say, 'Because it has always been that way'. Alternatively, they might say it is because the existing-Mr Reith-It was changed only a couple of years ago.",58
108,Mrs JAKOBSEN,Unknown,"The Opposition did not change it. The Opposition might say, 'Keep this method because it makes the Government's performance look inordinately bad'. That is why honourable members opposite would like to have it continue. Either way, the fact remains that they are afraid of change and therefore resist it at every turnnever mind that it may be necessary change or change for the better. When the Government and the Australian Statistician introduced the housing price measurement into the consumer price index (CPI) it was inevitable that the effect would be to lift the index. In a growing economy that· would be the normal expectation. However, it was not apparent that the methodology employed was inappropriate. This change in measurement of the CPI is a change for the better. Without it the shift in the cost of living index would continue to be skewed unrealistically. Given the importance of the CPI as a measure in itself-a guide for other changes such as pensions, family support payments, fees, wages and the price of goods-both the Government and the Statistician would be ignoring their responsibilities if they did not make the necessary adjustment at the earliest possible opportunity. It may be in the interests of the Opposition to have the CPI unrealistically skewed as a consequence of property and interest rate increases but it is certainly not in the interests of Australia as a whole. We on this side of the House are accustomed to the Opposition's use of spurious figures to support its equally spurious arguments on the economy. We understand that Opposition members are only upset because they may not be able to continue to use an inaccurate measurement to their own political advantage. In other words, they do not really care what the real cost of living increase is; they want to use whichever measurement makes the economic situation appear the worse for the Government. When the change in house prices and interest rates was first included in the cost of living statistics, the measurement was interpreted as if every person was going out and buying a house at the same time-that is, immediately. In other words, it was assumed that each and every home buyer was confronting and paying the prevailing price at the prevailing interest rate level. Of course, that is not the case. Some people have been buying their homes for a considerable number of years, be it five, 10 or 20. Many have been protected from interest rate fluctuations 'as a result of special arrangements pertaining to their loans, defence service, low start and ceiling protected packages. It is for this reason that the change has been made. The debt profile method of measurement attempts to take these differing circumstances into account. The new measurement will more accurately reflect the average effect of rises and falls in the home purchase market. The measurement of interest rates is not in dispute. I noticed that at Question Time the shadow Treasurer said that the debt profile method was one of five different methods available to measure the change in housing costs. He claimed that the Government had chosen this method because it consistently rendered the lowest CPI result. He overlooked the fact that this method and the previous method will continue to affect the CPI long after the price increases have passed. While the claim of the shadow Treasurer is obviously a nonsense in that it implies the complicity of the Statistician in the manipulation of statistics for political purposes, it is also a nonsense in that there are methods of measuring housing price movements which would not impact upon the CPI in anywhere near such a significant way. For instance, the imputed rent method would probably impact least on the CPI in the long term but neither the Government nor the Statistician has chosen that measure. No doubt the Opposition would not accept that method either if it appeared to be to the Government's short term advantage irrespective of the accuracy of it as a measurement of rental and relative rental changes. As the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) indicated at Question Time and more recently, the Opposition stands alone in its condemnation of the Government and the Statistician for making this necessary change. The Age editorial on 24 April said: On this occasion, and for good reasons of accuracy, the statistician has obligedthat is, obliged Mr KEATING The result is a fairer measure of price movements which happens, in the short term at least, to suit Government's purposes. The cost of living index is highly regarded in the community and by financial markets. It is imperative that it retain its integrity. The Opposition's discomfort is of small matter beside that. Ross Gittins, the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald-this article has been quoted on a couple of occasions today-also mentioned this problem in his column on 22 April: Has the CPI been fiddled? No. Is the new figure for the inflation rate more accurate? Yes, So what credibility can be placed in the charges the Opposition has been making? None. It is, surprise, surprise, merely playing politics. As the Acting Treasurer has said already, the attack of the Opposition on the Statistician is unforgivable and totally unwarranted, just as it was when Opposition members attacked him over the household expenditure survey. One does not need a long memory to recall similar attacks and innuendos on the action of the Commissioner of Taxation, who has been doing an excellent job retrieving tax around the nation, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and other statutory office holders under the protection of privilege in this place. It is a despicable action and it should cease. This Government's economic performance will stand against that of the Opposition any day. Why do honourable members opposite waste the time of the House with their spurious arguments over matters which recognised economists have accepted as being both necessary and beneficial. Mr Cad mao-You wouldn't say that in your electorate.",58
109,Mrs JAKOBSEN,Unknown,"I would say it in my electorate. My electorate is a very intelligent electorate which recognises that prices are going up but does not choose to blame the Government for everything, as the Opposition tends to do. If we had to wait for the Opposition to do anything in this place we would be waiting forever. It is totally reactionary and does not have any new thoughts. It is typical of this Opposition that we should be listening to a barrage of innuendo and downright misinterpretation today on the actions of the Treasurer, the Government the and the Statistician when it is quite obvious to the people of Australia and to economists and the money markets that there are many different problems associated with the measurement of housing increases. We have been the only Government, and this has been the only Statistician,· that has had the guts to put a housing cost measurement into the CPI. It is not a matter of whether it should have been done before. We have done it and Mr Castles has done it. That is a measure of the independence of the man. I would like once again to quote Ross Gittins on that very point: Remember two things. First, the Statistician is independent of Government. He's not just another bureaucrat who can be directed by a Minister. He's the holder of a statutory office, appointed for seven years and able to be removed only by both Houses of Parliament. This puts him on par with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Tax Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. And the Statistician guards his independence jealously. It's very important that the people of Australia be provided with statistics they know they can trust; statistics that aren't just a product of the political process. Mr Gittins goes on to say: The proof of Mr Castles' independence was his original decision to include mortgage interest charges in the CPI, made in the face of Treasury's long standing opposition. That, I hasten to add, is Treasury under Liberal and Labor governments. He continues: He did so because he wanted to make the CPI more credible to ordinary people. We agree with him.",59

The lake foreshore development is a very constructive proposal, a proposal that origigovernments, nally came from the National Capital Deold velopment Commission.

I personally think that National Library is a very attractive building and a great monument to the foresight of the Menzies Government, which was origiWhen nally responsible for it. The High Court and the National Gallery were opened during period of the Fraser Government, a governrelay ment which was visionary in terms of Canberra. It is important to remember with these sorts of proposals-they may not be the most fundamental matters that come before the Parliament-that this parliamentary zone is, and one can say this without exaggeration, the showpiece of our nation. It is GRIFFIN enormously important that our parliamentary zone look attractive and that it be dignified as well because the dignity of our Parliainstitutions is reflected by their physical the following environment. But, frankly, the Government has not done The anything about one important edifice within and the parliamentary zone-that is, the old Parliament House. I think it is very sad that as we come up to the first anniversary of the of the new Parliament House that mofine old building has laid dormant without any announcement being made as to its future use. As a building it is slowly deterioI understand it is suffering from leaks. It always suffered from leaks of one form or I another but it is suffering from leaks of enwater on this occasion. It will be all the expensive to restore the longer it is left unused. I am sure I speak for my colleagues it when I say it is disgraceful that such an historic building, a building which was for so many of its years dominated by the great figure of Sir Robert Menzies and his fine can be left to waste like a kind lady who has been callously abandoned by her family, her friends and even the Mintrees, the ister for Social Security.",61
119,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"1 will not delay the House greatly. I want to prove that I am not a spook by supporting additional lighting for the parliamentary zone. But I do so making 'two points. Firstly, the works are estimated to cost $1.7m. In joining the my colleague the honourable member for parMayo (Mr Downer) in speaking to this moLition, I add that there is a need to ensure that this work is carried out efficiently and effectively. I add one other thing: there is a atbetterment factor associated with Canberrathe we acknowledge the need for this-but there is a finite limit in the electorate at large with regard to tolerating this betterment factor. it comes to putting down a hot mix seal for the third time in one calendar year the on suburban roads of Canberra, and when I this information to some of my electors in, for argument's sake, Balranald Shire, where some of their roads are totally impassable at present, their tolerance evaporates in terms of the betterment factor of our national capital. However, I acknowledge the need for a degree of betterment associated with the parliamentary triangle and support the 'comments made by the honourable member for Mayo, but I appeal for efficient usage of the $1.7m involved. The second matter I wish to raise in relation to this question of lighting within the parliamentary zone is the fact that the original brief by the relevant authorities for the construction of this new Parliament House has not been complied with in relation to the external exhibition of green and red lights on top of the House of Representatives and the Senate chambers, respectively. This matter arose as a specific briefing and requirement of the new Parliament House. Once again, the architects, authorities and the relevant committee, despite toing and froing on the matter, managed to shunt if off and we were told that we could not have these lights because it simply could not be done. We now have a situation at night-time of the vast majority of Canberrans-especially those using Northbourne Avenue-thinking that the Senate is always sitting because of the specific design of the dome on the Senate chamber which allows light to shine out of the Senate. However, they would think that the House of Representatives is never sitting because of the design of the dome on this chamber, which does not allow the emission of light into the night. So, we have a situation of lack of balance in the presentation of the sittings of both chambers. I will not detain the House greatly on this matter other than to say that it was a long standing requirement in the old Parliament House that the lights be displayed when the chambers were sitting. Those beacons of democracy gathered their own momentum in the history of our national capital. In making the transfer to the new Parliament House, it was the Opposition that had to point out that there were no national flags in this chamber. Just as the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) led the campaign in regard to that matter, I have pleasure on this occasion in pointing out that the green and red light requirements were disregarded in the finishing off of the new Parliament House, but there is still a requirement for an appropriate, modern, efficient beacon to be established on top of the House of Representatives and the Senate to denote when they are sitting-green for the lower House and red for the upper House. I ask the Minister to take this matter on board and refer it to the relevant authorities to see why the Parliament was denied its legitimate request to see these important symbols of democracy, which denote the sittings of the Parliament and which were so much a part of the old parliamentary heritage, were not proceeded with in the new Parliament House.

In my own case, I came into the House with the intention of listening to two stimulating speeches from the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) introducing two Bills only to find that the whole program has once again been abandoned. It is very inconsiderate and inconvenient, and it seems that there is no explanation to be given as to why the Attorney-General is not here and ready to introduce these two pieces of legislation. I would be obliged; in the first place, if we could have some explanation for this departure from the program and, secondly, some sort of undertaking that it will not be done again. It is all very well for the honourable member to shake his head, but there are other people here whose convenience should be considered as well. Question resolved in (the affirmative. NA 1989 Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",62
121,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Navigation Act 1920. As the legislation rently stands, under section the Minister wishes to take action against the licence of an international airline, then the only action he or she can take is suspend or cancel the licence. This means suspending or cancelling all services operated on all routes that the airline has under its licence. The proposed amendment will give the Minister the power to vary the licence, which will mean the Minister has available a number of options which are much less severe than cancelling or suspending the ence. For example, these options will allow the Minister to vary selectively the number of flights, the type of aircraft and the routes the foreign airline operates to and from Australia. The need for this power has arisen because of instances where another country has taken detrimental action against Qantas or where Qantas has been affected by anti-competitive practices by other countries and their lines. In such cases, the existing powers of Bill. cancelling or suspending a licence would be too severe and could well result in a negative effect on broader bilateral relationships, as well as significantly impacting on the flow of tourism to Australia. It is therefore necessary in such situations for the Government to have a more moderate, graduated and realistic means of bringing countervailing presfirst time. sure to bear. This is exactly what the amendment seeks to provide in the form of legislative and regulatory powers which match those of Australia's bilateral ners. For example, most of our major bilateral aviation partners have powers, in addition to suspension and cancellation, alter, modify, amend, vary or limit the airline licences they issue to carriers flying to and from their territories. The amendment to the Act is also necesTerritory sary to support changes to the Air Navigadangerous tion Regulations-regulations 106B and which 106c-which came into operation on 21 cember 1988, giving the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communicaprescribed tions the power in certain circumstances vary, cancel or suspend an approved timeTerritory table of an international airline of a foreign country. An international airline licence issued in accordance with such timetables Air are approved from time to time by the Seccurretary to the Department of Transport and 13 of the Act, if Communications. With regard to compliance, I do not believe there will be any difficulties in this to regard. Under our bilateral air services agreements, the airlines are required to comply with Australian domestic laws and regulations while operating in Australian territory. Conversely, of course, Qantas is obliged to comply with the respective domestic laws and regulations of overseas countries while operating in their territories. Furthermore, licthe powers sought under this amendment to the Act are, as I have said, designed to match the powers overseas countries already have. In this regard what we are seeking is even-handed and will not lead to action on our part which would compromise or weaken the ability of our carrier, or the ability of foreign carriers flying to Australia, to compete on a fair and equal opportunity basis.

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Beazley, and read a Second Reading",62
122,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of the Defence Legislation to Amendment Bill is to 'make amendments to the Defence Act 1903 to exempt Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd for a transitional period of six years from certain State and laws which deal with land usage, goods or licensing of activities, or impose taxes, charges or rates, includDeing stamp duty. Arelated amendment to the Defence Act 1903 will exempt employees or organisations, such as Australian to Defence Industries Pty Ltd, from State and firearms licensing laws. The Bill also makes drafting amendments to the Defis ence Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) as 1988. I will explain the exemption of AustraHan Defence Industries Pty Ltd from certain State and Territory laws. The other changes are explained in the explanatory memorandum. I announced last August that the Office of Defence Production (ODP) would be converted into a government-owned company, Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd. The prime objective of the company will be to provide specialised industrial support to the Australian Defence Force. The present defence production establishments originated over 100 years ago with the establishment of the Colonial Ammunition Company in 1888 and now form a major part of the overall defence industrial base of this country. In recent years the defence production organisation has been subject to extensive rationalisation aimed at improving delivery and performance. This has included: elimination of excess capacity through the sale of facilities such as Williamstown Dockyard; transition of the Government Aircraft Factories to a government owned company; extensive financial reforms and full cost recovery; emphasis on product development; and management and 'staffing restructuring together with introduction of measures to increase productivity. These reforms have realised already a saving of at least $150m per annum in the defence budget and have been accompanied by a 30 per cent productivity increase. The Government has focused attention on improving efficiency and effectiveness across all aspects of the Defence portfolio. The 1987 defence White Paper emphasised the need for defence production to be as efficient as possible. This has placed pressure on the defence production establishments to improve performance. The only way to achieve this is to enable the organisation to operate in a commercial way outside the Public Service. Work from the Australian Defence Force, traditionally allocated to ODP facilities, will be progressively open to competition. The production facilities will need to adapt to direct competition from other Australian and foreign companies. It is impen-­ tive that defence production, be given the opportunity to restructure and develop in the open market with only commercial restrictions and controls on its mode of operation. The establishment of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd is designed to improve the operational management of the production facilities while maintaining government control of these valuable defence assets. As the ultimate ownership of the organisation will not change, it is unreasonable to burden the company with the imposition of costs and taxes associated with a technical change in legal status. An initial charge of $16m in stamp duty associated with the transfer of assets to the company would impact seriously on its financial situation. The Bill therefore excludes the company from the payment of stamp duty. The other potential area of difficulty for the company is the application of State regulatory laws, such as those relating to land zoning or the handling of dangerous goods. The ODP facilities have operated under the control of the Commonwealth Government for most of their existence. This has resulted in management and cost structures not always appropriate to a large manufacturing company. Having operated as an arm of the Commonwealth Government, these production facilities will take time to adapt to all the laws and regulations applicable to a company operating under State laws. ,These establishments already liaise closely with State and local government bodies on matters related to their production activities and adhere to stringent national and international operating standards. However, these do not always correspond to the laws of the States in which they operate. In the longer term, it is desirable that these establishments operate compatibly with State laws, but it will take some time to reach this position. This legislation is designed to give the company the time to meet the requirements of State legislation. It would be unfortunate if the continued operation of these valuable strategic assets were placed in jeopardy by providing insufficient time to adhere toa new set of operational requirements. An efficient industrial base is just as much a part of our self reliant defence capability as military capabilities. By the establishment of this company, the Government has acknowledged that it is sensible to encourage and support these defence facilities as part of the total defence industrial base and to allow them to reach a situation where they can operate commercially and competitively. This Bill will provide protection for an interim period to allow the new company a smooth transition to a fully competitive commercial situation. The Bill itself contains a sunset clause so that these protections will exist for a period of six years. It is envisaged that progress towards a fully compliant situation in terms of State law will be reviewed after four years to assess the requirement for continued protection. Financial Impact Statement It is estimated that the exemption of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd will save the company from being liable to pay approximately $16m in State and Territory stamp duty on the traqsfer of establishments to it, and from having to meet the co-ts, estimated to be at least $60m, of complying with State and Territory regulatory laws. The other provisions of the Bill have no financial impact. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to it. Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. NA COMMISSION BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",63
123,Mr KERIN,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The House will be aware that on 18 November last year the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced a package of measures that signal a major reorientation of the Government's approa-h to complex conservation and development issues. These measures include streamlining the operations of the Australian Heritage Commission, to. be given effect in amendments to the Australian Heritage Commission Act that will also be considered· by the Parliament in these sittings; the establishment of new consultative processes with the State and Territory governments and with industry, union and conservation groups to ensure that major conservation and deveiopment issues can be discussed in a less confrontationist atmosphere than in the past; the negotiation of a forest accord; a review of existing environmental data bases; the development of a national forests inventory; and the establishment of an independent Resource Assessment Commission (RAC). All these initiatives will improve the basis on which Government decisions on important resource issues are made. The purpose of the Resource Assessment Commission Bill is to establish the Resource Assessment Commission which will inquire into, and report on, the environmental, cultural, social, industrial, economic or other aspects of resources and their uses. The inquiries will be initiated by the Commonwealth Government on matters where the Government or a Commonwealth authority may need advice before taking a decision on a resource matter within the exercise of the Commonwealth's Constitutional powers. Consistent with the 18 November decisions, the Commission will be required to be guided by the three policy principles that were announced at that time and that are used as a guide by Commonwealth Ministers in resolving competing resource use claims. These principles are that: first, there should be an integrated approach to conservation and development by taking both aspects into account at an early stage; secondly, resource use decisions should seek to optimise the net benefits to the community from the nation's resources, having regard to efficiency of resource use, environmental considerations, and an equitable distribution of the return on resources; and thirdly, Commonwealth decisions, policies and management regimes may provide for additional uses that are compatible with the primary purpose values of the area, recognising that in some cases both. conservation and development interests can be accommodated concurrently or sequentially, and in other cases choices must be made between alternative uses or combinations of uses. The Resource Assessment Commission legislation will be in addition to and not in substitution for existing legislation. In particular, an inquiry by the RAC will not affect the need for, or timing of, any environmental impact statement. Ingeneral, however, RAC inquiries are expected to relate to industries, regions or issues, in contrast to the processes of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act which generally apply to a specific project proposal. Inquiries almost always will be into major, complex and contentious resource use issues. They are likely to deal with the resource industries that are of great significance for the economy and the environment. The Government will have the capacity under the Act to commission smaller scale inquiries, for example with the Chairperson only, to provide an independent assessment of smaller resource issues within a tight time-frame. In such exceptional cases we would expect that the matter under investigation by the smaller inquiry would be part of a larger RAC inquiry and that the Government would want advice or analysis in relation to the matter relatively quickly. The Government's intention, subject to the passage of this Bill, is to refer Australia's forests and timber resources to the RAC as its first inquiry. The terms of reference for the first inquiry, and the names of the special commissioners to be appointed, will be announced following passage of the legislation. The legislation empowers the Commission to enquire into all those aspects of any matters referred to it that the Commission considers to be relevant. It has a reporting freedom like that given to the Industries Assistance Commission. Clause 8 of the Bill indicates the various elements the Commission would be expected to consider: for example, identifying the resource and how it may be used at present or in the future; looking at the kinds of values individuals or groups in the community place on the resource or on the uses that can be made of it, and this includes both conservation and commercial or development uses; and assessing what various uses will mean to the community in the short term and the longer term-for instance, who will gain and who will lose in both material and non-material ways. This kind of assessment could thus encompass losses or gains of amenity, or of aesthetic or spiritual values, as well as monetary losses or gains. How the Commission makes its assessment is left to the Commission to determine. It is recognised that both quantitative and qualitative elements need to be assessed by whatever means seem appropriate. Clause 8 empowers the Commission to do these things as far as practicable'. This phrase is intended to cover all the aspects likely to be encountered in the Commission's inquiries and acknowledges our incomplete understanding of complex resource issues. We may have limited understanding, for instance, of the dynamic processes that operate within and between ecosystems or of complex economic and social interrelationships existing within and between communities. Similarly, while we can make predictions about the impacts of certain human activities, we can rarely foresee all the consequences or their extent. The Commission, therefore, will have to assemble all reasonably obtainable information and advice and do what analysis can reasonably be done within the time limits set by the Government. Each inquiry will be required to prepare a draft report unless the Minister instructs otherwise and, after consultations on the draft, to submit a final report to the Government. Depending on the terms of reference, the report can be an information report or a report with recommendations to the Government on optional courses of action the Government may wish to take. The decision on whether to implement the recommendations of an inquiry will, of course, rest with the Government. In its inquiry processes and operations, the Resource Assessment Commission will be similar to the Industries Assistance Commission. The Bill provides for an open, consistent approach, based on adequate information and analysis. It provides opportunities for participation by all interested parties, be they States, industries, unions, interest groups or individuals. It provides opportunities also for public comment on the background papers or draft reports that the Commission may prepare prior to putting its final advice to the Government. Evidence will be taken informally and legal representation discouraged as with the lAC. Like the lAC, the Commission may be asked to examine more than one issue or reference at anyone time. Like the Industries Assistance Commission, the Resource Assessment Commission will have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses and the provision of documentation. Penalties are provided for non-compliance. The Commission will be responsible to the Parliament through the Prime Minister. A chairperson will be appointed for periods of up to five years on a full time or a part time basis. It is expected that the chairperson work on a full time basis if necessary for the conduct of inquiries. Special commissioners will be appointed for particular inquiries lowing consultations by the Prime Minister with the chairperson of the Commission and those of the Industries Assistance Commission and the Australian Science and Technology Council. The chairperson and the special commissioners will be appointed by the Governor General. I am pleased to announce today that the first chairperson of the Commission will be the Hon. Mr Justice Stewart, currently Chairman of the National Crime Authority. Mr Justice Stewart has had a distinguished career as !l royal commissioner, as a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and in private practice. The analytical skills, perience in the conduct of inquiries and knowledge of government which he brings to this appointment will ensure the smooth, effective and impartial operation of the Commission. The members of the Commission will be supported by a small secretariat the Prime Minister's portfolio. Additional pert and professional staff will be hired as consultants or seconded from relevant agencies as required for particular inquiries. In addition the Commission will be able to initiate any research that may be necessary for the conduct of an inquiry. The work program of the Commission and the terms of reference for each inquiry will be determined by the Government. The terms of reference and any instructions given by the Government to the Commission will be made public, as will any subsequent changes to them. The financial cost of the Commission will depend on the number and type of matters referred to it by the Government and the duration of the inquiries it undertakes. Each major reference to the Commission is expected to cost approximately $2m in anyone year. If, however, there is no reference in the course of a year, the ongoing costs would be relatively low. The Government strongly supports economic growth based on sustainable development and protection of the environment. In establishing the Resource Assessment Commission, the Government has recognised the urgent need to improve its capacity to decide matters that affect present and future generations of Australians. It is will absolutely essential that as a community we ensure that our economic development and living standards are not maintained at the folexpense of our children and grandchildren. We have a lot to learn about managing our unique Australian environment. We have made mistakes in the past for which we are now paying dearly. We need to do all we can to maximise both our economic and our conservation goals. The two are inextricably interlinked. The Resource Assessment Commission will face difficult and complex tasks. We will never have perfect understanding, though we must seek to improve our understanding over time. Nor can we endlessly delay decisions on the basis that more and more information can be sought. We will sometimes face unexpalatable choices between conflicting goals on the basis of limited knowledge. The Commission's job will be to assemble all reasonably available information, acknowledge those areas where uncertainties remain, take relevant viewpoints into account and advise the within Government on the options it can adopt ex- within a reasonable time frame. The Resource Assessment Commission will make a major contribution to assembling, and improving our fund of knowledge and our analytical capacity. It will provide a transparent, consistent process that can be used by all interested parties as a means of having their information and their views impartially and independently assessed and considered by the Government. The inquiry process will make an important contribution to better community understanding of the facts of a paiticular situation and of the issues and options involved. The Bill before the House today has been prepared with input from a range of sources including peak industry and public interest groups. These groups raised a number of useful and constructive points about the Bill and, where possible, their concerns have been accommodated in the drafting of the Bill. It is th- essence of an integrated approach to conservation and development that all the aspirations of our community be given proper weight. To reflect this, the Commission has been charged with taking the broad view and arriving at independent judgments. In the past too many decisions have been taken without adequate understanding of the economic or the environmental consequences of particular courses of action or the full range of views in the community. The Resource Assessment Commission is a major initiative of this Government designed to remedy these deficiencies. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. NA NA (No.3) 1989 Bill presented by Mr Robert Brown for Mr Barry Jones, and read a first time. Second Reading",65
124,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is an omnibus measure, proposing amendments to the CUstoms Act 1901, the Excise Act 1901 and the Customs Administration Act 1985. The principal amendments in the Bill relate to the diesel fuel rebate scheme and implement changes to that scheme to improve its .administration and correct some anomalies in the coverage of activities eligible for rebate announced by the Government on 3 March 1989. The diesel fuel rebate scheme provides a rebate of either customs or excise duties, at varying rates, for diesel fuel purchased for specified categories of off-road uses, namely in mining, in primary production, in residential premises and in medical institutions. Clauses 7 and 17 of the Bill amend the diesel fuel rebate scheme legislation to give the Comptroller-General of Customs authority to waive recovery of overpayment of rebated duty in certain circumstances. These are where the Australian Customs Service has initially allowed the payment of a rebate in respect of a particular type of off-road activity but, as a result of a subsequent court or Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision, or legal advice provided to Australian Customs Service, it is apparent that rebate should not have been paid. Currently, the Australian Customs Service is obliged to recover the full amount of rebate in such circumstances. In most of these cases, the claimants have acted in good faith and recovery action would cause financial hardship. In such circumstances, the Government considers it unreasonable to seek recovery of the rebates paid, other than in cases of fraud or where the rebate was not payable but was nevertheless knowingly or recklessly obtained. The amendments proposed will provide this sensible flexibility. Amendments to the diesel fuel rebate scheme legislation are also proposed to allow the payment of rebate where duty is paid subsequent to the purchase of the fuel. Under the present legislation, to obtain a rebate, duty must have been paid prior to the purchase of diesel fuel. Anomalies have arisen where otherwise eligible users have been denied a rebate because fuel they had purchased for duty-free use for example, to power a fishing vessel on an international voyage, is later directed to a dutiable usefor example where the fishing vessel if used in domestic waters, and duty is paid subsequent to purchase. At the request of a large number of claimants, clauses 8 and 18 propose to amend the diesel fuel rebate scheme legislation to allow claimants to offset a rebate entitlement against any liability arising in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Further, the Government has also decided to remove some anomalies in the coverage of certain off-road activities eligible for rebate. For all· diesel fuel used after 3 March 1989: Operations connected with the dressing or beneficiation of minerals, or ores bearing minerals, that are carried out in, or at a place adjacent to, the area in which the dressing or beneficiation occurs as an integral part of operations for the recovery of minerals or. ores bearing minerals-for example such as the construction of beneficiation plants, leach dams, et ceterawill now become eligible for rebate. For fishing operations, the diesel fuel rebate scheme will be amended to make eligible for rebate operations such as outward voyages by dedicated mother ships, gear trials, voyages to and from a port for refit and fish farming. The diesel fuel rebate scheme will also be amended to clarify that rebate is not available for recreational, sporting or tourist fishing operations. For forestry operation, the diesel fuel rebate scheme will be amended to make eligible for rebate certain road making and maintenance operations in a forest or plantation which are integral to eligible forestry activities. In addition the milling of timber at a chipmill that is no't situated in a forest or plantation, and the transporting of timber from the forest or plantation to that chipmill are now eligible activities. As I mentioned earlier, these amendments to the scheme will apply to all diesel fuel used after 3 March 1989. The Government believes that these amendments to the diesel fuel rebate scheme will add to its efficiency and equity. The financial impact statement indicates that the removal of certain anomalies in the coverage of activities eligible for diesel fuel rebate under the scheme, effected by clause 5 of the Bill, is expected to result in additional outlays per annum of $20m, as follows: the additional fishing operations now eligible under the scheme will cost $5m, the additional forestry operations now eligible under the scheme will cost $3m, the additional mining operations now eligible under the scheme will cost $12m. The remaining provisions of the Bill have no direct financial impact. I commend the Bill to the House of Representatives and table its accompanying explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Robert Brown for Mr Barry Jones, and read a first time. Second R-ading",68
125,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to. incorporate into the Act previously notified excise tariff alterations which decrease excise duty rates on low-alcohol beer; alter the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); and impose excise duty on topped crude petroleum oil, where that petroleum oil is for use otherwise than as refinery feedstock. Reduction of Excise Duty on Low-Alcohol Beer Clause 4 of the Bill decreases the excise duty on low-alcohol beer, following the Government's announcement during the August 1988 Budget. The reduction is effected by providing that the excise is to be calculated on the alcohol content by which the volume of alcohol of the beer exceeds 1.15 per cent. Thus, the greater the amount of alcohol in the beer, the more excise duty is payable on it. It is the Government's hope that, by calculating the excise duty proportionately in relation to its alcohol content, some progress will be made in discouraging excessive alcohol consumption. Alternatively, it will recoup in an equitable manner the social costs of such excessive consumption. The threshold of 1.15 per cent is to ensure that beers with alcohol contents of 1.15 per cent or less-that is, ultra-light beers-which were free from excise prior to the Government's announcement in the 1988 Budget, remain free from excise. Liquefied Petroleum Gas I turn now to clause 5 which} decreases the excise duty for liquefied petroleum gas. The excise duty for naturally occurring LPG is adjusted six-monthly on 1 April and 1 October each year in accordance with the Government's LPG excise policy announced in April 1980. The excise rate is calculated 1989 as 60 per cent of the amount by which the realised price for naturally occurring LPG exceeds $147 a tonne. The realised price is based on the weighted average of the prices received from exports and local sales of LPG during the immediately preceding six months. Under the petroleum excise arrangements introduced from 1 July 1987, LPG produced from onshore fields is exempt from excise, so the excise now only applies to offshore fields-that is, Bass Strait. No excise is payable on refinery produced LPG. Clause 5 of the Bill will amend the excise rate with effect from 1 October 1988, from $15.39 to $6.25 a kilolitre, a decrease of $9.14 from the previous rate set on 1 April 1988. The decrease reflects the lower export prices obtained for LPG over the six months to September 1988. Topped Crude Petroleum Oil The amendment proposed in clause 6 alters the excise duty on topped crude petroleum oil, by reference to the intended purpose for which that oil is entered for home consumption. With effect from 15 February 1989 topped crude petroleum oil intended for use other than as a petroleum refinery feedstock will attract an excise duty rate of $0.04644 per litre. Traditionally, topped crude petroleum oil has been used exclusively as refinery feedstock, and the rationale for the free rate of duty hitherto applicable to that petroleum oil has been that such a rate keeps production costs at a mihimum in what is after all a process in the production of another product on which excise duty is collected. However, topped crude petroleum oil can be identical in specifications to certain grades of fuel oil which are subject to both customs and excise duty. Recently, cases have come to light where topped crude oil has been imported for use, not as refinery feedstock, but rather as a substitute for fuel oil, ing in a loss of revenue. Accordingly, the Government is acting to stop the revenue leakage caused by this substitution practice, by confining the duty-free entry of topped crude petroleum to that oil which is intended for use as refinery feedstock only. Finally, clause 3 proposes a technical change to the Act, by repealing section 6G of the Act, to change the point in time, but not the rate, at which the industry protection element of customs duty is payable on goods imported for the purpose of the manufacture of excisable products. Financial Impact Statement Firstly in respect of the decrease in excise duty rates on low-alcohol beer, this is a Budget measure announced as part of the August 1988 Budget, and it is estimated to produce a decrease in revenue of, $400m in 1988-89, comprising decreased excise duty of $730m and increased sales tax of $330m; Secondly, the 1 October 1988 decrease in the excise rate for naturally occurring LPG is estimated to result in a decrease of $10.7 million in excise receipts in 1988-89; Thirdly, the amendments relating to topped crude petroleum oil are estimated to produce a savings to revenue of $14m in a full year.

Other amendments included in the Bill represent technical and administrative adjustments. Before turning to the main thrust of the Bill, I will briefly mention the minor amendments it introduces. Provision is being made to align the Australian War Memorial with other Commonwealth statutory bodies in the arts and heritage sphere in relation to their powers to make investments. The effect of this would be to enable the Memorial to enter into an approved range of investments without the need to obtain ministerial approval. Financial limits on other contracts able to be entered into without ministerial approval would also be increased. Restitution payments made by Germany to victims of Nazi persecution will be excluded from the definition of 'income' under the income test on service pensions. This provision will formalise an administrative practice which has been followed for some time and will bring the income test provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act into line with the provisions of the Social Security Act .. The Repatriation Commission's power to set charges for treatment provided to community patients in repatriation institutions will be clarified to permit the Commission to adhere generally to State hospital charges but with some flexibility. Relevant campaign medals will be defined for the purposes of determining the service pension eligibility of certain Commonwealth veterans who served during World War II. To restore the position existing under the repealed Repatriation Act before May 1986, a deceased claimant's legal personal representative will be specifically empowered to formalise and pursue an informal claim or application for pension lodged before, the claimant's death. I wish now to proceed to the major new initiatives contained in this Bill. On 6 March 1989, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave an undertaking that members of the Australian Defence Force serving in Namibia would be provided with repatriation benefits, including assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act, 'appropriate to the tasks and hazards encountered'. This undertaking was confirmed the following day by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). Much background information was provided to honourable members during the debate following these announcements. I do not intend to go through all of this again in detail, but will briefly summarise the points of particular relevance to the proposed amendments on the question of Australian involvement in the Namibian peacekeeping force. Namibia's struggle for its independence from South African rule has been a long and protracted one. South Africa's refusal to abide by the United Nations request to allow South West Africa'-as the country was then known-to be placed under United Nations (UN) trusteeship some four decades ago led to the formation of the South West Africa People's Organisation, or SWAPO, in 1957. By, the early 1970s, SWAPO was in open confrontation and conflict with South African forces on Namibian soil. The situation was further inflamed by the involvement of Angola following its independence in 1975, as an extension of its own struggle against South Africa. The military support of tens of thousands of Cuban troops in the Angolan-South African conflict only served to heighten tensions in the region. The agreement reached between Cuba, Angola and South Africa in December 1988 facilitated the implementation of the longestablished United Nation's plan for Namibia's transition to independence. That plan included a monitoring role for UNTAG comprising military contingents from a number of UN member countries. Honourable members will be aware that Australia h-s contributed a contingent of 305 engineers and support staff to UNTAG. Recent events in Namibia indicate clearly that the country's transition to independence may yet remain fraught with difficulty. In the aftermath of armed clashes in· the early stages of the UN plan's implementation, some members of the Australian contingent were called at short notice to man assembly points on the border. A continuing danger lies in the abundance of land mines in the regions bordering on Angola, a legacy of many years of open confrontation on Narpibian soil, particularly between South Africa and Angola. n is against this background that UNT AG will play its crucial role. The United Nations mission is a very significant one, coming 10 years after a United Nations Security Council resolution that independence should be established in Namibia. And Australia's long standing involvement in this venture should by no means be underrated. As early as 1979, the then Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, made the initial commitment to send an Australian contingent to assist in the establishment of self-rule in Namibia. The fact that, regardless of party allegiance, the Government of the day felt it imperative to contribute to any United Nations mission to assist in the establishment of self-rule in Namibia indicates the importance attached to this matter by Australia. The realisation of this long standing proposal for the independence of Namibia is, now at hand, and this Government has the responsibility to ensure that its service men and women, who will bear the brunt of the country's commitment, are provided with repatriation benefits appropriate to the dangers they are likely to encounter and the tasks they will have to perform. The Bill in support of which I now speak meets this responsibility. Schedule 2 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act will provide that the area including Namibia and extending 400 kilometres into Namibia's neighbouring countries, as well as Walvis Bay, shall be considered 'operational' for the duration of the United Nations mission. Parallel provision has been made to include members of the Australian Defence Force who serve in this operational area in the list of person whose service will qualify them for service pensions under part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The cover provided will be effective from 18 February 1989, th- date at which the first Australian representative arrived in Namibia. Our people serving in Namibia can do so in the knowledge that the Government has recognised the difficult situations they may face. Once the proposed amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act have been introduced, these persons will be entitled to the full range of benefits and entitlements available under the Act. They will have access to disability pensions on the same generous standard of proof basis as other war veterans. They will qualify for service pensions at age 60 for men, and 55 for women. They will also be eligible for free repatriation ical treatment and associated benefits on the same basis as other war veterans. Cover under the Act will also be available to the families of any serving member in the event of the member's. service resulting in severe or fatal disease or injury. It is also proposed to amend the Defence Service Homes Act to include in the categories of Australian soldiers' to whom the Act applies those service men and women who serve with this United Nations operation. In this way, they will have access to subsidised low interest housing loans, insurance and other housing benefits under that Act. The proposed veterans' entitlements I have just listed. are the necessary outcome of a policy which has benefited from bipartisan support not only within this Parliament, but ever since Namibia came to the notice of the free world. I call on all honourable members to support the passage of this Bill through the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on the motion by Mr Tim Fischer) adjourned. . SUPPLY BILL (No.1) 1989-90 Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Duncan, and read a first time. Second Reading",70
127,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,"---:I move: That the Bill be now read a second ti!lle. This Bill, together with its companion Bills, the Supply Bill (No.2) 1989-90 and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90, seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government during the period 1 July 1989 to 30 November 1989, by which date it is expected that the equivalent Appropriation Bills, which will form part of the Budget for 1989-90, will have been enacted .. Supply Bill (No.1) seeks appropriations totalling some $9.948m for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $1,258m, or about 14.5 per cent, greater than med- the equivalent amounts provided in the Supply Act (No.1) 1988-89. A significant part of the increase reflects commitments which have been approved by the Government, price and cost increases, and exchange rate variations. The Bill also provides for 12 Public Service pay periods as opposed to 11 pay periods provided in the corresponding Bill in 1988-89. The extra pay period adds approximately $250m to Supply Bill (No.1). The running costs appropriations of departments have been amended to include an annotation under section 35 of the Audit Act 1901 which enables departments to retain all or part of the receipts they generate from certain activities funded out of running costs as agreed by Ministers and the Minister for Finance. This change is designed to enable the full benefits of user charging to be realised and to enhance asset management. Two other changes· to the running costs appropriations are reflected in Supply Bill (No.1): the incorporation into running costs of compensation and legal expenses premiums paid to Comcare, where these provisions are for Commonwealth employees. For 1989-90, residual-that is, non-Commonwealth employers-compensation and legal expenses will remain in 'other services' in Bill No.1; and minor capital items individually costing less than $250,000 which are part of the normal continuing activities of departments will be funded from running costs appropriations in Bill No. I-rather than Bill No.2-Bill No. 2 will continue to provide for new policy and capital projects individually costing in excess of $250,000. ·Each civil agency in 1989-90 will have a property operating expenses item which will provide for services previously allocated to votes under the Department of Administrative Services. These services include rent on leased premises, repairs and fitout, contract cleaning and general office services. In addirespect tion, moneys previously allocated to Bill No. 2 for minor new works and acquisitions have been transferred to the property operating expenses item in Bill No.1. I emphasise that this Bill seeks interim provision only in respect of approved ongoing policies of the Government. It does not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 1989-90 Budget context for which provision will be sought in the Appropriation Bills. I commend the Bill to the House.

129,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks interim appropriations, totalling soine $3,013m, for expenditure on capital works and services, payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory and certain other services for the period 1 July 1989 to 30 November 1989. The amount sought is $949m, or about 46 per cent, more than that provided in the Supply Act (No.2) 198889. A significant part of the increased provision reflects revised funding arrangements for hospital grants in the Department of Community Services and Health which was funded in 1988-89 understanding legislation. Certain new provisions in respect of which government decisions have been taken have been separately itemised in the Bill in accordance with convention. As indicated with to the Supply Bill No.1, the provisions in this Bill do not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 1989-90 Budget context. I commend the Bill to the House.

131,Mr SAUNDERSON,Unknown,"Before the debate was interrupted for the luncheon break I was making a point about issues that must be considered in relation to the question of taxation reform and the differing views on how the economy has been managed by the pt:esent Government and by the Opposition parties in government. I had begun to go through a range of social areas in which the Government has made changes to improve the services provided to the community and in particular to those who are more disadvantaged. I had referred to the first home owners scheme and pointed out that more than 300,000 people on low and moderate incomes were now buying their own homes because of the Government's providing that scheme. During our six years in office in real terms we have increased public housing funding by some 14 per cent. With more than 30,000 additional child-care places to be provided by 1992-93, we have brought about a more than 200 per cent increase in the number of such places since we took office. Those are just some examples. I could go on and cite the area of education-the increased number of higher education places, the improved retention rate and the changes that we have made in relation to education assistance. I could refer particularly to the changes we have made to the family allowance and family income support supplement. The Government has shown clearly that it is able to manage the economy in terms of the provision of tax cuts which are fully funded and paid for through the Government's management of the economy. When this is coupled with all the changes that we have made in the social area, it is obvious that the Government has made significant changes and has improved conditions for many people in Australia. Earlier, by way of interjection the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for  matters concerning me, and he referred in particular to the question of whether I had 'fled' my seat to become the honourable member for Aston. This was on the shadow Treasurer's mind, of course, because of the turmoil that exists in Victoria with preselection in the Liberal Party of Australia, and the honourable member was trying to score a point off me. However, he failed to understand the very significant difference between what occurred in my case when, because of a redistribution, the old seat of Deakin was cut in half and the new electorate of Aston was created. T-at is significantly different from the situation of the current honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale), the shadow spokesman for education, who is fleeing his seat. Because of a redistribution, that seat is now some 1.5 per cent marginal our way.",74
132,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,They tell me he is going to get done in preselection.,74
133,Mr SAUNDERSON,Unknown,"He is not running for a seat that is vacant but he is attempting to defeat one of his fellow colleagues who sits here in the House and take his seat from him. In the local papers, of course, this proposal has been treated with some derision, and it is no wonder that the shadow Treasurer tried to score some points by having a go at me. The facts are that the Mr Sharp-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the honourable member's comments and I ask you to consider whether they are relevant. The debate is in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebate) Bill, and I do not know what preselection arrangements in Victoria have got to do with this legislation.",74
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have heard the point of order from the honourable member for Gilmore. I was in the chair when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was speaking and he did canvass matters of· the nature referred to. Clearly, our concern is to focus on taxation matters, but, in fairness to the honourable member for Aston, he is responding to matters that were raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.",74
135,Mr SAUNDERSON,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You are quite right; I was responding to those comments. I simply want to make the point that we are confident that the Australian community will see the merits of this Government's economic management and the monetary policy that has been implemented. There have been tax cuts and we have wage arrangements with the trade union movement. We will see some reform in the restructuring of industry and wage increases will flow through. Therefore; I am confident that the community at large will appreciate that our economic management is right. I think that is the main reason why the honourable member for Deakin is attempting to flee his seat. He knows that the Opposition needs a swing of some 2 per cent in order to defeat the present Government at the polls. He knows that his present seat is 1.5 per cent behind and he knows in his heart that the 2 per cent swing that will be necessary for him to retain his seat will not occur. He is fleeing his seat and attempting to get a safe seat. He is prepared to defeat his colleague who sits here in the House with him, in order to try to retain his office here in Canberra. I am sure that this will be seen for what it is: the Liberal Party's lack of confidence in its ability to win the next tion. The date has not been set, but the Government is well on the way towards being re-elected for another term. Finally, I want to canvass a couple of issues that the shadow Treasurer raised in relation to capital gains, and so on. The shadow Treasurer said that a Liberal Government would reduce capital gains tax and change the system significantly. On the question of whether the family home would be excluded, he declined to give an answer and he waffled around that issue-so much so that the shadow spokesman on housing came rushing into the House to try to save the situation for the Opposition. The Opposition's concentration on the question of capital gains simply reinforces the community's view that it is not really concerned about the average worker or the PAYE contributors. Nor is the Opposition concerned about the average householder. Honourable members opposite are only concerned with their big business mates. The Opposition's economic package is designed to weaken the tax avoidance systems that the Government put in place. The capital gains arrangement is one of those, as are the withholding tax arrangements, the tax haven arrangements, the tax file number scheme, and so on. We can go on and on in terms of what this Government has done to crack down on those people who are avoiding tax or had been avoiding tax. Whenever an opportunity arises, we are continuing to narrow the areas in which people can avoid tax that they should rightfully be paying. But the Opposition continues to raise the suggestion that it will reduce, dismantle or remove altogether these sorts of tax avoidance minimisation steps that we have taken. It only reinforces the view that we are in fact the government for the people and that we are looking after and managing. the economy in a way which the Opposition has shown it is incapable of. The Opposition continues to reinforce that view by its lack of an alternative economic policy.",74
136,Mr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"We have just listened to the honourable member for Aston (Mr Saunderson) telling us how compassionate the Labor Government is. I might draw to his attention electhe fact-I am sorry he has left the chamber already-that in March 1983 a person on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children paid 15.6 per cent of income in taxation. In July next year, after all the tax cuts are in place, the family will be paying 21.9 per cent of its income in taxation. That is a rip-off in excess of another 6 per cent of an average family's gross earnings-its entire pay packet. The previous speaker, like other members of his Party, had the audacity to come in here parading as a friend of the worker. There has never been a government as big' at spending or a government as big at tax collection in the history of this nation. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has been the Minister in charge. of these matters right through the administration of the Hawke Government. On 12 April, before the television cameras, the Tre!lsurer, after ages of procrastination, came into this place and announced the details of the taxation cuts. There was a great expectation in the community that they would be substantial, but they were not. High-sounding economic talk surrounding whether tax cuts will fuel inflation and overheat the economy has little meaning to the average man and woman in the street who are struggling to make ends meet. All those people know is that since the advent of the Hawke Government their disposable income has been reduced in total by $58 per week by bracket creep. By July 1990 the family on an average income will again be $56 per week worse off than it was at the time of the change of government in 1983. Whilst I said before that the Labor Government has been a big-taxing government, I omitted to say that it is also Australia's gest-spending government. It is easily our biggest-spending government. It has been happy to see people pushed into higher tax ranges because it was a guarantee that government coffers would overflow and a guarantee that government would have the finance to help rearrange the social order in this country. Estimates were made only last year by the Australian Taxpayers Association based on the figures released by the Treasurer in August last year on the night of the Budget. The projections were that, if there were no alterations in the $19,500 threshold, 4t million Australians would move into that higher category by the income year 1989-90. Four and a quarter million Australians would be in a higher level of income tax payments. The only change we saw the other night in relation to these 4t million people was that the threshold was moved up from $19,500 to $20,600. This means, because of the tax cuts, that we might have about 140,000 fewer people in that higher level of income tax. The only change that those people will have enjoyed as a result of the magnanimous performance of the Treasurer on 12 April is th,at, instead of paying 4ltc tax in the dollar they are going to be paying 40tc in the dollar tax. Big deal! No wonder people interviewed on the streets for the AM program in Sydney the morning after the mini-Budget, when asked what they thought of the Budget, oozed with cynicism. Frankly, I thought the program's producers had gone to a Liberal Party meeting to get people's opinions because everybody was down on the Government. I thought it must have been a set-up. But it was not a set-up. We down here in Canberra, the unreal world, probably did not understand the night before how people would receive the much vaunted cuts that were under way. To a man and to a woman there was the oozing of cynicism along the lines, 'There wasn't much in it for me'. When there is not much in it for them, those ordinary Australian men and women who make up this nation know that those cuts were done in the context of their being $58 a week worse off at that time. I willingly concede that a rearrangement of the lower tax rates will have some side benefits for them, but nowhere near the $58 a week that big- has been ripped out of their pockets in the last five to six years by the failure of the Government to move the threshold level. This is the way it can be done. The Government knows that inflation is lifting people's income levels. It has just got to stand back because more and more people will be paying more and more. Since the Government came into office. I think there has been only one movement in that $5,100 no-tax threshold. I stand to be corrected but I believe that it has been moved only once from well into the $4,000 level up to $5,100. How many little people out there are today paying tax? I am not talking about the pensioners because the Government has been forced to exclude the additional amounts they are allowed to earn before their pensions are affected. What about the tens of thousands of others-190,OOO-odd, in fact-who will be pushed by this time next year into the $5,000 to $6,000 a year level? People who just earn peanuts are now a victim of the Grim Reaper, the one who comes in here in black and earns more in a week in living allowances than they earn",75
137,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,-w!,76
138,Mr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"I am not having a shot; the Minister should just settle down. We are all in this boat. He earns more in living allowances than some of these people do through other forms of income. I make the plea, as I did in my own party room in the beginning of the 1980s, that there is a need for an honest commitment to continued indexation, to move the levels at which different tax rates cut in. Yet his Government, which lauds itself on being pure, is the only Government in recent years to have the dubious title of being the one that reduced the threshold levels. It is not that many years ago that it reduced to $35,000 from about $35,600 or $35,700 the level where the highest income tax rate applied. That was a first. I have not done any research on this but I do not believe in times of peace that any government has gained the title of being one which has actually reduced the threshold levels so that it could catch more people. I referred before to the $19,500 bracket which had been moved up to $20,500, and to the one cent reduction that has taken place. The Australian Taxpayers Association also estimates that the number of people who will move into the top income tax bracket as from the 1989-90 financial year will grow to in excess of 1.3 It is not that many years ago that the highest rate of tax applied to people whose incomes were seven times larger than. the average earnings in the nation. Today it cuts in at about 1t times. As a country we are treating people who are simply marginally more successful than the rest as the tall poppies. Personally I see nothing wrong with the return of a system whereby the 60c in the dollar rate applies to people whose income is 6 or 7 times the average income level. I do not see anything wrong with people who are getting $150,000 a year-and there are a lot of them in Australia-paying high tax levels like they used to, because one can be extremely comfortable on that amount. But a salary of $35,000 a year, received by 1t million people is not necessarily up there in the big league. It is comfortab-e but it is no means rotten rich. Yet this Government, in its rearranging-I referred to this earlierable of the social order of Australia, is happy to leave this in place. The Labor Government's approach is to knock everybody off the top rungs, bring them down into the middle and then we will all be equal. The Liberal philosophy has always been to create an incentive. People may be guilty of self-seeking of improving their own situation, but they will seek to climb that ladder of success and in so doing lift the people on the bottom rungs.",76
139,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"Climb over their backs, you mean.",77
140,Mr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,The Minister may well smile because never in Australia's history has there been any need for a Prime Minister to go to the people promising to eliminate child poverty within two or three years.,77
141,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,He will.,77
142,Mr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"The Minister says he will, but he will have done nothing because the Government created it. There was never a need in earlier years for a preoccupation about child poverty. There was no need for it to be a major plank in an election campaign. It has grown so rapidly during this Government's administration that it has reached this stage. The Government should compare the numbers. It has been the creator by trying to rearrange the social order in million workers. this country.",77
143,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,What rubbish! Where have you been all your life?,77
144,Mr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"I am not going to be distracted by the Minister at the table, for whom I have a fond regard. If there is any example of his inability as an administrator it is the fact that he is so proud of introducing the voting system in the Australian Capital Territory for an election that was held so long ago that I can hardly remember the date, and a result has still not been declared. So milch for the Minister's achievements. I want to conclude by dwelling on another subject. I deeply regret that this document I have from the Australian Taxation Office was not in my hands on 13 April when I moved, in this place to have referred to a by committee a petition presented to the Parliament by the shadow Treasurer, the honour proposing an investigation of the maladministration by the Australian Taxation Office of the implementation of the tax file number system. One of the matters that I. raised at that time concerned the Taxation Office going beyond 1 April in the preliminary stages of and the introduction of the tax file number system as it affected the ordinary people of Australia-who, by that date, had to get their tax file number in place. This Parliament, in its wisdom, last November put in place a requirement that if there were to be an extension beyond that date it had to be done by proclamation so that the Parliament knew what was going on. We had a debate in this House on 13 April and the Government used its numbers to squash the referral. I am very pleased that the discerning Senate is going through the process now of creating its own inquiry because the Australian Democrats and the independents have joined with the Liberals and the National Party to put an inquiry into place. This is the point I want to make. That is the double talk that I am protesting about from a number of the top bureaucrats in this country. I have here the official Taxation Office document, dated yesterday, which would have been a result of my raising this question in this House. It says: Did the Commissioner of Taxation breach provisions in the TFN legislation by extending the period of time given for employees to lodge employment declarations with their employers? The answer was: The Tax File Number provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act provide in subsection 202c (4) that the phasing-in period for the employment use of the TFN ends at the end of 31 March 1989 or on a date to be fixed by proclamation. Nothing that the Commissioner has said or done has altered the date on which the phasing-in period ended. I refer to two press releases by Mr Boucher, dated 30 and 31 March. This is where I talk about double gobbledegook. The first release is about the need of retirees to quote tax file numbers. Mr Boucher tells all superannuants and the like: I also urge all employees to take the opportunity to quote their tax file number as soon as they can after I April 1989. That is the No. 1 slip-up. The other. press release is entitled 'Don't panic about tax numbers'. In this release Mr Boucher tells people not to worry about the date 1 April because it is in the middle of the long weekend. He says that the sensible thing to do is to get the form in next week. However, he then goes on to say: Despite the printing of massive numbers of the forms there may still be a relatively few people who have been unable to get hold of one. Anyone in this situation should get a form from a tax office or an official post office. The tax office will have yet another supply of forms available next week. I say that the credibility of the Taxation Office on this matter is in tatters. Its officers run around the country enforcing the law down the throats of little people, but they do not follow the law themselves and that is what I object to.",77
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Cowan)Order! The hqnourable member's time has expired.,78
146,Mr MILTON,Unknown,"ln supporting the Taxation Laws Amendments (Rates and Rebates) Bill I want to take the opportunity to express my strqng support for the Australian Taxation Office and the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Trevor Boucher, particularly in his handling of the duties of his office. It has become common-place in this House for some members of the Opposition continually to jump up during debates, such as this present one, and decry the powers of the Taxation Office. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) has almost made a fetish of this sort of activity. But it is not only the. honourable member for Moreton. Opposition members talk about invasions of privacy, illegality and blunders, but it never seems that they are prepared to accept the disgraceful attempts by many of the most wealthy corporations and individuals in this country to evade and avoid their legitimate tax liabilities. As - the Commissioner of Taxation has pointed out on more than one occasion, the Tax Office has a right and an obligation to collect the correct amount of payable tax under the law. Mr Donald Cameron-And follow the law.",78
147,Mr MILTON,Unknown,"And, of course, follow the law also. Mr Donald Cameron-That is why I asked.",78
148,Mr MILTON,Unknown,"I do not deny that. I believe that the Commissioner is endeavouring to do just that on behalf of all Australians. Indeed, it was a committee of the Senate which said: The Committee also agrees that the Commissioner is entitled to test the law where he regards it as in doubt, where the Commissioner considers that it is desirable in order to protect the revenue. Arguably the Commissioner has a duty so to do. Rulings which some taxpayers regard as ill-founded may represent no more than the signalling by the Commissioner of his intention to assert, on doubtful points, the view that best protects the Revenue. I say to the honourable member for Moreton that that is what the Tax Commissioner is doing. It is also well known that many wealthy taxpayers-both corporations and individuals-employ a large number of accountants and solicitors to ensure that their clients pay as little tax as possible. Indeed, Sir Garfield Barwick, a previous Chief Justice of the High Court, stated that taxpayers had the right to so arrange their financial affairs that they paid as little tax· as possible. That is a paraphrase of what he said, but that is the essence of his view at that time. Frankly, I consider that view to be' immoral. Fortunately, the views of Sir Garfield Barwick are not held by the present members of the High Court and they have certainly changed a good deal since the day when he was the Chief Justice. Now, the High Court has little regard for taxpayers who continue to work up ingenious. schemes to avoid paying tax. One such scheme was revealed to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration several weeks ago at a public hearing. The Taxation Office gave information to the Committee which indicated that profits had been shifted by certain sections of the banking industry to overseas tax havens in order to avoid the payment of taxes in Australia. It also appeared that sections of the media industry were involved in the same practice. The Tax Office is to be congratulated on its uncovering of such schemes through its audit programs of many large Australian companies. In a recent speech to the Victorian Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Tax Commissioner indicated the high degree of professional excellence which he and the other commissioners endeavour to develop in their professional tax offices. It is worth quoting what the Commissioner said about the professional development goals in view of the criticisms directed at the Taxation Office by honourable members opposite. It is a pity that the honourable member for Moreton is not present in tJ::le Chamber to hear this quote. The Tax Commissioner said: Broadly, the professional tax officer will have the technical knowledge necessary to make the right decisions; the ability to plan and carry out a task efficiently and the judgment needed to make sound decisions at each stage of the job; human skills of communication, understanding and persuasion; and the ability to manage a group of people to undertake a job as a team or series of individual jobs. That seems to me to be some qualification, but it is very important for professional tax officers to have it. I think they are laudable goals which should be combined with the overall goal which the Commissioner is pursuing. I quote from the address by the Commissioner as follows: Our overall goal as an office is to build compliance with the law-preferably voluntary compliance. We are talking about compliance with the law about corporations and individuals who endeavour to evade their tax. The Commissioner went on to say: Building up the professionalism of our staff is one of the key means by which we can achieve this. The audit program has gained $100m more than was anticipated in its first year of operation. To my mind, that is proof of the professional excellence of the taxation officers involved in the program. Unfortunately, there remains a shortage of suitably trained staff and I hope. that the Federal Government will assist the Taxation Office to remedy this deficiency, as the audit program has a return ratio in terms of revenue as compared to the cost of the program of close to 10:1. I agree with the Commissioner that there is a sharp division between right and wrong in tax matters. It is true that taxation Acts are lengthy and complex-in fact, far too complex in my view-but this is no excuse for companies engaging accountants and solicitors to scour through taxation Acts and case law on the constant lookout for tax loopholes which will enable corporations to avoid paying tax. Of course, companies would be' irresponsible in their duties to their shareholders if they paid tax unnecessarily. I quote from an interview which the Commissioner had with the Australian Financial Review on 23 February in which he said: But to make those propositions about rights and duties does not say that if that's the precipice there, over which you fall into an abyss of tax evasion, that legal rights and duties to shareholders take you right to the edge. , They should not be going right up to the edge, of course, but they have been doing this now for a number of years and forcing the Commissioner to try to obtain documents from them so that he can seek out these methods of tax avoidance which the companies have been adopting and take. them to law with all the costs of doing that. The problem with the complexity of the tax laws is that over many years the business community has devoted so much of its resources to attempting to avoid tax. One should say here that this Labor Government has been extremely successful in curbing this practice. Th,ere is no doubt that when we came into office in 1983 thousands of millions of dollars were being avoided in tax. Many of these people have now been taken to court. Even after all these years we are still recovering some of the money. Sometimes these people have to go to prison. We have managed stop this avoidance and the of millions of dollars that are now being returned to the revenue can be used for productive purposes. I sometimes wonder whether it would not be a good idea just to scrap the present taxation Acts, start all over again with simplified system and get rid of all the spetwo cial deductions and allowances. Companies and individuals should be required to pay the basic tax with deductions being allowed just for normal accounting practic;es, such depreciation and the like. It is several decof ades since. I have been in the professional world of business. No doubt some will say that I have got out of touch and am a little naive about the taxation law. But I cannot help thinking that all the resources which companies and individuals are devoting minimising tax and the costs to government in attempting to recover that tax could better used for more productive purposes and would certainly better suit the ecoQ.omy of the country. Let me conclude by reiterating, as I have on a number of occasions, the need for form of wealth taxation. At present there appears to be almost an obscene delight by some wealthy Australians in displaying their wealth as ostentatiously as possible. We still have a number of Australians out of work payments. and in poverty. The Government is attempting to remedy this, but for those people to see this display of riches and the way which these people live and flaunt their wealth in front of the whole population obscene. It seems to me that it would be at all inequitable for some of this wealth be creamed off for the benefit of the country as a whole. Unfortunately, despite many calls for an inquiry into the distribution of wealth in Australia, the Federal Government has not been prepared to bite the bullet. We cersystems. tainly need to know a lot more about where this wealth is actually being held at the presfits, ent time. Nevertheless, there is sufficient dence to indicate that the introduction of such a tax would produce a return of some $1 billion from the top 5 per cent of wealth holders in Australia. That money could be used for productive investment instead of the sort of speculative investment which seems to to be going on at present. I commend the many hundreds Bill to the House.",78
149,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"As the House will be aware, I have over many years taken a very deep interest in the structure of both our tax and social security systems. For the great majority of Australians, the a tax and social security systems are seen as sides of the one coin. There are periods in the life cycle of most Australians when they pay tax. There are other periods in the life cycle of most Australians when they are as recipients of payments from the Department Social Security. To the extent that people have paid tax and subsequently receive a payment from the Department of Social Security, it is my view that that payment should be seen as a tax refund. I would like to see that characterisation done on a life cycle to basis, but because of our determined approach to annual accounting, I guess it will be be a major achievement when we view that approach to taxation and social security on the basis of annual accounts. There are many thousands of Australians who, either themselves or their households, pay tax and then a receive some payment back from the Department of Social Security. To the extent that those payments are going to taxpayers, it is my view that they should be characterised as tax refunds and not as social welfare I want to use the opportunity of this debate to talk about some of th- principles of in taxation,. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill, now before the is House, is a somewhat deceptive document. not A cosmetic change is being presented as to .though it were making substantial tax concessions to Australian taxpayers and in a way that is endeavouring to delude Australianfamilies that all of a sudden their special needs are being adequately and properly recognised by both the tax and social security But that is not the case. The tax concessions and the family allowance benewhich will come up for debate on a later evioccasion, will soon disappear as a cOQ.sequence of inflation, just as the benefits that are now being proffered by the change in the rate structure, both as to thresholds and marginal rates of tax, will disappear in a very short time. The Government has taken advantage of the fixed money levels in the tax scales, the thresholds, and has clawed in huge amounts of money. Some would say that it has made no apology for being a high taxing and high spending Government. Now that the limit of tolerance has been reached, there are many Australians saying that they pay too much tax and who see an election not too far away. All of a sudden, a high taxing and spending government says, 'We will give you some cosmetic temporary tax relief by adjusting the tax threshold and fiddling the rates'. There is a need for major reform. The Liberal and National parties have made it quite clear that their next government will provide a flatter tax system with two steps in the nite scale. This legislation introduces five steps into the tax rate scale, but if looks at the real rate scale that confronts taxpayers and brings into account the Medicare levy, which is a fancy label for taxation-because the Medicare levy does not fund health costs; it makes a token contribution towards them and is a pretence at the hypothecation of a tax to meet a government liability-there are many more than seven steps in the rate scale. There are strange quirks in the marginal rate structure. For example, the Government says it will have a rate structure that has a zero rate band, rising to 21c, to 29c, to 39c, to 47c and then to 49c. In fact, there are, for differing family structures, ranges where some on incomes as low as $9,500 are paying 41c in the dollar. One might ask how. They are paying 41c in the dollar because the Government is clawing back the threshold benefit that those families have had in respect of the Medicare levy. There are some two-children families on incomes of $20,000, or thereabouts, paying 49c in the dollar. If they receive up towards $21,000 per year, they pay 59c in the dollar because the Medicare levy is being withdrawn from them to take account of the concession they had whilst their incomes were somewhat lower. Effectively, we have a tax system which is a hotch-potch of threshold steps, low marginal rates, very high marginal rates, lower marginal rates and, again very high marginal rates. We have said that we want a flatter rate scale-a two-step rate scale. I would hope that it would be a rate scale that totally abandoned the concept of this iniquitous Medicare levy. We should then look at the system and the manner in which that rate scale operates. In recent years there has been much debate in this country about whether we should have a flat rate tax. That is an interesting question, because any rate structure that a country with a progressive rate system may have can be categorised as a flat rate system. To the extent to which a taxpayer pays less than the tax that would be paid on a flat rate from the first dollar to the last dollar earned, the reduction in tax could be seen as a rebate. To the extent to which a taxpayer pays more than the flat rate, it could be seen as a surcharge. One might well ask: What flat rate does one notionally use to apply one that test? The sensible rate to apply as the basic or standard rate is that which confronts the full time work force. It is that marginal rate which has the most significant effect on incentives. If therefore, we applied the rate that confronts the full time work force, up to 30 June this year it is 40c in the dollar. From 30 June it will be 39c in the dollar. It is still very much higher than the flat rate or underlying rate confronting the full time work force under the· Fraser Government. Labor has raised the underlying tax rate that confronts the full time work force from 30c in the dollar to 40c in the dollar and is nowMr Kerin-That is marginal.",80
150,Mr WILSON,Unknown,That is right. Mr Kerin-The average is about 22c to 23c.,81
151,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"But Labor's average tax is very much higher than the average tax confronting Australian taxpayers and families under the Fraser Government. It is very much higher because Labor has not adjusted the threshold or point at which that 39c impacts upon the taxpayer. This change that the Labor Government is introducing makes some minor adjustments. It has raised the threshold at which the 39c will apply to $20,600, but that is still significantly below average weekly earnings. When the Fraser Government was in office the point at which the tax level increased 40c in the dollar was substantially above average weekly earnings. Labor is setting a system that will enable it to gather more and more tax as inflation goes on. Let us do some figures. Let us assume that in 1989-90 there will be a wages growth, dependants. average weekly earnings growth or taxable incomes growth of a modest 7 per cent. If one applies the fixed thresholds that will operate from 1 July and assumes that they will continue not only from 1 July 1989 but also from 1 July 1990, one will see that 1990-91 government revenues will grow above a constant real collection of tax by $2 billion. Labor is offering $4 billion of $5 billion worth of tax cuts knowing that it has no intention of changing those thresholds in 1990, so that the tourniquet will again begin to impact upon Australian taxpayers .and families. In 1990-91 it will have a windfall gain of $2 billion, increasing real tax collections and reducing the real disposable come remaining to Australian taxpayers. That needs to be exposed because the Labor Govany ernment has gained some publicity out of the fact that it has said that it will index certain elements of the changes to the tax structure; but it has not indexed the most fundamental aspect of the current tax strucrate ture-that is, the thresholds within the rate scale. Those thresholds should be inde;xed, otherwise we get fiscal drag or bracket creep increasing the tax burden on Australians. their incomes rise, the. tax collector takes higher and higher proportion of the income. The thresholds within the rate scales should be indexed in line with average weekly earnings. I have already said that one progressive rate scale in terms of a flat rate system. I would like to see not only a flatter rate system but also a flat rate system with adjustments to the underlying tax base. want to spend a few minutes talking about that because in 1988 the Government proone's duced a paper entitled 'Tax Expenditures Statement'. The authors of that paper outbecame lined some of the conceptual issues upon which they based their analysis. They said .that the legislative, progressive personal income tax rate scale, including the tax, free threshold, is part of the benchmark or underlying tax system. I think there is a defect to in the conceptual basis upon which taxation expenditures are assessed. The defect is this: up there is no allowance made in that conceptual analysis for appropriate adjustments to the tax scale to take account of the payments made by individuals in supporting The dependent spouse rebate-though increased, it is still very inadequate-should be treated as part of the underlying tax base or the benchmark test. It should not be treated as a tax expenditure. Otherwise, this paper in is saying that the Labor Government does not believe that the tax system should be based upon capacity to payor, if it will base its tax system on capacity to pay, its approach to that capacity to pay is to say that capacity to pay is simply a function of income. It is like saying, 'We will have a zero rate threshold. We have no conceptual, principled basis as to why it should be $5,100'. It used to be argued that $5,100, or whatinever the zero rate base was, took into account the non-discretionary expenditure that taxpayer needed to incur in order to live at a modest standard of living. The fact that that figure has been frozen now for seven or eight years seems to deny that that is the approach taken even in respect of the zero base. It is then argued that one's capacity to pay tax is a function of one's income. The Labor Party wants a progressive tax rate scale so that there are the various incremenAs tal steps clawing in more and more as one's a income rises, but with the threshold squeezing down so one is paying more. One's income becomes lower in relation to the total income profile of the community. Such a system makes no allowance for the cost of can express a supporting a dependant. Over the years I have expressed two views, with one more radical than the other. The radical view is that a fair and equitable tax I system would give a tax rebate to taxpayers who support a dependant, a cash rebate off tax of an amount equal to the cost of supporting that dependant if the dependant the liability of the Department of Social Security. In other words, if a taxpayer is supporting a dependent spouse, the taxpayer should receive an amount equivalent to the married rate pension as a rebate his or her tax because, if a marriage relationcharacterise ship splits up and the otherwise dependent spouse approaches the Department of Social Security and says that he or she has three children to look after, the department prosystem vides a pension of the order of $5,000 or $6,000, depending on how the person qualihousehold. fies. It is my view that a taxpayer who supports a person who would otherwise be dependent on the Department of Social Seholds curity should receive a tax rebate to that extent. It should be seen as part of the underlying tax base and not a social expendment iture or a social welfare payment even if is a cash payment, as is the case with family allowance payments in respect of children. I turn now to children. Where children are totally dependent on the Department Social Security, the allowance that the carer expired. of those children receives is substantially higher than the family allowance paid to great body of Australian families. I believe that every taxpayer, in order to ensure that there is proper horizontal equity between taxpayers who are single and taxpayers who support dependent spouses and children, should be entitled to receive a payment in respect of children. To use the Government's own yardstick, in the case of young children it is 15 per cent of the married rate pension, and for older children it is 20 per cent the married rate pension. Every family should receive that payment. No-one can tell me that very affluent families should not receive a large tax refund. They deserve it; they supporting children for the time being. High income earners who are paying more should receive an increased rate, while those supporting dependent children should be given at least the amount that those children would cost the Department of Social Securattempt ity to maintain if the families had to maintained by the Department. The less radical approach that I have vocated, and it may be that it is a step towards the radical approach that I just scribed, is to say that the tax burden imposed on households should be a function of the household's income and not a function of who earns the income within the household. I am a strong advocate of parents being entitled to be treated as partners, their income and pay tax on the basis of a off partnership return. Of course, one could that as a rebate if one wishes. It may be that in addition to this two person partnership system we should move in the direction of the French and have a quotient so that the divisor of the income is related to the number of children within the However, it is centrally important that the tax system is made less hostile towards Australian families and those housebringing up young children. To do that 'we must have a radical reform of the tax system but not, as proposed by the Governin this legislation, cosmetic change to it give back a small proportion of the additional tax drawn in over recent years by the Labor Government.",81
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Cowan)of Order! The honourable member's time has  the last we are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill to introduce the long awaited tax cuts which were the announced in the April mini-Budget-and what a pathetically damp squib of a package it was. That package failed to address our disastrous balance of payments, it failed to address the problem of rising inflation and the problem of rising interest rates, and it failed to give the long-awaited outline of the of Government's micro-economic reform proposals. Not only did it fail to address the major economic problems facing the nation; it was also a massive sell-out to the Austraare lian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), which is indeed pitted against meaningful tax reform of the labour market. The wage tax trade-off does nothing for the future economic growth of this country and it is quite clear that it is merely an to get the Government off the hook be in relation to micro-economic reforms. In effect, the Government is holding on to the adAccord like a drowning man holding on to a plank of wood-but the plank is waterlogged deand it is sinking. Even Max Walsh, in the Sydney Morning Herald, wrote an article about the accord headed 'The accord is a reckless and wrecking monster'. Even he acknowledges that the accord has had its day. It is wrecking the prospects for economic to split growth in this nation. It is not surprising then, when so much store has been placed in the wage-tax tradeoff and when one hears the economic commentators saying that that is not the way to go, that the public reaction to the miniBudget was so devastating. The Government itself could not believe the public response to the mini-Budget. The mini-Budget was badly received because the people knew that, after six years of hard labour, the tax cuts were a political gimmick, that they would be whipped away from them· in no time at all because of inflation and higher interest rates. In fact, 40 per cent of the value of the cuts-or $2 billion-will be clawed back by the Government in the next 12 months by bracket creep alone. The remaining value of the cuts will be,taken in the next six months by inflation and higher interest rates, higher home loan repayments. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) kept telling us last year that the tax cuts would be given only when they could be afforded. I do not know how he defines 'aff-rdability', but the current account deficit is blowing out to record levels-in fact, 50 per cent higher than his prediction-and inflation is roaring away, despite all the Treasurer's predictions and his recent rigging of the consumer price index (CPI). Interestingly enough, the current rate is about twice that of our trading partners. Really, it defies logic for the Treasurer to say, in the face of all these problems, that suddenly the tax cuts are affordable. The fact is that the Treasurer just was not able to withstand the pressure being put on him and the Government for some tax cuts. The Government was seen to be increasingly unpopular and in desperation it tried to do something that was popular. It is not as though the tax cuts were not due. Quite the reverse: they were long overdue. But they should have been provided in an economically sound context, and they have not been. This Government is the biggest spending, biggest taxing Government this country has ever seen, and there lies the problem. It just cannot massively increase Government expenditure and taxation without that having a significant impact on the private sector. That is exactly what is occurring now. Taxes have rocketed up under Labor. For example, pay as you earn (PAYE) tax collections in 1982-83, the first year this Government came to office, totalled $18.8 billion. This year they are $38.9 billion-a 107 per cent increase. Total income tax has risen from $23 billion to $61.7 billion in the period of this Government-a 120 per cent increase. The Government said we were not going to have a consumption tax, but there has been a pretty nifty move towards a much heavier reliance on indirect taxes, which have increased from $3.5 billion to $8.9 billion in the period of this Government-an increase of 154 per cent. So all of those taxes have increased by up to 150 or 160 per cent in six years. Have average wages gone up that fast? No. Has inflation gone up that fast? No. Average wages and inflation have gone up by about 50 per cent in that period. So we have seen that taxes have risen at two or three times the rate of wages and inflation. In other words, the Government is collecting a lot more in taxes than people are earning. For every extra dollar that people earn, roughly $2 is being taken from them in. tax. That is why the people do not believe in the mini-Budget. They know the benefits are all going to be taken away as soon as they are given to them. The Treasurer has not been too subtle in the way in which he has accomplished this massive rip-off of the Australian community. This Government has made on average one change to the tax laws for each week it has been in government. During more than 300 weeks in office, more than 300 changes have been made to the. tax laws. Two hundred of those 300 changes were to increase tax. The Government has got an outstanding record-and this is perhaps its only really outstanding record-that is, its ability to devise new ways of ripping off the public. It has instituted all sorts of new kinds of taxes: a capital gains tax, a fringe benefits tax, an entertainment tax and even the Medicare levy. It has extended existing taxes to cover new areas, with a sales tax now on citrus juice, wine, flavoured milk and so on. There are superannuation taxes, and taxes on Telecom Australia and Australia Postthey are all new taxes. On the other side, it has eliminated or reduced rebates and concessions. For example, it abolished the health insurance rebate and the housing interest rebate, and it has reduced depreciation allowances for farmers and industry. It has increased the rate of cost recovery for certain services provided by Government departments, such as export inspection charges. It instituted a system of indexing taxes so it can let inflation do its dirty work-for exalllple, the indexation of excise on petroleum, alcohol and cigarettes and the fees on passports. It has used every possible device to up the tax take. Never before has a government been so good at finding new taxes and imposing taxes on almost everything that moves in this country. When it could not find enough by imposing new taxes, it just upped the old taxes. Perhaps most perniciously, it has allowed inflation continually to push taxpayers into higher tax brackets, so even though the average weekly wage has just kept pace with inflation, personal income tax has increased faster because wage earners have been pushed into higher tax brackets. After just one year under these new tax schedules, bracket creep will have siphoned' off, as I said, $2 billion of the tax cuts. is more than 40 ,per cent of the value of the cuts we are debating today. In summary, the tax cuts we are considering have been paid for many times over by the Australian community. Forty per cent of their value will be clawed back within about 12 months, and the balance will be gobbled up by inflation, higher interest rates and higher home loan repayments. The members of the public are not fools. That is why there was such a dismal reaction to the Government's mini-Budget. The people do not believe this Government, and they are right. Their response to the mini-Budget was to can it, and they were right in so doing. So much for the hype that these are the greatest tax cuts this country has ever seen. We hear the hype all the time, such as that this is the greatest Ministry this country has ever seen. I have never seen so many Ministers wanting to get out of the Ministry in my life. Almost every day we read in the newspapers about another Minister wanting to bale out-rats leaving the sinking ship. One of the purposes of the Bill is to require the Commissioner of Taxation to reduce to the appropriate level the quarterly tax instalments payable under the provisional tax system. I want to focus on the provisional tax system for a moment, because I want to bring to the attention of the House a real anomaly in the existing system. On 19 September 1985 the Government announced a new system for paying provisional taxes. That system required taxpayers to pay compulsory quarterly instalments of provisional income tax where their liability was estimated to be in excess of $5,000. At the time that the system was introduced, the Government claimed that it would be revenue neutral because it did not actually add to the tax take but, according to the Government, simply moved the receipt of the taxes forward. For example, actual receipts for 1986-87 would be increased by $90m and so on. However, by the time the legislation was introduced, the Government acknowledged that the early receipt of the tax funds would eventually result in a $120m saving of interest for the Commonwealth from the reduced need to sell government securities. So in the end, when the legislation got That here two years after the Government announced its intention to introduce it, it said that actually it would save the Government $120m and obviously could cut costs to taxpayers by $120m. According to one of the major accounting firms in Australia the new system, with all the extra work involved, is actually costing the Australian Taxation Office and taxpayers $66m a year more than it is saving the Government. So it has actually cost the country more. As I say, the legislation for these new provisions was not brought in until February 1987 and it appears now, in the application of those changes, that some pretty sneaky provisions were slipped through. Those provisions are now beingapplied by the Tax Commissioner in a way that I think is totally unfair and inequitable. Section 221YCA (2) (e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act now states: Where an amount of an instalment is reduced and the taxpayer has paid an amount in respect to the instalment, the Commissioner shall(i) credit any amount overpaid successively to--'-(A) the payment of any instalment of provisional tax payable by the taxpayer for the year of income; and (s) the payment of any income tax payable by the'taxpayer in respect of the income of any year of income; and (ii) refund to the taxpayer any part of the amount overpaid that it not so credited. I am sure honourable member understand very clearly what all that means. Cases put to me suggest that the Commissioner is implementing that provision in such a way that any overpayment of provisional tax resulting from a change in income received would be applied first to that year's future instalment payments, and only after that would any balance be refunded to the taxpayer. Let me explain by way of example a case put to me. Suppose a provisional taxpayer's income in 1986-87 was $100,000. For the purposes of 1987-88, provisional taxes would be based on $111,000 because of the 11 per cent .uplift factor. Provisional income tax for 1987-88, plus the Medicare levy in that situation is $48,541, which would be paid in four equal instalments of just over $12,000 due on 1 September, 1 December, 1 March and 1 June. In July 1988, the taxpayer files a tax return for the 1987-88 year and finds that he had a taxable income only of $50,000 instead of $111 ,000. Maybe his business did not go well or the business he was involved in had a downturn; there was a substantial reduction in the tax payable. ,The tax and the levy on an income of $50,000 is $17,976. The taxpayer in this case has overpaid his provisional tax by $30,565. Normally, he would be entitled to a refund, but the Commissioner, exercising the provisions of Section 221 yeA of the Act, is apparently raising assessments and applying the overpayment to the instalments due in 1988-89. Provisional tax for 1988-89 is based on $56,000$50,000 income for 1987-88 plus the 198889 12 per cent uplift factor-which results in the tax being $20,991 which would be payable in four instalments of $5,247-odd. So the provisional tax on his income is nearly $21,000. We must remember that he has already paid over $30,500. What happens? The Taxation Office applies the $30,565 overpayment to the provisional tax requirement of nearly $21,000 and only sends .the taxpayer a refund of the balance, which is $9,574. The example illustrates that this taxpayer has by 1 March 1988 virtually paid his income tax for both 1987-88 and 1988-89, and has prepaid all quarterly payments through to the end of June 1989. The example looks at an individual taxpayer who earns $50,000 for two consecutive years. Not only has this individual prepaid taxes far in advance, but had he paid taxes on a PAYE monthly basis and invested the money not prepaid at 12 per cent, the savings would have earned him over $3,000 interest over the 24-month period. The interest forgone has nothing to do with the amount of tax ultimately paidthat amount would be the same whether the taxpayer paid on a P AYE basis or on the quarterly provisional basis. But because of the anomaly in the methodology, and the specific application of the overpayments, which the law requires, this taxpayer has forgone interest income and virtually paid an additional 3 per cent tax. The Commissioner will not give him his tax refund but will hold it and virtually take in advance three quarters-worth of instalments of provisional tax, and the taxpayer is substantially worse off. The figures in my example may not coincide exactly with the figures of the specific case which has been drawn to my attention, but they truly represent the reality of the situation .. The corollary to the scenario in which an individual is deprived of interest income is even worse. I refer to the situation where the taxpayer has to borrow money to make his provisional payments, thus incurring a real expense to pay taxes. The fact that the Government has recognised that the early payment of taxes through the quarterly instalment payment system will save it $120m a year in interest expense means that it is costing the taxpayers at least that $120m in interest forgone. The real problem that I bring to the attention of the Minister and his advisers is the application of the law in this situation.",83
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Cowan)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,86
154,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"1 welcome this opportunity of making a few comments on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill. The significance of this Bill is that it gives effect, by way of a number of amendments to various taxation Acts, to a number of proposals that were announced in the 12 April economic statement, the so-called tax-wage package that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has been busily negotiating with the Australian Council of Trade Unions over the last several months. I believe that the package takes the electorate for granted. Clearly, it underestimates the sophistication of the electorate. It has turned its back on financial markets in the real economy. It is little more than a rush to an early election. It is my guess that that early election, despite what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) says, will be before the Budget. As a professional economist, I see it as bad economics, and I suspect that it will prove to be bad politics as well. The Government makes much of itssuccess in employment creation in its term in this Parliament. I suggest that the package puts that employment growth at risk. That should be a matter of very great concern to the average Australian. In economic terms, the package increases the probability that the Government will put interest rates higher yet, and that they will remain higher longer, thereby increasing the chance that there will be a hard landing for the Australian economy in the latter part of this year Or early next year. This package does nothing to address the fundamental economic problems that confront Australia at present, such as our b\llance of payments problem and our inflation problem, which are both a reflection of the extent to which this economy has been overheated by this Government and the extent to which it has failed to address microeconomic reform. The 12 April package compounds the risk of what is a very high risk strategy. It leaves the economy in very precarious circumstances in what, in international terms, are probably some of the most prospectively difficult circumstances of the postwar period. The electorate will soon recognise that the tax cuts that are embodied in this Bill will give back only a part of what has already been taken by way of higher taxes and higher interest rates. Any temporary benefit or relief that the average Australian will feel beyond 1 July as a result of this package will soon be clawed back by higher inflation, by bracket creep, and by higher interest rates. It is instructive, I believe, to look at tax cuts against a background of the most recent release of the statement of Commonwealth Government financial transactions released by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) on 2 May and to look at some of the revenue growth numbers for the first nine months of this financial year as evident in that document. Total revenue is up 7.7 per cent. Gross PAYE tax receipts are up 16.9 per cent against a Budget estimate of 13.8 per cent-which has already staggered some people-which then was three times the Treasurer's projected inflation forecast, and net PAYE receipts in the nine months to March are up 18.2 per cent. Collections under the prescribed payments system are up 38 per cent, and sales tax receipts are up 24 per cent. As the honourable member for  alone has probably gone up so far under this Government by about 150 per cent, which is three times the rate of inflation and more than double the increase in consumer expenditure. I am told that the Treasurer now boasts that he has already clawed back the money that he would otherwise have hoped to raise in 1985 as a result of his proposed broad-based consumption tax. It is important, when we look at. these measures, to. consider the tax cuts in the context of what is a continuing and monumental tax rip-off. Indeed, even after these tax cuts take effect, this Government will remain the highest taxing government in Australia's post-war history. It has given back only part of what it has taken and, as I say, the benefits will. not be sustained. In that context I want to make. a couple of remarks about the circumstances which will occur, I believe, in the next several months, where we will see those benefits clawed back.. The Government, and in particular the Treasurer, has shown an acute sensitivity to any criticism of the tax package, and in recent days the Treasurer has done everything he can to distract attention from that package. He is on the record as trying very badly to defend his package against the accusation of many people that it directly puts at risk our overheated economy-indeed, it involves a risk of compounding the extent of the overheating that presently exists in the economy. To give an example of the sort of gobblethese degook that one gets from the Treasurer in this regard, I refer the House to an answer that the Treasurer gave at his last press conference on the balance of payments, when he tried to deal with this issue. He said: There is no risk in last week's package, that in terms of the boost to consumption identified by journalists as a risk, there is no risk; only relies on this understanding of the analysis in relation to the stimulus from the public sector. If the surplus this year is $5.5 billion and the surplus next year is $5.5 billion, the change year over year is zero. But as you know we have been I;xpecting a surplus without tax cuts of $10 to $11 billion. So we've got $5.5 billion, rising by another $5.5 roughly, because of higher growth, more employment, more activity, that $5.5 we are getting back, keeping the $5.5 we had, so the change is zero. Can anyone understand that? I could libt understand it. I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about. I am pleased that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is at the table, because he is one of the more honest aspirants to the office of Treasurer on that side of Parliament. Indeed, in yesterday's Question Time he came clean; he put the facts on the record as to the nature of the risks that are inherent in the April package, which we are referring to, in part, in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill. In answer to a question asked in the House yesterday, the Minister referred to a $1.4 billion cut in oil taxation. In a mocking fashion, which tends to be his style, the Minister spelt out the effects that that would have on the economy. He said: It would have an adverse macro-economic effect from a lower Budget surplus. The surplus, in the Minister's example, would be $1.4 billion lower than would otherwise be the case. The surplus mentioned by the Treasurer-if one can get anything out of that quote that I referred to before-is about $5.5 billion below what would otherwise have been the case. Instead of being $11 billion it will be about $5.5 billion. So, if the Minister at the table is concerned about the potentially adverse macro-economic effect of a lower Budget surplus to the extent of $1.4 billion, he must not sleep at night worrying about the magnitude of the adverse effects that will flow from the Treasurer's package, where the surplus totals $5.5 billion, or roughly four times the amount that he was referring to yesterday. This is one element of the claw back. There is a very real risk that it will further overheat the ,economy and we will see further increases in interest rates by this Government. We will see higher inflation, irrespective of the extent to which the Government fiddles the consumer price index (CPI)- and we will see some evidence of that with the release of the next figure tomorrow. Also, of course, people realise that they are still being pushed into higher and higher tax brackets, as inflation pushes up their income. The other matter to which I want to draw the attentio,n of the House is that the economic statement as a whole did nothing in relation to our fundamental economic problems. It is in that sense that the electorate will soon realise that any benefits, that are delivered from these tax cuts will be short lived. As I say, the prospect is higher inflation and further increases in interest rates. The key point is that we should look at Australia today in terms of current world economic circumstances. We already have the worse wage inflation position in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Yet, the package of measures which, in part, we are looking at today, gives an across the board wage increase to all workers irrespective of their productivity. Indeed, we should pause and think back to the time of the last Budget, when the Treasurer had a very optimistic outlook in relation to the balance of payments: a $9.5 billion deficit was in prospect and there was an expectation that inflation would fall to 4.5 per cent. At that point the Treasurer talked in terms of a genuine wage-tax trade-off-a zero wage increase in return for the tax cut. Indeed, as the months went on, and he visited New York, he clarified the reference to 'zero'. He meant a zero increase' in earnings in return for that tax cut. Yet, the measures that we are considering today, announced in the 12 April statement, give a tax cut of $20pretty much the same order of magnitudebut that is along with a wage increase of about $50 to $70, which will take effect across the board, quite unrelated to produc"" tivity. So, in very precarious world, circumstances, where we are at the top of the league table in the OECD in terms of wages and inflation, the Treasurer delivers that sort of wage increase across the board, unrelated to productivity. He was decisively rolled, no doubt, by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and Australia will pay a very real price for the extent to which that has occurred. The point is that the Treasurer effectively has been forced to institutionalise. a wage break-out. He calls it in the name of the accord and, as is so often the style of the Treasurer, he has simply moved the goal posts. One can think about how many versions of the so called accord we have had since 1983, and each time the goal posts have been moved to make it easier to kick a goal, rather than deal with any of the fundamental problems. As I have said before, the approach is that instead of dealing with the issue of inflation the Government decides to move the goal posts up to half-way and in those circumstances it is a hell of a lot easier to kick a goal. The Government has decided that it will not address the problem; that it will just make it look as though the problem is going away by fiddling the CPI. Equally, as to the risk of further overheating an already overheated economy, that issue is not even addressed. Of the 17 pages in the April statement only a little more than one page was devoted to the economic debate. Back in August the Treasurer referred to the balance of payments as our number one economic problem and to inflation as our number one economic disease. Both those things had moveddramatically off course relative to the Treasurer's forecasts at that time. Yet, we still find those matter receiving only one sentence each in the April statement. That is a pathetic commentary on the extent to which the Treasurer has been prepared to come clean about the magnitude of our economic problems and of the extent to which we are left in a very precarious situation. In these terms, I see the wage-tax tradeoff that the Treasurer brought down on 12 April-in part, introduced in this Bill-as effectively the surrender terms of economic management in this country. The Treasurer has put the whole show at risk for the sake of a short term, vote buying exercise, in a world situation which, as I say, is particularly precarious. For example, in Japan the Prime Minister has resigned and there is political uncertainty in prospect for 12 or 18 months. In economic. terms we will start to see things in Japan that we have not seen hitherto, such as rising inflation, increases in interest rates and flatter growth rates. The United Kingdom has problems similar to ours-high and rising interest rates and flattening activity. Germany has gone it alone. It is putting up interest rates quite dramatically. The United States has had some interest rate increases. The evidence to date is that activity is flattening faster than expected. This is all bad news for us. This all relates to the prospect of higher inflation, higher interest rates and flatter economic activity and, from our point of view, falling export markets and falling commodity prices. Against that very dangerous international economic circumstance, the Treasurer brings down a package like this that is completely oblivious to the nature of our economic problems and the extent to which we are already at risk in this country.

There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",89
157,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,"The Wheat Marketing Bill 1989 and the related wheat levy Bills have a number of major features. They include the removal of the Australian Wheat Board's acquisition and price setting power for wheat for domestic human consumption; the retention of the Board's export monopoly and the reduced.' underwriting guarantee from the current 95 per cent to 90 per cent next season and then a phasedown to 80 per cent in 1993, after which this part of· the legislation will cease; the removal of an acceptable level of wheat grower Board membership; and the' virtual prohibition of the Wheat Board from instrastate trading and a threatening restriction to its pool interstate trading. The Bill also gives the Board the ability to negotiate better rail freight arrangements with the use of the commerce or export power. The same section, section 88, also provides the Federal Minister with the ability to override or even terminate State commodity marketing authorities other than in wheat. This is the cause of justifiable and considerable State opposition. Wheat growing is a major rural industry. In the 1988-89 year the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics put the gross value of farm production of wheat at $2.37 billion, with exports worth $1.88 billion. That is about $40,000 worth of exports per wheat grower this year and up to $70,000 several years ago from Australia's 45,000 wheat' growers. However, despite the importance of the industry, this Bill has been poorly drafted. Both the Wheat Board and the Grains Council of Australia have expressed concern at inconsistencies, contradictions and omissions in a number of areas quite apart from the major policy issues such as the Board's domestic or export powers. Proof of the shoddy drafting is that the Opposition has about 40 amendments, while the Government has even more-about 45. Many of the Government's amendments relate to the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Collection Bill. This is despite the fact that the Government has had 12 months to prepare the Bill. The Bill is also shoddy because it reveals the contempt of this Government towards providing a fair deal for Australia's wheat growers. It makes a joke of the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) when he said: The Bill also gives effect to the Government's concern to minimise its own' control over the A WB's operations and to extend the Board's accountability to growers. Yet we find in almost every section of the Bill that the Wheat Board has to seek the written permission of the Minister before it can borrow, spend the growers' own levy money or start a subsidiary company; Is this minimising government control when at least 20 times in this Bill there is ministerial interference? The Minister also said: The A WB will not be weakened as has been claimed, but will be significantly strengthened. In another part of his second reading speech he said: I am confident that the A WB will remain the dominant force in a deregulated domestic market, given its expertise and the additional commercial powers . . .. Those are very hollow words. At this eleventh hour the Minister has not been able to convince one of the State governments to pass the necessary complementary legislation for the Board to be able to trade intrastate: after 1 July. The South Australian Parlia· ment has already risen and will not sit again until August. In answer to a question in the Victorian Parliament yesterday a Government Minister there said it was not in a hurry to pass complementary legislation and would wait until the Federal Bill was finalised. The Victorian Parliament will no doubt be in recess at that time and will not resume again until at least August. This means that the Australian Wheat Board does not have the power to trade intrastate after 1 July. Honourable members should realise that about 80 per 'cent of domestic trade takes place within each State. What is the Wheat Board to do from 1 July? It can either hand over virtually the entire domestic market to the grain merchants or it can defy the Constitution and trade within a State until such time as the States pass complementary legislation to make that trade legal or until it is challenged in the High Court. The Wheat Board is in an impossible position. I acknowledge that, even with the amendment that I will be moving in committee, it will remain so. It may also be in trouble with its auditors under this legislation if it goes ahead and trades intrastate. There is also a doubt that it may not be able to finish the domestic trading of the current pool. Here, more than in any other aspect of the wheat legislation, the Minister has treated the industry with contempt. He could be accused of misleading Parliament with his repeated claims, including those in his second reading speech, that the Board's domestic trading position is protected. He cannot plead,.ignorance because he has been advised of this predicament for months. His desperate pressure on the States in recent months confirms this. Yet instead of allowing a phase-out of that particular section of the legislation or using some other means to mark time until this problem is corrected, he has ruthlessly pushed ahead. My anger tonight will be very mild compared to that of growers in the chaotic months ahead. Fortunately, due to pressure from the coalition parties, the legislation provides for the Board to retain its monopoly export powers for export markets and thus prevents a disaster of even greater proportions. Australian wheat growers are already the lowest paid in the Western world, because they are without subsidies. There is no complaint about that, yet they must sell their wheat on world markets against the subsidised grain from the European Community (EC) and the United States of America. In 1985-86 Australia had about 19.5 per cent of the world's wheat trade and flour trade. Today we have only 11.3 per cent. Over the same period the European Community has gone from 18 per cent to 20 per cent while the United States share has jumped from 29 per cent to about 43 per cent with the help of those export subsidies. The Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, Clinton CondQn, in a letter to the Australian Financial Review on 28 Apriljust last week-said that since enhancement programs began in 1985 the United States has sold in excess of 59 million tonnes of wheat with subsidies of up to $US50 per tonne. He said there was no doubt that subsidised trade on this scale had affected 'the whole world wheat trade'. Because Australian farmers do not receive any subsidies, Mr Condon said, they must react logically to the world price of wheat by sowing more wheat when prices dse or reducing their acreage when the price drops. Mr Condon said: Since 1985 . . . when the US began its export enhancement programme, Australian production has fallen from more than 18 million tonnes to about 13 million tonnes as world wheat prices continued to fall. This in turn has made it even easier for the United States and th- European Community, with their stockpiles,' to increase their market share. Australia's share of the Russian and Chinese markets has been seriously eroded since the introduction of the American export subsidies. The United States defends its subsidy program by saying that it is necessary to bring the Europeans to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiation table. But negotiations are still not advanced and both the European Community and the US have increased market share. Australia and Australian wheat growers, the genuine free traders in all this, have been the losers. Last year the US spent $US760m on its export enhancement program. This year Congress has been asked to approve $USl.l billion. The news from Europe is that there is no lessening in its subsidies and production is still increasing. As recently as last week, with the visit of Vice-President Quayle, the Australian Government achnowledged that the US export enhancement program is affecting Australian exports and was quite rightful in its criticism of the US program. Yet the same Australian Government is prepared not only to force Australian wheat growers to compete against those corrupt prices on export markets but now to force them to sell down to these corrupt prices on the home market. Today there is a report of the US sale to the USSR of 1t million tonnes of wheat. While the amount of subsidy given by the US Government on this particular sale is not yet known it is likely to be about $US 18 to $US20 a tonne. There is no need, with low world wheat stocks, for this subsidy. It has just been given so that the Americans can increase their market share. In the past the price for the domestic market in Australia has been set at the best export price. From now on, or with the passage of this legislation, it will go down to the average export price or lower. This in turn is lower than it should be because of United States and European subsidies. There is no reason why our domestic market should be pushed down because of decisions taken in other countries. No other industry in Australia is expected to perform such feats. Mr Kerin-Wool.",90
158,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,"That is a very interesting point. Wool has an ability to control the world price; so I. think the Minister would be very unwise to use wool as an example again. If the Government wants to look at some more appropriate examples let us look at the productivity of some of the other industries in this country compared to a world efficient wheat industry. The efficiency of our automotive industry today is under half that of our Western competitors; for railway freight it is a quarter to one eighth that of other Western nations. Waterfront efficiency is less than half of other Western world efficiency levels. These areas do not have to compete at even commercial world levels let alone corrupt world levels. The Governmemt's attitude to the rural people of Australia is clear: 45,000 wheat growers earning close to $2 billion in export income do not count anywhere near as much as the wharf labourers, those in coastal shipping or railways or just about any other area of the work force. While wheat growers are forced to accept prices which are below normal world levels other workers are allowed to continue practices which put their costs well above that of our competitors and which, in turn, add to wheat grower and other exporter costs. For the past 12 months the Grains Council has been lobbying the Government to use the commerce or export power to improve the expensive, inefficient and highly regulated grain transport and export terminal systems to implement the recommendations of the MCColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. These transport savings can be achieved irrespective of the marketing arrangement. Initially nothing was done; in fact the Federal Minister assured the rail unions that nothing would be done. At the last minute, as well as a section being dropped to remove the Wheat Board's export monopoly a section was inserted to provide the Board with the export power to negotiate transport arrangements. I want to quote from the Bendigo Advertiser of 19 April which carried the headline, 'VJLine won't lose out in wheat plan: MHR'. It is an article, or press release, by the Federal Labor honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby). In this article he assures the railway union people that they will not lose any jobs-that does not mean much for greater efficiency-and that the only reason the Government brought it in was that 'The Opposition parties, but particularly the National Party, indicated that they would not even consider the wheat marketing deregulation without the other, so our hand was really forced'. The honourable member for Bendigo was attempting to duck the wrath of his railway workers, but with a completely false argument. We clearly recognise that there is no relationship between transport efficiency and marketing. The wheat growers of Australia are entitled to the least cost transport chain for the export of their grain, irrespective of the marketing system. Already the Australian Labor Party Victorian Conference has carried a resolution condemning the use of this power, saying that it will cost the Victorian railways $22m a year and a thousand jobs. That is a little bit different from what the honourable member for Bendigo said, so will the unions allow it to work? Even if they do it will not provide wheat growers with a real choice. It will mean the Wheat Board dealing with the railways, rather than the. grain handling authorities dealing with the railways, to negotiate better, regulated freight arrangementsnot deregulation, not Competition. The use of the commerce power is not new but I do understand the concern of some State governments that it is overriding traditional State areas of responsibility. Nevertheless, the Opposition parties believe that it is an advance and therefore it will be supported. I want to make it clear that this is not the proposal that the Grains Council put forward and it is not what is needed to provide growers with a competitive rather than managed or regulated system or a choice of transport modes. The export power, as the Council wanted it used, would have allowed special export road licensing to permit suitable road vehicles to compete with railways-as happens in South Australia to everybody's advantage-and really provide a deregulated choice for deregulated wheat growers. This proposal will not deliver any great savings to growers because those costs are in the labo-r market and there has been no move' by this Government to deregulate this area. For this reason the Opposition will be moving an amendment to allow the same export powers to be used to deregulate the labour market in the transport and grain terminal system. In other words, it will assist the Government, if it is genuine, to get on with the job of providing some deregulated efficiency and competition.  will respond?",92
159,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,"It will be very interesting to see how the Government responds to some real deregulation in its own constituency instead of the rural constituency. I mentioned earlier that the efficiency of railway workers, for example, is only one-eighth that of their counterparts in the United States. At the recent Mackay grain terminal Industrial Relations Commission hearing $10,000 labour costs for 40 minutes terminal work by waterside workers were cited. That is the sort of regulated expensive system that the wheat growers of this country have to contend with. I put the challenge to the Government: if it is really genuine and interested in assisting the export industries of this country and if it is really genuine about deregulation, accept guarantee. this part of the amendment so that it is a reality rather than just window-dressing. There are other major failings in this Bill and we will be moving to hav- these corrected. For example, the present Board comprises a grower chairman and one wheat grower from each State in a board of eleven. This has worked well as wheat is generally sold' as wheat and not as a processed or refined or greatly transformed product. As wheat growers finance the Board, adequate representation is necessary and justifiable. The coalition parties believe that the chairman should continue to be a wheat grower at .the time of his appointment and there should be five growers out of the eight nominated members. In other words, it should be basically the same as the current legislation. However, as the Grains Council will nominate the members of the selection committee to determine those eight positions it is in a position to achieve grower representation from each State if that is what the wheat industry wants. The provision of the export power to the Wheat Board has as() brought the threat of the Minister, through section 88, overriding State commodity boards in the marketing of their grain or other products of the soil. This is a clear intrusion on State rights and the rights of growers of those commodities. The Minister acknowledged this problem in his statement of 26 April entitled 'Wheat debate clouded again'. So, the Government must either have an acceptable amendment or accept ours to restrict the reach, under section 88, of the Minister's power to the transport of' grain and the marketing of wheat by the Wheat Board, and nothing else. Another contentious part of the le-slation is to require a wheat industry fund financed by a levy of between two per cent and five per cent of the net return plus the research levy. The levy is to be used to assist the Wheat Board to trade in grain other than pool wheat, which at present is covered by the borrowing guarantee; to provide more adequate insurance cover than that allowed by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EPIC), et cetera, for other commercial activities; and to provide advance payments additional to those possible with the Government's declining borrowing The Opposition supports the principle of the levy, but is strongly opposed to the fund being used to compensate for an inadequate Government guarantee or underwriting. On return to government we will review the operation of the fund and this and the adequacy of the five-year $100m: borrowing guarantee provided by the Government will be discussed with the industry. We also have an amendment for this section to ensure that wheat growers of Australia, through their representative body, the Grains Council, which will contribute up to $50m per year to this fund, agree to the expenditure of that fund. Again, contrary to the Minister's claim that he is assisting the Board to be more commercial and to be a strong trader, the reality of the legislation is to impose more ministerial vetoes or to withhold necessary powers from the Board. The Opposition will move a series of amendments including the following: the removal of unnecessary vetoes; the ability to create a general reserve fund separate from the special fund whic.h I just mentioned; to allow for the Board, or the wheat growers of Australia, to be compensated for losses resulting from ministerial direction additional to that already provided for credit sales; and the ability to employ staff, particularly money or finance managers, free of legislative restraint. The Board is Australia's biggest regular overseas borrower and it is unfair and absurd to restrict these employment rights. Another amendment is to preserve the ability of the Board to use the basically export pool to also handle domestic wheat or domestic wheat sales by exempting only that part of its operations from the Trade Practices Act. The major part of the Board's domestic marketing will be by a separate cash trading company subject to that Act, taxation, etc. The underwriting guarantee is set at only 90 per cent and this will phase down to 80 per cent over the five-year period; Underwriting allows the Wheat Board to borrow more favourably than would otherwise be the case. No government money is involved, so why the need for this Government to cut back on this underwriting and borrowing. guarantee other than vindictiveness against our 45,000 wheat growers? With the formula base changed to the current· year and the Board and the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics determining the level of the guaranteed minimum price, the chance of the market returning less than 95 per cent of this figure is basically non-existent. So, if this Government will not. do at least this much for the wheat growers of Australia, then the Opposition will endeavour to do so. I will move for a continuing 95 per cent borrowing guarantee on the current year basis with no time limit. The Opposition also wants harsher penalties for illegal exports, because $100,000 as the charge on a shipload of wheat could be considered as just a part of the expenses of selling. A ship load of 80,000 tonnes with a profit of only $10 a tonne would mean a profit of $800,000 and a charge of $100,000 for illegal· exporting is then considered a normal part of the selling operation. This is shoddy legislation, but it is possible to dramatically improve it by using the Opposition's 41 amendments and the Government's 45. Mr Kerin-Twenty-eight.",93
160,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,"It was 45 before. Many of these amendments overlap and I acknowledge co-operation between the Minister's office, the Department, my office and the Grains Council to work objectively to utilise or get the best advantage from these amendments. I offer my continued co-operation on behalf of the coalition to achieve the best improvements that we can to this legislation. But I state firmly and clearly that the Opposition will persist with its amendments, particularly the major ones such as underwriting and membership of the Board, et cetera. With the support of the Australian Democrats, these amendments will be passed in the Senate and the improved Bill will be returned to the House. I acknowledge that we do not have the numbers here to insist on these amendments, but we will continue to press for the Bill as passed by the Senate to be accepted here and for the Government to respond positively to these amendments.",94
161,Mr COURTICE,Unknown,"The Wheat Marketing Bill and associated Bills give effect to the continuing reforms of the Hawke Labor Government for the rural sector. In particular, these Bills finally breathe a breath of fresh air into the wheat industry and give farmers freedom of choice. That is what it is all about. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) that farmers want a fair go, but I agree with him only on that point. We are bringing in this legislation to give them a fair go. The Bills continue the progress of genuine assistance to primary producers. These reforms began with the freeing of the exchange rate, reform of the statutory authorities, winding back tariffs on manufacturing industry, reforms to a range of other primary industries, and now the lowering of costs to grain producers. Surely, the lowering of costs to grain producers is what it is all about if we are going to give farmers a fair go. Since 1949 the Opposition has held government for so many years and failed. It failed with protection on tariffs and failed to breathe a breath of fresh air into the agricultural industries. It is no wonder that the least number of speakers on these Bills tonight come from the National Party. There are more speakers from the Australian Labor Party and from the Liberal Party. Day by day we are seeing the National Party becoming more and more insignificant in this House. Indeed, in Victoria Senator MCGauran, of the National Party, became the sacrificial lamb for so-called coalition unity, and that is rather sad. It is hard for him to work it out, but I guess it demonstrates that sometimes $250,000 cannot always be right. The grair} handling and transport industry in Australia is highly regulated and mainly con-ists of non-competitive marketing, bulk handling rail and port authorities. Concern over the cost of transport and handling services led to the establishment of the MCColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. The Queensland National . Party's .response to the royal commission was interesting for the slothful way it approached such an important report. QueeJ;lsland was the last State to issue letters patent to the Commission, six weeks after the Commonwealth, four weeks after New South Wales and two weeks after Western, Australia. Queensland was the only State to insist on an interim report and to withhold information from the Commission in relation to costs df rail transport and details of the 1986-87 Queensland rail freight agreement. That is not very cooperative, and this comes from a National Party Government in Queensland which pretends to represent the rural community. Typically, the Queensland National Party dragged its feet when it came to supplying information for a report which would be of direct benefit to primary producers. Of course, Queensland has an intricate web of regulation in grain storage, transport and handling. Bulk Grains Queensland, the statutory handling authority, has an effective monopoly in handling wheat in particular, and some other grains to a lesser extent. Queensland has legislative restrictions on the use of road transport for wheat, barley and central Queensland sorghum. In addition, there is a less than total commercial orientation of the Queensland Railways. The MCColl Royal Commission suggested that the corporate structure which the Commonwealth has applied to Australian' National would be a good model for Queensland Railways to follow. The Royal Commission suggested that savings of $10 per tonne could be made on the transport of grain across Australia. Once again, that is a saving for primary producers.' The largest savings, of course, would be made in Queensland where $13 per tonne could be saved. I believe it was odd, therefore, that a plan to force deregulation of grain transport in Queensland to benefit growers was criticised by the President of the Queensland Graingrowers Association, Mr MCKechnie. It seems obvious that the organisational. head of the Queensland grain growers is more interested in supporting the National Party of Australia than in supporting his own members. Quite clearly, Mt MCKechnie has turned his back on his own constituents. The restrictions limit the capacity of growers to decide for themselves where they may make the best deal for their own grain. The Queensland National Party and the organisational leadership of the Graingrowers As-; sociation want to maintain the unnecessary cost structures which are reducing returns to the average Queensland graingrower. Lower' costs to growers from the Bill are expected to result in a net increase in returns to growers. Surely, the National Party can' understand that. This' is in addition to any increase in returns that, would result from higher world prices. The effect of the cost savings is to stimulate an increase in production as wheat becomes relatively more profitable. Australia-wide production is estimated to increase by some 797,800 tonnes. in the medium term. The increase expected at the State level in Queensland is approximately 141,000 tonnes. The deregulation of the transport sector will result in some increased movement of grain by road in country areas. That goes without saying. Naturally, - his has raised some concerns by people employed in the Queensland railway system. I point out that the quantity of grain transported by road directly from the farm to the port is estimated to increase by 107 kilotortnes. However, the Royal Commission findings suggest that there will be no significant overall change in the quantity of grain hauled by road or rail transport. The reason for this is that the quantity of grain delivered from farms in New South Wales to silos in Queensland will increase significantly. The flow of grain from New South Wales to Queensland is expected to in-rease by some 69 per cent. The main port in Queensland to be affected will be Fisherman bland,. which will gain a marked increase, largely at the expepse of Pinkenba. Within my own electorate, the new arrangements are expected to affect the port of Gladstone. Grain currently going by. rail from a country silo in the Emerald area to Gladstone would probably be directed to Mackay. However, grain currently .going by rail from a country silo in the Miles area to Fisherman Island would probably go direct by rail to Gladstone or a new subterminal at Fisherman Island. It is expected that there would be a total increase through Queensland ports of some 4 per cent. Results ,froIl). the Royal Commission suggest that average rail haul lengths will be unchanged but that grain haulage by rail will increase and, by virtue of that, .the jobs of railway employees will be safe. Also, as the average haul distance by road decreases the tonnages hauled by road increase. In other words, road transport will carry more grain but over shorter distances. Again, this gives farmers a choice in the way they wish to transport their grain and an opportunity to make decisions themselves on the commercial side of the industry. Additional competition resulting from the entry of road transport will provide a ceiling on the rail freight charges. It will not result in extensive substitution of road transport for rail. The movement of grain by rail is necessitated by the long distances from grain growing areas to the seaboard terminals. The average rail haul is 380 kilometres. The volume of grain hauled in 1988-89 was 14.9 million tonnes. In 1983-84, when there was a bumper crop, the volume was more than 21 million tonnes. I am quite certain that, with the great rains we have had, this coming year will also provide more grain than last year's 14.9 million tonnes. The comparative advantage for rail increases with greater distance. For instance, the cost for the rail transport of grain over 100 kilometres is 4.51c per tonne kilometre. The cost decreases to 3.03c per tonne kilometre for a 300-kilometre haul, and further declines to 2.76c per tonne kilometre for a SOO-kilometre haul. This compares to road costs, for a six-axle articulated truck making a 300-kilometre trip, of 6.3c per tonne kilometre. While I acknowledge that there is a greater advantage to be taken up in the larger States in comparison with, say, Victoria, it clearly demonstrates in my home State that rail transport will increase at the same time as road transport will increase. The cost competitiveness of rail in the transport of bulk grain commodities will result, I believe, in the retention· of approximately 84 per cent of total grain traffic and puts to rest the nonsense that has been peddled by some people that the roads will be destroyed and all grain will be handled by trucks. It was rather pathetic that the Queensland Premier, Mr Ahern, and the State Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Harper, stated that 40,000 trucks would haul grain through Brisbane. Either they have no confidence in the Queensland railways or they intend to close them down if they really meant what they said. Again, if we follow recent events in Queensland, they often do not· mean what they say or say what they mean. I would also like to direct attention to the situation facing many farmers in the Burnett district in my electorate. Grain producers in Monto are not the wheat specialists found in the large grain producing areas. They are, in the majority, people who supply stock feed to other farmers or to retailers. Under the current arrangements, they require a permit· to carry out this activity. In opposing this legislation, the Queensland National Party is essentially saying that primary producers are fools and are nbt able to look after their own affairs. The Nationals would have us believe that farmers are not smart enough to work out the best financial deal for themselves. I guess that they are judging them by themselves. The situation was best explained in a booklet forwarded to me by a Mr Colin Uebergang, a wheat grower. That booklet, called The Right to Choose Less Regulation. More Profit, says: The key to achieving greater profitability is to give growers a choice. Without choice, it is not possible for each grower to select the bulk handling/transportation/marketing option which best suits his individual circumstances. Yet here tonight we have heatdmembers of the National Party say that they want to look after farmers. If they do not believe in giving them a choice, if they believe that losing $10 per tonne across Australia and $13 in Queensland is looking after farmers, I think they should go home' and read a dictionary. It continues: Growers could maximise their returns if they were free to choose between delivering their wheat to a pool, selling direct to a trader for cash, storing wheat and exercising their judgment on the future direction of wheat prices, or entering into contracts to deliver certain tonnages for certain prices ified future times. This is precisely what this Bill will bring about for growers, especially those in the Burnett and Moura districts in my electorate. Essentially it gives them freedom of choice. It recognises that they have enough savvy to make commercial· decisions which are in their own best interests. The fact that the Queensland National Party cannot understand this is a reflection of their own misunderstanding of agriculture down through the decades. The Nationals are captives of a few rich and powerful producers whose interests rarely coincide with those of the average producer. It is rather sad that some of the leaders of the graingrowers in Queensland in particular are more interested in preserving their own power base by frightening farmers and putting forward situations that are not correct than in saying that they have made mistakes, moving on to free up the industry and giving people a better chance to make commercial decisions and make more money. This wheat debate has highlighted the flawed commitment· of, the Opposition parties to deregulation of the Australian economy. While Future Directions talks about deregulation, the coalition cannot achieve it. The sugar debate showed how the National Party front bench spokesman from Queensland went to water when his own State branch turned up the heat against the long term best interests of primary producets. Once again, we have seen the National Party turn its back on farmers in the wheat debate for its ideaological nineteenth century attitudes. This wheat debate shows that the Queensland National Party rump has once again spooked the Liberals into compromise after compromise on the basic issue of deregulation .. The Liberals have again been talked out of their own policy by a narrow-minded clique on Queensland. If the coalition cannot bring itself to vote for this Bill with one voice, then it can never face with unity the hard decisions across this nation. This Bill will bring about the greatest savings to Queensland growers. I congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr their Kerin) for once again showing more vision in the period he has been in this portfolio than all previous Ministers for primary inat spec- dustry. He has at last brought the grains industry out of the dark ages of the nineteenth century into the twentieth century.",94
162,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"The Wheat Marketing Bill represents one of the most significant proposals for Australian agriculture in many years. It offers tremendous opportunities, but it also carries with it some very real concern felt amongst many in the farming communities. It will mean a very changed attitude towards marketing of grain, particularly wheat. It will also mean a significant change for the Australian Wheat Board, which will move from being a regulated receiver of all wheat for domestic and industrial uses to an active competitor in the domestic market. This last point represents the big safeguard for farmers who do not wish to move into the marketing of their own grain at this stage. The Australian Wheat Board will still be the major buyer of wheata view not just of the Board but of the Flour Millers Council of Australia as well. The Australian Wheat Board, since 1948, controlled all sales of wheat, both within Australia and overseas, until 1984. Since then, it has continued to control all exports, as well as all domestic wheat, except for feed wheat. Farmers can rightly say that the Australian Wheat Board has served them very well over these years and will continue to serve them extremely well in the years to come. Wheat growers have, over the last few years, felt tremendous pressures, with falling returns, rising costs and a concerted effort by the United States and the Europeans to try to cut the ground from underneath the Wheat Board in many of our markets. It is interesting to note the comments of the United States Vice-President, Mr Quayle, when he visited Australia last week. The Vice-President claimed that while the export enhancement program may be indirectly costing. the United States taxpayers billions, it was not aimed at Australia's overseas customers. But despite the efforts of Mr Quayle, the figures tell a stark and differing story. In the last four years, the United States has increased its share of the world wheat and flour market by 48 per cent. At the same time, the Australian share of that market has fallen by 45 per cent. There is no doubt that Australian farmers have been affected. Whatever way we look at it, the trade war that has been going between the Americans and the Europeans is .affecting Australian farmers. It is against this background that all members would have to welcome the efforts of the Minister for Trade Negotiations, Mr Duffy, last month at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting, to get agricultural trade on the negotiating table. While it is very encouraging--,-and full marks to the Minister-as he admits, there is still a long way to go. It is for this reason and others that the coalition parties have doggedly refused to accept the Government's earlier proposal to deregulate feed wheat exports. I am very pleased to note that the Minister has finally backed off on this point. After all, Australia exports 80 per cent of our wheat crop and the majority of that crop is sold to countries with a single buying agency. To increase the number of sellers from Australia really makes little sense. Many farmers have expressed their concern about the proposed changes and I would like now to deal with some of the specific concerns and point out why, overall, this Bill is for the better rather than the worse. The major concern that is continually raised is what will happen to the domestic price· of wheat under a deregulated domestic market. Under the present system, the domestic wheal price has been fixed for a three-month period, at a figure estimated to be the best export price for that period. The concern continually raised is that under a deregulated domestic market the price could fall to an average export price. This concern, while it is understandable, is not founded on real evidence. In fact, there. is much contrary evidence. First, if in fact the domestic price were to fall to the average export price, the effect, according to recent, figures I obtained from the Wheat Board, would be a decline of somewhere between $2 and $2.50 per tonne for the coming season. That is over the whole crop. However, we have to weigh this against the evidence of the feed market experience. The 1984 Act allowed the feed wheat market within Australia to be deregulated. This has allowed growers who wanted to take advantage of this to, in fact, do very well. One grower from Victoria told me that he is $17 a tonne better off over his whole crop because he has been able to utilise his marketing skills. This grower found he could obtain a much better price than he would have had he been forced to continue to sell to the Wheat Board. Also, the then Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics made a study of this in New South Wales and found, on average, growers were better off by around $13 per tonne if they marketed their own feed wheat. So, when we compare that experience, an increase of at least $13 to a questionable loss of $2.00 to $2.50 at most, it seems that the evidence of a higher price on the domestic market greatly outweighs the fear of the lower price. But there are two other compelling reasons for the deregulation of the domestic wheat market. The first is that the domestic market is, in effect, partially deregulated already. Secondly, it is only through allowing some real competition on the domestic market that the efficiencies in storage, handling and transport that have been outlined in the MCColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport have any real chance of being achieved. Taking the first point, the Flour Millers Council recently expressed its concerns when it pointed out that black market trading of milling wheat is beginning to break down the existing regulated system. The Council expressed its concern to the Wheat Board but it seems that the Wheat Board has not been able to stop this practice. This is reinforced by a grains conference recently in Horsham where one delegate, in the middle of a debate, asked the several hundred growers present whether there were any who could honestly claim they had never sold outside the present system. Out of those several hundred delegates, only six were prepared to put their hands up and say that they had always sold strictly within the system as regulated by the Australian Wheat Board. This is really not surprising as growers are continuing to increase the tonnage traded under permit. The second and more compelling reason for the introduction of changes in the domestic market is the savings that are availtotal able to growers under the freeing up of storage, handling and transport. The MCColl Royal Commission has estimated that there are savings to be made in the order of $10 per tonne over the whole crop if these efficiencies can be implemented. Under this new Bill, clearly the Australian Wheat Board will have the powers to begin to implement the changes to bring in those efficiencies. Before Christmas, a small grain receival depot at Laharum in western Victoria, just out from Horsham, found itself out of business. The receival depot, which had for 16 years been receiving grain of up to 60,000 tonnes a year, had a special dispensation to contract the trucking of that wheat direct from Laharum south to ship out of Portland. At the stroke of a pen, at the demand of the Australian Railways Union, the Victorian State Government took away that licence and forced that wheat back onto the Victorian railway system. The unions, in their demands, had forced that wheat to be trucked north, loaded on the train at either Murtoa or Horsham and then taken to Portland by train-a journey of at least 60 per cent greater distance than the direct trucking to the port. Growers in the Horsham area were understandably furious. Growers in that area were even more frustrated when they found that the Australian Wheat Board was virtually powerless to do anything about this. Under this new Bill and last year's amendment, the opportunity is there for more flexibility. It is also significant to note the power of the Australian Railways Union, particularly in Victoria, when it comes to forcing grain to be carted by rail. Currently growers held are not allowed to use road transport to truck wheat more than 60 kilometres unless they use their own truck. VJLine ought to take a long hard look at why, despite this regulation, it is losing business even when it is currently being subsidised by over $1 billion per year to keep it operating. To put it in perspective and to allay another concern of country people, Australian road transport operators are currently carrying approximately one billion tonnes of freight annually throughout Australia. When we compare that with the annual wheat crop of around 15 million tonnes it can be seen that the wheat would amount to about 1.5 per cent of the road freight. So I think the very real concerns of country people in respect of possible damage to roads if there is an increase in the freight transport of wheat by road must be put in perspective. If in fact the reality of possibly 20 per cent, or at the most 30 per cent, of wheat and other grains carted by rail were transferred to road transport, the effect on the road system would be limited. To be more specific, last year the Director of Corporate Development of the Road Construction Authority in Victoria pointed out some fairly important facts. In fact, the Director had this to say: Even if all grain was transported by roadand I would suggest that no-one would agree with that the additional annual road infrastructure costs are likely to be much less than $ 10m. Most of the extra costs would be recovered from the taxes and charges paid by the road transport operators. It is interesting to note that the Australian Railways Union, in its union election platform last year, bragged about the fact that the union had been in the forefront of transferring wheat to rail. It is also interesting to note that last weekend at the ALP conference in Victoria the Australian Railways Union felt concerned that the Government had gone back on its undertaking given last year not to touch the transport of grain. Again, it is very much due to the efforts of the Opposition that the Government has been forced to implement some overdue transport reforms. The Opposition's stand has forced the Government to extend this legislation to give the Australian Wheat Board the choice in transport as well as storage and handling. Our amendments take the next logical step and offer the chance to deregulate the labour market. It will be interesting to see the Government's response. After all, if we ar- talking about deregulating the storage, handling and transport of grain, why do we not extend it to those who work in this area? Why should they be bound by a centralised wage fixing system? The union has claimed that 1,000 jobs are at risk. This overlooks several very important factors. It overlooks the fact that several thousand wheat farmers and employees have lost their livelihoods over the past 10 years, very much because the costs associated with storage, handling and transport have cut their margins to the point where they had to go out of business. It is time that the union took notice of these facts. A recent Industries Assistance Commission (lAC) report claimed that labour productivity improvements of as much as 100 per cent would appear to be possible in State rail authorities. The report also stated that there is potential for labour productivity increases in. VjLine in Victoria of up to 70 per cent and cost reductions of 30 per cent. By international standards, Australian railways are relatively inefficient. Most industrialised nations out-perform Australian railway systems by a considerable margin. Over the past 10 years, while the price of wheat has hardly altered, the cost of transporting, handling and loading that wheat onto ships has literally trebled. Growers are receiving no more than they did 10 years ago, yet those servicing that area have put up their charges threefold-a very significant point. That is a point that the Australian Wheat Board is very conscious of, but a point that up until now it has found difficult to do anything about. The union claims that 1,000 jobs are at risk, but this overlooks two very important facts. The first is that competition in transport, as well as storage and handling, is likely to mean that jobs will be created in other areas. For example, there may be some movement from trucking. It also overlooks the New South Wales experience, where a recent contract was signed by the Australian Wheat Board and the State Rail Authority. This has meant that the chances of railways losing the major part of that crop are well nigh impossible. New South Wales shows that in a competitive environment the State Rail Authority not only won a contract for 100 per cent of the wheat grown in New South Wales but also managed to cut the cost of carting the New South Wales crop by $1.6m. I believe that that is an encouraging achievement and a sure sign of things to come. The other thing we ought to note when we talk of jobs is that one major flour miller-a miller who buys $30m of wheat a year-has been prepared to give a commitment to double its investment. This commitment is an example of how new industries will spring up in a deregulated domestic market. Many of these new industries will open up in country areas, and I am sure that all growers will w-lcome this. They will spring up because the domestic price of wheat will not have to have factored into it all the fixed charges currently there and which have made it uneconomic for these industries to operate. If one talks to these operators, they are the first to admit that they do not expect the farmers to get a lower price for their wheat. In fact, they are on the record as saying that the millers will have to pay more for the wheat. Because the millers will be relieved of many additional charges that are currently there, they will be able to operate profitably in the processing industry, in a value adding industry and in an industry that will increase exports of flour and other processed wheat products. The claim that 1,000 jobs are at risk really should be a claim that possibly some jobs of members of the Australian Railways Union could be transferred to other areas. Overall, I have np doubt that this Bill will be a net generator 'of jobs and will certainly not cost people their jobs. It will clearly create greater efficiencies and consequently greater marketing opportunities. The Opposition has stated that it will support the freeing up of the domestic market if the Government moved in four areas. Clearly, this Bill now includes the opportunity for the.Wheat Board to have the power to ride inefficient State authorities in the exmajor porting of wheat. We welcome that, and we believe that it is a very necessary step to achieve the savings that MCColl has outlined. Relating to this area of the legislation, another point that is still not completely clear is the position of the Australian Wheat Board as a competitor on the domestic ket when it is trading intrastate. The coalition amendments pick up this point and, hope, would strengthen that position. ever, I still believe that the Minister has explained to Parliament how this will tually work. Another area that the coalition insists on. the Government maintaining is proper underwriting. There is no doubt that While the Minister was weak when he went to current Cabinet. He was rolled and forced to reduce the level of underwriting. We believe that tional underwriting should be maintained, and our amendment will ensure that that happens. Some concern has been expressed by subject growers about the composition of the Board However, under the Bill. Firstly, we insist-and we ing will move an amendment in this regardtransport that the Chairman must be a wheat grower. major Concern has also been expressed about composition of the Board members. With the utilisation of the. selection committee Board members, the Grains Council will eflooking fectively have a say on the selection of eight out of 11 Board members. While I appreciate that some growers are not wholly convinced that this will maintain the right balance, think we can draw on the experience of the Australian Wool Corporation selection comment, mittee. Those who are involved in the indusreview try, while not stating it publicly, will say very clearly. that the implementation of selection system has meant that Board memhave bers are far more responsive to the Wool Council than they were in the past. I have little doubt that the proposed selection comat mittee for the Grains Council will have actly the same effect on Board members of the Australian Wheat Board. The new Wheat Marketing Act offers some exciting prospects for grain growers. It offers some challenges to farmers along with the opportunity to ensure that farmers can rightreturn fully say that they have had a major say steps towards reducing off-farm costs, have had a major say· in steps towards pushing overmicro-economic reform, and have made a step in forcing efficiencies in the storage, handling and transp()rt of grain and, hence, other related materials. As a result, I believe that overall many other industries right throughout Australia will benefit. The coalition can rightly claim the credit for forcing the Government to include these spemarcific measures in the Bill. Some growers have expressed the view I that the reforms outlined by MCColl could Howhave been achieved without altering the not domestic marketing arrangements, but this acoverlooks the point that even MCColl himself put forward at page 114 of his report: the Commission is of the view that potential resource cOsts savings can largely be realised under marketing arrangements, it also recognises that marketing reform . . '. may inject addicompetitive pressure into the marketing environment of storage, handling and transport. The Commission has not considered the overall desirability or otherwise of changes . . . it regards this as being beyond the scope of its enquiry. it is concerned with the impact of marketreform in efficiency of storage, handling and of grain . . . it is worth noting the sources of competitive pressure that reform of the domestic and export marketing arrangements the could bring to grain distribution. for The coalition parties remain committed to after the best interests of Australian ' farmers. I have no doubt that, with the amendments we are proposing to this legislation, farmers' best interests will be properly I served. I believe that we should also give an undertaking that when we return to governand at the appropriate time, we will the performance of the wheat marketing arrangements. I believe that with any a changes it is proper for those affected to an opportunity to have an input into improving the system. At stake here is a potential saving in the service industries of least $10 a tonne. I suspect it will be far exmore than that, because of the downstream effects on other associated costs in the country areas, and also, of course, the value would be greater because of the opportunities opened up. The concerns expressed by some about·a to the 1930s overlook a very signifiin cant change in our society, and that is the availability of information. It is very easy nowadays for a farmer, within a matter of seconds, to get the price of grain anywhere in the world merely by hooking up a personal computer to a telephone. Armed with that knowledge, I have no doubt that those farmers who want to take advantage of opportunities being offered will do so skilfully and successfully and, in so doing, will enable other farmers to follow and get a better return for their crop. This legislation also allows farmers to serve notice on other inefficient industries, industries that have lived off their backs like parasites, that they must get their act together so that not only farmers but also other Australians will be better off. Finally, I call on the Government to give due regard to the amendments put up by the Opposition. The 45-odd amendments that have been put forward by the Government indicate the sloppiness' of its drafting. The 40 amendments put forward by the Opposition will further improve the Bill.",97
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,102
164,Mr BEDDALL,Unknown,"1 offer my full support for the Wheat Marketing Bill and cognate Bills. I preface my remarks by expressing the belief that most of the opposition to this Bill is because some people are not cognisant of the fact that 80 per cent of Australia's wheat crops are for the international market and that we sell only 20 per cent on the domestic market. That domestic market is already 40 per cent deregulated. These amendments in this Bill, the changes that have been made, are a recognition that we already have an increasingly deregulated domestic market and that market must continue to be deregulated. I congratulate the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) on his contribution to this debate. It is a shame the· Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who preceded the honourable member for Wannon for the Opposition, does not take the same view. Many opponents of this Bill are not aware of the problems that now face this industry. Unfortunately many people in the industry itself are not aware of what is changing in the world. We are no longer operating in a protected environment. Our wheat industry continually needs to be aware of international demands. This Bill will enable the Australian wheat industry to compete on international markets, in particular international markets that are debased by the subsidies of both the European Economic Community and the United States of America. The wheat marketing Bills provide the opportunity for the Australian wheat industry once and for all to break free and to be internationally competitive. The most important fact about this legislation is that we will be deregulating the transportation, storage and handling of grain. That is important so that our grain industries can compete internationally and unnecessary transportation costs do not inhibit export markets. I would like to turn to one of the Opposition's amendments, which I think is just face-saving by the Opposition, and that is its proposition that the deregulation of the labour market is a requirement for the passage of the Wheat Marketing Bill. I am sure that amendment will be defeated. I think the Opposition has failed to take note of changes that are occurring in the Australian labour market at the moment, first of all with the second tier negotiations that have taken place and now with the large amount of award restructuring. Many of the things the Opposition is calling for are actually taking place. The labour market, whilst not being deregulated, is more cognisant of the fact that we are living in a changing world. It was also interesting to hear a number of speakers talk about the need to protect rail systems. In my State of Queensland one of the major issues is whether the State rail system would be disadvantaged. I totally reject that. The MCColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport clearly showed that the vast majority of transportation of wheat and grain will continue to be by rail. It is inefficient and uncompetitive to transport grain by road over longer distances. By and large, wheat is transferred to port at distances of more than 300 kilometres. Therefore, in that environment there is no way that road transport can compete. Certainly, road transport will take some of the more inefficient grain lines off stream. Their grain will be transported by road to various terminals and rail will carry particularly large quantities of wheat to port facilities. With these changes that have been made to the wheat industry, in particular in Queensland, more grain. will be shipped through Queensland to Fishermans Island in Brisbane. That means that the rail network will be much more efficient and profitable. Other things are included in this package of Bills. The Australian Wheat Board, in negotiating how the grain will be shipped, will take into account the cost factor and it will keep the rail systems honest. So, unlike other commodities,such as coal, that are shipped through the Queensland rail network, no exorbitant charges will' be made and the grain grower himself will be receiving the most efficient and cheapest possible transport of grains to port. We an- often asked why we should deregulate the wheat market. The Minister for Primary IndustrieS and Energy (Mr Kerin) has often said that the wheat""Bill of 1988 became the bible, as the changes we made in 1984 became the bible, and those changes are now enshrined in folklore. There has been a progressivt(change to wheat marketing and wheat distribution and this is the next step along. These are not wholesale changes; they are logical and sequential changes which are important to making this industry more competitive and more able to compete in a world market that has been greatly debased' by our major competitors. I stress the fact that Australia will always to export in excess of 80 per cent of its crop. Therefore, we have to have the most efficient transportation and marketing arrangements possible for grain growers so that they can survive not only the good times but also the hard times that .this industry provides as markets rise and fall. The present legislative arrangements exclude competition. That is why these changes need to be made. Grain transportation has to be efficient. The prices charged rarely reflect actual costs, as costs are pooled on an average charge. It is important also for us to remove restrictions on the transport of grain ,by road so that the authorities can compete. These Bills are concerned with bringing about enormous amounts of competition. Interestingly, the Opposition is divided on this legislation. It is interesting that some of the 40-odd amendments that it has proposed are basically about some face-saving for the Liberals on behalf of their National' Party colleagues. That is unfortunate. Certainly the divisions have shown that the National Party has not changed its spots. It is still the great agrarian socialist party of this country. It is still the great regulator-Mr Kerin-Not so great.",102
165,Mr BEDDALL,Unknown,"Not so great, as the Minister now says, but it is still the regulator. In fact, it is not prepared to face up to the changes that have taken place. Even those National Party members who know' that these are the right moves for the wheat industry are not prepared to admit it. My grain growers-,-I have a large number in my electorate-came to me early in the discussions. ,Their major concern about this legislation was that the Australian Wheat Board would not have sole export powers. Those representations were made to the Minister along with a number of other organisations. The Minister has acknowledged that the Australian Wheat Board will have sole export authority; therefore, many fears that were raised initially by my grain growers have been alleviated by this legislation. Even though the Australian Wheat Board in the past has used merchants to market some of its crop overseas, under this legislation, because it is freer and more competitive, it will need be able to control more of the wheat crop. Benefits from this new marketing' legislation will mean that the Board hll-s a large advantage over any competitor in the domestic wheat market because of its strong position and its considerable experience. The Board will have advantages because of its assured supply of capital and not having to please shareholders with large returns on funds. The Board will be the only player in the export trade, thus having about 80 per cent of the crop under its control even if it loses out completely on the domestic market. The growers themselves will still have the option to market their wheat through the Board, and will still have access to' relevant and accurate information even if they do not go' through the Board. They will have the option of using cheaper methods of grain haulage. The MCColl Royal Commission has shown that savings of $10 per tonne may be made on the transportation of grain. Competition from road operators will provide a ceiling on rail freight charges, but there will not be an extensive substitution of road for rail freight as the volume and distances involved will mean that rail will still predominate. The highly international wheat prices and the lower charges for handling and transport will result in greater returns to the grower and will lead to increasing wheat production. The Government's proposals will allow the Australian Wheat Board to remain the sole exporter of Australian wheat, and to have wider powers to engage in commercial operations such as trading wheat for cash. The domestic market will be deregulated, thus giving growers greater choice in how to dispose of their wheat. Many of the grain growers will' freely admit that in the past they have been using the permit system or, in some cases, the black market to dispose of their crops for a better price. That means that some grain growers have had the opportunity to take advantage of a semi-deregulated market and other grain growers have not. This legislation enables all growers to take advantage of a deregulated domestic market. It gives us the opportunity to have a market that will bring about a reduction in the domestic cost to some degree with a subsequent small, but significant, benefit to Australian consumers. It will enable us to have an internationally competitive market. It will enable the Minister, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other Ministers in the Government to show to international competitors that we have a system that is free of the rorts that happen overseas, and free of'subsidisation. It' is an industry that stands on its own feet, and competes on world markets. It does not need subsidisatioh. It is an industry which shows that Australia can compete successfully on world markets. It shows more and more that if we can get freer trade in agricultural products, Australia will be a major player for many years to come. I do not wish to take up too much time of the House as there are a large number of members listed to speak in this debate. What is ironic about this debate is that the vast majority of speakers will be supporting the legislation, even though some will be supporting some of the proposed amendments, which the Governmentwill consider. In conclusion, I congratulate the Minister and the Government on taking these steps. I am sure that the Australian wheat industry will be a much better industry in the future.",103
166,Mr MCARTHUR,Unknown,"Corangamite) (9.14)I rise to debate the changes to the wheat industry. The legislation before us, the Wheat Marketing Bill and associated Bills, provides a choice for wheat growers in domestic wheat sales. In the controversy that surrounds these proposals, a number of the farmers have been misled and misinformed as to their impact. The key element and catalyst of the changes that have been brought about and put forward in a legislative form is the MCColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, which suggested a bringing together of competition in the handling, transport and storage area, and a certain amount of competition for the monopoly position of the Australian Wheat Board. I am reminded of the controversy that surrounded the changes that were suggested to the dairy industry only three y-as ago. On that occasion the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) suggested that there bean adjustment of the domestic competition and the overseas market to suit the prices in both those arenas. In a competitive environment between the States, a number of the dairy farmers were very concerned that their carefully cultivated fresh milk markets would be interfered with. They were saying that we, therefore, needed the support of governments and monopolies to sustain the dairy industry. After a great amount of debate, that legislation was enacted and I have heard no real concerns from the dairy industry. I note-and this has an ironic twist-that Victorian dairy farmers are now considering moving fresh milk into the Sydney milk market, and indeed this has happened in the past three or four months. Such a terrible thing was never contemplated three years ago, so there is genuine and true competition in the dairy industry which three years ago dairy leaders assured me would never happen. Likewise, the sugar industry has been cultivated with a cradle to the grave attitude, and legislation was introduced in 1914 to support that industry, to make sure that it was highly regulated, highly protected and highly organised. At long last market pressures are appearing in the industry, and I have no doubt that with the passage of time and with changes of attitude the sugar industry will change its ways. The Australian Wheat Board is a symbol of the problems of the 1930s, the Depression, the low prices, the poor communications at that time and the lack of alternative outlets for farmers in those difficult years. In the current debate farmers often refer to what their fathers and grandfathers said. The attitude has been, 'youcan't possibly change the Wheat Board because my father said it might put us back to the 1930s'. I assure honourable members that people in other areas of industry in Australia suffered siinilar problems. The problems of the Wheat industry were not unique and the Wheat Board's existence has not solved those problems. I am reminded of the arguments in the wool industry, an industry with which I have had a long association. In the 1960s and 1970s marketing was a hot issue and passions rose very high as to the way in which the wool industry would solve its problems in those very difficult times. The issue was resolved by the introduction of a reserve price fund, about which some of us had reservations. Wool growers contributed their own funds and now have about $1.7 billion in reserve to assist a potholing operation of the wool sales through the auction system to help the wool industry to cope with its up and downs. They contribute 4.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent, totalling 8 per cent, to the statutory reserve. funds which, in turn, are kept for a rainy day. It is important to note that wool is sold through the auction system, it is at a competitive price and the world bids on wool at any time throughout Crop year of production 1975-76 1249.2 1976-77 1050.8 1977-78 934.2 1978-79 2295.8 that auction. I defy anyone to value wool during the auction period because it changes even during that two-hour period. The reserve price potholes the auction system. It does not create or maintain a price against the trend. Because of the present buoyant prices the wool industry is rightly concerned as to what is around the corner in terms of price and how the reserve price fund will be able to cope with a downturn. The key argument in this wheat debate is, 'What price should Australian wheat growers take?'. The Australian Wheat Board is a dominant seller on the world market, but let us be quite cl-ar that the Board does not set the price on the world market. It has no clout and has to respond to the world wheat market price according to supply and demand, seasonal conditions in the Soviet Union or China and, in more recent times, seasonal conditions in Canada and the United States of America where drought has brought about a scarcity of grain. The oil producers in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel tried to create a monopoly in price, but market forces overcame that monopoly. In the final analysis, in establishing prices buyers and sellers react to good news, to bad news, to supply and demand, to politics and to the position on a day to day basis. It is a myth to suggest that the Australian. Wheat Board, by its very existence, provides a stable pricing mechanism. Judging by the prices received in the past eight years, I would say that the Australian Wheat Board is a conduit of the world price mechanism back to the Australian farmers. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics .of December 1988, which demonstrates clearly the fluctuations over the years 1988-89 back to 1975-76.

167,Mr MCARTHUR,Unknown,"I draw to the attention of the House the variation that has occurred in world prices in relation to the prices received for the years 1981-82 to 198889. The price in 1981-82 was $157; in 198283 it was $184; in 1983-84, $170; in 1984-85, $189; in 1985-86, $179; and then, of course, there was the low point in 1986-87 when the world wheat market was over-supplied and when the price went down to $136. In 198788, the price received was $156; and for the current year, when prices have been more buoyant, the estimated price is $189. So much for the myth, believed by a number of wheat growers, that the Australian Wheat Board has in fact controlled the price. I have had a number of arguments with wheat growers who quite honestly believe that the existence of the Australian Wheat Board has meant the maintenance of price stability for them irrespective of the price of wheat established on the world market. Of course, the price of wheat for home consumption has been fixed in a more arbitrary manner by the Australian Wheat Board. It depends on what side of the argument one is on: of course, wheat growers are quite happy to take the extra dollars involved, although I. am not too sure that the consumers in the Australian market are happy that the price that they pay for their wheat is well above the price at which they could buy wheat on the export market.

(1988). Annual of Primary Commodities Produced. Australia, First previous issues); Australian Bureau of Agricultural and The key thrust of the legislation is to ensure that there is a more competitive domestic wheaf sale arrangement. Domestic wheat sales comprise 20 per cent of the market-and all the discussion that has taken place in recent days about this legislation has centred· on that part of the market. The legislation maintains the Australian Wheat Board's monopoly of export sales, which account for about 80 per cent of the crop. Surprisingly enough, export sales are often handled by private agents, of which many wheat growers would not be aware. I will i talk a little more about that later. As I have mentioned, the catalyst for change was the MCColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. The Commission estimated that, conservatively, $10 per tonne would be. the bottom end of savings that could be achieved if the transport, handling and storage areas were smartened up under a more competitive systern. The Bill maintains the export monopoly, as I have mentioned. The Minister quite rightly indicates that the corrupt markets of the United States of America and of the European Common Market, where surpluses are generated and supported by the treasuries of those countries involved, will be little influenced by the activities of the Australian Wheat Board. I compliment the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) in his endeavours to try to get those countries to see some sense in relation to their very doubtful trading practices in flooding the world with under-priced wheat. Quality control is maintained. The Bill gives further commercial powers to the Australian Wheat Board. I commend that approach of allowing the Australian Wheat Board to borrow more commercially and enabling its operations to be undertaken on a more commercial footing. The Bill also allows the Australian Wheat Board to buy wheat for cash on the domestic market. I now turn to the matter of the changes recommended by the MCColl Royal Commission. With all its investigations, the MCColl Royal Commission has carefully identified areas where changes could be made. I think that this is the crux of the argument, and it is. in this regard that wheat growers will see some considerable advantages in the case of a downturn in the price received for their wheat. First, I refer to· the figures reported in the Mc(::oll report for the year 1986-87, when the f.o.b. price for wheat was $159 per tonne. The split for the storage and handling charges is $14.94, nearly $15, or 9 per cent of the f.o.b. price; the transport port charge is $17.88 or 11 per cent; Australian Wheat Board administration and interest charges amount to $17.94 or 11 per centmany wheat growers do not fully understand that the Wheat Board administration and interest charges run into a considerable ber of dollars-and the wharfage and wheat re$earch charge is $1.62. That adds up to a total of $52 or 32 per cent, nearly a third, of the total price received by wheat growers in 1986-87. That is a very realistic assessment, and that is the reason why the MCColl Commission's research and investigation into the high handling charges in the transport area are so significant to the final return wheat growers. It has been argued that changes would be brought about without bringing any competition into the total system. I put it to the House and to those who question this that only by bringing some competition into the sales of wheat will these matters be brought to a more competitive head and the profit motive instituted in the freight, handling storage arenas.. The Bill also suggests thaI there ought to be a disaggregation of the costs involved and that they should. not be bulked in one total account so that the comparisons between States and handling authorities cannot be identified by individual growers. This will enable growers to see where their money is being spent. Other members have spoken about State monopolies on transport. State monopolies grew up because of the complementary legislation in setting up the Australian Wheat Board. The various States required their pound of flesh, so to speak, when they agreed to the setting up of the wheat legislation in those early years. From that monopoly position of the Board further monopolies grew in the handling areas and, of course, in the railway operations. My colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) indicated the quite dramatic incident of the road haulier at Laharum near Horsham who, having operated for the last 16 years, was forced out of business. He had as assisted with the movement of wheat but because of the Victorian Railways monopoly the wheat growers in that area were forced to move their grain another 120 kilometres because of the concern of the Victorian Railto ways, the Victorian Railways Union and others that the enforced monopoly position was being challenged. The irony of this debate throughout Australia is that the feed wheat permit system num- which was introduced in 1984-90 per cent of the feed wheat is now traded in this way-really legalised the way in which market forces were operating when feed wheat was sold. As I say, the stock feed wheat permit was introduced in 1984. That allowed farmers and buyers to negotiate a price for quality and delivery in a free, competitive system. They could even work out their terms of of payment and come to a reasonable situation. All of us who have had anything to do with the wheat industry well recall the movement of wheat under section 92 of the Constitution. The poultry industry, the pig industry, the feedlotters and the feed processors utilised section 92 to move across the border and break the monopoly position of the Australian Wheat Board. On many ocand casions the great supporters of the Australian Wheat Board would be flying by night, loading trucks and moving wheat across the border to overcome the monopoly position of the Wheat Board at that time. The Opposition supports the guaranteed minimum price and has moved an amendment to increase it to 95 per cent of the returns. This will enhance the borrowing capacity of the Wheat Board and, provided it is based on a reasonable market forecast, will assist the Board in becoming a more commercial ,operation. However, I warn the House that it does open the suggestion to our American wheat grower friends and wheat growers in the European Community that they can utilise this piece of information to say that in some ways the Australian Government is subsidising the wheat industry. I note that only on one, occasion in the last 10 years has government been called upon to support the guaranteed minimum price. That was in 1986-87, to the extent of $220m. That was at a very low point in the ,market. Up to that time it had not been required. I have mentioned the changes that the Royal Commission would bring about in saving $10 per tonne by the new combinations of road, rail and port operations, and changes in storage and handling. The grain handling authorities would operate in a more effective way if there was some competition between grain handling instrumentalities, both private and State run. The work practices that go on in the railways and grain handling authorities have to be seen to be believed. The lack of cooperation and the view that the State run instrumentalities do not need to be competitive demonstrate quite clearly the number of changes that could be undertaken. One of the amendments th-t the Opposition has put up challenges the Government to adopt some of the innovative industrial relations policies that we will be implementing after the next election. They include voluntary agreements and more flexible work-based arrangements that would suit the wheat industry. In summing up, we see some market changes for the first time in 41 years since the Wheat· Marketing Act was introduced in 1948. I observe that farmers have bigger 200 and 300 horsepower tractors, big headers, big seeders and bulk handling equipment. They have capital equipment worth between $300,000 and $500,000. They plant new varieties of wheat and they now have a wonderful timeliness of operation to utilise· any moisture that is around. All .one Western Australian farmer said to me, he spent $lm planting his crop with all this new equipment and then, at the point of sale, gave up completely because he had handed responsibility of his total crop to the Australian Wheat Board. At a time when there will be considerable pressure on costs we now are moving into an new era where there will be competition at the market place, there will be a cost conscious operation in handling, transport and storage. Hopefully, in the downturns people will be able to stand the fluctuations of price. Not only will the modern wheat farmer be able to check out the operation of the Australian Wheat Board by checking his computer price on the Chicago Grains Exchange but he will be able to use all the new flexible arrangements. Finally, I pay tribute to the honourable member for Wannon, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) for their rational debate of the issues as they affect the wheat farmer. I also pay tribute to those members of the gallery who have fought this battle in difficult times.",106
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,108
169,Mr BRUMBY,Unknown,"It is my pleasure to speak in support of these wheat marketing Bills. Of course, the Bills have been the subject of a great deal .of public attention in recent weeks, particularly among the ranks of the coalition as honourable members opposite have tried to come to grips with what is basically fairly straightforward legislation which aims to produce increased efficiencies and competitiveness in the Australian economy. If one looks at the objectives of these Bills before the House, they are basically about two fundamental issues. They are about introducing an element of competition, increasing an element of competition in relation to grain marketing, its storage, transport and handling. The Bills are also about encouraging efficiency in those wheat related industries. In that sense they represent a further evolution in the Federal Government's efforts in making Australia a more' competitive, efficient and certainly more export oriented nation. I would have thought that all of those things are objectives which every member of this House ought to be able to embrace. At a number of meetings which I have attended to discuss this legislation some people have asked me, 'Why do we need more competition in relation to these industries? Why do we need more competition in relation to wheat marketing? Why do we need more competition in relation to the way grain is handled and freighted?'. the answer to that is a fairly simple one. I would hope that most members of this House would agree that monopolies of themselves do not encourage efficiency or a good result for producers and consumers. Monopolies tend to l-ad to cosy arrangements between the parties that make them up. They certainly do n-t encourage innovation or efficiency. I certamly have a view that competition encourages efficiency and innovation. In that' sense this is a fairly basic and fundamental objective of this legislation The question of effiCiency is also raised. wo-ld have thought th-t there is a fairly lOgIcal response to that view. Australia needs to become more efficient. We need· to become mQre market oriented. We need to increase the value and quantity of exports that we sell overseas. I would have thought that the recent $1.6 billion March trade deficit and the result over the past year would confirm in anyone's mind that Australia still need to make a major effort to increase the value and quantity of exported goods that we put onto overseas markets. These Bills put an end to what I consider to be monopolies. They bring· about some competition and they will lead, in the estimates of a number of economists and the MCColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling ,and Transpor-, to savings of around $10 per tonne on average to wheat grQwers throughout Australia. I would have thought that that is a good result for Australia. We are seeing a bit of competition and efficiency. W- are seeing a result which a number of qualified and independent profes-ional people have-timated will lead , to savmgs to producers' the order of $10 per tonne of wheat. So I think good outcomes are likely to flow from this legislation. I would like to address a number of concerns which have been expressed by various people about this legislation. One of the most obvious and, certainly, one which has generated some media space in my electorate is th- question of what will happen to the rallways, particularly in Victoria and whether we will see tens of thousands of large semitrailers carting wheat as a result of these changes. If one looks at the statistics and if one cares to make a first-hand on site examination of VjLine today, one can see that it is a very different organisation to what is was five or six years ago. It has been rationalised considerably over recent years. It has reduced staffing levels. The Victorian Government has invested heavily in the railways infrastructure. As a result, we have a much more efficient rail organisation in Victoria than we had five or six years ago. In fact if one looks at the real cost of carting grain in Victoria, which is tendered by VjLine, we, see that there has been a reduction of something like 20 per cent in real terms over the last four years. In other words, the results of I some rationalisation, some better marketing decisions, some investment by the Victorian Gove!nment and some changes in staffing practices have led to a dramatic improvement in productivity in that industry with the result that VjLine has been able to reduce the real cost of its grain operations to growers by around 20 per cent over recent years. The honourable member forWannon (Mr Hawker) alluded in his speech to the situation in New South Wales where the State Rail Authority of New South Wales has recently signed an agreement with the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) to cart by rail all export wheat produced in that State. That tender was won by the State Rail Authority against competition from trucking firms. I should say that the New South Wales system has already been' deregulated. What it shows is that rail is prepared to tender - o-petitively in an open market to protect Its mvestment and to guarantee and maximise its returns. In that - case there will be more grain, not less, carted by rail in New South Wales as a result of deregulation and it will be carted at a somewhat cheaper rate than it was in previous years. Not only have tens of thousands of trucks on the highway not materialised in that State but wheat producers have also gained a better deal because of more competition in that industry. I do not accept the sort of claims that are madeand some of them have been made by councils in my electorate-that local roads will suddenly be overtaken by heavy transports. If we look at the best information available and we take into account the recent developments which have occurred in New South Wales, we can quite comfortably argue the opposite case. As a result of these competitive changes we may see more grain in quantity and proportion carted by rail in Victoria and perhaps in some other States. I am confident that with the right marketing strategies-and I expect V /Line in Victoria to apply themVjLine wil1 be able to increase the quantity and proportion of grain that it carries in Australia but it will have to do it in a competitive environment, competing against trucking. As I said before I believe in competition. I believe it brings out the best in organisations. There are a number of other issues I want to raise in the limited time available. One of those is the question of quality. The quality argument goes along the lines that if we take away the Australian Wheat Board's monopoly powers, its ability to assess and oversee the quality of the crop will in some way be diminished. The monopoly powers of the Australian Wheat Board have been an integral part of wheat marketing for over 40 years. However, some of the Board's functions are not dependent on it having these powers. Rather, by virtue of its existence and its role in the industry it has been a suitable and convenient vehicle to implement other aspects of the wheat marketing arrangements. That is an important distinction to make, although it is one which is not always appreciated by some people who are ardent supporters of the Australian Wheat Board. For example, while the Australian Wheat Board performs various quality control functions, such as grading and classification, it can provide those functions and services wh-ther or not it is the sole marketer of wheat. To go further with that example, other rural commodities such as wheat and meat are successfully marketed by the private sector with statutory authorities closely involved in successful quality control programs. The argument that goes along the lines that if the AWB loses its monopoly we will suddenly see a rapid diminution in the quality of grain produced in Australia, and that in turn that will affect our export markets, is just a bunkum argument and one which simply has no veracity. The third issue which is sometimes raised is that of price premiums or single seller premiums. The argument here is that the A WB's monopoly powers again allow it to extract price premiums in some export markets. The argument goes on further: if we allow competition into the market those premiums would be competed away if there are multiple sellers of Australian wheat. I say in response to that that while there are premiums for Australian wheat, it is difficult. to determine the share, if any, which is due to the AWB's monopoly control from that portion which is attributable to other factors such as quality and reliability of supply. It is also pointed out consistently to me, including by the AWB itself, that Australia is not a price maker, it is a price taker in a competitive world market, so if there were to be any increase in the number of sellers of Australian wheat it could not be expected to affect prices. . The fourth issue I want to raise relates to the responsibility for marketing decisions. The establishment of the Australian Wheat Board resulted in responsibility for major marketing decisions being transferred from individual producers to a specialist organisation, although this body is still accountable to producers in the corporate sense. This removes the risk to individual growers of them making a poor marketing decision with respect to disposal of their output. Despite the intentions of the legislation, there is no inherent guarantee that the AWB will maximise returns to growers, either individually or corporately. It is important to make the point that in the absence of alternatives it is not possible to rate or compare the Australian Wheat Board's performance. Prior to 1984-85, growers had no opportunity to adopt a marketing strategy which was oriented towards their individual situations. Under the present legislation governing the wheat industry, the AWB has introduced several marketing options for growers. These include things like the pool cash-out, deferred delivery and deferred payment. It has to be said that the success of these initiatives strongly suggests that producers would be likely to use-we then- assume they would benefit from-the increased range of marketing options which would be expected to be available in a competitive domestic market. Again, that is an important point. The Opposition has put before the House tonight some 37 amendments. Of those, many are technical, only a few are significant in any way, and some may be considered by the Government. I note that one of the Opposition's proposals is that the underwriting level be fixed at 95 per cent of the expected return in each season rather than at 90 per cent, phasing down to 80 per cent, as is proposed by the Government. That is very clearly an ambit claim, if I can use that expression, by the Opposition. Such a high level of underwriting as that proposed by the Opposition in a sell-out to appease the National Party would certainly be triggered relatively frequently as it would require an error of only 5 per cent at the time of estimating the expected wheat price for the year. That would confer underwriting into a price subsidy operating at random, at considerable budgetary cost. Considerable assistance is already provided to the Australian wheat industry through the underwriting scheme. Those underwriting provisions have existed since 1979 and they are a source of direct price support to the industry. The Commonwealth in 1986-87 did payout and the value of that liability is expected to be $220m. Even though the direct financial outlays which are triggered by underwriting have been small relative to the value of wheat produced since the provisions were enacted, taxpayers have also borne the risk of having to make an annual payout. For growers, this amounts to a reduction in risk provided by the Commonwealth, obviously free of charge. In recent studies on underwriting, independent economists estimated that this implicit subsidy was worth a total of $381m or from $1 to $5 a tonne annually for the years 1979 to 1986-87. The proposal the Government has put here in relation to underwriting is a fair one. Certainly the proposition put by the Opposition that there should be a 95 per cent underwriting level is not a fair dinkum proposal. It would clearly amount to a subsidy. Clearly, it would distort market signals and have implications for taxpayers over many years. I do not think that the Opposition as a whole is serious about it. I conclude by making a few points. The major elements of Australia's present wheat marketing system, as a numb,er of speakers tonight have noted, were introduced at a time when less than half of the crop was exported. Today, 80 per cent of the Australian crop is exported and of the 20 pel\ cent which is sold on the domestic market a significant proportion is already sold in a deregulated market. When the original elements of the wheat marketing system were introduced, the industry was subject to malpractices and inadequacies in the transport and storage system. These contributed to the depressed market conditions in the industry and they adversely affected the livelihoods of many people. It seems that there is a fear among some people in the industry that there will be a return to marketing malpractices if the domestic market is fully deregulated. Fears of a return to what we call 'the bad old days' can be allayed on several grounds. Firstly, trade practices legislation clearly prevents the type of collusive practices by private traders which existed in the early decades of this century. Growers who so prefer, and for whatever reason under these new arrangements, will still have the option of marketing their wheat through the Australian Wheat Board and, unlike wheat growers in the first half of this century, those who opt to trade outside the Australian Wheat Board will have ready access to relevant and accurate marketing information to use in their decision-making. This would not be a new situation for wheat growers. The skills which they successfully apply in marketing many other commodities that they produce should work equally well in the case of wheat sold for domestic consumption. I conclude by saying that I believe that this is straightforward legislation which makes eminently good sense. It will benefit Australia and wheat producers and will unquestionably lead to a more competitive and 'efficient economy. I say also that I have grave fears for the future of the National Party, which seems always to be in favour of change in general but opposed to it in particular. Whenever any reform is brought before this Parliament which has to do with a particular industry, the National Party opposes it. It .seems unable to respond to the necessary. changes which have.to occur in the Australian economy if Australia is to be more competitive and efficient and if it is to get more products onto the export market. If the National Party cannot support these relatively modest changes to produce a relatively modest competitive environment, I hate to think what would happen if it got back into government. Fortunately, I think we can say that,. in relation to this modest legislation which introduces some competition into an industry, the National Party's attitude of opposing competition, increased efficiency and change in the Australian economy will ensure that it stays out of government for many years to come. Finally, I say to the alleged supporters of the National Party, which represents less than 12 per cent of seats in Australia, that Australian wheat growers have shown themselves quite capable of on farm innovation and change. This has allowed them to contribute substantially to improving their own and the. nation's standard of living. Their record of adapting their production systems to a changing environment is impressive indeed. They should endeavour to see-and so should their National Party supporters-that marketing and transport arrangements are not factors which limit future prosperity. The Nationals ought to let them get on with the job. They have shown that they are capable of on farm innovation and change. We should not.let restrictions in the marketing and grain transport industry limit their capacity to earn for Australia export income in the future.  In this debate on the Wheat Marketing Bill and associated Bills I declare a pecuniary interest. I am a grain grower and represent one of Australia's greatest grain growing electorates. The tragedy of this wheat debate, and the major changes to wheat marketing arrangements it proposes, is that wheat growers and their industry have been forsaken by politicians for political considerations of power, unity and ideology and not through any understanding or debate on this issue-political tactics by the Australian' Labor Party which saw an opportunity to create mischief within and between coalition partners while at the same time achieving its aim of removing any possibility that Australia's rural industries will ever again receive any government support. If this legislation passes it will have widespread ramifications far and beyond the Australian wheat industry. The political manoeuvring on this issue raises serious concern as to the future role of a private member in having his views on issues heard above the force of Executive power and insecurity. Such procedures are undemocratic and unfairly place people between a rock and a hard place. I would like to say a word about the host of political commentators and consultants who have contributed to this debate. There are those who are ignorant of the issue but wallow in the political controversy. There are those whose only information or thought processes flow from the press releases of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). There are those whose motivation on behalf of corporations and agribusiness is predictable and acceptable, and there are those who genuinely believe that deregulation will bring value added benefits across a wide range of economic endeavour. The Government's legislation will without doubt increase the volume of wheat sold domestically. I believe, however, that this will be to the economic disadvantage of farmers themselves, while the present disincentives and impediments to value adding, such as restrictive work practices and high domestic costs still remain. At the Outlook Conference this year, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) said: Farmers adjust every day to the vagarie& of the seasons, and every season to the vagaries of the market. In the past six years,' for example, . . . there has been a 21 per cent decline in the area planted to wheat, and a 292 per cent increase in the area' planted to grain legumes. Farmers adapt to change rapidly on the farm, and market forces do work. Yet one of the reasons given for this legislation is that it will ensure that farmers respond rapidly to market signals and export opportunities. If the rest of the Australian economy had been as responsive and adaptable to structural change, this nation would today not be with Mexico and Brazil in the banana republic league. I ask the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby), who speaks about a $1 to $5 subsidy for growers per tonne: What about the $9,000 per year every farmer pays for subsidies to sectors of manufacturing industry? The study of history is a useless occupation in itself unless lessons can be learnt from it. I want to look briefly at the growth of the Australian wheat industry and the development of orderly marketing. The actions of this Parliament on this issue, I believe, will show that it does not understand the history of the industry. The Australian wheat industry expended dramatically in this country. Marketing in the early years was chaotic, and imports to meet home consumption requirements because of inadequate transport caused gluts, high price fluctuations and low prices. Producers were dominated by the British market. Merchants utilised the fair average quality criteria and storage shortages and manipulated prices to the lowest level possible. Despite increasing export prices in the early days of the Australian wheat industry, growers became increasingly dependent on merchants, and unprofitable. Almost by the accident of war, growers were freed from the bondage of merchants but immediately came under the bondage of Government. Prior to the Second World War, we saw more Government action that in itself was a long and tragic story. A patriotic call was made to grow more wheat. Farmers responded and worked dawn to dusk and on into the night by the lights of their motor vehicles. The Government of the day promised five shillings a bushel. After months of parliamentary and political nonsense, Prime Minister Scullin abandoned the plan. Farmers got not five shillings a bushel but one shilling and eight pence. Bankruptcy threatened every farmer and farmers walked off in droves. Finally, a wheat board wasestablished in 1939, again under a National Security Act, to acquire and dispose of all marketable wheat. Government again reneged on its commitment and began the alcohol and wheat fiasco which failed within the year. This did, however, have the accidental benefit of increasing storage capacity. As growers' political· and industrial status grew by 1948, a strongly organised industry successfully put in place the foundations of a marketing structure that, with continuing modification, flexibility and commercialisation, exists to this time. Basically the wheat plans have had principles aimed· at moderating the impact of production and price fluctuations, giving equity to growers, and government borrowing guarantees that gave a floor price, confidence, and growers representations and control. The Australian wheat industry has always been dramatically affected by the spirit of politics at the time and this legislation simply continues that process. It should also be noted that, like arms and aid, wheat is traded as a political commodity. Domestically, the 1950s and 1960s were the golden years. The 1970s and 1980s saw uncertainties in world trade develop but more significantly they saw the plundering by the greed of State and Federal governments on the productive sector particularly. They saw high domestic imposts, particularly fuel, and even the taxing of grower built and managed handling and storage facilities. Let us not forget that, since the deregulation of our financial markets-and I do not dispute the Government's integrity-the Government has delivered to this nation record high interest rates on two occasions since 1982. This is the present scenario in this industry. The Australian Labor Party Government, as with governments in the past, is now set to attack the symptoms, not the cause, of this nation's economic bankruptcy. The wheat grower is to become the example and possible the sacrifice on the alter of deregulation and at a time when our competitors are receiving higher government protection and support. Vice-President Quayle left the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in no doubt about this last week after the Prime Minister's poorly briefed comments which must leave few people listening to our case in Washington. This legislation acknowledges that the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) can and should effectively control export sales because of its expertise and efficiency. Claims that the Government ever intended to do otherwise are absolute nonsense. It could not risk the impact on export income. This Government's survival depends on Australia's farmers. It is paradoxical, therefore, that the same powers on the domestic market are being removed. Asked whether the Wheat Board should retain the monopoly, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said: Yes, I am pretty strongly of that view. What we're up against there is highly subsidised marketers; we're up against some of the biggest international grain organisations in the world and to have each State or wheat producer running off to compete against that would lead us into a situation where the price would be bid down. If you got rid of the Wheat Board's powers you would be handing the industry over to Elders and Cargills and 'Continentals and Bungies and away you go. It mayor may not work, but the Wheat Board has so far done better than the international grain traders in my opinion. Is anyone in this Parliament prepared to tell my why the same situation will not apply on the domestic market? Such a move as we are seeing here tonight will expose 45,000 growers to the corruption and subsidisation of the world market. It will pit each grower against the other in a mad scramble for the small domestic market. The Australian Wheat Board will become the repository-in fact it will be forced to be the receiver-of all wheat not wanted by merchants, not sold by growers on domestic outlets, and will be left without the capacity to be truly competitive on the domestic market unless the Government accepts a series of amendments proposed by the Opposition. Of course, the question is whether the Opposition's amendments will be voted on. I hope so, or this will be seen as just a political gimmick. There is a need to identify clearly the pricing effects of competition in the marketing process from those in storage, handling and transport. The MCColl Royal' Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport clearly identified savings in the transport and storage sector. I have no argument with this. As wheat growers, we have been ripped off for years. But there is no relationship between transport efficiency and the marketing arm. However, there are two points to be raised here. First, what commitment does this Government have to come to grips with these issues? Two of my colleagues tonight have mentioned the situation in Victoria. In fact, in my own electorate at Lah arum, the State's first off-rail storage, which has operated successfully for 16 years under the existing scheme, has seen its licence revoked since-and I emphasise 'since'the Federal Minister forecast these changes. The second issue relates to the loss to State governments, so increasing their rail deficits and the agonising of rail unions. For a long time grain has been singled out in Victoria for regulation by rail. Farmers today pay 120 per cent cost recovery and urban commuters 35 per cent. And we talk of social justice! Huge savings will result without a major loss to road transportation. VjLine, as it relates to Victoria, will simply have to undercut road transport or cease to exist. However, there will be a shift to road. As road users already pay charges far exceeding the cost, it will be incumbent on government, particularly the Federal Government, to redistribute some of its revenue back to State and local governments to meet this extra usage. Does anyone in this Parliament believe that this Government intends to add-ess this problem? There are no votes in roads, and this Government has no moral commitment to anything but votes and staying in office. I accept the need for competition, but if competition reduces prices to buyers how can competition increase prices to sellers of wheat in a small, oversupplied milling and industrial wheat market? These Bills remove the Australian Wheat Board's acquisition and price setting power for wheat for human consumption on the domestic market. The peak body of the wheat industry, the Grains Council of Australia, the National Party's Federal Council and State National Party policies oppose this, as do a large majority of Australian wheat growers. As I believe that farmers have a right to determine their own marketing procedures and to extract a premium from the domestic market as every other sector of this community does, I also oppose it. I also believe that this will result in lower prices equivalent to the lowest export price, as the Minister himself acknowledges. This includes the savings that he forecast, yet to be seen, in the transport, storage and handling sector. With the underwriting arrangements to drop to 80 per cent of the estimated net pool return in the subject year, as proposed by the Government, in a deregulated domestic market the Australian Wheat Board will be in a substantially weaker position relative to its competitors. Without an adequate capital base the Board is able only to make advance payments to the level of the Government's guarantee on borrowings. Similarly, the cashout price, or the Board's cash buying price, will be around that mark and can only be higher than the 80 per cent level in a low production or, to a lesser extent, a low price year. It is not, therefore, economically or equitably feasible for the industry to act as a banker to itself for the purpose of making higher advance payments or higher cash payments than the Government's guaranteed level of borrowings, unless, of course, in the case of the cash-out payments, the return to the pool on the money borrowed to make that cash-out payment is in excess of the cost of borrowing that money. The level of cash-out payment will be determined, as is currently the case, by taking a percentage of a net pool return rate that has been discounted to a net present value on the basis of expected revenue flows and, of course, the cost of money. This is to ensure that the pool is not disadvantaged, but what is more important is that the qashout price is co-related to the level of pool advance payments. Given that the cash-out price or cash price on offer will set the floor in the domestic market, the implications of lower advance payments to domestic market wheat prices is extremely critical in any debate we have on this legislation. It reinforces my earlier tions that domestic wheat is likely to be traded at prices far below average export prices. This price will determine the competitive benchmark for the AWB and private traders alike. As payments drop growers will seek a cash-out option rather than wait for further payments down the track. Some growers in my electorate support deregulation. I know them all and I respect their arguments. I accept that under the present structure they have been able to capture premiums in some instances in some years-as my colleagues have already stated, up to $15 a tonne on feed wheat. These growers, through geographical advantage, marketing skills or a superior product, will still do this in a deregulated market. However, I contend that while these growers will still capture a premium it will be at a lower base and they will face increased competition as all growers will be forced to capture part of the domestic market. I therefore indicate my intention during the committee stage of this Bill to move amendments that I have already tabled. These amendments, to clauses 3, 5 and 6 of the principal Bill, and the consequential changes necessary, are designed to maintain the Australian Wheat Board's powers on the domestic market while accepting the opportunities to give the Australian Wheat Board greater flexibility and commerciality. Mr Ian Cameron-And I will second them.  honourable member for Maranoa will support the amendments. These Bills also reduce the underwriting guarantee from 95 per cent to 80 per cent in 1993 and then stop it altogether. I support the Opposition's amendment to maintain the underwriting fee at 95 per cent. It is on this issue that the Minister has totally destroyed his credibility. Every other initiative in the legislation is to continue into the future, but the Minister imposes what is basically a sunset clause on underwriting. Farmers have been told in no uncertain terms that they as individuals simply do not count, despite contributing 45 per cent of export income. The Government knows that if the worse happens agribusiness or foreign interests will take up the land and still produce the wheat. Family farmers have asserabsolutely no place in the program of the Australian Labor Party. These Bills are a disgrace to the Government. It has been necessary for the Government to move a host of amendments to its own legislation. I am told that there are about 40 amendments to its legislation. The Opposition amendments are all positive and must be supported. I will debate· these amendments further at the committee stage. I conclude by saying that this issue is of fundamental importance to me. I understand that some of my colleagues see the removal of this Government and a perception of unity as more important than the issue of wheat. But if this is the case, growers· will lose the status to influence and direct their own future and will be placed at the cliff face of a corrupt marketing system while unfairly bearing the brunt of high domestic costs without genuine government backing-something no other sector, including every member of parliament, would be/prepared to do. This is something that no other government in the world is prepared to do to its farmers. Surely no democratic government would be prepared to use blackmail as the Minister did in 1984 with the last marketing plan when he threatened not to pay the first advance to farmers. In 1989 he is using the same blackmail tactics by threatening not re-establish any Wheat Board procedures this legislation is not supported. In leaving most of my specific comments to debate in the committee stage, I just say that it is that clever politics is more important than people and ideology more more than issues.",108
170,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown," I support the wheat marketing legwill islation introduced by the Government. we have heard from other speakers, the eral legislation that sets the infrastructure of the wheat marketing system will expire at the end of June. We understand from press reports that the Oppositiol). intends to support this legislation. We have heard a strange mixture of speeches tonight from members of the Opposition-some from the Liberal Party 'of Australia and, just recently,  Fisher) from the N:ational Party of Auslegislation tralia .. Listening to these speeches one ceror tainly understands the divisionl, taking place in the Opposition ranks in relation to this very important legislation. As most of the National Party members do with legislation of this nature, honourable member for Mallee gave us a history lesson. In fact, he skipped over years between 1939 and 1949 when the Austime. tralian Labor Party put in place legislation that brought the wheat industry forward to 30 years. The problem was that at the end of those years we had the unfortunate return of the· conservative governments could not look further forward and modify legislation as times changed. That is one of Australia's tragedies that we have had to face up to. Once again, we are seeing the Labor Government and the Minister for Prithe mary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is at the table, initiating wide-ranging forms to all forms of agriculture as indicated by this legislation. The relevant State and Federal legislation vests sole responsibility for the marketing of most of the wheat grown in Australia with the Australian Wheat Board (AWB). The only exceptions to this are stock feed wheat sold domestically under the permit system, which others have mentioned, wheat kept on farms for farm seed, seed use and seed wheat in Queensland. The proposed legislation for to operations after the end of June was intro· if duced in this place early last month. This legislation deals with four major points, which I would like to cover, including the maintesad nance of the Wheat Board's 40-yeat monopoly on the export. position. The Opposition spoke as if that would be abandoned. It is not true. That monopoly on export wheat stay. We are improving the AWB's local As and overseas competitiveness-something Fedwhich is very important to the future of Australia's wheat industry. We are lifting restrictions on the local market to private traders and abolishing local underwriting arrangements-something again which members Of the Liberal Party strongly support. But we all know that the National Party has vested interests in this regard. We are providing loan guarantees for five years on the from AWB's borrowing to finance advance payments to wheat growers. Nowhere does the per se direct what wheat should should not be transported by rail or road. History has seen a total of eight wheat marketing plans, each containing four common denominators-the Australian Wheat Board, guaranteed prices, domestic price regulation the and stabilisation arrangements. Honourable members opposite have the squabbled over the wheat issue for some In fact, in the gallery earlier this evening we saw a National Party senator who 25 looks like losing his place on the Senate ticket, mainly because of these issues. What they propose is a list of 37 amendments. The that honourable member for Mallee mentioned these. He said that he would discuss them in the committee stage. It will be interesting to hear the debate in the committee stage, when the Liberal Party will argue one case,. and National Party will argue the other. We look forward to the voting on this legislation. reThe public will be able to see how divided the Opposition is in relation to real, progressive legislation. Most of the. 37 amendments are technical. Many will be covered by the Government's amendments and several more may be accepted by the Government after due consideration. However, several stand. out for their inconsistency with the general feeling and intention of the legislation. They are 'lVell the mark, and are the result of intense politicking amongst those opposite. Firstly, there is the needless suggestion for a provision restricting the operation of the transport and marketing override sections. These provisions, sought by the Opposition, apply only to. grain transport, storage and handling and wheat marketing. Why, when this was precisely the Government's intention in drawing up the necessary regulations, is the provision contained in the Oppositi<;m amendments? It is unnecessary,and might allow States to reregulate grain transport, handling and storage by backdoor methods. Let us talk about intra state trade. There is provision for the Wheat Board to trade intra state, even without complementary State legislation. Again, we ask, Why? Is this. an encouragement to the Board to act outside the law? According to legal advice, complementary legislation is required for the Board to trade intra state. True, there has been some political fun and games going on, particularly in New South Wales. There is really no doubt that all States, with the exception of Queensland, will eventually pass complementary legislation. They must, otherwise the same people who do not want private traders to be involved in the market will end up with no one but the private traders-a total contradiction in the arguments put forward by the Opposition. The Queensland situation is unique, in that Queensland is planning to use its State Wheat Board to re-regulate the domestic market. The Queensland approach will be overcome by other provisions in the Bill, which automatically override certain prescribed State regulations. One would expect that sort of approach from Queensland in the preseht climate because it is out of step with everything else in Australia:. The Opposition's suggested exemption of the Wheat Board from the Trade Practices Act is quite ludicrous and is quite contradictory to the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act regarding the abuse of market power. Fancy suggesting that the Wheat Board should be exempted from the Trade Practices Act! The Government would have considerably difficulty in implicitly endorsing an abuse of market power by a Commonwealth instrumentality. Still, we can expect that type of off thing from the National Party, particularly when one looks at the position from the Queensland end of things. Amid its endless posturing and pondering on this issue, one of the Opposition's political stunts was to call for the inclusion of a provision to allow the Wheat Board, or any other corporation involved in grain marketing, storage, handling or transport, to take no cognisance of any industrial award or agreement and to be exempted from State and ComJ,llonwealth industrial legislation. Will it never learn? We are moving intothe 1990s, not into 1919-20. Here we have the most ridiculous amendment ever to be proposed in this Parliament, in an attempt-for what reason I do not know-to attack the labour forces within Australia. Just for good measure, the Opposition throws in p-nal clauses and allows claims for damages. If that is not an ambit claim, I do not know what is. It would not get past first base in any State of Australia, and it will not get past this House. It is a nice try, but it is a blatantly political stunt. Let us ask what its sole purpose is. Is it a diversionary tactic? Opposition members had to come up with something to cover their embarrassment over the Government's decision to use its constitutional powers to override certain State regulations .concerning wheat marketing and grain transport, storage and handling. I turn now to underwriting levels. The Opposition wants an underwriting level, as mentioned by other members, fixed at 95 per cent of the expected return in each season. The Government has proposed 90 per cent, phasing it down to 80 per cent over five years,' That level of 90 per cent, as has also been mentioned by other speakers, would be triggered very frequently; in fact it would occur almost every year. All it would need is a meagre 5 per cent error at the time of estimating. the expected wheat price for the year. Of course, then budgetary problems would follow. This would be totally contradictory to the position taken by the Australian Government and this Australian Parliament in all the efforts we are making on world markets in relation to subsidies and developing markets in a free market approach. In respect of the United States of America, Vice-President Quayle was here recently getting a lot of publicity in relation to wheat, US subsidies and US export enhancement programs. This Parliament sent a delegation to the US on two occasions to speak to Congress, one with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and another that I was privileged to lead. Both delegations argued our case on the world scene in relation to subsidies. Here we have the most ridiculous situation being put forward by the Opposition, and in particular by the National Party, in amendments which virtually say, 'Let us tear up all those efforts we have made on the world scene; let us go back on our arguments and develop a similar process here in Australia'. It is virtually the sort of problem that we have been endeavouring to overcome in all our discussions around the world and one in which we are making great progress. The problem in the US is that in the Midwest there is this National Party approach to subsidies, and the administration of Vice-President Quayle and President Bush claims it is trying to break that down. However, it has a bigger problem than our Government in respect of those Midwest American farmers who are represented in the American Parliament by people who also cannot see the problems they are creating for the rest of the world. Another area of vital importance relates . to the composition of the Board. The Opposition wants a requirement that the Board chairman and five of the remaining Board members be wheat growers. Such a proposal is totally contrary to the principle that the Board consist of the best available people. We are not saying that the best available people could not come from the farming sector, but that is not the point. Grower interests will be safeguarded. In fact, the selection committee is dominated by representatives of the Grains Council, and the Board itself will consist of people with a balance of skills, one being production. It is vitally important that the Wheat Board consist of the best possible people as it is the only statutory marketing authority that markets most of a commodity's production. It is unique in Australia and it must have the best possible people. Besides, no other Commonwealth statutory marketing authority has such guaranteed positions for growers and several do not have chairmen at the present time, for example, the Australian Dairy Corporation, the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the Australian Pork Corporation and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. All those corporations have been reformed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and this Government. They do not necessarily have to have a farmer representative at their head. We are talking about modern times, modern marketing and the modern techniques that are required for these corporations to run effectively. The Government wants the Australian Wheat Board to comprise 11 people, including eight nominated by the selection committee, bearing in mind that the selection committee will be chosen from Grains Council people around Australia. So we will achieve a balance of skills and a balance of the sorts of people who are required in this modern day. There will be no requirement for all States to be represented on the Board. Apart from the presiding member, the members of the selection committee are to be nominated, as I said, by the Grains Council of Australia. The Australian Wheat Board will be able to operate under a more commercial structure, possessing the ability to buy wheat for cash and market other grains. That is vitally important in the changes we are seeing today-the marketing of other grains . The figures clearly indicate that farmers in some areas are making economic decisions to move to other products. They are moving with the times. Why cannot these so-called National Party representatives who continue to claim that they have the wisdom recognise what is going on in the marketplace? Farmers are moving to grow other products, including products that need to be exported. That is one of the changes that has to take place. They will need to trade in wheat produced in other countries, operate grain handling and storage facilities and enter into contracts unencumbered by State legislation-real changes to create a wheat board for the future, not a wheat board designed in the 1940s. It was a Labor Government that put the first structures into place. said before, it was looking 25 to 30 years ahead. This legislation is looking ahead to the next 25 or 30 years, it is looking at a country which is dealing in world markets, not a country which is basically producing wheat only for a small market and trying - o build it up. Those days are gone. We are In a modern world, which requires these changes. The Government's legislation also puts an end to compulsory acquisition and administered domestic pricing measures. It terminates the levy which funds the shipment of wheat to Tasmania. In future, the assistance to meet the cost of shipping wheat to Tasmania will be funded from Consolidated Revenue, and it will be available to be seen by all. We also propose to introduce the Wheat Industry Fund (WIF). The establishment of the Wheat Industry Fund will provide a capital base to fund activities, including Australian Wheat Board's commercial operations. The WIF will be able to make advance payments above the borrowing guarantee and provide insurance on credit sales. Proceeds from a levy on all wheat sold, delivered or processed, including wheat handled by private traders, will be paid into WIF. To ensure the successful establishment of the WIF the Minister has announced that the Government will guarantee over five years AWB borrowings of up to $100m. In supporting this legislation, I see it extremely vital to the future of Australia and to a major industry in Australia, an industry which is making the necessary changes to make itself more competitive and which needs the support of the structures that we are now putting into place to enable it to compete on both the world and Australian markets more effectively. Mr Tim Fischer-Your Victorian conference will revoke your preselection.",116
171,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The interjector at the table talks about the Victorian rail situation. There is a great debate at the moment as to whether we are going to continue to lose rail jobs. There is no doubt about that. The steady decline in employment in. the railways will continue. This legislation will have no bearing upon that. This legislation As I will allow a marketing system whereby new industries, new exports and new products can also be carted by rail. It will mean that unless the wheat industry is competitive, we will not get back that share of the world market which has declined in competition with the United States. Therefore the railways will still be able to cart at least 85 per cent of the wheat produced in Australia, and they can improve that situation by being more efficient and .being able to take the measures that ale necessary to move wheat in the directions, to the ports and to the places where it is most economical to do so. That may have to be across State borders, it may have to be in different avenues from today. Some of it may have to be carted by road to get to terminals. Some may have to be carted by road to get direct to buyers in the Australian market. But all those efficiencies will mean that we will be more competitive, that we will be able to continue to the produce more wheat and 85 per cent of that will continue to go by rail. This legislation does not guarantee any sector a part of that transport market or guarantee that the type of structure that the railways have today will be there in 10 years' the time. That· is not· what this Bill is about. Those are issues which are being faced up to by railways all over Australia, regardles- of what happens in this area. But there IS a guarantee that unless we hold the line on as costs, unless we produce a very efficient industry growing wheat in Australia, unless. we support. those farmers who have moved to produce other products and to put those products on rail, the decline in rail will continue. Everybody has to realise that this is 1989, not 1949. .ADJOURNMENT",119
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the Ho.use do now adjourn. Mr Kerio-I require that the question be put forthwith without debate.

173,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The only plea that I make in this Parliament tonight is that those opposite who have been squabbling and brawling over this issue for the last three weeks and who cannot come to a decision and look to the future should realise that their situation is such that, if they continue to live in the past and they do not face up to the realities, they will decline as a political force in this nation. Even their own constituents in many parts of Australia today are seeing the evidence. Go through my area where we have the dairy industry, go through other areas where we have the cotton industry and go through the beef industry. All the industries in Australia which have been revamped under the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy are now prospering. All we are doing with this legislation is facing up to another issue which honourable members on the opposite benches ignored from about 1976 when they grabbed power in this nation and did nothing about the real issues that they should have been facing up to. They should not come into this House posturing as if they are able to say to any farmer or producer in Australia that they have any answers for their problems. I strongly support this legislation. I believe that it will take Australia's major industry, the wheat industry, into the next century in a very strong position. Mr TA,YLOR (Groom) (10.33)-Despite the incoherent ramblings of the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham), I welcome the opportunity to participate in this vital debate on the wheat industry as the package before the House is one of the most important legislative initiatives in this 1989 place for many years. I say at the outset, as my colleagues have said earlier, that, at best, it is sloppily drafted and, at worse, many would argue that it is unduly invasive and bereft of any real feel for its practical consequences. I have some sympathy for this latter view-hence the need for extensive amendments from both sides of the House to facilitate informed debate. Here we have yet another example of the Hawke Government's more haste less speed approach to its legislative program OVer the last year. Clearly the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin)-I am glad to see him at the table this eveninghas contracted the saine disease and, over recent weeks, has resorted in the wheat issue to political one-upmanship at the expense of the most important factor u'nderlying this debate-the economic survival of the· grain grower. I will Come back to that point later in this debate. . Some of the measures that, we have before us this evening would not be' there, warts and all, without strong pressures from the Opposition and advice from many grain instrumentalities and individuals across the country. Before I address some of the specific issues raised by the legislation, I would like to pay particular tribute to my colleagues the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and the honourable member for Wannon (Me Hawker), without whose patience, perseverance and industry the issues that needed to be aired would not have been aired, and without whose knowledge of what the producers need rather than what a central government dictates, we would not have been able to have had a rational debate on these matters this evening. I also thank the  Fisher) for his conviction and his courage. I thank the many contributors in my electorate, which is the major provincial centre for the grains industry instrumentalities in Queensland, for their diverse views on the wheat deregulation issue. Without them my education and analysis of the very complicated issues would not have been complete. These issues are complex, despite the somewhat simplistic appreciation of the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) earlier this evening. I am particularly grateful to the General President of the Queensland Grain Growers Association, Mr Don MCKechnie, and his General Manager, Mr George Houen; the Chairman of the State Wheat Board of Queensland, Mr Ross Bailey; the General Manager of Bulk Grains Queensland, Mr Don Christmas; the Executive Officer of the Queensland Produce, Seed and Grain Merchants Association, Mr Tony Parsons; the Executive Officer of the Australian Wheat Board, Mr John Dunn; and many others, such as the Council of Agriculture and local producers. As that renowned philosopher and scholar Socrates once said: Nobody is qualified to become a statesman who is entirely ignorant of the problem of wheat. His perceptions are no less relevant today than they were centuries ago and I only wish that the Chairman of the Government's country task force, the honourable member for Rankin, would take up this scholarly advice and talk to producers and the Queensland instrumentalities rather than offhandedly dismiss the legislation's very real deficiencies as he did on television last week. Despite what he had to say this evening, he cannot continue to hide in the urban sprawl of Inala at the expense of his rural cOnstituents. Turning more specifically to this debate, my first point is that we should not have deregulation in any industry simply on the basis 9f unyielding philosophy or ideology. There has to be a demonstrable need. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) knows better than most in this place what that means in terms of pragmatic privatisation measures. We only have to look at the Australian Labor Party's socialisation objective of the 1920s and its blind dogma to see the adverse social and economic consequences that can result. In the Opposition we need also to take care that we do not fall into the same philosophical trap, albeit from the other end of the political spectrum. In the wheat industry, there is a need for some change in management and marketing---':a point conceded by many across. the nation and argued here this evening-but the Government's approach, in my view, goes too far too fast. The Opposition's amendments go some way, but not completely, towards correcting that situation. However, I note also from the Government's Caucus record of discussion of the legislation that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy admitted in that forum that only 41 per cent of growers expressed support for the legislation. I am left wondering why he has persevered with his legislative approach in the absence of an absolute majority and why he has disregarded growers' meetings in Queensland and elsewhere in which most people attending have opposed strongly the domestic deregulation push. Come what may, the Minister appears intent on having his way. My second point involves persistent concern about constitutional question marks over the Government's approach based on the Commonwealth's international and interstate trade and commerce powers under section 51 (1) of the Australian Constitution, in particular the very understandable perception of some that so-called States' rights are in question. I have cited eminent legaladvisings from both sides of the argument. To base legislation on a questionable foundation inevitably must lead to challenge, disruption and/ or uncertainty. I wonder whether the industry can afford such a shaky legislative foundation in an environment of increasing competition? Despite what I have heard earlier from some on both sides of this place, my third point refiectspractical local reservations about the potential for increased road transport of bulk grains in very large vehicles through Toowoomba in particular despite the inadequate response on that question in this place earlier today by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown). His New South Wales rail analogy does not necessarily apply across the nation. Both he and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy might be happy with such a proposition from where they sit here or in their electorates, but many of my constituents are increasingly apprehensive at the prospect of increased road tonnages-irrespective of their quantum-on an already inadequate Warrego Highway to the port of Brisbane. I acknowledge that Queensland Rail has to be more competitive and cost effective. To its credit, the Queensland Government has already taken some initiatives, both in terms of rolling stock and track work. Clearly, it has to do better in a truly competitive environment. However the road transport .problem is exacerbated by the Government's road funding reductions in rural road construction over the last six years despite the mathematical gymnastics of the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support to the contrary over recent months. The Warrego Highway to Brisbane is already stretched to its limits with large vehicles. Will road funding measures announced yesterday by the Government counter this argument, and .do they extend to that highway and to the many rural roads in south-east Queensland needing extensive work to meet increased bulk grain transport? Based on what the Minister has said to date, I have little confidence in any substantive improvements. What specific guarantees can he give both producers and residents in terms of environmental and safety considerations? He cannot simply pass the buck to the State or local governments. I now turn to some of the specific clauses of the Wheat Marketing Bill. Clause 7 relating to powers provides the Board with the power to contract or enter into agreements or arrangements without any regard whatsoever for State legislation. It is open to speculation as to whether. the vesting of grain in State commodity boards has any overriding constitutional backing. The Opposition's. proposed new clause 7A seeks to clarify the situation and to prevent any overriding of the marketing functions of State statutory marketing bqards other than for wheat. Clause 8, dealing with directions to the Board, provides the Federal Minister with extensive powers with respect to directions to the Board. It can be argued that as the Bill stands, the wheat growers .of Australia will no longer be masters of the destiny of their own industry. To this end, a new subclause 8e has been proposed by this side of the House to allow compensation to be paid if the Board incurs a loss in obeying a direction of the Minister. Clause 13 provides the Board with the power to enter into partnerships or joint ventures, but only with the written permission of the Minister. Negotiations between the Queensland State Wheat Board and the Australian Wheat Board to enter into a joint venture arrangement in Queensland and to merge the functions of the two organisations are proceeding. Unfortunately, this clause as drafted could jeopardise such negotiations by the necessity to obtain ministerial approval and the provision of power for the Minister to give directions to the Board. Can the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy give some assurances to allow the negotiations to proceed to mutual satisfaction? Clause 15 deals with composition of the Boaf(-. There is no prerequisite for a member to be appointed from Queensland. Whilst Queensland subscribes to the philosophy of having well qualified Board members, it also believes that it is essential for Queensland growers to have their own representative on the Board, especially in view of its role in the production of premium wheat. In regard to clause 58, the Board has overriding powers with respect to the classification and quality determination of wheat. Whilst this may appear to be logical and justifiable, there is a need for consultation with State instrumentalities such as the Queensland State Wheat Board. Clause, 61 deals with pooling arqmgements. I fl.dly support the proposed. new clause 61A, which prevents the provisions of the Trade Practices Act from applying to wheat pooling arrangements. Clause 78 deals with underwriting. I also support the Opposition's proposed subclause 14 with ,the appropriate percentage for. all seasons .commencing on or after 1 July 1989 at 95 per cent. It is not, .as the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) suggests, an ambit claim. It is a real and justifiable claim. In regard to clause 85. the establishment of the Wheat Industry Fund which requires a levy of at least 2 per cent of the value of wheat of the season in a deregulated environment appears to me be be an anachronism. It is difficult to envisage how the Commonwealth will implement the levy arrangements on an equitable basis on all the wheat so produced. The very important clause 88 deals with the operation of certain State and Territory laws. This clause as drafted purports to· allow any trading corporation to ignore State laws in respect of. the storage, handling, transport and marketing 9f all grain destined for export or for sale interstate, and in many minds is a direct interference with so-called State rights. This clause, as it now stands, has the potential to disrupt some well-established· State-b.ased arrangements for the storage, . handling, transport and marketing of commodities such as barley, grain, sorghum, maize, oilseeds, rice and legume crops and could set a precedent for further unwanted and unwarranted Commonwealth intrusion into the handling, transport and marketing of other commodities which have an export orientation, such as coal and beef. Queensland producers are extremely concerned at the prospect of unrestricted road deliveries of grain to port terminals and at the possibility of a challenge to Bulk Grains Queensland's exclusivity at port to the year 1994. This is critical to the future viability of that organisation. The Bill is also notable for its departure from previous arrangements which exist 'between the Australian Wheat Board and State authorised receivers. The damage which could be imposed on the grain industry if the Queensland bulk handling authorities are fragmented and exposed to open competition without significant relief to the current indebtedness which was incurred in an environment of regulated marketing, storage and handling needs to be emphasised. The Commonwealth has an obligation to address this issue prior to imposing a deregulated environtnimt. What short term financial relief to statutory handling authorities does the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy have to offer on this point? A critical element of this whole d'ebate is the Government's acceptance of the Opposition's amendment to clause 88 to deregulate labour practices in the storage, handling, 'transport and sale of grain for export by using the same powers that the Government has used to deregulate storage, handling and transport. I agree entirely with what the honourable member for Murray said yesterday: If it was good enough for wheat growers to accept a deregulated domestic market, which would make them the lowest paid wheat farmers in the western world, they should not be subjected to unnecessary costs caused by a highly regulated labour market , , , The average export price is lower than it should be because of the subsidies paid by the European Community (EC) and the United States in its Export Enhancement Program (EEP) , This will 'also reduce the domestic price in an open market. This lower price will mean that grain growers will be forced to make savings wherever possible, particularly in the high cost areas· of storage, handling and transport. The waterfront is another area of concern, because it is important that exports are delivered on time and for minimum cost. The amendment will allow the Wheat Board to enter into agreements with the labour force on conditions outside the regulated awards, As the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) has said, the latter point is a very important initiative, giving the Government the opportunity to respond positively. Logic dictates that, if the Government accepts the legal basis for clause 88, it must equally accept the thrust of the amendment. To differentiate must weaken its legal case and therefore place much of the package in question. In summary, while I support the legislation, with the Opposition's amendment, which I hope the Government will accept, I have some persistent difficulty with accepting the basic argument that it will result in resource savings of $10 per tonne, put forward in the report of the MCColl Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport published last year, which forms the basis of the legislative approach of the· Minister for ·Primary Industries and Energy. This is best summarised in the final comments of Ken Davidson's article in the Melbourne Age of 6 April, entitled 'Wheat Farmers Likely Losers in Open Market', in which he said: Whether wheat farmers as a whole would benefit by choosing when and to whom to sell really amounts to whether they are capable of being better wheat marketers than the Wheat Board, The balance of probability is that they are better at growing grain than selling it. The idea' that wheat farmers, by having the opportunity to take risks in the wheat market, will be more responsive to market forces and more effective in getting economies in handling, distribution and transport does have a <;ertain ideological attraction, but only a weak practical force. There are continued savings to be made by improving the efficiency of wheat handling, storage and transport. But as Mr MCColl, on whose Royal Commission findings the Government's case for deregulation is based, says, The identified savings are achievable with the existing marketing arrangements.' Unless the bulk of Australia's wheat growers have untapped attributes in marketing their own wheat, the real beneficiaries of the deregulatory proposals are the middlemen and end users. In my view, there is merit in holding an urgent meeting of' the all-States Australian Agricultural Council to review this unsatisfactory legislation. The Minister appears to have ignored calls from State Ministers to explore the issues in this way. I hope that he will reconsider this in the light of the States' lack of complementary legislation so critical to the legislation's practical effectiveness and in view of the earlier comments by the honourable member for Murray about likely support for the Opposition's amendments in the Senate and their subsequent return to this place. I wholeheartedly support the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Mallee that too many of us in this place too often allow ideology to misplace the issues and crass politics to misplace the needs of people. On this occasion, this involves people in the rural sector in general and the grain pl'oducers in particular. It is about time that we all pulled up our socks and remembered that it is the people of Australia who put us in this place.",120
174,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"It is a great pleasure tQ speak in this, debate because many of the, sentiments echoed by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), are in fact just words. If honourable members read them in the Hansard they will see that they can be used anywhere in the Parliament on any topic because about all they really relate to is the normal popUlist cant and hypocrisy that emits from National Party people wandering around the bush in Australia preaching this sort of stuff. Every time members of the Opposition have to tap the mat and actually face up to some of the realities of the policies they have been preaching, this is the sort of stuff we get. It is cant; it is hypocrisy. As a member of the country task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), let me say that in all our travels around Australia, when we go out bush and we actually meet and talk with people-I remind the honourable member for Groom that we represent more country people than he does and we have more people in the House with a country background than the Opposition-we find that the producers tell us that they do not want their prospects of quality world markets damaged by restrictions in getting their product to the market. They continually say to us that they want transport improved, marketing improved and the wharves improved. The Minister for Primary lndustries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has the guts to introduce into this House decent deregulation and decent moves to actually make these things happen. Honourable members opposite should listen to what is being said. On the front page of tonight's Melbourne Herald there is an article entitled 'MPs in fiery dash'. It is not a fiery clash on the Government side of the House versus the Opposition side of the House. The fiery clash is between the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and Senator MCGauran. A member of the National Party of Australia and a member of the Liberal Party of Australi- are almost thumping each other physically in the corridors of Parliament because they cannot agree over deregulation. It is cant and hypocrisy and we get it every time. Let us briefly look at this situation. Every time ,a government tries to do things such as this in the reform agenda, we run into frustration in the Senate. Once this legislation goes through this House, let us see what happens on the other side. I will put two bob on members of the Opposition being out there frustrating the legislation and referring it to a committee. They will not tap the mat and pass decent deregulation legislation; no way. Let us look at a couple of key issues that come into this legislation: first of all, there is the question of market benefits. I am the first one to agree that market benefits have to flow through. Royal Commissioner MCColl estimated at least $10 a tonne as the result flowing to the producer. The result of this deregulation has to be something flowing through to the producers. If we are going to go through the pain and the agony, then the system has to work and everybody has to make it work. We are the' ones who will be saddled with having to deliver. We will have to put the legislation through, go out there; make sure it happens and make sure that Queensland the State of the honourable member fo; Groom, actually makes it happen. We have to make sure that the hono-r. able member does not run otT to the High Court of Australia, frustrating it which is what I expect he will be promoting once he goes back home with his populist stutT. We have got to make it happen so that the producer actually gets the return. Let us walt and see what happens when that comes along. Let us look at the road and rail dispute. Members of the Opposition are absolutely terrific at running in here talking about the threat to rail transport from roads. When did they ever face up to the real cost of trucks' on the roads? Ret us look at the question of road and rail. In the States where it 'has happened the rail has held the contract. In New South Wales the Grain Elevators Board has been prepared to stick with the rail because its tender was competitive. In South Australia the evidence has been that, as a result of the deregulation, rail still held its share without any problems. In Victoria-and that is the State I am most interested in-Mr Tim Fischer-Tell us about your ALP conference. Mr ,OKEEFE-Forget abo\.!t the State ALP confel,""ence. In Victoria rail will hold its own. The, minute rail is, not used, trucks will start coming down through my electorate. AbouUwo years ago, farmers boycotted rail in order to get the prices down. The first thing that happened was that all the roads were torn up in places like BalIan and Daylesford. All the farmers on the council& raced up to us and said, 'For God's sake, what are you going to do about this? We have got to have more road funds. Look at all these trucks coming through'. They have learned that leSson. They know that if they take their wheat otT the rail, that will be end of their railway line. They are the very OIles who demand a railway line. Wheat will be carried by rail. All the evidence so far is that raIl will hold its own. The farmers have been down that road.' They are a bit smar'ter than honourable members opposite. That is about the guts of, it. Let us have a look at the cant that we have been hearing. Let us talk about these people who claim to be, the friends of wheat producers. My first experience ?f. driving anything as a young boy was of dr1Vlpg a tractor ona wheat farm. My father was a sh,are farmer and we raised wheat. Mr Tim Fisch-rWhere?",124
175,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"In Horsham. The honour will be able to tell you all about my background as a young share farmer. It was a great learning experience. Let us talk about the farmers' friend, Senator MCGauran, who has taken up the challenge on behalf of the farmers in the National Party of Australia. Fair dinkum, this far-­ ers' friend would not know a wheat stalk If he found one in a Weet-Bix packet. Senator MCGauran who was elected to the Senate on the tidket 'We are the Nationals; we represent country people', lives in South Yarra. It is a bit hard in places like St Arnaud and the Mallee. This Melbourne City councillor and motel owner, who is supposed has to have a country background, has come to this Parliament. I might say too, that he is, not too bright. I was having a look in the, Parliamentary Handbook to see whether he has the cheek to list his occupation as a farmer. I find that it does not contain any background or nominated occuI?ation. !l0wever I have discovered that he IS certamly a trier: He set otT to do his degree and, despite persistent difficulties, kept his h-ad an- stuck to his guns. Eventually he gamed hiS economics degree after seven years of study. "" Mr Brumby-How many?",125
176,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"'--Seven years full time-he had plenty of time. Mr Brumby-What did he do then? Mr OKEEFE""':'-He went out and looked for a job. 'Do honourable members know what he got a job as? He was - mployed - s the a bookie's penciller, and let him come m here and deny it. He is supposed to be the farmers' friend-the man with the great background of being a bookie's penciller. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order in relation to standing order 75, which states: No Member may use offensive words against either House of the Parliament or any Member thereof, against any member of the Judiciary, or against any statute unless for the purpose of moving for its repeal. Clearly, the honourable member has exceeded standing order 75 with regard to his descriptions in relation to Senator Julian MCGauran, a courageous senator. I ask that you draw the honourable member back to the Bill.",125
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The honourable member had made his point. I do not find that the honourable member has used unparliamentary terms or, indeed, offensive language. (Quorum formed)",126
178,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"I was talking about an aspect of the wheat deregulation issue involving the Nationals and the Liberals being at each other's throats. This particularly cerns Senator MCGauran, who claims to be the farmers' friend. We were talking about the fact that Senator MCGauran, having taken seven years to get his degree-he is a great trier-does not list his occupation anywhere. He runs around claiming he is the farmers' friend, but we find out that his occupation is not in the Parliamentary Handbook because before he came to this place he was a bookie's penciller. He does not want to tell anybody he· was a bookie's penciller. The last time. I was talking about him in here the Opposition also called a quorum, and that reminds me of the bells story. The other problem that we had with Senator MCGauran, the farmers' friend, is that when he arrived here he did not turn up for divisions. The reason he did not turn up for divisions was that he put pillows over his bells so he did not have to listen to the damned things.",126
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I ask the honourable member for Burke to get back to the legislation before. the House.,126
180,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"I am happy to do that. The relevance of what I am saying is the fact that we have been-Mr L1oyd-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Has the honourable member said anything relevant on the Bill? He should get back to the Bill.",126
181,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,I am glad to see that the honourable senator's brother has now joined us in the House. Here is another Melbourne City Council area motel owner who runs around claiming to represent farmers. He is wandering into this wheat debate which has been going on-,126
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I again ask the honourable member for Burke to come back to the contents of the Bill.,126
183,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"I am happy to do that. We are talking here about genuine deregulatioh and reform of the infrastructure aimed entirely at getting the product to the market quicker, better and cheaper. My colleagues here who are on the country task force know that the thing that we get asked about every time we go around the bush in Australia is the ability to get products delivered to the market efficiently, quickly and at minimum con- cost. All my colleagues will say that the minute that the Minister tries to do something to bring this about those on the other side who are full of all this cant and hypocrisy about reform and deregulation and all that stuff they go out and preach-the populist stuff they go on with; the agrarian socialists who want to capitalise the profits but are happy to socialise the losses-come into this Parliament and oppose and frustrate. I bring attention to the front page of the Melbourne Herald, which is very relevant to this debate. It describes the honourable member for O'Connor and Senator MCGauran fighting with each other in the corridors of Parliament about the wheat legislation. I am talking about Senator McGauran, the Melbourne City councillor who lives in South Yarra, who puts the pillows over the bells so he does not have to listen to them. He claims to be the farmers' friend! How can members opposite expect to be taken seriously? I return to the core of the matter. Another of my honourable colleagues, the Deputy Whip, the honourable member for Streeton (Mr Lamb), is a Horsham lad. More people on our side come from the wheat country and understand what the wheat legislation is all about than on the other side. The honourable member for Streeton is probably like me, in that he grew up on a tractor like I did and understands the issues. To return to the point, half of these fellows who run around claiming to represent country people, particularly in the wheat belt, would not know a wheat stalk if they found it in a Weet-Bix packet, fair dinkum! The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) knows that when put to the real test, members opposite have failed. They went on with all this stuff about the great National Party Conference in Victoria last week producing peace, a coalition that has it all back together, and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) proud to have the team behind him. Look at it-punching each other up in the corridor! Can anyone believe it? I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition will do about - t. We also know that once the legislation passes through the Hpuse, once we have all the dramas and the crossings of the floor and all that stuff, it will to the Senate where it will be obstructed and sent to a committee. When it comes to the crunch of facing up to genuine reform aimed at getting the farmer's product to the market more quickly and cheaply, aimed at putting more money in the farmer's pocket, the National Party will oppose it. It will block it, frustrate it, and stall on· it. When National. Party members are asked to tap the mat they do not have it in them. They do not have it in them because they do not have people who are prepared to go out there and talk to country people in the bush, like our country task force does. They do not have people like the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I commend the Minister. I am probably tell-ng stories out of school, but at our Caucus policy committee meeting yesterday, the Minister sat down and talked about the matter with the very members who are at the coal face. As one, they told him that their growers understood and supported what we are doing and that they had no hassles with it. There is the fact of the matter. The guts is over here; the cant and the hypocrisy are over there. I am happy to support the Bill.",126
184,Mr IAN CAMERON,Unknown,"1t was interesting to listen to the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) and the fact that he thinks that he has grown wheat. Before I pass some comments on the Wheat Marketing Bill and cognate Bills, I would like to say that I am a wheat grower. My colleague the honourable member for  grower. I oppose the Bill-not because of the so-called 'deregulation' parts of the leg-' islation but because of the hypocrisy of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). Two years ago he was rolled in the Senate by the Opposition on the composition of the Australian Wheat Board. I also oppose the Bill because of the fact that we have in this chamber members of the Australian Labor Party who are overriding their own States in relation to States' rights on the transportation of grain. Mr O'Keefe-Hear, hear!",127
185,Mr IAN CAMERON,Unknown,"It is not 'Hear, hear!'. On the other hand, they impose taxes on them, such as excise duties. They have go the hypocrisy - o allow one government to tax another. They introduced an excise tax on fuel, on the diesel used in our rail transportation system throughout this country, and here they are imposing taxes on the wheat growers. If we want a bit of deregulation in this industry-where is Keating: What about withdrawing the excise tax on diesel? What about it!",127
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for Maranoa will address his remarks through the Chair.,127
187,Mr IAN CAMERON,Unknown,"These are two of the main components. Queensland got a bit of a bash here tonight, but it so happens that Queensland is a very efficient producer of wheat. It is not one of the biggest producers in Australia, but the wheat it produces is of a very high quality and has a high protein content. Queensland produces a very good product. The Agricultural Council in Queensland regards this legislation as totally unacceptable. I am referring to the whole agricultural industry of Queensland. It fears the definition of 'grain', which according to this legislation covers any product of the soil declared by the Minister. Of course, in this legislation all power is to the Minister. Everything depends on the Minister. Mr John Brown-A good Minister.",127
188,Mr IAN CAMERON,Unknown,"That is your story, but that is not what the farmers think. Most of the farmers think that he is not much of a Minister. Where are all the wheat growers supporting the Minister in this country? There have been protest meetings up and down this nation, covering its length and breadth. How many resolutions were passed at these grower meetings supporting the Minister's stance on this legislation? The Minister was not even prepared to go to any of the meetings. Tell me, Minister, which meetings you attended? You did not go to Toowoomba; you sent someone from your Department. You did not go to Emerald; again you sent someone from your Department. You did not have enough guts to go up to Queensland and hear what the growers have to tell you. You were to- gutless! You did not have the guts to go up there and listen to the growers. You did not attend any meetings; you sent departmental representation. Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to address my comments through you. Queensland has a good National Party government. The Labor Opposition in Queensland is not worth a bumper-the Breakfast Creek mob is not worth a bumper. The National Party has been in office in Queensland for 30 years. It has been able to give the grain growers of Queensland a good freight rate. I pay $16 a tonne. What do we have here? We have the Minister introducing legislation tonight which totally overrides States' rights in this area. What is the need for this? He wants to take over the power for the movement not only of wheat from the point of production to port but of all primary products. He wants to be able to control the movement of all primary products on the State rail systems. What do colleagues from other States think of this Minister of the Federal Government wishing to do that? Whenever before has a Commonwealth Government imposed upon the States the power to take over their rail systems? It is an absolute disgrace and that is the second reason that I will not support this legislation. It has nothing to do with the deregulation of the wheat industry. The other reason is the composition of the Board. The problem in Queensland is that the bulk grains organisation has borrowed a large amount of money to set up Fisherman Islands, which is a brand spanking new export port facility. The organisation borrowed $80m to establish it. The growers had to borrow the money. The whole of the wheat industry organisation is financed by the growers, not the Government. The Government does not put a red cent into the industry and never has, except when Senator Walsh became frightened and the Government had to cough up $170m. Mr Chynoweth-That is a pretty big red cent.",127
189,Mr IAN CAMERON,Unknown,"Well, it is true. That is chicken feed or pig feed. With an $80 billion budget, $170m is pig feed. The industry had to have a stabilisation scheme. Last year, for the first time in 15 years, Senator Walsh did not like the fact that he had to contribute $170m to the stabilisation fund, so what did he do? He ran to the Minister and said, 'We can't have this. We can't have the Government spending a lousy $170m.' How much did the Government give the banks two years ago? How much subsidy did the Government give the banks for housing loans? How much was it? Can Government members tell me? It was $200m. That is how much the Government gave the banks. You are screaming about the banks but you gave the banks $200m in subsidy two years ago. What did you give Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd three years ago? Mr Chynoweth-Too much.",128
190,Mr IAN CAMERON,Unknown,"Too much. I am pleased that the honourable member for Dunkley agrees with me' because that is dead right, but the poor old battling wheat grower, if he wants-incidentally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope that you are listening to me.",128
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I am waiting for the honourable member for Maranoa to direct his remarks through the Chair. I know he is about to do that.,128
192,Mr IAN CAMERON,Unknown,"If the poor old battler out in the bush wants a few bob out of the taxes that he has paid, it is different. It is not as if he has not paid any taxes. Over the years, he has paid millions and millions of dollars in tax. He pays a heap in tax. Just consider the excise on petrol. It is 22c a litre. Mr Deputy Speaker, I want you to understand that half the fuel used on farms is petrol and, under this Labor Government, farmers are now paying 22c a litre excise. It is a disgrace. Where is the Minister, for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown)? He was here. There he is over there. He had the gall to come into the House today and tell us that we do not lack funding for roads. What a lot of nonsense! He has his Minister sitting at the telling us tonight that we must support this legislation. It will put an additional It lion tonnes of grain on the roads system not just in Queensland but throughout the nation: How much in additional funds is he prepared to spend on the road system to cater for that transportation? None! Nil! Absolutely not one dollar! And that is true, Mr Minister? The Minister will agree with me? The Government has not increased road funding in real terms since coming into office. It is down 40 per cent-Mr Robert Brown-We have put lots of money into roads.",128
193,Mr IAN CAMERON,Unknown,"It is all right for the Minister. He flies in his executive jet. I know that he has been to Central Queensland. He flies in his VIP jet and would not know what a potholed road looks like. He would not have a clue. He flew in his VIP jet to Rockhampton-Mr Cunningham-I rise to a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The legislation before the House deals with amendments to the wheat legislation. Road funding, excises and the other matters about which the honourable member is speaking have nothing to do with the Bill. I suggest that he should return to the debate. I know that he really has nothing to speak about.",129
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! I understand that there is an issue in relation to forms of road transport versus rail transport. I was waiting for the honourable member for Maranoa to direct his remarks to that subject but he has not, so I call him back to the Bill.",129
195,Mr IAN CAMERON,Unknown,"Give me a go, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have got Government members worried. I have got them running scared that I might say something about their legislation, so they are jumping up and taking points of order. There is not a bit of power among the lot of them. As I said, the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support travels around in his VIP aircraft. He went to Central Queensland. We have grain roads there. We had a deputation on urgently needed· money for that largest agricultural developing area in the whole of Australia. We need a great deal more road funds for that area so that we can transport grain table using that system. What has he given us? Not a red cent. I am disappointed in the milMinister-I thought that he would do a better job in the Ministry, but he is not succeeding. If the Government is going to deregulate the wheat industry, if it is going to put another 1t million tonnes of grain onto our road system-because that is what is intended-the rail system will be done away with. There are railway lines out to Glenmorgan, out to Bell, which is where I live, and out to Jondaryan. All these branch lines will close. Once the rail system goes, what competition does road have? There will be no competition and the truckies will charge what they like. The Minister knows that well and truly. There will be no competition. What did the Government go and do? It went and taxed the railways and taxed them out of existence. It has been proved that grain can be carted cheaper by rail and ship than by any other form of transportation. We do not need our road system used and abused by forcing this It million tonnes of grain onto it. The other problem is representation on the Australian Wheat Board. What does the Minister do in this all-powerful legislation? He appoints the chairman and deputy chairman of the proposed selection panel. What do they do? They put forward the names of eight members to the Minister. Under this legislation the Minister has the power to reject any of those people; he does not have to accept them. None of them have to be grain growers yet the grain industry is expected to pay for this selection board. The Minister nods his head. He knows that none of the members have to be wheat growers. Yet under this legislation the growers are expected to pay a levy of up to 5 per cent of their gross product in order to collect $50m a year. They are also expected to pay for the composition and running of the selection panel. What do they get in return? Not one grower representative are they allowed under this new arrangement. I know that the Minister will argue that the Grains Council, which sets up the selection committee, appoints these people, but that does not mean to say that there will be a grower representative. Under this new legislation, it is not necessary to have any growers on the Board. It can be argued that there may be some, but the Minister may sack or reject people and it is likely that there will be no grower representatives on the Board. It is an absothat lute disgrace. We growers ought to have some form of representation on our Board, if we are going to continue with the Board. What about the way the members are ing selected? What about a bit of deregulation in the way that they are selected? Why we not have an open ballot system 'as used to? Why do we not have members put up for the growers to select under the soa called democratic system? What is wrong States, wi,th that? Why does the Act that we forced upon the Government three years ago need to be changed? I am disappointed with side about this, although an am:endment will be put forward. We want five grower reprePress sentatives. It will be interesting to see what happens at the end of the day, but I believe that we should have some representation. If the Government is fair dinkum about dereours gulation, give us a democratic form of resentation for board members. It is not to do that. Let us have a bit of democracy. The Government is all for deregulation, so to do so . , it should let us have a bit of democracy. MrKerin-How about a bit of democracy in Queensland? I'll do a deal-one man one vote in Queensland.",129
196,Mr IAN CAMERON,Unknown,"There is a lot more deregulated democracy in Queensland than there ever was in New South Wales under the Labor Government. That is for dead sure. We are still in office in Queensland whereas the bor Party in New South Wales went out of office last year. It is no longer in office; are still there and intend to stay there. Returning to the Bills-there are pages and pages of legislation. I have never seen many Bills, there are seven involved. I have used red ink, underlining and all sorts of things! I will show the House how stupid the Department is. The first paragraph in the explanatory memorandum says: These new arrangements will result in a deregulated domestic wheat market and cessation of controls over the export of feed wheat. The first paragraph of the explanatory mempayment orandum is a total stuff""up. That is what these Bills are-a total stuff-up. Not only are we introducing amendments, but the Minister also has to bring in 30 amendments. I have not seen them all yeti but apparently is what is intended. The Minister's Bill is in tatters and he will have to bring in a own whole raft of amendments as well. I would - lso like to mention underwriting. Previously we had a 95 per cent underwritguarantee over' a three-year role-off. If the price fell below a certain level the Govdo ernment was prepared to put funds into we help the industry over a hump such as we have just had, a downturn. We have just had visit from the Vice-President of the United and he tried to tell us that the United States Government is not subsidising wheat. What a lot of nonsense. I have never heard our such hogwash in all my life. He had the situation so upside down that at the National Conference he tried to tell, us that we had a surplus in trade, for God's sake! Ouf deficit is worse than the United States deficit. The United States deficit is horrific, and is horrific-plus. It is a disaster for us. repWheat is one of the main commodities that going is needed. Encouragement is needed for· farmers to produce wheat, and to continue The domestic market represents only a very small proportion of the amounfof grain that is produced. About' 800,000 tonnes of wheat go to the feed market:· That has been for the last eight years. Permits were needed to sell on that market, and they are being done away with. Purchasers will be licensed and they will pay a licence fee. LaThey will have to contribute to the levy. The levy will return to the fund which is to be we built up and is expected to be worth about $50m. That money will be used by the Board. ,,1 In the meantime, the Government will put up $100m against which the Board can borso row. Over five years that $50m will perhaps build up to $250m and will be used by the industry to help it negotiate and make cash sales. That is probably not such a bad idea. That is one aspect of the Bill which I support. Growers ought to be levied to help pay for the first payment. Under the new arrangement, of course, we see a fall-away from a, 95 per cent guarant-e for the. first to 80 per cent. That will not cost the Treasury anything, yet the industry borrows $200 billion a year, and the Government makes a tremendous amount in tax revenue from the industry. It is one of the biggest industries in Australia. The Government is now negating its responsibilities towards the industry, and it is ending up with very little support at all. Fortunately, we on this side of politics are putting forward amendments. It will be interesting to see how many amendments the Government supports. I would like to think it will support all of our amendments, but I bet it will not. We have a whole fistful of amendments. I wonder why we do not just scrap the legislation and start again. We have that many amendments, and the Labor Party has that many that we may as well start afresh. Poor wheat growers like me are totally· confused by the pages and pages contained in a stack of Bills this high. We are only the poor mugs who have to grow the stuff'. At the end of the day we wonder what we get out of it all. It is not much. Fortunately for us we have seen an increase in the price of wheat. That is to do with the drought in the United States and the fact that world demand for wheat has increased because supply has dropped away. I conclude my remarks by supporting the amendments which we will propose and by indicating that I will not be supporting the legislation. I will support the amendment which the honourable ",130

The following answers to questions were circui-ted: (Question 'No. 1106) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Trade Negotiations, upon notice, on 22 August 1988: (I) What changes have occurred in Australia's exports to debt affected developing countries since the debt crisis began in 1982. (2) What are the estimated losses of Australian exports as a result of import constraints and restructuring programs in those countries. (3) What has been the impact on employment within Australia of this loss of potential exports.",131
198,Mr DUFFY,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The debt problem of the developing countries has constrained world economic and trade growth. To that extent, the debt problem has had an indirect impact on Australian exporters. However, as can be seen from the Table I attached, there is no clear evidence of a direct effect on Australian exports to the debt-affected developing countries. Australian exports to debt-affected countries are dominated by commodity-based exports, particularly agricultural products. While the value of Australia's commodity exports fell, in some cases, following 1982, this was the result of lower world prices rather than lower volumes. In the case of non-agricultural commodities, debt problems were but one of a number of factors that resulted in lower world prices. Similarly, while debt problems contributed to lower agricultural prices, the European Communities Common Agricultural Policy and the Export Enhancement Program by the United States were the major influences on lower agricultural prices. A number of Government policies also contributed to insulating Australian exports from the direct impact of the developing country debt problems, including: (i) the Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF). Use of DIFF funds together with funds from the Concessional Finance Facility operated by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) has allowed EFIC to offer ""soft"" loan packages. These packages have enabled heavily-indebted developing countries to continue importing Australian capital goods important to their development; and (ii) the National Interest provisions whereby the Australian Government (through EFIC) has provided export finance and credit insurance for a range of exports. The National Interest NA Exports "" provisions generally cover exports to heavilyindebted developing countries. (2) and (3), As outlined.in (I), Australian exports have, as a result of a number of policies, been insulated to a considerable degree from the direct effects of the debt problems in the developing countries. At the same time, the debt problem will have had some negative impact on world trade, including Australia. However, it is not feasible to calculate the quantitative effects of these factors given their coincidence with a wide range of other influences on international trade.

(2) What other aged persons' accommodation fareligious cilities are situated in the electoral division of and how many persons are resident in each facility. (3) What was the total number of (a) nursing home beds and (b) other aged persons' accommodation places in (i) the electoral division of Parkes and (ii) Australia in (A) March 1983 and (B) November 1988. (4) How is funding determined in each area for each type of aged persons' accommodation. , Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There are ten Commonwealth subsidised nursing homes for aged people in the electoral division of Parkes. Section 135A of the National Health Act prevents the disclosure of information relating to third parties, however, the total number of approved beds in these facilities at December 1988 was 436. ' (2) There are five Commonwealth subsidised hostels for people in the electoral division of Parkes with 170 persons resident as at December 1988. (3) Commonwealth funded nursing home places in the electoral division of Parkes at 30 June 1983 to-alled 435 and at 30 June 1988, 436. Commonwealth funded hostel places in the electoral division of Parkes at 30 June 1983 totalled 179 and at 30 June 1988, 206. Commonwealth funded nursing home places in Australia at 30 June 1983 totalled 72,307 and at 30 June 1988, 72,116. Commonwealth funded hostel places in Australia at 30 June 1983 totalled 22,676 and at 30 June 1988, 42,121. (4) Nursing homes provide elderly people with nursing and personal care services. The Government believes that, in the past, there has been an overemphasis on nursing homes both in the share of resources provided and in the public perception of what constitutes appropriate care for elderly people. The policy now is to increase the availability of hostels, as opposed to nursing homes, to provide to frail elderly people a range of choice of accommodation and care services. Religious, charitable and voluntary 'organisations may receive capital funding for new nursing home places on a $2 to $1 basis subject to certain eligibility criteria and subsidy limits. Special conditions exist for financially and other disadvantaged groups. Recurrent subsidies are paid to approved nursing homes to assist them in meeting specific care outcome standards. The subsidies comprise components the costs of nursing and personal care, for infrastructure and for miscellaneous compulsory expenses as superannuation. E-esidents make a contribu' tion at a minimum of 87.5% of the standard age in the elecpension plus rent assistance. For approved hostels, the Commonwealth provides capital and recurrent funding to non-profit and charitable organisations and local govParkes ernment bodies. The level of Commonwealth capital funding varies depending on the proportion of financially disadvantaged people catered for in a hostel up to a maximum of $46,400 per place. Recurrent funding for hostels is provided through standard subsidies which are paid for eligible residents. Two subsidy levels, Hostel Care and Personal Care, are based on the level of services required and received by residents and there is a suppleJ:llentary subsidy payable for respite care services to enable hostels to provide short-term accommodation and care to those in need.

Antarctica: Ozone Depletion (Question No. 1610) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 2 March 1989: ' What measurements have been taken of ozone depletion in the Antarctic region for the spring and summer of 1988/89.",138
206,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Australia operates only one device for the direct measurement of ozone levels in the Antarctic region; a Dobson ozone spectrophotometer which is operated by the Bureau of Meteorology, in co-operation with the Antarctic' Division, at Macquarie Island. The data from that single instrument is insufficient to draw conclusions about trends in ozone concentrations over the Antarctica region, although it does provide a valuable contribution, along with other instruments located in Australia, to the global ozone monitoring network. The greatest fluctuations in the ozone levels over Antarctica have been observed by US and UK scientists to occur during the months August to October. Results of satellites monitoring by the United States in 1988 have been summarised in a paper in Nature. Vol. 336 I December 1988, a copy of which has been forwarded to Mr Baldwin. The paper notes that the decline in ozone in the spring of 1988 is considerably less than the extreme depletion of 1987. The paper indicates that the extent of ozone depletion seems to be influenced by meteorological conditions in any particular year. Tax Deductions for Tobacco Advertising' (Question No. 1622) Mr Scholes asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 6 March 1989: Is expenditure on 'advertising tobacco products subsidised through a tax rebate equal to the compariy tax rate; if so, does this amount to the Government subsidising the encouragement of young Australians to take up smoking.",139
207,Mr HAWKE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under section 51 of the Income tax Assessment Act, expenditure incurred in deriving assessable income, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a' business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, is an allowable deduction, provided it is not of a capital, private or domestic nature. Tobacco advertising receives the same income tax treatment as any other cost of deriving income and a deduction would normally be allowed. To disallow the deduction would cut across one of the basic principles of the income tax law. The deduction is necessary to determine the level of income subject to tax, and as such does not represent a subsidy for the, expenditure. The Commonwealth Government through the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), and in co-operation with the States and, Territories, is taking action to dissuade young Australians from the ,use of tobacco. Tobacco advertising has been banned from radio and television, smoking cessation and prevention campaigns are an annual event in all States and Territories and, as part of' NCADA, the Commonwealth is developing an anti-smoking media campaign aimed particularly at young women. ' Together with participating Sta-es and Territories, the Commonwealth is also addressing the issue through the $41 million National Better Health Program. Preventable cancers, of which lung cancers are a major component, are an area for priority action within the program. Mrs Winnie Mandela (Question No. 1628) Mr Cobb asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 6 March 1989: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the details surrounding Mrs Winnie M\lndela's alleged involvement in the murder of 14 year old black activist, S\ompi Mokhetsi. (2) Will the Government condemn the action of ' Mrs Mandela and her bodyguards in view of the murder charges laid against two of her bodyguards and her refusal to disband the so-called ""Mandela United Football Club"". (3) Does the Government recognise Mrs Mandela as still being representative of black opinion in South Africa following the actions of the United Democratic Front and the Congress of South African Trade Unions in dissociating themselves from her and isolating her from the community.",139
208,Mr HAWKE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) YeS. (2) I am aware that charges have been laid against members of the ""Mandela United Football Club"" for the alleged murder of a young black activist. The Government 'is not disposed to pre-judge the issue. The trial should provide answers to some of the outstanding questions. Mrs Mandela. has not been charged. (3) Mrs Mandela is only one of many black spokespersons whose views the Australian Government takes into account when considering events in South Africa. ' Road Accidents (Question No. 1639) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 7 March 1989: (I) Will he examine ABC news reports that, during the weekend of 4 and 5 March 1989, a driver was killed because his car strayed onto the wrong side of the road and another driver was killed when his car ran off the road and hit a tree. (2) If in fact the drivers were in control of the vehicles involved, will he ask the ABC not to minimise the driver responsibility which is the cause of most road accidents.",139
209,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The ABC 'is an independent body with complete responsibility for its own programming. However, an examination of ABC Radio News in Victoria on that weekend shows that the ABC did not say, .... . a driver was killed because his car strayed onto the wrong side of the road . . ."", nor did it say another drivel' was killed"". . . when his car .ran off the road and hit a tree . . ."". The only relevant items on record say that the driver died "". . . after he lost control of the car he was driving and hit a tree . . ."" and that another driver died "". . . after a similar accident . . ."". The ABC Was not in a position to say why the drivers lost control of their vehicles. Frequently there Products also legal reasons which restrict comment on where blame lies in a road accident. Jordan: Foreign Debt. (Question No. 1646) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 7 March 1989: (I) Has the Government noted reports that Jordan is considering rescheduling its foreign debt. (2) How much Jordanian debt is held by Australian commercial banks and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation ..",140
210,Mr KEATING,Unknown,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) It is estimated that as at 31 December 1988 Australian commercial banks and Austrade-EFIC had a total of around US$70 million in loans and commitments outstanding to Jordan. Whether any or all of these debts would be subject to rescheduling will depend on the terms and conditions of the relevant rescheduling arrangement(s).

(3)What improvements in (a) purchasing power and (b) quality of life have been introduced under the Hawke Government for the Australian family with two children and an annual income of $19600.",142
216,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (i) Rental Allowances (a) to (c) Maximum Rent Assistance has increased from $10 per week in 1983 to $15 per week for pensioners. In 1986 eligibility was extended to unemployment beneficiaries renting privately at the maximum rate of $10 a week. Until then this group had not received rent assistance. In 1987 as part of the Family Assistance Package the maximum rate for unemployment beneficiaries with children was increased from $10 to $15 a week and eligibility was extended at this rate to low income working families. In the 1988 Budget it was announced that progressive increases would be made to rent assistance that would particularly assist families with children. From June 1989 the maximum rate of rent assistance to families with one or more children will increase by $5 a week (33 per cent) from $15 to $20. From December 1989 the rate payable to beneficiaries without children will increase by $5. In June 1990 a further $5 a week increase will be available to all recipients with an addi-ional $5 for recipients with 3 or more children. (ii) Family Allowance (a) to (c) In 1987 an income test on family allowances was introduced. The income test applied at that time was on joint family incomes over $50,000 per year (plus $2,500 for each child after the first). The income and child disregard amounts are indexed and are currently $53,550 and $2,678 respectively. From I January 1990 they will be indexed annually in line with the CPI growth over the previous financial year. In the Economic Statement of 12 April 1989 it was announced that family allowance payments will be increased significantly. From July 1989 rates will be increased to $9 a week for each of the first three children and $12 a week for the fourth and each additional child. Commencing in January 1990 the payments will be indexed in line with the CPI to preserve their real value. (iii) Child Payments (a) to (c) Since it came to office the Government has made substantial real increases in child payments (Family Allowance Supplement (FAS) which replaces the previous Family Income Supplement (FlS) and additional pension/benefit). Between 1983 and 1987 the payments increased from $10 to $17 a week. In 1987 the Prime Minister made a commitment that by 1990 no child need live in poverty and that by that time total child payments would be IS per cent and 20 per cent of the combined married rate of pension for children up to 12 years and for those aged 13, 14 and IS years respectively and their real value maintained thereafter. FAS was introduced in December 1987 and child payments were increased to $22 a week for children under 13 and $28 a week for children aged 13, 14 or IS. The payments are now $24 a week for children aged under \3 and $31 a week for children aged 13, 14 or IS. They represent increases in the real value since 1983 of 61 per cent for young children and 108 per cent for children aged 13, 14 or IS. Combined with the first rate of Family Allowance these current rates represent 14.1 per cent for children under \3 and 17.5 per cent for older children compared to the married rate of pension. From I July 1989, the rate for \3-15 year olds will be increased by $3.10 a week to $34.10 ensuring that, together with the FA increases, the benchmarks of 15 and 20 per cent will be met by July 1989, ahead of the date promised. In January of each year the rates will be increased by the amounts necessary to maintain the benchmarks. (2) The Government has taken major steps to alleviate poverty since 1983. Some of the initiatives which have already been implemented include: increasing the rate of pension. Since 1983 the single rate of pension has increased from 22.7 per cent of AWE to 24.6 per cent restoration in May 1984 of full indexation of unemployment benefit for those aged 21 or more introduction of the family assistance package which .has benefited up to an estimated 600,000 families with more than a million children introduction in 1988 of the child support scheme introduction in 1987 of measures to reduce poverty traps by Iiberalisation of the income tests. These measures increased incentives for recipients to improve their financial situations linking of social security and labour market services by introducing programs such as JSA, JET and Newstart. The Economic Statement of 12 April 1989 contained further initiatives which will build on those mentioned: the significant increases in Family Allowance rates the increase in FAS and in additional pension/ benefit rates for older children the indexation, for the first time, of family ments including Family Allowance, Mothers/ Guardians Allowance, Child Disability Allowance and Double Orphans' Pension ongoing compliance with the benchmarks of adequacy for family payments bringing forward by twelve weeks the indexation dates of pension and benefit. (3) (a) and (b) An Australian family with two children and an annual income at $19,600 a year (approximately 75 per cent of A WE) will receive a significant improvement in purchasing power and quali'ty of life under the Hawke Government. Following the implementation of the Government's April Statement measures, between March 1983 and July 1989 this family will have an increase in real disposable income of 7.4 per cent arising mainly from the introduction of the Family Package in 1987, the recently announced tax cuts and proposed increases in Family Allowance and Family Allowance Supplement. Electoral Rolls (Question No. 1748) Mr Fife asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 10 April 1989: (I) As electoral rolls were not generally available in printed form for the last elections, when will the next rolls be available. (2) Will he guarantee that the rolls will be printed and available at least six months before the next election is called. Mr West-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Australian Electoral Commission has advised that every State, except Western Australia, is currently conducting an electoral roll review with a view to producing printed rolls in September. (2) No. Fringe Benefits Tax (Question No. 1290) Mr Downer asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 October 1988: Does he encourage the form of tax minimisation favouring fringe benefits over cash salary resUlting from the recent 10% corporate tax cllt giving an across-the-board tax advantage for the fringe benefits over cash salary, provided the employer is a company and the employee is on the top marginal rate of 50.25%.",143
217,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has actively discouraged tax minimisation through provision of fringe benefits-it introduced the fringe benefits tax in 1986 as a means payof broadening the taxation base to include non-cash benefits received in remuneration packages. Such benefits previously had been largely untaxed and had figured prominently in tax minimisation arrangements. The relative impact of taxation on cash and noncash benefits varies for different employees, depending on their marginal tax rates and the rates applying to their employers, whether companies or otherwise. Any tax advantage favouring fringe benefits for particular employees, arising from differences in these rates, is substantially smaller than that which applied prior to the introduction of the fringe benefits tax. Pharmaceutical Benefits (Question No. 1434)  ing and Aged Care, upon notice, on 1 December 1988: (1) Was an assurance given to pharmacy owners and operators whereby delays in the payment of pharmaceutical benefits would be reduced significantly as the result of pharmacies adopting computerisation. (2) Has his attention been drawn to the situation where many pharmacies, despite purchasing appropriate computer systems, are still waiting as much as 30 days for payment. (3) What is the reason for the delays and will he take action to ensure more prompt payments. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. When the Claims Transmission System (CTS) was introduced, pharmacies with computer systems were advised that their claims would be paid more quickly than if they continued to submit manual claims. This statement was reiterated .by the Treasurer in his May 1987 Economic Statement when he stated that, although the Commonwealth would pay· its accounts on a 30 day basis, it would pay pharmacy computer claims in 20 days. I am now able to advise that from I April 1989, CTS claims will be released for payment when they are processed. This will mean in most cases claims will be paid in approximately fifteen days. (2) Prior to I December 1988, no complaints had been received from pharmacists submitting claims by the Claims Transmission System that they were waiting as long as. 30 days for payment. Claims are processed and passed to the Department of Finance for payment within 15 days. After processing by the Department of Finance (which usually takes a day), they are released to the banking system which takes three to four days to place the funds in a pharmacist's bank account. However, during December 1988, lightning struck the Department of Community Services and Health buildings in Canberra causing disruptions to the Department's computer system which, coupled with the Christmas public holidays, meant that pharmacists' claims would have exceeded the 20 day payment time. The varying Australia Day public holidays in January 1989 have also affected payment times by one to two days. (3) The reasons for the recent delays are explained in (2) above. These delays are unusual in their nature as all CTS claims have, prior to this, been released in sufficient time for the banking system in order for funds to be credited to pharmacists' bank accounts within 20 days. (Question No. 1503) Dr Woods asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: Further to his answer to my question without notice (Hansard, 22 November 1988, page 2934) relating to the cost and choice of tenderer for 6 surveys to monitor public reaction to Medicare and in which he stated that he was prepared to seek from that authority an answer to the question, will he ask the authority to provide the answer to the question and when would he expect to receive an answer.",144
218,Dr BLEWETT,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The costs of the surveys wereI September 1983; 2 October 1984: 3 January 1986: 4 May 1987: 5 May 1988: The Health Insurance Commission retains professional managers with considerable commercial experience in this area of work. At the time of undertaking the fi,rst study in 1983, ANOP was assessed by them as superior in the conduct of large-scale quantitative research of this nature. For 'tracking' studies of this type to be useful, it is essential that the results be totally comparable from one study to the next. This is primarily a function of sampling methodology and questionnaire design and it is therefore prudent to use the initial consultant on subsequent studies. The Commission, which enjoys a reputation for sound financial management and cost efficiency, does not operate on trust with any supplier. Other major research organisations are asked to quote on an identical brief on a' regular basis so that the Commission can ensure that ANOP's prices remain competitive. The next check quotation will be made by the Commission in 1989. The check quotation in 1987 revealed a price of $77,616 which was substantially higher than ANOP's price of $61,000. Senior Executive Service (Question No. 1508) Mr Reith asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: (I) Will the Minister identify each Senior Executive Service or equivalent position within the Minister's department or authorities responsible to him which has been reclassified since 1 July 1988 and to which the occupant has been reappointed, indicating in each case (a) resultant increases in salary and Medicare other entitlements and (b) whether or not the reappointment followed normal selection procedures. (2) On what basis is it claimed that the reclassifications conform with the national wage fixing principles. (3) How many Senior Executive Service or equivalent positions are there within the Minister's portfolio.",145
219,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) One position has been reclassified since 1 July 1988. (Level 5 to Level 6). No permanent appointment has been made to the position. The salary diff-rence between a Level 5 and Level 6 is $5055, but the entitlements remain the same. (2) Following the Machinery of Government changes in July 1987, the Attorney-General's De$54,000 partment gained an Associate Secretary. This was in addition to three Deputy Secretary, Level 6 positions $49,500 and one Deputy Secretary, Level 5 position. However, since Mr Brazil's resignation, Mr Rose has been $55,000 appointed Secretary and his former position of As$61,000 sociate Secretary has been abolished. As a consequence, the responsibilities of the Associate Secretary $69,000 position have been re-assigned in an even distribution of responsibilities. It was therefore, anomalous that one Deputy Secretary position be classified at a lower level than the others. The reclassification conformed to all the national wage fixing principles, identifying an increase in work value as the justification for the reclassification. (3) There are 264 Senior Executive Service and equivalent positions within the Minister's portfolio. International Program for the Development of Communications (Question No. 1554) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: (I) Is the Minister able to say which States have made resourceS available to the International Progra- for the' Dev-lopment of Communication (IPDC). (2) Has the Government considered making resources available to IPDC since the former Minister for Foreign Affairs answered question No. 3786 (Hansard, 7 May 1986, page 3329). Mr DuffyThe Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) According to our most recent information, the following countries have pledged support to the International Program' for the Development' of Communications (lPDC). ,Algeria, Bangladesh, Benin, Cameroon, Canada, China, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, France, Gabon, Guyana, India, Indonesia,"" Iraq, Italy, Jamaica,Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Luxembourg; Mauritius, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, San Marino, Sweden, Tunisia', Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, USSR, Venezuela, Yugoslavia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. (2) In F-bruary 1989, the Australian Government, through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIOAB), approved'the commitment of $550,000 to IPOC through 'Fundsin-Trust' to enable IPOC to conduct a three year training program for the Pacific in video techniques to be held at the South Pacific Commission's Media Centre in Fiji. International Labour Conference (Question No. 1568) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: Will he bring up-to-date the information which the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations gave on the International Labour Conference: Sessions, Conventions and Recommendatioris in his answer to question No. 2140 (Hansard, II February 1986, page 44).  honourable member's question is as follows: International Labour Conference: Sessions; Conventions and Recommendations , (I) In the years since 1985, three annual Sessions of the International Labour Conference an- one Maritime Session of the Conference have been held iii Geneva. The annual Sessions were approximately three weeks' duration and took place in June of each y,ear. The Maritime Session was held from 24 S-p­ ' tember-9 October, 1987. (2) Since the answer to question No 2140 (Hansard, II February 1986, page 44) the following Conventions and Recommendations have been adopted by the International Labour Conference. Australian Government delegates voted as shown in the table below: International Australian Labour Government Conference Delegates Session Instrument Adopted Voted 72nd Session Asbestos Conven- For (June 1986) tion No 162 For Asbestos Recommendation No 172 73rd Session No instruments (June 1987) adopted 74th' (Mari- Seafarers' Welfare 'For time Session at Sea and in (Sept-Oct port Convention 1987) No 163 Seafarers' Welfare For at ,Sea and in Port Recommendation N'o 113 Health Protection For and Medical Care of Seafarers Convention No 164 Social Security For (Seafarers) (Revised) Convention No 165 Repatriation of For Seafarers (Revised) Conven, ,tion'No 166 'of Repatriation For Seafarers Recommendation 'No ' I 174 75th Session Safety and Health For (June 1988) in Construction Convention No 167 Safety and Health 'For in Construction Recom-endation No 175 Employment Pro- 'For motion and Protection Against , Unemployment Convention, , No 168' , International Labour Conference Session Instrument Adopted Employment ProTobacco Products (Question No. 1624) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 6 March 1989: Will he examine the imposition of a levy on tobacco products to assist in meeting the cost of providing the additional health and hospital services required to treat lung cancer and other smoking related illnesses.",145
220,Dr BLEWETT,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Matters relating to taxation are the responsibility of the Treasurer. My portfolio accepts responsibility for funding health and hospital services to treat lung cancer and other smoking related illnesses. This is provided through Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and through grants to the States for hospital care. Attorney-General's Department: Security Checks of Staff (Question No. 1681) Mr John Scott asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on4 April 1989: (I) Does the Minister's Department and any authority responsible to the Minister have any requirement to conduct security checks of its staff; if so, are security checks carried out by the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO). (2) If security checks are required and are not undertaken by ASIO, (a) by whom are they carried out and (b) does a review procedure equivalent to that contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act apply to such checks; if not, why not.",147
221,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. Agency Heads throughout the portfolio conduct security checks on people to assess their suitability to occupy: positions which would allow them access to national security information classified Confidential or above, or to secure areas-ie designated security assessment positions (DSAPs); Australian and Government positions which would allow them access to Delegates sensitive, non-national security information or Voted to valuable assets-ie positions of trust (PoTs). For A security assessment from ASIO forms part of motion and Pro- the security clearance process for DSAPs only. How. tection Against ever, in accordance with the requirements of the Unemployment Commonwealth's Protective Security Manual, SecurRecommendation ity Assessment M!lnual and Personnel Assessment No 176 Manual, Agency Heads do not request a security assessment from ASIO until they are satisfied that a person is suitable on general suitability grounds to occupy a DSAP. An assessment of general suitability requires the Agency Head to: check the person's identity; request a check of police records from the Australian Federal Police; and make an assessment of the person's loyalty, trustworthiness, reliability and character. The factors considered by the Agency Head in the assessment of general suitability are not normally taken into a.ccount by ASIO in the formulation of a security assessment unless directly relevant to security as defined in the ASIO Act 1979. (2) (a) For POTs, Agency Heads comply· with the requirements of the Commonwealth's Personnel Management Manu!ll and assess the general suitability of people selected to occupy such positions-ie the same checks as outlined above for DSAP's. A security assessment from ASIO is not required. for POTs as these positions do not allow the occupant access to national security classified information. (2) (b) Where it is determined that, on general suitability grounds, a person is unsuitable to occupy a DSAP or a POT, the Agency Head ceases further clearance action, and fOr DSAPs does not request a security assessment from ASIO. A security clearance is not issued. In such circumstances an aggrieved person may seek a review of the Agency Head's decision through the following avenues of appeal: Division 3, Part III of the Public Service Regulations; the Merit Protection Review Agency for Commonwealth employees; and the Commonwealth Ombudsman for non-Commonwealth employees. Department of Industrial Relations: Security Checks of Staff· (Question No. 1694) Mr John Scott aslced the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 3 April 1989: (I) Does the Minister's Department and any authority responsible to the Minister have any requirement to conduct security checks of its staff; if so, are security checks carried out by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). (2) If security checks are required and are not undertaken by ASIO, (a) by whom are they carried out and (b) does a review procedure equivalent to that contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act· apply to such checks; if not, why not. .  honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. Security assessments are carried out by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) for staff selected for designated security assessment, positions. (2) Security clearances are required for officers in positions of trust involving acc\lSS to certain nonnational secufity information or to valuable assets and public monies. (a) These clearances are undertaken by the Department and follow government security clearance guidelines. An ASIO assessment is not required for positions of trust. (b) Yes. There are avenues of appeal available under Public Service Regulations; the Merit Protection Review Agency for Commonwealth employees and the Commonwealth Ombudsman for non-Commonwealth employees. Public Service: Security Checks of Staff (Question No. 1696) Mr John Scott asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Did the 1986-87 annual report of the Security Appeals Tribunal express misgivings at a practice developing among some Government departments and authorities of bypassing the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) when conducting security check- of employees and potential employees. (2) Did the recently tabled 1987-88 annual report reiterate these misgivings. (3) Has .the effect of this practice been to enable departments and authorities to. evade t-e review provisions of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act, thus denying people receiving adverse assessments any right to review. (4) Will he consider amendments to the relevant legislation to ensure that persons receiving adverse assessments, whether from ASIO or elsewhere, have access to independent review through the Security Appeals Tribunal; if not, why not.",147
222,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's' questions is as follows: (I) and (2) The Tribunal expressed the view, in its 1986-87 and 1987-88 reports"" that such a practice, if it existed, would enable the 'security assessment review provisions of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act to be evaded. (3) The Tribunal appears not to understand the respective roles of ASIO and Agency Heads in the security clearance process: Agency Heads are responsible for the administration of the' security clearance process within their respective agencies. . Under the provisions of the Commonwealth's Protective Security Manual, the Personnel Assessment Manual and the Security Assessment Manual, Agency Heads are responsible for assessing the suitability of staff, employed or to be employed in their respect agencies, for security clearances. An ASIO security assessment may be a 'component of the security clearance process, but it is requested only if other aspects of the clearance process have been completed to the satisfaction of the employing agency. Agencies are required to make their own assessment of a person's general suitability for employment, including a check of identity and an assessment of loyalty, trustworthiness, reliability and character, and a check of police records. The Security Manuals provide that. where, on general suitability grounds, a person is assessed as unsuitable for a security clearance, the Agency Head should cease further clearance action. An ASIO security assessment is not required in such a case. In such circumstances the ASIO Act, and its review provisions, are not relevant. However, an aggrieved person may seek a review of the Agency Head's decision through the following avenues of appeal: Division 3, Part III of the Public Service Regulations; the Merit Protection Review Agency-for Commonwealth employees; and the Commonwealth Ombudsman-for nooCommonwealth employees. Only where an Agency Head is satisfied as to a person's identity and general suitability is: ASIO requested to provide a security assessment. (4) Persons who are the subject of adverse security assessments by ASIO already have review rights under the ASIO Act. I am not satisfied thllt persons who are refused a security clearance by a Agency Head on general suitability grounds need review rights in addition to those referred above. International Labour Organisation (Question No. 1563) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: (I) Which member states of the International Labour Organisation have been determined by its Governing Body to be of ""chief industrial importance"". (2) When was such ,a determination last made.  honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The members of the International l,abour Organisation designated t9 be of chief industrial importance are: Brazil, the People's Republic of China, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, India, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. ' (2) The determination was last made by the 222nd Session of the Governing Body in March 1983. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: , Staff Security Checks (Question No. 1683) Mr John Scott asked 'the Minister representing 'the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Does the Minister's Department ,and any authority responsible to the Minister have any requirement to conduct security checks of its staff; if so, are security checks carried out by the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO). (2) If security checks are required and are not undertaken by ASIO, (a) by whom are they carried out and (b) does a review procedure equivalent to that contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act apply to such checks; if not, why not.",148
223,Mr DUFFY,Unknown,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes. Security checks, for the purpose of assessing a person's suitability for a security are conducted on people ,selected to occupy designated security assessment positions (DSAPs) or positions of trust (POTs). Requ-ting ASIO to provide a security assessment forms part of the security clearance process for DSAPs-i.e; where access is required to national security information classified Confidential and above, or to secure areas. For positions of trust, the Commonwealth Personnel Management Manual requires the Department/ Agency to assess the general suitability of that occupant to occupy a position which may allow the occupant access to sensitive, non-national security information or to valuable assets. The process involves: - a check of the person's identity; - requesting a check of Police records; , - an assessment of the person's loyalty, trustworthiness, reliability and character. An ASIO security assessment is not required for POTs. For DSAPs, in addition to the above requirements for POTs, the Commonwealth's Protective Security Manual and Personnel Assessment Manual require that a security assessment be requested from ASIO, but only after the Departmental Secretary/Agency Head is satisfied as to a person's general suitability to occupy a DSAP.

(2) Has ther- been any reduction of staff at the Embassy in Pretoria as a result of the lesser workclearance, load; if so, what are the details.

(6) How many visa and immigration applications (a) have been processed annually at the High Commission in Harare, (b) are ,being processed annually at the High Commission in London and (c) were processed in the last full year of processing at the Embassy in Pretoria.",149
224,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Immigration visas for persons residing in South Africa are still processed by the Australian Embassy in Pretoria and have never been devolved elsewhere. All migrant applications lodged by South African citizens residing outside of South Africa may be processed in their country of residence. In November 1986 the Government announced that temporary entry visas for Australia, with rare exceptions, would no longer be issued in South Africa. The announcement followed agreement on a package of further measures against South Africa by the heads of six Commonwealth countries who were concerned at the failure of the South African Government to make progress towards dismantling apartheid. Consequently South African citizens applying for temporary entry visas were required to apply in countries outside South Africa such as Harare, Lusaka and London. As a flow on to this decision it was decided on I January 1989 to centralise processing of temporary entry visa applications at one post. Since the Australian High Commission London had already acquired a sizeable South African caseload it was decided that it would become the centralised post for this responsibility. The Australian High Commission Harare had never been nominated to undertake this centralised role. (2) No staff reductions were mllde in Pretoria. However, in line with Departmental rationalisation of resources the migration office in Capetown was subsequently closed, and the Migration Officer position was transferred to Pretoria together with the positions of two locally engaged staff members.

R. J. Kelly on 5 April 1989. Migrant Processing Coolangatta Airport Times Only- (Question No. 1538) South Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Te1ecom-. African Citizens munications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 28 February 1989: Not applicable (1) What proposals does the Civil Aviation AuAverage all thority (CAA) have to upgrade radar and other air categories safety facilities at Coolangatta Airport. 7 months (2) When was it decided to upgrade those facilities. (3) Was any incident responsible for this decision. (4) What is the timetable for the upgrading of those facilities. (5) Is the upgrading program on schedule; if not, why not. (6) What staff numbers and categories does the CAA have at Coolangatta Airport. (7) Is it planned to expand those numbers; if so, which staff categories will be expanded and when will this occur.",149
225,Mrs KELLY,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is currently establishing a radar service for Air Traffic Control (A TC) at Coolangatta Airport which includes the building of a new Control Tower and Approach Control Unit (ACU) at the airport as well as the provisioning of primary and mono-pUlse secondary radar sensors on a site adjacent to the airport. (2) In July 1988 the new Board of the CAA approved the fast tracking of the project in conjunction with arrangements to replace and extend radar sensor facilities throughout Australia. (3) No single incident was responsible for the decision. Over the past 5 years traffic at Coolangatta has risen dramatically. Traffic at Coolangatta is difficult to control due to the danger of unauthorised intrusion into the control zone, particularly by pilots who are unfamiliar with ATC procedures. (4) At this point in time, i.e. prior to the of the major contracts (e.g. Tower and Radar building contracts and provision/installation of radar sensors), the commissioning of the project is scheduled for mid-1990. This timetable requires the new Control Tower to be available for fit-out in December 1989 and the radar sensors to be available in Australia for installation commencing November 1989. (5) The project is proceeding according schedule. (6) CAA staff currently located at Coolangatta are: '10 Air Traffic Controllers I 'Electrical technical staff 3 Radio technical staff 3 Mechanical technical staff 26 Airport Fire staff (7) Some expansion is contemplated at this stage; it is proposed to increase the Air Traffic Controllers to 20 positions with the introduction of 3 Flight Data Officers. The additional staff will be employed progressively commencing approximately August 1989. The decision on the technical staffing numbers may be dependent upon the final selection of equipment. Grants to Local Government Bodies (Question No. 1603) Mr Scholes asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: (I) Has the Minister received representations from local government bodies throughout Australia objecting to offsetting cuts in Commonwealth grants' against revenue derived from Commonwealth business premises. (2) Why have these cuts in Commonwealth grants been made. (3) Will the State Local Government Grants Commission take account of this new revenue source for local government bodies when assessing allocations to individual local government bodies. '",151
226,Mr HOLDING,Unknown,"The Minister for Local Government has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes. (2) The cuts have not been made. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs announced on 10 April 1989 the Government's decision to allow local government to keep all moneys paid to them in rates and charges by Telecom and Australia Post. (3) Yes. letting Department of Defence: Security Checks of Staff (Question No. 1688) Mr John Scott asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 4 April 1989: (I) Does the Minister's Department and any authority responsible to the Minister have any requirement to conduct security checks of its staff; if so, are, security checks carried out by the Australian to Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). (2) If security checks are required and are not undertaken by ASIO, (a) by whom are they carried out and (b) does a review procedure equivalent to that contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act apply to such checks; if not, why not.",151
227,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. Security checks, for the purpose of assessing a person's suitability for a security clearance, are conducted on people selected to occupy Designated Security Assessment Positions (DSAPs) or Positions of Trust (POTs). Requesting ASIO to provide a security assessment forms part of the security clearance process where access is required to national security information classified Confidential and above, or to secure areas. (2) For POTs, the Commonwealth Personnel Management Manual requires the department/agency to assess the general suitability of people occupy positions which may allow them access to sensitive, non-national security information uable assets. The process involves: a check of the person's identity; requesting a check of police records; and an assessment of the person's loyalty, trustworthiness, reliability and character.

Defence Force: Membership of Political Parties (Question No. 1763) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 12 April 1989: Are there any restrictions of any kind, formal or informal, on membership of political parties by members of the Australian Defence Force; if so, (a) what are they and (b) how do they operate. Mr Simmons-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Members of the Australian Defence Force may join political parties, attend political meetings, write letters to newspapers and express personal political opinions, but not as members of the Defence Force. However, some restrictions are necessary to ensure that member's political activities remain compatible with their service position and thereby preserve the Defence Force's impartiality in political matters. These restrictions are as follows: (a) Activities to further the interest of a political party or candidature for election to political office are forbidden in Service establishments or HMA ships. This does not extend to an area specially set aside as a polling place. (b) Members of either the permanent or the reserve Defence Force, shall not, in any activity of a political nature, use their rank, wear uniform, use without authority information gained while in Defence employment, allow political activity to interfere with or prejudice their duties as members of the Defence Forces, speak in public in such a manner as to identify them as members of the Defence Forces, or use Defence property or facilities. Additionally, members are not allowed to take a leading part in the affairs of a political organization. This restriction is not intended to inhibit members' political aspirations nor deter them from taking part in the corporate affairs of their chosen party. The guiding criterion is that members should not find themselves in the position of being spokesperson for their party and possibly having to espouse and support policies which are at variance with those of the' Government of the day.",152
